AROUND TOWN
 DANCE PARADE Attention all hoofers, swingers, tappers, pop-and-lockers, tangoers, balletomanes, breakers and roller-discoers: the Dance Parade will shimmy through the streets of downtown Manhattan on Saturday. Created last year to promote and unify the dance styles of different cultures and focus attention on the city's cabaret laws, which require proper licensing for any kind of rhythmic movement, the parade is expected to draw thousands of spectators along the route down Broadway and through the East Village, said Mahayana Landowne, an organizer. 
 The celebration will culminate in a party in Tompkins Square Park, where many of the more than 100 dance groups from the Knicks City Dancers to an Albanian folkloric ensemble to the GrooveHoops, an artsy Hula-Hoop squad, will perform. There will also be free lessons and some site-specific choreography in and around the park, which should make for good brunch conversation in the neighborhood's cafes. At last year's event, above, part of the fun was watching disparate techniques merge, as spangled belly dancers gave lessons to zoot-suited Lindy hoppers, and vice versa. Experiencing it is even better. 
 Though the organizers hope that individual dancers will register in advance online -- already more than 3,500 have -- there are opportunities to just boogie on in. ''We're not going to turn anyone away,'' Ms. Landowne said. ''If they're ready to move, we're ready to move with them.'' (The parade begins at 1 p.m. -- arrive at noon to register -- at 28th Street and Broadway, Chelsea; 4 p.m., DanceFest in Tompkins Square Park, between Avenues A and B, from Seventh to 10th Streets, East Village; 212-501-4560, danceparade.org.)

HEADLINE: Profits Beat Expectations As Retailers Trim Costs

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
J. C. Penney, Kohl's and Nordstrom reported first-quarter profit on Thursday that fell less than analysts estimated by reducing costs as the economy teetered near a recession. 
 The better-than-expected performance helped bolster Wall Street, as did an announcement by Tiffany & Company, the luxury jewelry retailer, that it would increase its dividend 13 percent. Tiffany, which releases earnings May 30, said its first-quarter profit would exceed a previous forecast, and its shares rose the most since March.
 J. C. Penney forecast second-quarter earnings that matched analysts' estimates, sending the shares higher in regular New York trading. Kohl's fell in late New York trading after projecting quarterly and annual profit that may trail some analysts' estimates.
 J. C. Penney, Kohl's and other American retailers have weathered declining spending and store visits as consumers navigate record gasoline prices and falling home values.
 Tiffany, too, has been withstanding a slowdown in United States spending, partly through faster international sales.
 ''We've had a promising start to the year,'' the company's chief executive, Michael J. Kowalski, said. ''While we remain cautious about U.S. economic conditions, net earnings in the first quarter will surpass our previous expectation.''
 Tiffany rose $3.03, to $48.88, on the New York Stock Exchange composite trading for its biggest increase since March 24. The shares were little changed this year through Wednesday.
 The retailer will pay a 17 cent-a-share dividend on July 10 to investors who hold the stock on June 20.
 Net income at J. C. Penney declined by half, to $120 million, or 54 cents a share, from $238 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Seventeen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated profit of 50 cents on average. The company, based in Plano, Tex., forecast second-quarter earnings of 38 cents a share, matching analysts' projections. Sales in the three months ended May 3 fell 5.1 percent, to $4.13 billion. J. C. Penney shares rose $2.07, to $46.32, the biggest gain in six weeks.
 Kohl's said that first-quarter net income decreased 27 percent, to $153 million, or 49 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate of 44 cents. Sales climbed 1.5 percent, to $3.62 billion, the retailer, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., said.
 The company forecast second-quarter profit of 70 to 74 cents a share. Twenty-one analysts' average estimate was 73 cents. For the year, Kohl's said it expected to earn $2.95 to $3.15 a share, compared with a Bloomberg estimate of $3.11.
 Kohl's fell $1.14, to $49.35 in after-hours trading after closing up 90 cents, to $50.49.
 Nordstrom, the luxury department-store chain based in Seattle, said net income declined 24 percent, to $119 million, or 54 cents a share, exceeding the average projection in a Bloomberg survey by 5 cents. The company predicted full-year earnings would be lower than previously forecast.
 Nordstrom increased $1.11, to $38.40, after the results were released, after rising $1.15, to $37.29, in regular trading.

HEADLINE: A Values Debate (Not the Political Kind)

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
WALL STREET is struggling to answer what might seem like a simple question: How much are some investments really worth? 
 Ever since the credit crisis erupted last summer, banks and investment firms have struggled to pin down the value of certain investments, particularly those linked to troubled subprime mortgages. In all, financial companies have written down the value of various assets by roughly $300 billion, meaning the investments are worth far less than they used to be.
 But on Thursday, at conference hosted by Standard & Poor's in New York, several bankers complained that they have felt pressured by accountants and regulators to undervalue assets in recent months. 
 Accountants countered that the bankers, like any investor or homeowner, simply do not like seeing their investments drop.
 ''People were saying, 'We've got to face up to the fact that we are selling things we don't know how to value,' '' said Rebecca T. McEnally, senior analyst at the CFA Institute, a nonprofit organization for investors.
 The debate on how to value investments comes at a tense time. Lawyers for investors who lost money are focusing on how banks valued troublesome assets. Policy makers are considering new regulations. And shareholders are demanding cuts like layoffs to offset some of the write-downs. 
 ''The problem has been not so much dealing with the write-downs in value but figuring out what the values were,'' said Alexey Surkov, a partner at Deloitte & Touche. ''There are matters of fact and matters of faith in the valuation world right now.''
 In the industry, much of the debate is focusing on an accounting rule known as FAS 157. The rule requires companies to provide dollar values for the portion of their assets that are priced based on market prices versus those that are priced based on internal models. Hamilton E. James, the president of the Blackstone Group, called the rule ''dangerous'' in his company's earnings call on Thursday.
 A Merrill Lynch executive, Christopher Hayword, at the conference said banks had been forced to be overly conservative since last summer.
 ''There is a bit of this pressure, a bit of this atmosphere that says, 'Let's just mark it down, no one is going to question it if we mark it down,' '' said Mr. Hayword, finance director and head of holding company supervision initiatives at the firm.
 Banks are particularly concerned about having to mark down assets simply because the markets have frozen up. Bob Traficanti, head of accounting policy and deputy comptroller at Citigroup, suggested that some assets could be marked as if they would be held until they matured. 
 But the accountants in the room fired back. Mr. Traficanti's suggestion did not seem ''particularly economically grounded,'' said Robert H. Herz, the chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which oversees accounting rules. 
 Mr. Herz compared asset valuation at financial firms to what homeowners are busy discussing when they see a house down the block sell for a low price. They hope, he said, that their own house's value will go back up in a couple of years.
 Companies are allowed to mark assets based on the market prices of similar assets or based on in-house computer models. Many firms, though, did not have models in place to come up with prices during the credit crisis and had trouble getting quotes from third-party companies. 
 David M. Johnson, chief financial officer of the Hartford Financial Services Group, said his company was lucky to have a model to use for pricing when ''Mr. Market went on holiday.'' 
 Darryll Hendricks, global head of quantitative risk at UBS Investment Bank, said regulators should call a meeting of financial companies to let them compare the methods they use to value their assets' collateralized debt obligations so that there will be more consistency in the market.
 But no amount of consistency or changes in accounting rules will change economic realities like the souring mortgage market, said Raymond Beier, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 ''Management doesn't like it when they have to record big losses,'' Mr. Beier said.

HEADLINE: Obama Admires Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Hezbollah is one of the world's most radical terrorist organizations. Over the last week or so, it has staged an armed assault on the democratic government of Lebanon. 
 Barack Obama issued a statement in response. He called on ''all those who have influence with Hezbollah'' to ''press them to stand down.'' Then he declared, ''It's time to engage in diplomatic efforts to help build a new Lebanese consensus that focuses on electoral reform, an end to the current corrupt patronage system, and the development of the economy that provides for a fair distribution of services, opportunities and employment.'' 
 That sentence has the whiff of what President Bush described yesterday as appeasement. Is Obama naive enough to think that an extremist ideological organization like Hezbollah can be mollified with a less corrupt patronage system and some electoral reform? Does he really believe that Hezbollah is a normal social welfare agency seeking more government services for its followers? Does Obama believe that even the most intractable enemies can be pacified with diplomacy? What ''Lebanese consensus'' can Hezbollah possibly be a part of? 
 If Obama believes all this, he's not just a Jimmy Carter-style liberal. He's off in Noam Chomskyland.
 That didn't strike me as right, so I spoke with Obama Tuesday to ask him what he meant by all this. 
 Right off the bat he reaffirmed that Hezbollah is ''not a legitimate political party.'' Instead, ''It's a destabilizing organization by any common-sense standard. This wouldn't happen without the support of Iran and Syria.''
 I asked him what he meant with all this emphasis on electoral and patronage reform. He said the U.S. should help the Lebanese government deliver better services to the Shiites ''to peel support away from Hezbollah'' and encourage the local populace to ''view them as an oppressive force.'' The U.S. should ''find a mechanism whereby the disaffected have an effective outlet for their grievances, which assures them they are getting social services.''
 The U.S. needs a foreign policy that ''looks at the root causes of problems and dangers.'' Obama compared Hezbollah to Hamas. Both need to be compelled to understand that ''they're going down a blind alley with violence that weakens their legitimate claims.'' He knows these movements aren't going away anytime soon (''Those missiles aren't going to dissolve''), but ''if they decide to shift, we're going to recognize that. That's an evolution that should be recognized.''
 Obama being Obama, he understood the broader reason I was asking about Lebanon. Everybody knows that Obama is smart (and he was quite well informed about Lebanon). The question is whether he's seasoned and tough enough to deal with implacable enemies. 
 ''The debate we're going to be having with John McCain is how do we understand the blend of military action to diplomatic action that we are going to undertake,'' he said. ''I constantly reject this notion that any hint of strategies involving diplomacy are somehow soft or indicate surrender or means that you are not going to crack down on terrorism. Those are the terms of debate that have led to blunder after blunder.'' 
 Obama said he found that the military brass thinks the way he does: ''The generals are light-years ahead of the civilians. They are trying to get the job done rather than look tough.''
 I asked him if negotiating with a theocratic/ideological power like Iran is different from negotiating with a nation that's primarily pursuing material interests. He acknowledged that ''If your opponents are looking for your destruction it's hard to sit across the table from them,'' but, he continued: ''There are rarely purely ideological movements out there. We can encourage actors to think in practical and not ideological terms. We can strengthen those elements that are making practical calculations.''
 Obama doesn't broadcast moral disgust when talking about terror groups, but he said that in some ways he'd be tougher than the Bush administration. He said he would do more to arm the Lebanese military and would be tougher on North Korea. ''This is not an argument between Democrats and Republicans,'' he concluded. ''It's an argument between ideology and foreign policy realism. I have enormous sympathy for the foreign policy of George H. W. Bush. I don't have a lot of complaints about their handling of Desert Storm. I don't have a lot of complaints with their handling of the fall of the Berlin Wall.''
 In the early 1990s, the Democrats and the first Bush administration had a series of arguments -- about humanitarian interventions, whether to get involved in the former Yugoslavia, and so on. In his heart, Obama talks like the Democrats of that era, viewing foreign policy from the ground up. But in his head, he aligns himself with the realist dealmaking of the first Bush. Apparently, he's part Harry Hopkins and part James Baker.

HEADLINE: Analyst Vetting Pension Bill Was Paid by Unions Pushing It

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
A bill offering thousands of additional city workers early retirement has been gaining support in the Legislature in recent weeks. New York City officials have protested, saying it would cost the city $200 million annually.
 Not so, lawmakers countered. It won't cost a cent, they said, pointing to the review of a highly credentialed actuary to prove it. 
 But what the legislators did not disclose, as they cited the expert analysis of the actuary, Jonathan Schwartz, was that Mr. Schwartz had not been paid by the state to conduct his analysis. His work was bankrolled by unions, including District Council 37, the umbrella group of municipal unions that drafted the early retirement bill, which is now moving through the Legislature. 
 Lawmakers have cited Mr. Schwartz's analysis on hundreds of bills in recent years, with billions of dollars worth of potential costs. His projections were used to fulfill a legal requirement that every piece of legislation be accompanied by a ''fiscal note'' that examines its impact on spending. Mr. Schwartz's consultant work for the unions was discovered during a review of Department of Labor documents by The New York Times this week.
 Mr. Schwartz, a former city actuary, said that he routinely skewed his projections to favor the unions -- he called his job ''a step above voodoo'' -- and admitted that he had knowingly overreached on the pension bill by claiming that it cost nothing, either now or in future years. ''I got a little bit carried away in my formulation,'' he explained.
 The Senate sponsor of the bill, Martin Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said on Thursday that he had no idea Mr. Schwartz was a consultant for the unions. Assemblyman Peter J. Abbate Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat and the Assembly sponsor, said the bill was drafted by the union pushing the measure, and that it provided Mr. Schwartz's analysis.
 ''It's their bill,'' Mr. Abbate said. ''They drew up the bill; they went to Jonathan Schwartz,'' he said, adding: ''We assume he comes up with the real number. He was hired by them.''
 Mr. Schwartz's review, though, is presented in the legislation after an explanation of language changes, and appears as if it were a governmental analysis, rather than one financed by an interest group. It is the only analysis provided.
 To critics of the Legislature, the reliance on Mr. Schwartz's analyses is a startling example of unchecked coziness between lawmakers and labor and the willingness of many legislators to blindly carry bills handed to them by special interest groups. 
 On almost every bill involving New York City pension benefits in recent years, Mr. Schwartz has provided the analysis.
 ''I'm shocked the Legislature would use someone who works for the union,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''This guy might be the best in the world at what he does, but at best there is a clear appearance of a conflict of interest.''
 Actuaries are experts in the field of forecasting risk, life expectancies and the future pension liabilities of municipalities and other pension funds. 
 Mr. Schwartz, 70, who was an actuary for New York City until 1986, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that his connection to labor groups was well known. Asked which unions he serves as a consultant, he responded, ''How many unions are there?'' He then ticked off a list of his clients, including the United Federation of Teachers and unions representing firefighters, detectives, correction officers and bridge and tunnel officers.
 He said: ''The Legislature knows full well I'm being paid by the unions. If they choose not to disclose that, that's on them, not me.''
 He still called the city's estimates that the early retirement bill would cost $200 million annually ''off the wall,'' saying that ''at the very least, that's high by a factor of four.'' But even that would leave the city with tens of millions of dollars of additional annual expenses at a time of growing economic uncertainty. 
 The bill would offer workers a second chance to buy into an early retirement plan that had been offered in the mid-1990's.
 ''What people call actuarial science is at least as much as an art as a science,'' Mr. Schwartz said. 
 ''Back in my days as city actuary, I would go to that part of the range that would make things look as expensive as possible,'' he added. ''As consultant for the unions, I go to the part of the range that makes things as cheap as possible, but I never knowingly go out of the range.''
 Mr. Schwartz resigned from his city job in 1986 after admitting he had given false testimony in a deposition in a lawsuit brought by female employees who claimed that their pension payments were lower than those made to their male counterparts. 
 Farrell Sklerov, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said, ''It is an outrage that union-paid actuaries freely admit that they create artificially low fiscal impact statements in order to help push pension sweeteners through Albany, costing taxpayers millions upon millions of dollars.''
 The executive director of District Council 37, Lillian Roberts, declined to be interviewed. 
 In a statement, she said, ''As far as the cost is concerned, actuaries disagree.''
 Last year, District Council 37 paid Mr. Schwartz more than $10,000, according to records from the Department of Labor reviewed by The New York Times. 
 John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, said, ''We use the city's estimates before we make any decision.''
 Dan Weiller, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said, ''The fiscal notes don't determine whether the bill gets done.''
 Both men said that bills received further financial review before approval and that in this particular case they would seek a so-called home rule message, which would require the City Council to approve the measure.

HEADLINE: In the South, a Force To Challenge the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER and JANNY SCOTT. 
Adam Nossiter reported from New Orleans, and Janny Scott from New York.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
The sharp surge in black turnout that Senator Barack Obama has helped to generate in recent primaries and Congressional races could signal a threat this fall to the longtime Republican dominance of the South, according to politicians and voting experts.
 Should Mr. Obama become the Democratic nominee, he would still have to struggle for white swing voters in the South and in border states like West Virginia, where he lost decisively to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Tuesday's presidential primary. In West Virginia, where more than three-fourths of white voters chose Mrs. Clinton, 20 percent of the white voters said the race of the candidate mattered in their choice.
 But in Southern states with large black populations, like Alabama, Mississippi and Virginia, an energized black electorate could create a countervailing force, particularly if conservative white voters choose not to flock to Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, predicts ''the largest black turnout in the history of the United States'' this fall if Mr. Obama is the nominee. 
 To hold these states, Republicans may have to work harder than ever. Already, turnout in Democratic primaries this year has substantially exceeded Republican turnout in states like Arkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. 
 Some analysts suggest that North Carolina and Virginia may even be within reach for the Democratic nominee, and they point to the surprising result in a Congressional special election in Mississippi this week as an indicator of things to come. 
 With the strong support of black voters, a conservative white Democrat, Travis W. Childers, scored an upset victory in that race, in a district held by Republicans since 1995. Kelvin Buck, a black state representative who helped the Childers campaign, said he saw a ''level of enthusiasm and energy'' that he had not seen before from black voters -- significantly motivated, he said, by a recent Republican anti-Obama campaign. 
 The numbers appear to bear that out. In one black precinct in the town of Amory, Miss., the number of voters nearly doubled, to 413, from the Congressional election in 2006, and this for a special election with nothing else on the ballot. Meanwhile, in a nearby white precinct, the number of voters dropped by nearly half.
 A similar increase has been evident in Southern states with presidential primaries this year. In South Carolina, the black vote in the primary more than doubled from 2004, to 295,000, according to exit poll estimates. In Georgia, it rose to 536,000 from 289,000.
 One expert on African-American politics, David A. Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, called those numbers ''almost astounding.'' Black turnout also shot up in states like Maryland, Virginia and Louisiana, even after Hurricane Katrina had driven many Louisianians out of state.
 Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: ''This is going to encourage the purplization of red states. It's going to make red states purplish over time.''
 Black voters made up a larger percentage of Democratic primary voters this year in several states than in the last two presidential election years, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press this year and in 2004, and by the Voter News Service in 2000. In Maryland, for example, black voters rose to 47 percent of the total, up from 35 percent in 2004 and 28 percent in 2000. 
 Ronald W. Walters, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, who worked for the 1984 presidential campaign of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said of Mr. Obama, ''He's generated a tremendous force in American political culture outside the electoral system.''
 Still, it would take a shift in the electoral dynamic -- a substantial stumble by John McCain, for instance -- for Mr. Obama to put in play a state like Mississippi, where whites gave John Kerry only about 15 percent of their vote in 2004 and where voting in presidential elections is perhaps more racially polarized than anywhere else in the nation. Even with a heavy black turnout, Mr. Bositis estimated, Mr. Obama would have to increase his white percentage by at least a third, to about 20 percent, to win the state.
 ''I don't anticipate him winning Mississippi,'' Mr. Bositis said, even though it has a higher percentage of blacks than any other state, 36 percent. 
 Many of the votes on Tuesday for Mr. Childers -- an anti-abortion, pro-gun-rights Democrat -- were from whites who will in all likelihood pull the lever for Mr. McCain in November, analysts and voters themselves say. 
 ''Obama, he's too off-the-wall,'' said Chappell Sides, a white Republican-leaning voter in Yalobusha County who said he was preparing to punch the button for Mr. Childers on Tuesday. ''Hillary -- I thought I hated her, till Obama came along.'' 
 Bruce Oppenheimer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, said the question was not so much whether Mr. Obama would carry Mississippi as whether he would force Republicans to spend time and money in the state. 
 Yet one sure lesson of the surprising Congressional result from northern Mississippi is that the use of Mr. Obama as an electoral tactic -- Republicans resorted to it heavily in the contest -- is at best a double-edged sword. At worst it is a guillotine for Republican candidates in areas with substantial black populations, like the Mississippi district won by Mr. Childers, where 26 percent are African-American. Indeed, Tuesday's Mississippi vote emerged as a case study in the effects and consequences of focusing on Mr. Obama. 
 ''We realized the Republican machine was on the attack,'' said Mr. Buck, the state representative who helped Mr. Childers. ''They wanted to say he was tied to Barack Obama. The question we asked was, What's wrong with that? We wanted to prove to them that there's nothing wrong in Mississippi with a person being tied to Barack Obama.''
 Between an initial vote on April 22, when Mr. Childers fell just shy of getting the 50 percent he needed to win, and Tuesday's runoff election, when he won with a decisive 54 percent, the Republican campaign to link Mr. Childers with Mr. Obama intensified, with a barrage of advertisements specifically on that theme. Perhaps not coincidentally, vote totals in counties with large black populations went up sharply between those two dates. In Marshall County, which is 48.8 percent black, the votes nearly doubled, to 5,083. In Clay County, 56.8 black, nearly 1,500 more people voted, pushing the total to 3,898. 
 The attacks on Mr. Obama clearly had a galvanizing effect, local officials said. ''The people I talked to said, 'Man, I don't like that they're trying to use Obama against him,' '' said Eric Powell, a black state senator who helped in voter turnout efforts. ''It actually helped Travis.''

HEADLINE: House Approves Tax on Rich to Aid G.I.'s

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats began to put into practice their philosophy of asking the wealthy to shoulder more of the cost of government programs on Thursday as the House approved an expansive new veterans education benefit that would be paid for by a tax on affluent Americans.
 Some Republicans joined Democrats in approving the aid, for veterans who enlisted after the Sept. 11 attacks, with a cost estimated at $52 billion over 10 years. 
 A vote to provide an additional $163 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan went down in a surprise defeat, at least temporarily, because of objections from members of both parties. 
 In pushing the tax plan, Democrats are banking on the idea that most Americans will have no quarrel with requiring those on the highest economic rung to pay for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan to receive the equivalent of a free four-year college education at a public university. 
 The proposal is the most striking example so far of a Democratic refrain being heard increasingly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail: Americans with significant financial resources need to contribute more to efforts to help those less prosperous.
 Individuals earning $500,000 or more would pay a surtax of 0.47 percent on income above $500,000 and the tax would apply to couples on incomes above $1 million.
 Democratic officials said one analysis estimated that about 440,000 people would fall under the new tax and would pay an average of nearly $9,000 a year. 
 ''We are talking about people who are making over $1 million to make a small sacrifice to pay for this war when our military families are making a huge sacrifice,'' said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois.
 Leading Republicans said a tax was a tax, accusing Democrats of pushing policy that could harm the economy in a downturn, particularly those small-business operators whose earnings are taxed as regular income. ''I can't think of a worse time to raise taxes,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, senior Republican on the Budget Committee.
 Yet with their party's political prospects looking bleak, 32 Republicans joined 224 Democrats in the vote, which was 256 to 166, to approve the veterans benefits and the accompanying tax as well as extra unemployment benefits for idle workers, up to 26 weeks in especially hard-hit areas. The package also included nearly $6 billion for Louisiana levees and $1.8 billion for international food and disaster aid.
 Democrats have been reluctant to pursue income tax increases in recent years, but this year House leaders did push a tax increase on hedge fund managers earning huge paychecks, though it failed to survive the Senate. 
 The fate of the tax to pay for the veterans benefits was also uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans were opposed to it and some Democrats were registering initial reservations. Senators have been more willing to add spending to legislation without finding ways to pay for it, while the House tax plan was developed to soothe conservative Democrats worried about the impact of the new G.I. benefit on the deficit. 
 The White House this week issued a veto threat against the overall measure, singling out the tax increase to pay for veterans benefits as a top reason. ''The president has been clear that tax increases are unacceptable,'' the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.
 In the roll call on the $163 billion for the war operations, 132 Republicans withheld their votes in protest of Democratic handling of the measure. At the same time, a large bloc of antiwar Democrats unwilling to provide new money for the conflict voted against the financing, causing it to fail on a 149-to-141 vote. 
 Leaders of both parties said the result had not put the war spending in real jeopardy, since it was expected to be restored in the Senate, where a December 2009 deadline to withdraw combat troops from Iraq and other war restrictions passed by the House were expected to be killed. House members would then get another chance at the financing, and it was unlikely that Republicans would stand in the way a second time.
 The defeat of the war money took House Democrats by surprise since Republicans in the past had been willing to provide the necessary votes to push through the financing despite the objections of most Democrats. But Republicans have been complaining for weeks that the war spending measure was being assembled by Democrats with no Republican involvement or even the opportunity to offer amendments.
 Democrats said the decision by so many Republicans to abstain was irresponsible since it was those lawmakers who have been so supportive of the war. They said the action by Republicans appeared to be an effort to find some new approach in the wake of a series of election defeats capped this week by the loss of a highly conservative Republican district in Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Marriage Ruling Vaults Issue Back to Stage In Presidential Bids

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Gay marriage is an issue on which the three major presidential candidates -- John McCain, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- are pretty much in agreement. All oppose it, while saying at the same time that same-sex couples should generally be entitled to the legal protections afforded married couples. All think the decision should be left to the states. 
 And not one has shown any eagerness to make the issue a priority. Senator McCain, for example, did not mention it in a speech he gave Thursday outlining what he wanted to do as president. 
 But the decision by the California Supreme Court on Thursday overturning the state's ban on same-sex marriage seems likely to put the issue back onto the national political stage for the time being. In the process, it should offer a test of whether the issue is resonant in American politics or whether it has fallen to the side of the road, as many Democrats and some Republicans say.
 ''The court has interjected itself into national politics and made same-sex marriage a major issue in the upcoming national election,'' said Brian S. Brown, the executive director of the National Organization for Marriage in California, which opposes same-sex marriage. 
 Mr. Brown predicted that Senator Obama, who is leading in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Mr. McCain, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, would be forced to deal with this issue repeatedly between now and November. Republicans did use the issue in 2004 in an effort to get conservative voters to help President Bush win Ohio.
 This year, the decision in California could at the very least have resonance with socially conservative voters in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Even if Mr. McCain does not wield it as part of his fall campaign -- and his political associates said he almost certainly would not -- history suggests that independent conservative advocacy groups would seize on the ruling to try to define Mr. Obama and his party as culturally out-of-step. Presumably, it is just a matter of time until voters across the country see advertisements including same-sex couples taking their vows on the steps of San Francisco City Hall.
 There is considerable debate whether the marriage issue helped Republican candidates in 2004. And it seems questionable if voters are going to find it compelling this year, at a time when the country is facing a prolonged war, an ailing economy and skyrocketing gasoline prices, the issues that Mr. McCain and the two Democratic candidates are confronting on the campaign trail every day.
 ''At best, it doesn't move voters, and at worst for Republicans, it moves them against them,'' said Matthew Dowd, who was chief strategist for Mr. Bush's campaign in 2004. ''Not so much on the issue, but it becomes, 'Why are we having a discussion on this issue when we should talking about things that matter, like the economy, or health care, or the war?' '' 
 Joe Solmonese, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, said: ''Regardless of where the American people have moved on marriage, what you have to look at is where it places in their priorities. I don't see it being the same kind of issue that it was in 2004.''
 If there is to be a national debate over the merits of same-sex marriage, the presidential candidates may not be the best proxies to carry out these arguments. 
 Mr. McCain supports marriage ''between a man and a woman'' and opposes any legal recognition of a same-sex relationship. But he is against an amendment to the Constitution, backed by many conservatives, that would ban same-sex marriage. More pressingly, he is at a point in his campaign now where he is seeking to appeal to moderates and Democrats uncomfortable with Mr. Obama; Mr. Dowd argued that emphasizing social issues would repel those groups.
 Mr. Obama and Senator Clinton are more explicit in their support of civil unions, but both campaigns were quick to restate their views that the candidates believe the act of marriage should be between a man and a woman, a formulation that seems to have succeeded in taking the sting out of the issue.
 Yet there are differences of nuance in how the Democratic and Republican candidates talk about the issue that could have resonance with socially conservative voters. For example, Mr. Obama's campaign explicitly said that he ''has always believed that same-sex couples should enjoy equal rights under the law, and he will continue to fight for civil unions.''
 In California, Mr. Brown is leading an effort to force a voter initiative that would overturn the court decision. If Mr. McCain decides to back such an initiative, it could provide a point of contrast that conservatives could use to hurt Mr. Obama. And an initiative could bring out more conservative voters at a time when Mr. McCain's advisers see a small hope of putting California in play.
 But if Mr. McCain were to actively support such an initiative, it would put him in the uncomfortable position of working against Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican whose success at appealing to moderates is part of the model of Mr. McCain's national campaign. Mr. Schwarzenegger said he would uphold the court ruling and oppose any such initiative.
 A survey taken by the Pew Research Center last October found that 55 percent of respondents said same-sex marriage would be not at all important or not too important to their decision of whom to support for president; 43 percent said it would be somewhat important or very important. 
 And that was at a time when gasoline prices seemed low and the economy seemed stable. So the California Supreme Court may have created a laboratory to test once and for all just how powerful this issue really is.

HEADLINE: McCain Vision Has Most G.I.'s Home by 2013

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain declared on Thursday that most American troops would be home from Iraq by 2013 and that the nation would be a functioning democracy with only ''spasmodic'' episodes of violence. The comments were a striking departure from his usual refusal to set a date for American withdrawal.
 In a speech in the heart of Ohio, a major general election battleground, Mr. McCain set forth a sweeping, extraordinarily positive vision of what the world would look like in 2013, when, he said, he would have been in the White House for four years. 
 The remarks, which offered no proposals for how he would achieve that vision, were an effort by Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, to define himself and the rationale of his candidacy to voters before he has a single Democratic rival who will try to do it for him. 
 ''By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom,'' Mr. McCain said at the Greater Columbus Convention Center. ''The Iraq war has been won. Iraq is a functioning democracy, although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension. Violence still occurs, but it is spasmodic and much reduced.''
 The United States, Mr. McCain added, ''maintains a military presence there, but a much smaller one, and it does not play a direct combat role.''
 During his primary battle, Mr. McCain accused his rival Mitt Romney of setting a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq, even though Mr. Romney was merely speaking generally about timetables that might be set in private discussions among Iraqi and American leaders. Since then, Mr. McCain himself has come under repeated fire from the Democrats for his support of the war and for offhand comments that he could envision a United States peacekeeping presence in Iraq for 100 years.
 Despite his mention of a specific year for the end of American combat operations, Mr. McCain and his aides strenuously argued afterward that his remarks should not be interpreted as promoting a timetable for withdrawal, even implicitly, and that he was simply projecting victory. ''I am certainly not putting a date on it,'' Mr. McCain said with exasperation during a circular, semantic debate in the back of his campaign bus. 
 Mr. McCain took issue when a reporter said the candidate had asked everyone to go along on a ''magic carpet ride'' to 2013. ''I don't think it has anything to do with fantasy,'' Mr. McCain said pointedly. ''I think it has everything to do with setting goals and achieving.''
 In Afghanistan by 2013, Mr. McCain predicted in his speech, intelligence will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden. In addition, Mr. McCain forecast, the threat from the Taliban will have been ''greatly reduced''; there will be no place in the world that Al Qaeda can consider a safe haven; and ''there still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001.''
 Mr. McCain also projected that ''concerted action'' by the world's democracies would have persuaded Russia and China to cooperate in persuading Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions and North Korea to discontinue its own. 
 The speech was written over the last several weeks by Mark Salter, Mr. McCain's closest adviser. If Mr. Salter employed the futuristic device as a way to avoid ''Fact Check'' rapid response e-mail from the Democrats -- there were no real checkable facts in Mr. McCain's divination -- it did not stop opponents from issuing swift dismissals of his remarks. 
 ''While Senator Obama agrees with many of the sentiments Senator McCain expressed today, he believes you cannot embrace the destructive policies and divisive political tactics of George Bush and still offer yourself as a candidate of healing and change,'' said a statement from Senator Barack Obama's campaign.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement that ''this is not the first time Senator McCain has predicted victory in Iraq'' and that he had ''promised more of the same Bush policies that have weakened our military, our national security and our standing in the world.''
 Mr. Obama has called for a monthly withdrawal of one or two American brigades from Iraq to finish within 16 months, while Mrs. Clinton has called for troop removals beginning within 60 days of her taking office, with most troops out by the end of 2013.
 In his speech on Thursday, Mr. McCain, who has been critical of President Bush's environmental policies this week, implicitly criticized him on three other issues: Refusing to admit mistakes, running a permanent political campaign from the White House and attaching comments to legislation called signing statements that claim the president's constitutional right to ignore or bypass parts of bills passed by Congress.
 ''When we make errors, I will confess them readily, and explain what we intend to do to correct them,'' Mr. McCain said. 
 He also said: ''I won't spend one hour of my presidency worrying more about my re-election than keeping my promises to the American people. There is a time to campaign, and a time to govern. If I'm elected president, the era of the permanent campaign will end.''
 Discussing the signing statements, Mr. McCain said, ''I will not subvert the purpose of legislation I have signed by making statements that indicate I will enforce only the parts of it I like.''
 Mr. Bush has asserted his right to bypass more than 1,000 sections of bills he has signed into law, including an amendment sponsored in 2005 by Mr. McCain to ban cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of American prisoners in custody.
 On domestic policy, Mr. McCain projected that in the fifth year of a McCain presidency the United States would have experienced several years of ''robust economic growth,'' a reduction in the corporate tax rate, the beginning of a phase-out of the alternative minimum tax, and ''much improved'' public education.
 In addition, Mr. McCain said, health care will have become ''more accessible to more Americans than at any other time in history'' because the federal government and states will have cooperated in establishing insurance pools to provide coverage for the sickest who cannot get insurance elsewhere. Meanwhile, he said, a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders will have worked with his administration to ''fix Social Security.''
 There will be mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, Mr. McCain added, and construction will have begun on 20 new nuclear reactors. There will also have been ''scores'' of new judges appointed to the federal courts who understand, Mr. McCain said, ''that they were not sent there to write our laws but to enforce them.''
 In addition, he said, ''our southern border is now secure, illegal immigrants who broke our laws after they came here have been arrested and deported,'' but there is a program for temporary foreign workers in place.
 Mr. McCain pledged to appoint Democrats to his administration, hold weekly news conferences and take questions in Congress, much as the Britain's prime minister does in Parliament.

HEADLINE: Buffett Increases Stakes in Kraft Foods and Wells Fargo

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company controlled by Warren E. Buffett, added to stakes in Kraft Foods and Wells Fargo in the first quarter, taking advantage of prices driven down by the credit crisis and the slowing American economy.
 Mr. Buffett also increased holdings in the health insurers UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint, according to a regulatory filing Thursday by Berkshire, based in Omaha. 
 ''If a stock goes down 50 percent, it doesn't bother me in the least,'' Mr. Buffett told reporters this month after Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. ''If we're going to be buying things, we want to buy them on sale.'' 
 Mr. Buffett, 77, built Berkshire from a failing maker of men's suit linings into a $200 billion holding company with a $72.6 billion stock portfolio by investing premiums from insurance subsidiaries like Geico and National Indemnity. Berkshire is the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft and American Express as of March 31, according to Bloomberg data.
 Berkshire's holdings of Kraft have risen 4.4 percent since Dec. 31, to 138.3 million shares. Mr. Buffett first disclosed a stake in the company at the end of 2007. The shares fell 5 percent in the first quarter. Berkshire's filing discloses equity investments in the United States as of March 31.
 Berkshire's stake in Wells Fargo increased by 1.4 million shares, to about 290.7 million. The bank's share price averaged $29.74 on the New York Stock Exchange during the first quarter, about 9 percent lower than in the fourth, when Mr. Buffett increased Berkshire's holdings by 3.4 percent.
 ''He's putting more in the things he's invested in all along,'' said Frank Betz, a partner at Carret Zane Capital Management, which oversees $800 million, including Berkshire shares, in Warren, N.J. ''We'll see more of that; why reinvent the wheel?''
 Berkshire added to its stakes in the two largest American health insurers as the shares fell. Holdings in UnitedHealth and in WellPoint increased by 6.7 percent each. WellPoint lost half its value in the quarter while UnitedHealth tumbled 41 percent.
 Mr. Buffett, the world's richest man according to Forbes magazine, is often mimicked by investors who follow his stock picks. Using that strategy for 31 years could have delivered annual returns of about 25 percent, double the return of the S.& P. 500, according to a study in 2007.
 Berkshire disclosed a 47 percent increase in shares in Ingersoll-Rand, the refrigeration equipment maker based in Hamilton, Bermuda. The company now holds 936,600 shares.
 Mr. Buffett reported no holdings in Ameriprise Financial, compared with more than 600,000 shares on Dec. 31. Berkshire got the shares when the company, an investment adviser, was spun off from American Express in 2005.
 Berkshire also cut its holdings of Iron Mountain, the records storage company, by 28 percent, to 3.37 million shares.
 Investors will not be certain they have a complete picture of Berkshire's holdings because Mr. Buffett regularly asks the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to delay disclosure of holdings to avoid copycat investing. Thursday's filing lists only equities traded on American exchanges. Mr. Buffett discloses other holdings in filings with non-American regulators.
 In Berkshire's prior quarterly filing of holdings, Mr. Buffett revealed a previously undisclosed stake in Kraft.
 Berkshire has declined 14 percent this year in New York trading after posting two consecutive declines in quarterly profit on lower returns from insurance businesses.
 Berkshire subsidiaries include See's Candies, Helzberg Diamonds, the business jet fleet operator NetJets and the carpet maker Shaw Industries. Berkshire earned $13.2 billion in 2007.
 ''Nine times out of 10, where he's going is where you want to be,'' Mr. Betz said. ''He's demonstrated for 50 years that he's right a whole lot more than he's wrong.''

HEADLINE: French Bank to Sell Assets To Offset Subprime Losses

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Just days after announcing plans to raise capital, the French bank Credit Agricole named a new head for its investment banking unit on Thursday and said it planned to sell 5 billion euros ($7.75 billion) of assets to help pare losses linked to the subprime market downturn. 
 At a rival bank, Barclays in Britain, pressure to raise capital increased Thursday when the bank said first-quarter earnings declined. The chief financial officer, Chris Lucas, did not rule out a rights issue, saying that he wanted to ''keep all options open.'' 
 Credit Agricole plans to go ahead with the equity offering later this year. 
 The bank named Patrick Valroff as head of its investment bank, succeeding Marc Litzler, who had been in the job less than a year. The bank said it planned to reduce fixed costs at the unit by at least 150 million euros, or 10 percent, this year. 
 The investment bank division, which had a loss of 795 million euros in the first quarter after a profit of 539 million euros in the period a year ago, will also refocus on its core expertise and clients as part of an ''action plan'' that will be presented in September. Credit Agricole's overall profit was 892 million euros in the first quarter, a third of the 2.7 billion euros that it reported in the period a year ago.
 The bank, based in Paris, did not say which assets it planned to sell over the next 18 months but some analysts said it could sell, among other things, its stake in an Italian rival, Intesa Sanpaolo. Credit Agricole's 5.6 percent Intesa stake is worth about 2.9 billion euros based on the closing price Thursday.
 Credit Agricole shares fell 1.3 percent.
 Barclays shares also dropped, falling 2 percent after the bank, based in London, said it had write-downs of $:1.7 billion ($3.3 billion) at its investment banking unit. The write-downs compare with about $:2.8 billion at HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, and $2.6 billion at HSBC Holdings.
 Financial firms around the world have tapped shareholders for fresh cash to replenish capital depleted by the subprime mortgage market turmoil in the United States. Central bankers, including the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, have applauded the steps, saying they are necessary to guarantee the stability of the industry at a time when the outlook for the economy remains gloomy. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, in a speech in Chicago, urged banks to continue to raise capital because the financial market turmoil underscored the need for ''generous'' capital cushions.

HEADLINE: Auto Production Cuts Help Trigger a Sharp Fall in Industrial Output

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The nation's industrial output plunged in April, reflecting big cutbacks in automaking and other manufacturing industries.
 The Federal Reserve reported on Thursday that industrial production dropped 0.7 percent last month, more than double the decline that economists had expected. 
 Manufacturing output fell by 0.8 percent. Half of that weakness came from large cutbacks in auto production because of falling demand for new cars and problems related to a strike at a parts supplier for General Motors.
 The drop in overall production matched a 0.7 percent decline in February and followed a weak 0.2 percent increase in March. It pushed the industrial operating rate to its lowest point in more than two years. Factories, mines and utilities operated at 79.7 percent of capacity last month. It was the first time the operating rate had been below 80 percent since October 2005, when it stood at 79.8 percent because of disruptions from the Gulf Coast hurricanes.
 Output in the mining sector declined by 0.8 percent last month, while output at utilities edged up by 0.3 percent.
 In other economic news, the Labor Department reported on Thursday that applications for jobless benefits rose by 6,000 last week, to 371,000. The gain was in line with expectations.
 The weak economy has resulted in four consecutive months of job losses, often a sign that a recession has started. The April drop was just one-fourth the size of job losses in March, however, giving hope that the current economic slowdown might not be as severe as the last two recessions.
 The increase of 6,000 claims applications last week was the smallest one-week move in about two months. Claims have been unusually volatile in recent weeks, reflecting strike-related layoffs in the auto industry and trouble the government had in seasonally adjusting the data to take into account an unusually early Easter.
 For the week ended May 3, the total number of people receiving unemployment benefits rose by 28,000, to 3.06 million. It was the third consecutive week that this figure had been above three million, another sign that the weak economy is having an adverse effect on the labor market.
 The number of states and territories reporting increases in claims applications for the week of May 3 totaled 26, while 27 reported decreasing claims.
 New York State had the biggest rise in claims, a jump of 11,414 that was attributed to higher layoffs in transportation and service industries, followed by Pennsylvania, where claims increased by 2,716.
 Massachusetts had the biggest drop in claims, a decline of 5,027, which was attributed to fewer layoffs in transportation and services. Other states with big declines were New Jersey, down 3,259, and Georgia, with a drop of 2,935.

Surprising even the most optimistic forecasters, the German economy grew 1.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, delivering its best performance in more than a decade despite the global financial crisis and recessionary fears enveloping the United States.
 The euro zone, where Germany accounts for a third of economic output among 15 members, grew 0.7 percent during the period, the statistics agency Eurostat reported Thursday. The region's numbers, which represent quarter-on-quarter growth, also got a surprising lift from France, where the economy grew 0.6 percent in the first quarter. 
 The figures, which were about double what most economists expected, suggested that the European economy was demonstrating a resilience that seemed unlikely as recently as last autumn. Economists said, however, that the numbers obscure severe slowdowns in Ireland and Spain, which have been battered by the global housing decline, and a probable recession in Italy.
 Still, the statistics appeared to validate the path of the European Central Bank, which has resisted cutting interest rates as the Federal Reserve has done in the United States. The European bank has repeatedly emphasized that inflation remains a threat while playing down the risks to growth posed by financial market distress since August.
 Most private economists have taken issue with what they see as the overly rosy view of the central bank. They have forecast that financial conditions, which have ratcheted up borrowing costs; the strong euro; and declining demand in the United States will eventually pinch German and European growth.
 For now, though, that impact appears to be delayed, and probably less intense that most observers had feared as recently as late last year.
 ''It is very hard to come up with good arguments why Germany and Europe can shrug all this off,'' said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank's office in London. ''I imagine, in the end, it will be a timing question. We expected these effects to come through sooner, but I do think they will eventually come through.''
 Germany has not grown at its current pace since early 1996, when its economy was cranking up for what became the worldwide technology boom.
 The number probably includes some one-time gains that could hold down growth later in the year, economists said. Sunny weather in Germany fed construction spending, and a buildup of inventories probably added to growth, they said.
 Germany's strength at a time of global uncertainty also testifies to progress in containing labor costs, streamlining production in its important manufacturing sector and managing a slow but steady increase in employment, which supports domestic demand. Germany is also profiting immensely from thriving economies in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
 The sunny outlook for German manufacturers has also helped avert a sudden contraction in credit, a much-feared outcome of the financial crisis that is now vexing the American economy but seems an increasingly remote possibility in Europe.
 Nonetheless, growth in Germany almost certainly peaked in the first quarter, economists said. Even with an expected slowdown, Germany seemed set to achieve an economic soft landing in which slower growth did not automatically lead to recession, according to economists.
 ''To have a hard landing you would have to have a serious credit crunch,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ''But we're looking like we're not going to have that.''
 The diverse tapestry of economies in Europe looks set to complicate the job of the European central bank as it steers interest rates later this year. By not lowering its benchmark rate, which has stood at 4 percent since the financial crisis began in August, the central bank is in effect making monetary policy for thriving Germany, the dominant economy of the euro zone. For most other countries, easier credit would be welcome relief.
 Growth in Spain and Ireland was near zero in the first quarter, Eurostat said, reflecting stagnant or falling housing prices. Italy is likely to slide into recession, and further growth in France is not guaranteed, economists said.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says Banks Need More Capital

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, pushed banks on Thursday to keep raising capital in the aftermath of losses from the credit crisis to avert deeper damage to the economy.
 ''Firms are hunkering down,'' Mr. Bernanke said at the Chicago Fed conference on credit markets. ''They have at least partially replaced the losses with new capital raising, but not entirely. They are being rather conservative in making new loans, which has implications for the broader economy.''
 Mr. Bernanke's remarks reflect concerns he and other Fed officials expressed this week that financial markets had yet to return to normal. The Fed chief also said the central bank was considering strengthening its guidance to banks on how they manage risk after ''weaknesses'' that contributed to the crisis. 
 While banks and securities companies have raised about $244 billion of capital since July, they may have further to go after write-downs and credit losses in excess of $333 billion.
 Mr. Bernanke and the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., have repeatedly said firms should keep increasing their funds to ease the impact of the credit squeeze.
 Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are among companies raising capital this quarter. IndyMac Bancorp, a major independent home lender, said this week that it planned to raise a ''slug'' of money from outside investors. 
 Mr. Bernanke said that senior bank executives needed to take a leadership role in strengthening risk management. The strongest banks did not rely on credit-rating companies and took into account the danger of a slump in access to funds, he said.
 ''I have been encouraged by the recently demonstrated ability of many financial institutions, large and small, to raise capital,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 He did not discuss the path of interest rates or the outlook for the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee next meets June 24-25. Investors expect the central bank's next move will be to raise, rather than lower, the benchmark rate from 2 percent, according to futures prices.
 Mr. Bernanke said the credit crisis continued to confound the economy. ''Events continue to unfold,'' he said, adding that ''the financial stress we continue to experience'' stemmed from a separation of lending and distribution of credit to investors.
 Sovereign wealth funds have contributed as much as a third of the capital banks have raised, which has been ''very positive,'' Mr. Bernanke said in response to questions. ''It has been very constructive to have this source of funding coming into our banking system,'' he said.
 Banks are likely to heed the chairman's advice, said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
 Mr. Bernanke is ''just reminding us there's more wood to cut here,'' he said. ''They're going to continue to float new debt or equity into a market that's going to be a little more receptive to it because they see this as part of a process that's putting the problems behind them.''
 The flight from risk since August has made financial institutions reluctant to lend to each other, driving up banks' borrowing costs. That has increased the threat to economic growth already posed by the worst housing recession in a quarter-century.
 The Fed has created three new types of loans to financial companies since December to alleviate credit strains, including direct lending to firms other than commercial banks for the first time since the Great Depression.
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was reviewing how supervisors approach bank examinations.
 ''Supervisors must redouble their efforts to help organizations improve their risk-management practices,'' Mr. Bernanke said.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just Petroleum, All Imports Cost More

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Read Floyd Norris's blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR years, waves of inexpensive imports helped to keep inflation at bay in the United States. But those days are over, and now many imports are bringing inflation with them. 
 Some of that inflation comes from soaring oil prices -- the government reported this week that oil imported in April cost 67 percent more than oil imported a year earlier -- but the trend is clear even if energy prices are ignored.
 For all nonpetroleum imports, prices in April were up 6.2 percent from a year earlier. That is the fastest rate of gain in almost 20 years, reflecting increases in products from most countries and in most categories.
 The reasons for the increases include strong world demand for many products, thanks to the emergence of China and India, and a weakening dollar.
 The impact can be seen in the chart, which shows the 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index, excluding energy, and the 12-month change in prices for nonpetroleum imports. While the import price changes were usually lower -- and often reflected declining prices -- in the 1990s, now they are sharply higher than the overall gain in consumer prices.
 That fact is likely to put downward pressure on imports, as consumers react to the higher prices and have less money to spend on other things after buying gasoline and food.
 Food prices are a significant part of the problem. Over all, import prices for food and beverages were up 12.6 percent in April from the year before. That gain is much higher than the overall food inflation rate of 5 percent, a fact that makes it likely some consumers will seek to substitute domestic products for imported ones.
 At least those who wish to drown their sorrows are not suffering as much. Import prices for wine and beer were up 4.1 percent, and those of other alcoholic beverages climbed just 2.6 percent.
 The change is particularly evident in Chinese imports, which for years became less and less expensive. That trend halted a year ago, and in April Chinese import prices were 4.1 percent higher than they had been the previous April.
 That price increase, coupled with a slowing economy, seems to be reducing American demand for Chinese products. In the first quarter of this year, according to American figures, the dollar value of imports from China was up only 1.8 percent from the period in 2007, an increase that is less than the rate of inflation and indicates fewer goods were purchased.
 The price increases in Chinese products were not matched by those from Japan, but even the 1 percent increase reported for Japanese goods was the fastest rate of inflation in more than three years. And the strong euro helped to send prices of European goods up sharply, including a 6 percent gain in German import prices.
 Even automobile prices -- historically held down by tough competition -- have started to rise. The government reported a 3.3 percent gain in the prices of motor vehicle imports. That is not a gain that would impress an oil trader, but it is the largest 12-month increase for that category of imports in a dozen years.

HEADLINE: Congressional Pressure Prevails As U.S. Halts Filling of Oil Reserve

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from Congress, the Energy Department said Friday that it would temporarily suspend a program to fill the nation's strategic oil stocks. 
 But the move, which some analysts and politicians had hoped would help break the rally in oil prices, failed to sway the market. Crude oil prices hit another record Friday. 
 The decision on the oil stocks came the same day that Saudi Arabia announced a modest increase of 300,000 barrels a day in its oil production as President Bush visited the oil-rich kingdom. 
 But oil traders dismissed the news from Washington and Riyadh and focused instead on the continuing tensions between growing energy demand and limited supply growth. 
 ''You're getting more oil on the market so you'd think this would be a reason for prices to pull back down,'' Thomas Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas in New York, said. ''But sometimes the market doesn't react to fundamentals, especially when it's in a bullish mode.''
 Crude oil futures rose to a record of $126.29 a barrel, up $2.17, on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. 
 The decision by the White House was not entirely a surprise. Three days ago, both the Senate and the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to force the administration to freeze its policy of adding oil to the nation's emergency stockpiles, known as the strategic petroleum reserve, or S.P.R. 
 The high cost of oil has pushed up gasoline and diesel prices to record highs in recent weeks, straining household budgets at a time the economy is also slowing. That has increased the pressure on Congress and the White House, especially as the Memorial Day weekend approaches, to do something about rising costs. 
 The administration planned to add 76,000 barrels a day into the oil reserves from August to December, or a total of 13 million barrels. The reserve, which was last used after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, has 702.7 million barrels of oil stored in the underground salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas. 
 The White House portrayed filling the reserve to its capacity of 727 million barrels a day as a security issue, and a response against sudden disruptions in supplies. 
 But the policy has come under mounting criticism in Congress, including some from Republican allies of the president, who have found it difficult to justify taking oil off the market at a time of mounting prices. The speed with which politicians have jumped on this policy is a measure of how anxious people feel about mounting energy costs.
 But many analysts cautioned the decision was unlikely to have much of an impact on oil or gasoline prices. Neither gasoline, which now averages $3.79 a gallon nationwide, and diesel, which sells at $4.48 a gallon, are likely to fall this summer.
 ''Those who suggested it was going to have a dramatic effect are going to be disappointed,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. ''It won't have a material visible impact on the market but it is still the appropriate thing to do at this time.''
 Still, the decision was welcomed by politician of both sides of the aisle, who also cautioned it would have a little effect on prices. 
 ''No one can make the case that filling the reserve makes sense when oil prices are rising the way they are,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico, who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ''Suspending the S.P.R. fill will keep the government from competing for oil in the marketplace and driving up fuel costs across America.''
 Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, said that ''freezing shipments to the S.P.R. is a sensible approach, but it is a baby step forward in addressing our nation's energy crisis.''

HEADLINE: Despite Unease, Big Gains for the Week

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street pulled off its lows to finished narrowly mixed Friday as investors squared concerns about rising oil prices with a surprise jump in home construction. The major indexes ended the week with big gains.
 The Commerce Department's report that home construction jumped 8.2 percent in April was welcomed as a sign that the housing market might be bottoming.
 But investors still appeared concerned for much of the session about energy prices and their effect on consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. 
 The price of a barrel of oil rose to $127.82 for a new trading record on Friday.
 The rise in energy and food costs is weighing on the mood of consumers. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading for May fell to 59.5 in May, the weakest reading since June 1980.
 Despite the uneasiness over energy prices, stocks posted strong gains for the week. The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rose 2.7 percent for the week.
 The gains in oil for a time upended some of the week's optimism that led investors to move into cyclical stocks, which typically benefit when an economy begins to emerge from a slowdown, said Steve Neimeth, portfolio manager for AIG SunAmerica Mutual Funds.
 ''Although the housing numbers today were generally positive, the Michigan survey was quite poor and, more importantly, a continued spike in energy and commodities is causing investors to second-guess the second-half recovery,'' he said. ''If oil and gas prices continue to go up, consumers are unlikely to have the spending ability in the second half.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.86, or 0.05 percent, to 12,986.80.
 The S.& P. 500 index ticked up 1.78, or 0.13 percent, to 1,425.35, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.88, or 0.19 percent, to 2,528.85. 
 The S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq remain at five-month highs.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.21, or 0.30 percent, to 741.17.
 For the week, the Dow rose 1.89 percent, and the Nasdaq added 3.41 percent.
 Light crude rose $2.17, to settle at a record close of $126.29 a barrel, holding its gains even after Saudi Arabia's oil minister said the country increased production by 300,000 barrels a day last week and the Energy Department said it would stop adding to the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve for six months, starting July 1.
 Investors have been tracking energy prices closely, with the average American retail price of gasoline around $3.77 a gallon and the average price of diesel fuel near $4.46 a gallon. 
 Consumers and businesses alike are struggling with high commodities costs, despite mild overall readings on inflation, so Wall Street remains concerned about spending on discretionary items.
 David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said investors would continue to worry about oil prices but that there was a sense that if the economy was in a recession, it most likely would prove to be a mild one. 
 He said stocks had been able to advance from their mid-March lows because fears of worsening troubles in the credit market had receded somewhat.
 ''I think oil is still the worrying wild card in all of this, but the central theme of this year is that we are gradually moving from the credit storm to the economic storm,'' he said. ''At this stage the economic storm is essentially getting downgraded from a hurricane to a nor'easter.'' 
 Mr. Kelly said the government's economic stimulus checks, which began arriving in mailboxes this month, should help consumers absorb increased energy prices and leave them with extra money.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to 100 8/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.84 percent, from 3.81 percent.

HEADLINE: Excess Money, Deficits and the High Price of Oil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman (''The Oil Nonbubble,'' column, May 12) refers to a statement I made two and a half years ago that the oil surge was a ''huge bubble.'' It was -- and still is. 
 And it is not only oil -- we are experiencing a commodity bubble not seen since the 1970s and early '80s. The cause of the commodity bubble then, and now, was excess money creation by the Federal Reserve. 
 When the dollar is debased, commodity prices go up. In the current case, the bubble began in 2004, when the Fed continued to provide excess liquidity long after the economy was back on track from the 2000-1 recession. Gold surged to more than $400 an ounce, far above its $350 average of the previous 12 years, and today sits at almost $900 an ounce. Oil also went up, as did virtually all other commodities. 
 John Maynard Keynes in 1919 observed that when inflationary forces are unleashed and the destruction is felt, not one person in a million will understand the inflationary process in play. And so today everyone is pointing fingers at India, China, greedy oil companies and powerful speculators.
 Supply and demand as the primary cause of high oil prices? Last August when the credit crisis hit, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, began flooding the banking system with liquidity, like throwing money out of a helicopter. Since then, the American economy has ground to a halt, and global economic growth rates have slowed. Yet the price of oil since August has zoomed from around $70 a barrel to more than $120.
 The frustrating thing about bubbles is that they take on an irrational life of their own, getting bigger and lasting longer than most sober observers would ever have imagined. This one is no exception.
 No one knows when this bubble will pop. But pop it will -- just as it did for high tech and housing. Steve Forbes 
 Chairman and Chief Executive
 Forbes Media
 New York, May 13, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman provides a sensible explanation of the fact that the huge increase in the price of oil within the last several years has been the result not of a speculative bubble but of a growing long-term imbalance between demand and supply worldwide. 
 But one important fact particular to the United States should be mentioned. While the dollar price of oil has more than quadrupled over the last six years, the price per barrel in euros is about two and a half times what it was six years ago.
 The difference between these two reflects the decline in the value of the dollar during this period relative to the other currencies, the simple consequence of our having been trying to live far beyond our means. This has been reflected in our explosion of deficits -- government and private -- and consequently in our balance of international payments. Alfred E. Kahn 
 Ithaca, N.Y., May 13, 2008
 The writer, emeritus professor of political economy at Cornell, was President Jimmy Carter's adviser on inflation.

HEADLINE: Olympic Dream Stays Alive, on Synthetic Legs

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROBINSON and ALAN SCHWARZ; Gina Kolata contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When an international court ruled Friday that a double-amputee sprinter from South Africa was eligible to compete in this summer's Olympic Games in Beijing, the stage was set for disabled athletes to meet their own trailblazer. 
 The watershed ruling made the runner, Oscar Pistorius, the first amputee to successfully challenge the notion that his carbon-fiber prosthetics gave him an unfair advantage and assured his right to race against able-bodied athletes in the Olympics, should he qualify. Previously barred from competing in such races by track and field's world governing body, Pistorius will continue to stoke the debate over the competitive issues created by evolving technology in sports.
 The ruling's direct impact on disabled athletes could be limited, in part because Pistorius, 21, still must post a time fast enough to qualify for the Games. Yet his victory Friday in the Court of Arbitration for Sport sent a message that could long resonate among Paralympians.
 ''I am extremely shocked that the C.A.S. has made that decision,'' said Marlon Shirley, a single amputee who holds world records in the 100 meters, the 200 meters and the long jump in his Paralympic class. ''It's a very brave decision and one that's definitely going to revolutionize sports.'' 
 Ann Cody, a seven-time Paralympic medalist for the United States in basketball and track and field who sits on the governing board of the International Paralympic Committee, added: ''It sends a message. People with disabilities can see people like them compete, and they'll connect. They'll say, 'Maybe I can do that, too.' '' 
 In overturning a ban imposed by the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field's governing body, the court deemed that there was not enough evidence to prove that Pistorius's flexible j-shaped blades, attached below his knees, gave him an advantage.
 ''It's not just about me,'' Pistorius said in a telephone interview from Milan. ''It's about the extra opportunity for amputee athletes.''
 Pistorius must meet the qualifying standard of 45.55 seconds in the 400 meters to gain an automatic berth in Beijing (or 45.95 seconds for a provisional spot); his current personal best is 46.33, according to his coach, Ampie Louw. With 64 days left, he is in a race to race.
 Several Paralympic athletes and officials said that the court's ruling would probably not affect many athletes, at least immediately. A large portion of athletes in the Paralympic Games, which take place two weeks after the Olympics, compete in wheelchairs; those who do not rarely reach the elite levels that Pistorius has. And the wording of the ruling appeared to caution against extrapolation, clearly stating that it ''has absolutely no application to any other athlete, or other type of prosthetic limb. Each case must be considered by the I.A.A.F. on its own merits.''
 ''I knew they would have to do it somehow to protect themselves,'' said Brian Frasure, a single amputee who will try out for his fourth United States Paralympic team in June. Frasure also works for Ossur, the company that designed and manufactured the Cheetah Flex-Foot, the prosthetics that Pistorius and many other athletes use.
 ''In the world of prosthetics, with so many variables, they need a stipulation for down the road, when we come to the day and age when bionics come to the fore,'' Frasure said. ''If they say it's O.K. for all amputees to compete in the Olympics, they would be setting themselves up for even more controversy, more than Oscar dealt with, in the future.''
 The I.A.A.F. thought it had made that stipulation when it barred Pistorius in January, despite clearing him to compete with able-bodied athletes last spring; he ran at international meets in Rome and Sheffield, England.
 Disabled athletes have competed in the Olympics before -- for example, the American Marla Runyan, who is legally blind, made the final of the 1,500 meters at the 2000 Sydney Games. Natalie Du Toit, whose left leg was amputated above the knee seven years ago, will swim for South Africa in Beijing.
 But very few have raised the issue of whether their disability, or their compensation for a disability, presents an advantage. One was Neroli Fairhall, a paraplegic archer from New Zealand, who competed in the 1984 Olympics while in her wheelchair; there was some question as to whether the chair provided her better stability than archers standing on legs, but she was allowed to compete.
 Pistorius was born without the fibula in his lower legs and with defects in his feet, and his legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. He went on to set Paralympic world records in the 100, 200, and 400 meters, but did not draw attention until he started competing with able-bodied athletes in South Africa in 2004.
 So last November, the track and field governing body's cooperation with Pistorius was uncharted territory. The I.A.A.F. sponsored three days of testing on Pistorius, who gave his consent, in Cologne, Germany, under the supervision of Peter Bruggemann, a professor at the German Sport University.
 Bruggemann found that the Cheetah prosthetics were more efficient than a human ankle. He also found that they could return energy in maximum speed sprinting and that Pistorius was able to keep up with a few able-bodied sprinters while expending about 25 percent less energy.
 Pistorius's lawyers, however, argued that the results of the study did not provide enough evidence to make a decision, and they lodged an appeal in February. Jeffrey Kessler, a lawyer with the New York-based firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, who agreed to take the case on a pro bono basis, led Pistorius's defense.
 ''The I.A.A.F. had not at all followed proper procedures in conducting any of its review,'' Kessler said. ''Many of its results were in many respects pre-ordained.''
 To test how much mechanical energy a runner uses, researchers study forces on the ankle, knee and hip joints. They do this with video cameras to record the joints' motions and plates along the running path that record the force on the joints. When the athlete's foot, or prosthesis, touches a plate, it measures the forces in three directions: up and down, right and left, and front and back. 
 The measurements, combined with oxygen consumption, are a reliable indicator of the runner's economy -- and whether the prosthetics are providing an advantage, said Roger Enoka, a biomechanics researcher at the University of Colorado.
 The researchers who examined Pistorius were instructed to study only his performance while running on a straightaway -- when he was at his fastest. That approach was deemed unfair by the court. In its published opinion, the court censured the I.A.A.F. for its handling of the case, saying that from the outset, it had its mind made up.
 ''The manner in which the I.A.A.F. handled the situation of Mr. Pistorius in the period from July 2007 to January 2008 fell short of the high standards that the international sporting community is entitled to expect from a federation such as the I.A.A.F.,'' the panel said.
 In a public statement, however, the I.A.A.F. did not address any of the hearing's specifics.
 ''The I.A.A.F. accepts the decision of C.A.S. and Oscar will be welcomed wherever he competes this summer,'' the I.A.A.F. president Lamine Diack said. ''He is an inspirational man and we look forward to admiring his achievements in the future.''
 But Pistorius is not convinced that his future includes the 2008 Olympics on top of his competing in the Paralympic Games. Over the last five months, the time spent preparing an appeal and a court case has eaten away at his time on the track.
 ''It's going to be very hard for me to make the Olympics now,'' he said. ''Even if I don't, I want to compete at the world championships and in London in 2012.''
 The cutoff date for Olympic qualification is July 20, and between now and then he hopes to race in three or four able-bodied events as well as at least five competitions against amputees to build up to his top speed.
 If Pistorius does qualify, the International Olympic Committee said it would welcome him. ''Oscar Pistorius is a determined and gutsy athlete who will now no doubt put all his energy into reaching the qualification standards for the Olympic Games,'' the I.O.C. said in a statement.
 And with the court's decision effective as soon as it was delivered, Pistorius said he would resume training immediately. But he added that training was the furthest thing from his mind as he sat in Dewey & LeBoeuf's Milan office, waiting for a fax from the court. ''We were trying not to expect anything so as not to be disappointed,'' he said.
 But when a lawyer read him the decision, five months after he thought the I.A.A.F. had shattered his dreams of running in the Olympics, he wept.
 ''Most people would have quit after the I.A.A.F. said no,'' said Shirley, the single-amputee Paralympian. ''He kept fighting through. He's been doing things on prosthetics that people haven't thought about.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Steps to Ease Congestion At Airports

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To hold down ticket prices and ease airplane congestion over the New York region, the Bush administration proposed Friday to auction landing slots at two major airports, Kennedy and Newark, and to impose a limit on airline traffic at Newark. 
 Together the changes are meant to untangle the metropolitan skies and to make it easier for new airlines to gain access to the lucrative New York market, a step the administration expects will help keep fares down. 
 Eventually, the administration hopes, the changes will help smooth air traffic throughout the country. A third of the nation's air traffic passes through the New York region, and three-fourths of the chronic delays around the country can be traced to delays in New York, according to the federal aviation officials. 
 The latest moves come on top of previous proposals for major changes at the airports serving New York, suggesting that in the late stages of its term, the Bush administration is trying to address problems that have grown worse on its watch. 
 Last month, the Transportation Department proposed to auction slots at La Guardia, the third major New York airport. The cap on flights in and out of Newark Liberty International means the government has now limited flights at all three major airports. 
 Auctions have never been held for airport slots in the United States or other major airports around the world. Because of stiff opposition from airlines and influential lawmakers, it was not clear whether such auctions could actually be conducted before the Bush administration ends. 
 The auctions are a necessary complement to the caps, administration officials say. The caps are meant to prevent airlines from crowding flights at peak hours when most passengers want to fly and to force them to spread flights out around the clock. 
 Such caps run counter to the pro-competition leanings of the Bush administration, but officials say they regard the auctions for takeoff and landing slots as an appropriate ''market mechanism.'' 
 By both capping flights and auctioning slots, the thinking goes, carriers that now dominate the three airports will not be able to use that dominance to raise ticket prices. Allowing the existing carriers to remain without new competition would be ''a formula for failure,'' said D. J. Gribbin, the general counsel of the Transportation Department. 
 Mr. Gribbin said in a briefing with reporters that the government had to have a system to allow ''the next Virgin America, the next JetBlue, or whoever, to get access to some of the most valuable airspace in the world.''
 The department proposed different auction systems, but they would all take slots away from big carriers and make them available to others. 
 For Newark, it said, each airline would get to keep up to 20 slots a day, but 10 percent of the remainder would be auctioned over 10 years. Any airline, including the one whose slots were being offered for redistribution, could bid. At Newark, this would mean auctioning 96 slots over 10 years, out of a total of 1,219. 
 For Kennedy International, the government proposed the same auction system as for Newark but it also offered a more aggressive alternative under which each airline would keep up to 20 slots while auctioning 20 percent of the remainder over five years. The incumbent airline would not be allowed to bid under this alternative.
 The different proposals arise from the oddities of market share. Continental Airlines will have 72 percent of the departures from Newark in August, based on schedules that the Air Transport Association has compiled. All other carriers at Newark have a market share in the single digits. Thus, forbidding Continental to bid on slots it gave up would not be fair, transportation officials said. 
 At La Guardia, US Airways will have a 32 percent market share, American 22 percent and Delta nearly 20 percent. At Kennedy, Delta has 31 percent of the planned departures, JetBlue 27 percent and American, 15 percent. 
 Auctions are often used to distribute scarce public resources like broadcast spectrum, but they are not as well accepted as they are in the Bush administration and among some conservative academics. 
 The airlines plan to argue that they won the slots and that an auction would be an unlawful ''taking.'' They also plan to argue that auctions would be a tax on airline operations, and that only Congress can impose such a tax.
 ''Implementing an untested scheme to impose auctions at the busiest airports in America is nothing short of insanity,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, in a statement. ''Auctions have never been tried and were hatched by a handful of ivory tower types in the administration. It shows that this administration puts ideology above the safety and economic well-being of the American flier.''
 In some markets, airlines that hold slots can sell them to others, according to Douglas E. Lavin, vice president for North America of the International Air Transport Association. ''That's how carriers like Delta and Continental are getting into Heathrow,'' in London, he said. But, he added, ''As far as I know, there's no government organization that takes slots and auctions them off.'' Mr. Lavin formerly served as the assistant administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the incumbent airlines say they will oppose the auction idea. The Air Transport Association, the trade group of the big carriers, said the Transportation Department had a ''continued fixation'' on auctions. The F.A.A. should focus on steps that will increase capacity, said James C. May, the group's president and chief executive. ''This experiment will penalize the public,'' he added, because airlines will pass on costs to passengers.
 The airlines say that they have spent many years and millions of dollars building market share and physical facilities at the airports, and that the slots should not be taken away from them. The Transportation Department, however, insists that the F.A.A. owns the slots. 
 The Port Authority said the auction proposal was poorly conceived. ''The Port Authority will work with the airlines to examine our options for prohibiting the federal government from implementing this auction plan,'' the agency said. 
 The department's goal is to hold the auction this year or at ''the very beginning'' of next year. Mr. Bush leaves office on Jan. 20. 
 The department also said on Friday that an airline that charges extra for a second piece of checked luggage would have to disclose that charge before it sold a ticket. 
 The department said it would close a loophole that makes airline on-time statistics look better than they really are. At present, planes that leave the gate on time but then sit on the tarmac for hours and return to the gate are not counted as delayed.
 The department also said it would give the Port Authority $2 million to study how to extend train service to Stewart Airport, in Newburgh, 90 miles north of Manhattan. ''Ultimately, this will help make Stewart New York's fourth major airport,'' Mr. Gribbin said.

PERSON: Dick Netzer 

HEADLINE: Dick Netzer, 79, Municipal Finance Expert

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Dick Netzer, an economist who advised mayors of New York City and governors of New York State and served on the first board of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which pried New York City out of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died on May 7 in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Brooklyn and in East Hampton, N.Y.
 His death came after a long illness, his wife, Carol, said. 
 Mr. Netzer, who spent much of his career at New York University and became dean of its Graduate School of Public Administration (now the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service), was an expert in public finance, especially as it pertains to state and local government. He wrote widely and voluminously on the arcana of how people are, should and should not be taxed and how the government should, should not and does spend the money. In the 1950s he wrote about tolls, toll roads and highway finance. In the 1960s he wrote a comprehensive analysis of property tax. 
 In the 1970s, his book about public support of the arts, ''The Subsidized Muse'' (Cambridge University Press, 1978), argued that government arts financing was generally a good thing but needed to be applied prudently, that money simply flung at arts organizations was both fiscally and culturally irresponsible. 
 He served, in the late 1960s, as an adviser to Mayor John V. Lindsay, in the 1970s, to Mayor Abraham D. Beame and Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and in the 1980s, to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. And in June 1975, when the financier Felix Rohatyn and others recommended that the State Legislature create the Municipal Assistance Corporation, an agency with the power to issue bonds backed by portions of the city sales tax, Mr. Netzer joined the board, his deep academic background providing a fiscally conservative anchor. He remained until 1995.
 ''He provided continuity and perspective and placed the crisis in terms of both the city and state's long term financial evolution,'' said Peter Goldmark, who was the state budget director at the time. ''The thing about Dick is that he was a continuing iconic figure. When I first went to work with Mayor Lindsay, Dick Netzer was a god. He was the guy we all looked up to. And he was still that guy in 1985 and 1990.'' 
 Dick Netzer, who was named for his mother, Sue Dick, was born in Brooklyn on May 14, 1928. His father, Solomon, was a doctor who specialized in the treatment of tuberculosis. He attended New York City public schools and the University of Wisconsin and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard. He served stateside in the Army during the Korean War.
 In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Ellen Lane of Los Angeles; two daughters, Jenny Netzer, of Cambridge, Mass., and Katherine M. Bunger of Newtown, Conn.; and six grandsons. 
 In recalling the fiscal crisis of 1975, Dall W. Forsythe, a professor at the Wagner school who was the state budget director from 1988 to 1991 under Governor Cuomo, said that ''Dick was horrified at what the city had done, and he was absolutely delighted to be part of the solution.'' Now on the Municipal Assistance Corporation board himself, Mr. Forsythe said that the last of the bonds it issued are to be paid off next month, and that the agency will be dissolved, essentially having succeeded itself out of existence.
 ''The city now has a double-A credit rating,'' Mr. Forsythe said. ''It's a great success story. It's too bad Dick didn't make it another month and a half. He could have come to the closing party.''

HEADLINE: Dominican President Wins a Third Term

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic 

 BODY:
-- Dominicans who went to the polls on Friday had been given chickens, poured beer, promised new homes and even handed cash during a spirited frenzy of campaigning. But President Leonel Fernandez won a third term in office largely as a result of a campaign gift to the populace that dwarfed those of his six opponents: a shiny new subway system.
 ''It's something for all of us,'' said Francia Catalina Pena, 71, who stood outside one of the downtown stations, a glass and granite structure that juts from the ground at an odd angle. Her vote went to the man she calls simply ''Leonel.'' 
 Mr. Fernandez's campaign slogan was ''Pa'lante,'' Dominican slang for onward, and his giant public works project was rushed to completion to allow him to offer free rides before the polling. For a while he even drove the subway train, the first in the Caribbean outside of Puerto Rico.
 Opponents said the $710 million used to build the nine-mile subway line, which happens to roll through the struggling neighborhood where Mr. Fernandez was born, could have been better spent on the country's poor.
 ''All that money that went for this should have gone here,'' said Eddie Urenya, 55 and unemployed, rubbing his belly. ''It's nice, but is it needed?''
 Perhaps not. But many Dominicans said they saw the project, which still had not opened officially, as a sign of the country's progress. And in a country where corruption is all too common, others argued that at least the money was not pocketed.
 ''It's true that it's a lot of money, but it's a project for the people,'' said Ramona Hernandez, director of the Dominican Studies Institute at the City College of New York.
 Mr. Fernandez grew up in the Bronx and maintains strong ties there. ''Leonel grew up in New York and has a fascination with the place,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, a professor at Florida International University in Miami and Mr. Fernandez's longtime friend and campaign consultant. ''For him, the Metro is part of that, a way to make this city modern and boost national pride.''
 Early returns Friday night showed that Mr. Fernandez appeared to have garnered more than 50 percent of the vote and clearly would not need to enter a runoff election. His main opponent conceded late Friday. 
 Mr. Fernandez has been widely credited with steadying a country that he inherited in economic crisis. He was first elected in 1996 and then returned to the presidency in 2004, as banks collapsed, inflation skyrocketed and waves of Dominicans headed to the ocean in boats to seek better lives in the United States. 
 Mr. Fernandez's chief competitor, Miguel Vargas, an engineer, was public works minister in the last government. The two men battled during the campaign over which of them would drag the Dominican Republic back to its troubled past.
 Mr. Fernandez, 54, whose Dominican Liberation Party vastly outspent all rivals, sought to link Mr. Vargas with the problem-plagued presidency from 2000 to 2004 of Hipolito Mejia, who left the country near collapse.
 And Mr. Vargas, 57, representing the Dominican Revolutionary Party, raised the specter of the last president to win two consecutive terms, Joaquin Balaguer, a strongman who rigged elections, jailed opponents and stuck around for decades, leaving office in 1996. 
 ''We have seen the harm that re-election has done,'' Mr. Vargas said at a recent election rally.
 Mr. Balaguer's legacy prompted the country in 1996 to bar sitting presidents from serving again, a law that was changed again in 2002 to allow two consecutive terms.
 Mr. Fernandez has made no secret of his desire to amend the Constitution to lift term limits altogether, a controversial notion in a country with a history of dictatorship.
 Even with his apparent victory, the Dominican Republic faces entrenched problems, despite an economic growth rate that has approached 10 percent in recent years. Global food prices are on the rise, blackouts are still a way of life for much of the capital and unemployment hovers around 15 percent. On top of that, a building boom and a steady influx of tourists have not changed the fact that a quarter of the population lives in poverty.
 ''Life is hard,'' said one of those poor people, Sando Chere, 34, who sells flavored ice on the street and planned to vote for an opposition candidate to stir things up. ''None of the politicians, not one of them, really understand that.''

HEADLINE: High-Tech Japan Running Out of Engineers

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan is running out of engineers.
 After years of fretting over coming shortages, the country is actually facing a dwindling number of young people entering engineering and technology-related fields. 
 Universities call it ''rikei banare,'' or ''flight from science.'' The decline is growing so drastic that industry has begun advertising campaigns intended to make engineering look sexy and cool, and companies are slowly starting to import foreign workers, or sending jobs to where the engineers are, in Vietnam and India.
 It was engineering prowess that lifted this nation from postwar defeat to economic superpower. But according to educators, executives and young Japanese themselves, the young here are behaving more like Americans: choosing better-paying fields like finance and medicine, or more purely creative careers, like the arts, rather than following their salaryman fathers into the unglamorous world of manufacturing. 
 The problem did not catch Japan by surprise. The first signs of declining interest among the young in science and engineering appeared almost two decades ago, after Japan reached first-world living standards, and in recent years there has been a steady decline in the number of science and engineering students. But only now are Japanese companies starting to feel the real pinch. 
 By one ministry of internal affairs estimate, the digital technology industry here is already short almost half a million engineers.
 Headhunters have begun poaching engineers midcareer with fat signing bonuses, a predatory practice once unheard-of in Japan's less-cutthroat version of capitalism.
 The problem is likely to worsen because Japan has one of the lowest birthrates in the world. ''Japan is sitting on a demographic time bomb,'' said Kazuhiro Asakawa, a professor of business at Keio University. ''An explosion is going to take place. They see it coming, but no one is doing enough about it.''
 The shortage is causing rising anxiety about Japan's competitiveness. China turns out some 400,000 engineers every year, hoping to usurp Japan's place one day as Asia's greatest economic power.
 Afraid of a hollowing-out of its vaunted technology industries, Japan has been scrambling to entice more of its younger citizens back into the sciences and engineering. But labor experts say the belated measures are limited and unlikely to fix the problem. 
 In the meantime, the country has slowly begun to accept more foreign engineers, but nowhere near the number that industry needs. 
 While ingrained xenophobia is partly to blame, companies say Japan's language and closed corporate culture also create barriers so high that many foreign engineers simply refuse to come, even when they are recruited. 
 As a result, some companies are moving research jobs to India and Vietnam because they say it is easier than bringing non-Japanese employees here.
 Japan's biggest problem may be the attitudes of affluence. Some young Japanese, products of a rich society, unfamiliar with the postwar hardships many of their parents and grandparents knew, do not see the value in slaving over plans and numbers when they could make money, have more contact with other people or have more fun. 
 Since 1999, the number of undergraduates majoring in sciences and engineering has fallen 10 percent to 503,026, according to the education ministry. (Just 1.1 percent of those students were foreign students.) The number of students majoring in creative arts and health-related fields rose during that time, the ministry said. 
 Applications to the engineering program at Utsunomiya University, an hour north of Tokyo, have fallen one-third since 1999. Starting last year, the school has tried to attract students by adding practical instruction to its theory-laden curriculum. One addition was a class in making camera lenses, offered in partnership with Canon, which drew 70 students, twice the expected turnout, said Toyohiko Yatagai, head of the university's center for optics research.
 But engineering students see themselves as a vanishing breed. Masafumi Hikita, a 24-year-old electric engineering senior, said most of his former high school classmates chose college majors in economics to pursue ''easier money'' in finance and banking. In fact, friends and neighbors were surprised he picked a difficult field like engineering, he said, with a reputation for long hours.
 Mr. Hikita and other engineering students say their dwindling numbers offer one benefit: they are a hot commodity among corporate recruiters. A labor ministry survey last year showed there were 4.5 job openings for every graduate specializing in fields like electronic machinery. 
 ''We don't need to find jobs,'' said Kenta Yaegashi, 24, another electrical engineering senior. ''They find us.'' He said his father, also an engineer, was envious of the current sellers' market, much less crowded than the packed field he faced 30 years ago. Even top manufacturers, who once had their pick of elite universities, say they now have to court talent. This means companies must adapt their recruiting pitches to appeal to changing social attitudes.
 So, Nissan tells students they can advance their careers more quickly there than at more traditional Japanese companies. The carmaker emphasizes that it offers faster promotions, bigger pay raises and even ''career coaches'' to help young talent ascend the corporate ladder.
 ''Students today are more demanding and individualistic, like Westerners,'' said Hitoshi Kawaguchi, senior vice president in charge of human resources at Nissan. 
 On the more offbeat side, an ad for the steel industry features a long-haired guitarist in spandex pants shouting, ''Metal rocks!''
 One source Japan has not yet fully tapped is foreign workers -- unlike Silicon Valley, filled with specialists in information technology, or IT, from developing nations like India and China. 
 According to government statistics, Japan had 157,719 foreigners working in highly skilled professions in 2006, twice as many as a decade ago, but still a far cry from the 7.8 million in the United States. Britain has also been aggressively recruiting foreign engineers, as have Singapore and South Korea, labor experts say.
 ''Japan is losing out in the global market for top IT engineers,'' said Anthony D'Costa, a professor at Copenhagen Business School, who has studied the migration of Indian engineers. 
 Companies are scrambling to change tactics now. 
 For instance, Kizou Tagomori, director of recruitment at Fujitsu, said the computer maker and its affiliates routinely fell about 10 percent shy of their annual hiring goal of 2,000 new employees. Fearing chronic shortages, the company has begun hiring foreigners to work in Japan. 
 Starting in 2003, Fujitsu began hiring about 30 foreigners a year, mostly other Asians who had graduated from Japanese universities. Initially, many managers were reluctant to accept them. Mr. Tagomori said they are now gaining acceptance. 
 Fujitsu's 10 Indian employees in Japan won over some of their co-workers by organizing a cricket team, he said.
 But Fujitsu remains an exception. In an economic ministry survey last year, 79 percent of Japanese companies say they either have no plans to hire foreign engineers or are undecided. The ministry said most managers still feared that foreigners would not be able to adapt to Japan's language or corporate culture. 
 To combat these attitudes, the ministry began the Asian Talent Fund, a $30 million-a-year effort to offer Asian students Japanese language training and internships in order to help them find work here.
 ''If these students do well, they can change Japanese attitudes drastically,'' said Go Takizawa, deputy director of the ministry's human resource policy division.
 Nonetheless, labor experts warn Japan may be doing too little, too late. They say the country has already gained a negative reputation as discriminating against foreign employees, with weak job guarantees and glass ceilings. Experts say Indian and other engineers will often opt for more open markets like the United States. 
 Indeed, a growing number of Japanese companies are having more success by building new research and development centers in countries with surpluses of engineers. Toyo Engineering, which designs chemical factories, said it and its affiliates now employ more engineers abroad -- 3,000, mostly in India, Thailand and Malaysia -- than in Japan, where they have 2,500 workers.
 With corporate Japan still reluctant to accept foreigners, a half-dozen staffing companies have stepped into the breach by hiring Chinese and South Korean engineers to send to Japanese companies on a temporary basis. One of the biggest is Altech, which has set up training centers at two Chinese universities to recruit engineering students and train them in Japanese language and business customs. Of Altech's roughly 2,400 engineers, 138 are Chinese, and the company plans to hire more at a rate of 200 per year.
 One of the first it hired was He Xifen, a 27-year-old mechanical engineer from Qingdao University of Science and Technology who joined Altech two and a half years ago. She said her friends back home envy her because she works with advanced Japanese technology, and earns three or four times more than she would in China. 
 While Japanese clients appear uncertain at first about how to deal with foreigners, she said, they quickly catch on and she usually feels welcome.
 ''Foreign engineers are becoming accepted,'' said Shigetaka Wako, a spokesman for Altech. ''Japan is slowly realizing that its economy cannot continue without them.''

HEADLINE: Imagine No Possessions

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and RACHEL MOSTELLER

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
Like many other young couples, Aimee and Jeff Harris spent the first years of their marriage eagerly accumulating stuff: cars, furniture, clothes, appliances and, after a son and a daughter came along, toys, toys, toys. 
 Now they are trying to get rid of it all, down to their fancy wedding bands. Chasing a utopian vision of a self-sustaining life on the land as partisans of a movement some call voluntary simplicity, they are donating virtually all their possessions to charity and hitting the road at the end of May.
 ''It's amazing the amount of things a family can acquire,'' said Mrs. Harris, 28, attributing their good life to ''the ridiculous amount of money'' her husband earned as a computer network engineer in this early Wi-Fi mecca. 
 The Harrises now hope to end up as organic homesteaders in Vermont. 
 ''We're not attached to any outcome,'' said Mrs. Harris, a would-be doctor before dropping out of college, who grew up poverty-stricken in a family that traces its lineage back through the Delanos and President Franklin D. Roosevelt to a Mayflower settler, Isaac Allerton. 
 Mr. Harris, 30, who dropped out of high school and ''rode the Internet wave,'' agreed, saying they were ''letting the universe take us for a ride.'' 
 They are not alone.
 Matt and Sara Janssen, who traded down from their house in Iowa to a studio apartment in Montana and finally an R.V. powered by vegetable oil, now crisscross the country with their 4-year-old daughter, highway nomads living on $1,500 a month. 
 Not that simplicity need be that spartan. Cindy Wallach and her husband, Doug Vibbert, of Annapolis, Md., moved out of their apartment with an ''everything must go'' party and, along with their 3-year-old son, now sail and make their home on a 44-by-24-foot catamaran.
 ''We never wanted four walls and beige carpet,'' Ms. Wallach said. 
 Though it may not be the stuff of the typical American dream, the voluntary simplicity movement, which traces its inception to 1980s Seattle, is drawing a great deal of renewed interest, some experts say.
 ''If you think about some of the shifts we're having economically -- shifts in oil and energy -- it may be the right time,'' said Mary E. Grigsby, associate professor of rural sociology at the University of Missouri and the author of ''Buying Time and Getting By: The Voluntary Simplicity Movement.'' 
 ''The idea in the movement was 'everything you own owns you,' '' said Dr. Grigsby, who sees roots of the philosophy in the lives of the Puritans. ''You have to care for it, store it. It becomes an appendage, I think. If it enhances your life and helps you do the things you want to do, great. If you are burdened by these things and they become the center of what you have to do to live, is that really positive?''
 Juliet B. Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College and author of ''The Overspent American,'' said the modern ''downshifters,'' as she called them, owed debts to the hippies and the travel romance of Jack Kerouac. 
 ''Their previous lives have become too stressful,'' Dr. Schor said. ''They have a lack of meaning because their jobs are too demanding.''
 Mrs. Harris, who with her husband home-schools their son, Quinn, 5, and plans to do the same with their 15-month-old daughter, Nichola, agreed that there was something of the hippies in their quest: ''the ideals, the peace and love, the giving and freedom.'' 
 But she said they had no tolerance for idleness or drugs. ''Any state that can be induced by drugs, the mind and body are already capable of,'' she said. 
 Mrs. Harris grew up in Wisconsin with her mother and sister. They were so poor, she says, that they nearly froze to death in the winter and had to cook their meals in the fireplace. She developed a weight problem, ballooning to 200 pounds -- she has since shed half of it -- and suffered for years from the chronic pain disorder fibromyalgia, which she overcame, she says, by improving her diet.
 In April, the Harrises began detailing their story on a blog (www.cagefreefamily.com). They were taken aback by some of the hostile responses. ''Some people seem to be threatened that they're not making the same choice,'' Mrs. Harris said.
 The timing was right, she said. They had been feuding with their landlord over conditions in the simple house they rent in Austin for $1,650 a month, and felt they had to get out. 
 At first they intended to auction what they owned. But ''we were unable to define the worth of something we didn't want or need,'' she said. They finally decided to donate much of it to a children's home in the Texas Hill Country and the bulk of the rest to an agency for the homeless in Austin.
 But, Mrs. Harris said, their calls for pickups have gone unreturned, and they are now rushing to find new recipients. ''You wouldn't think, O.K., I'm going to give away all my fine things, but at the end of the day they're still in the house,'' she said.
 Their rings -- his gold band and her one-carat diamond -- may be ''red-paper-clipped,'' Mrs. Harris said: bartered for something better that could in turn be bartered for something better still, as in the Internet celebrity Kyle MacDonald's tale of a paper clip that ultimately produced a house. 
 ''They don't fit us anymore,'' Mr. Harris said. Sure enough, his band was loose on his finger, but that was not what he meant. ''They don't fit our lifestyle,'' he explained.
 They have already given away some property, Mrs. Harris said, including their big-screen television, presented to a neighbor. It had bad karma anyway, she said: her father had gotten it as an employee of the year just before he was fired.
 Their goal, she said, is to retain one personal carton per family member, plus bedding and kitchen utensils. They hope to sell or barter their two vehicles -- a new Honda Odyssey minivan and a 2004 Dodge Intrepid -- for a school bus or a four-wheel drive. 
 They are exchanging e-mail with a woman who has a remote cabin available in central Vermont. There is no electricity, Mr. Harris said, just propane power and a wood stove. 
 ''We want to be in clean country with like-minded people with access to clean food,'' Mrs. Harris said.
 Mr. Harris does have a concern, though. He now telecommutes from his job as a Web systems administrator and is hoping to stay employed through the move. ''The question is, Do I have Internet access in the woods?'' he said. 
 They plan to travel first to Wyoming for the Rainbow Gathering, a free-spirited annual outdoor convocation, then head to Vermont. 
 In her garage strewn with cartons to be given away, Mrs. Harris shook her head. ''Stuff, stuff that a family has,'' she said.
 Then she noticed a box of Christmas decorations, and at least for the moment grew wistful. 
 ''I won't lie,'' she said. ''I'll cry when that goes.''
 ''When what goes?'' Quinn asked.
 Mrs. Harris seemed to struggle. ''The stuff of our lives,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In Siberia, Shopping Malls Are Sprouting All Over

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: NOVOSIBIRSK, Russia 

 BODY:
In this region of Siberia, long synonymous with gulags and hardship, shoppers mobbed an Ikea store last winter with the vigor of a miners' riot. They loaded their outsize yellow shopping carts with clothes, housewares, appliances and small furniture.
 The store and the surrounding Mega mall, opened last year on a bluff beside the Ob River, are expecting 12 million visitors in 2008 -- bursting with pent-up consumerism and oil rubles, unbothered by the economic uncertainty roiling much of the rest of the world.
 Siberia, where Russians waited in long lines to buy food with ration cards not long ago, is the improbable epicenter of a huge mall boom. As retail businesses shrink in the United States, provincial Russian towns like this one have become targets of retailers and shopping center developers from around the world. Malls in this area are even poaching managers from as far away as California.
 Across the great expanse of Russia -- on plots cleared of birch groves and decrepit factories, on the territory of old airports and collective farms -- big-box stores are rising at a rate of several a month. Russia is projected to open twice as much mall space as any other European country this year, and Europe will open more shopping centers this year than ever. 
 All that retail space is spawning a consumer culture in industrial towns that once had little of either.
 ''Your eyes open wide, there is so much to buy,'' Tatyana P. Salamatina, a retired engineer at one of the city's military factories, said in the food court of the Mega mall. ''You should carry a basket,'' instead of pushing a cart, she advised, because ''then you know by the weight when you have too much.''
 To be sure, malls are nothing new in Moscow, where money from oil and other industries has always pooled. Indeed, in Moscow and the surrounding region, 38 malls are scheduled to open before 2010. 
 What is new is the dispersion of wealth in the Russian provinces that have, for centuries, been poor. 
 The malling of Siberia is transforming the drab gray landscape on the outskirts of these cities into a tableau of Day-Glo green and purple outlets, and providing a slim ray of hope to retailers whose business is lagging elsewhere. 
 Russian retailing has become such an alluring business that Ernst & Young and KPMG highlighted the sector last month at an investor road show in London . 
 In a sign of how trickle-down petroleum money appeals to retailers, at a time of near-record oil prices, Russian developers were expected to open 4.6 million square meters, or 49 million square feet, of retail space in shopping centers in the second half of 2007 and 2008, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate company.
 That is more than double the new shopping center area planned in Poland, the European country with the second-largest pipeline of malls in development. 
 ''You have this incredible purchasing power in these cities retailers want to tap into,'' said Charles Slater, a partner working in the Russia office of Cushman & Wakefield, which advises mall developers headed to the Russian hinterlands. ''There is a race for land.'' That is another reason sparsely built Siberia is so popular. 
 Developers are turning to the 12 provincial cities in Russia with populations over one million, islands of prosperity with population inflows from rural migration and rising purchasing power, ripe for malls.
 This retail strategy is known here as the ''millions,'' and is embraced by leading Western retailers including Ikea and Auchan, the French food chain. 
 This approach has put Siberia, not a place often associated with shopping, on ''the center of the radar screen'' for mall developers, said Jeff Kershaw, a former manager of California malls, now a partner in Moscow with the real estate company CB Richard Ellis. 
 So promising was mall development in Russia that Ikea, a privately held company run by the Kamprad family in Sweden, has added a side business in mall development through its Mega franchise, using Ikea as an anchor tenant. 
 With growth elusive in their domestic markets, other Western retailers have eyes on Russia. 
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has considered expanding into Russia for years in spite of setbacks in its planned expansion in Germany, where it retreated in the face of local competition. 
 The company took another step toward Russia in April by hiring a German retail veteran, Stephan Fanderi, to study business opportunities in the former Soviet Union. 
 For Wal-Mart, the appeal of expanding into frontier markets, like Siberia, is obvious. Its international sales from stores in 14 countries outside the United States grew 17 percent in 2007, compared with 6 percent growth domestically. 
 Russia, ever competitive with the United States, is also neck-and-neck in a new measure of competition: mall size. 
 The Belaya Dacha Mega mall outside Moscow, developed by Ikea like the mall here in Novosibirsk, opened in 2004. It has 330,000 square meters, or 3.6 million square feet, of interior space, about the same size as the 3.5 million square feet of interior space at the United States' largest mall, the Mall of America, outside Minneapolis. That does not include the Mall of America's seven-acre amusement park.
 In some places in Russia, oversupply of mall space is already becoming a problem. 
 Kazan, a city on the Volga River, for example, has as much shopping space per capita as Paris, according to the Moscow office of CB Richard Ellis.
 Though pent-up demand for cars, cellphones and furniture is far from sated, this is still Siberia. The winters are long, the distances vast. And the history of the first Ikea store illustrates some enduring problems. 
 Dirk Hammerstein, the manager of the store in Novosibirsk, said Russian customers, many living with several generations crammed into tiny apartments, made a run on sofa beds in December. With the Siberian snow flurries falling ominously, it became a mighty test of his badly attenuated supply lines, stretching back along decrepit roads all the way to Moscow.
 The truck convoys he dispatched for new sofa beds covered 2,050 miles each way to Ikea's logistics center outside Moscow. He kept the store, the most remote in Ikea's worldwide chain, in stock, barely. 
 But sofa beds represent a new -- and in some ways, better -- kind of scarcity for Siberia. 
 In the fall of 1947, food was so scarce here that children were sent into the fields after the harvesters passed to glean wheat from the discarded straw, according to the city history museum. 
 And, as late as 1993, city authorities rationed food. Printed in cheery red, blue and yellow colors that belied the misery they symbolized, these little slips of paper entitled residents to buy fixed quantities of staples like sausage, sugar or flour. 
 One was marked simply ''animal butter.'' 
 Now the museum keeps a set of the cards from February 1992 under glass in an exhibition case.

HEADLINE: Poverty in Connecticut

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Down and Out in Connecticut'' (editorial, May 9):
 Connecticut's record on income inequality is indeed shameful. As one of the country's wealthiest states, Connecticut should be leading the way on creating pathways to opportunity and prosperity for all. 
 There have been bright spots. Connecticut's Legislature passed a bill in 2004 that set a goal of reducing child poverty by half, and state officials drafted a strong plan. But Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the Legislature have failed to follow through on its recommendations, like a state earned-income tax credit, and poverty has risen.
 Quality education, universal health care and increasing income and assets are the keys to reducing inequality. Leaders from business, communities and philanthropy must push for policies and actions that ensure that every person has a fair chance to realize his full potential. Success will follow when leaders inside and outside government join together with vision and a sense of urgency.
 James P. Horan Executive Director Connecticut Association for Human Services Hartford, May 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial tells the country what working-class and poor people in Connecticut have known for a long time: even in one of the richest states, people are suffering. 
 Worsening the gap is the lack of accessible and affordable health care. Even residents with health insurance understand that they are in jeopardy. Health care costs are hurting the economy, stunting job growth and forcing many small and large businesses to forgo expansion. And employers are passing on the high cost to their employees in the form of higher deductibles, premiums and co-payments. 
 The health care inequities in Connecticut are most striking among low-income residents and people of color. While Latinos are roughly 10 percent of the state's population, they constitute 40 percent of the uninsured. African-Americans are 9 percent of the population, but 16 percent of the state's uninsured. 
 Residents in this rich state are aware of these problems, and they are demanding universal health care.
 Our elected leaders need to wake up and respond, starting with the governor

HEADLINE: F. A. O. Schwarz Will Sell Toys in Macy's Stores

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Two of New York's most venerable retail brands, Macy's and F. A. O. Schwarz, are teaming up for a risky experiment: bringing toys back to the department store. 
 F. A. O. Schwarz will open shops inside 685 Macy's stores over the next two years, executives of the two retailers said Friday. It will be the first time in 20 years that Macy's has operated a year-round toy department. 
 The F. A. O. Schwarz shops, ranging from 200 square feet to 3,500 square feet, will carry a variety of F. A. O.-made products, many exclusive to Macy's. The first 275 shops will open this fall, in time for the holiday shopping season. 
 It is a bold move, given that the fiercely competitive toy market has previously plunged F. A. O. Schwarz into bankruptcy and forced Macy's to largely stop carrying toys. 
 But a 2007 experiment that put F. A. O. products inside Macy's State Street store in downtown Chicago, indicated that department store customers still have an appetite for toys. Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Macy's, said he hoped the new shops would ''drive store traffic, particularly to our children's departments.''
 The toy industry is now dominated by chains like Toys ''R'' Us, with broad selection, and big discount chains like Wal-Mart, with its low prices.
 Indeed, a toy price war in 2003 helped push F. A. O. Schwarz -- and a rival, KB Toys -- into bankruptcy reorganization and has left many department stores wary of the business. 
 Since it emerged from bankruptcy protection, F. A.O. Schwarz has tried to distance itself from competitors with distinct toys and experiences -- like a design-your-own Barbie station -- that its rivals do not have the space or resources to replicate. 
 Under the deal, Macy's will be the only American retailer to operate F. A. O. Schwarz departments. That makes the arrangement the latest in a string of exclusive deals for Macy's. 
 Macy's merger with May Department Stores in 2005 was intended to create a national chain with the size and influence to command dozens of such arrangements. 
 Since then, Macy's has signed exclusive distribution deals with Oscar de la Renta, Tommy Hilfiger and Martha Stewart, which the chain regularly trumpets in television commercials. 
 It is unclear how much the exclusive deals are helping Macy's business, which has been hurt by the economic slowdown and the merger with May, which alienated many customers. During the first three months of 2008, Macy's profit dropped $59 million and sales at stores open at least a year fell 2.6 percent.
 Exclusive deals, Mr. Lundgren said in a recent interview, ''are a big commitment -- it's a marriage. ''
 ''You shake your hand and all of a sudden the line does not look good the next season and you have to buy it,'' he added. ''The vendor is not going anywhere else.''

HEADLINE: A Victory for Equality and Justice

 BODY:
The California Supreme Court brought the United States a step closer to fulfilling its ideals of equality and justice with its momentous 4-to-3 ruling upholding the right of same-sex couples to marry. 
 The battle is far from over, even in California. Opponents of giving gay couples the respect, benefits, obligations and protections that come with marriage are already mobilizing to try to nullify the historic decision through a proposed state constitutional amendment likely to appear on the November ballot. All three presidential candidates oppose same-sex marriage, although the two Democrats at least support recognition of civil unions.
 Still, the California verdict was a major victory for civil rights. At issue in the case was a ban on same-sex marriage based on a law enacted in 1977 and a statewide initiative approved by voters in 2000. Both defined marriage as available only to a man and woman. 
 In striking down the ban for violating state constitutional provisions protecting equality and fundamental rights, the court's 121-page opinion fittingly drew on a 1948 decision in which California's high court removed the bar to interracial marriage 19 years before the United States Supreme Court followed suit.
 The new opinion found that ''the right of an individual to establish a legally recognized family with a person of one's choice'' is fundamental. The court said California's strong domestic partnership statute was not enough to solve the inequality problem.
 ''An individual's sexual orientation -- like a person's race or gender -- does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold rights,'' wrote Chief Justice Ronald George, first appointed to the bench by Gov. Ronald Reagan. 
 He noted that ''tradition alone'' did not justify the denial of a constitutional right to same-sex couples, any more than it did to interracial couples. Coming on the heels of John McCain's rant against so-called ''activist judges,'' the decision provides a refreshing example of a Republican-dominated state court transcending ideology and political pressures to render a scrupulously fair ruling based on law, precedents and common sense.
 It is unclear what impact this ruling will have on the presidential elections. Polls show the nation divided on the issue, and there remains considerable debate over how a similar decision by Massachusetts' high court affected the 2004 election. Same-sex marriage is the kind of issue that is likely to resonate with socially conservative voters. But neither of the Democratic candidates supports gay marriage, and voters this year seem far more focused on a shaky economy, a seemingly endless war and skyrocketing gas prices.
 What matters more than election tactics is that the California court's ruling stands, and that voters reject the ballot initiative. It is encouraging that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said he will uphold the ruling and oppose the antigay ballot measure.
 Since the presidential candidates' positions on gay marriage seem based more on tactics than principle, we do not expect them to shift ground. We would like to hear all of them support Mr. Schwarzenegger in opposing a constitutional amendment. Mr. McCain's reaction that he ''supports the right of the people of California'' rather than judges to decide the question was not encouraging.

HEADLINE: Courting N.R.A., McCain Criticizes Obama and Clinton on Gun Control

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain reached out to the National Rifle Association on Friday and warned 6,000 people at the group's annual convention that a President Barack Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton would put the rights of ''law-abiding'' gun owners at risk.
 In a speech in one of two states where political primaries are to be held on Tuesday, Mr. McCain mocked Mr. Obama before the gun lobbying group he has tangled with in the past, but whose endorsement he now needs to help shore up conservative support. 
 ''It seems every election, politicians who support restrictions on the Second Amendment dress up in camouflage and pose with guns to demonstrate they care about hunters,'' Mr. McCain said, ''even though few gun owners fall for such obvious political theater.'' 
 After Mr. Obama said last month that small-town voters ''cling'' to guns and religion because they are ''bitter'' over their economic circumstances, Mr. McCain recounted, Mrs. Clinton quickly affirmed her support for the Second Amendment right to bear arms. This, Mr. McCain said, drew the derisive comment from Mr. Obama that Mrs. Clinton was acting ''like she's on the duck blind every Sunday, packing a six-shooter.'' 
 Mr. McCain paused, then said to laughter, ''Someone should tell Senator Obama that ducks are usually hunted with shotguns.''
 Mr. McCain, who was received with warm but not wild applause, has not always been a favorite of the country's largest gun lobby, and was once branded by it as ''one of the premier flag-carriers for enemies of the Second Amendment.'' The gun lobby still disagrees with Mr. McCain because he favors background checks for firearm sales at gun shows and pushed through campaign finance regulations that restricted political advertising by groups like the N.R.A.
 But this week the N.R.A.'s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, told The Louisville Courier-Journal that there were ''vast numbers of areas'' in which Mr. McCain and the gun lobby agreed. In 1994, the senator voted against a ban on assault weapons because he considered it, as he told reporters on Friday, an ''encroachment'' on the Second Amendment. Last year Mr. McCain told The Associated Press, ''I strongly support the Second Amendment and I believe the Second Amendment ought to be preserved -- which means no gun control.''
 And this year, Mr. McCain was one of 55 senators to sign a brief urging the Supreme Court to declare the District of Columbia's strict gun-control law ''unconstitutional per se.'' The brief, a major new cause for the N.R.A., was not signed by Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama.
 In his speech, Mr. McCain acknowledged his differences with the N.R.A., but said they should not detract from his ''long record of support'' for the Second Amendment.
 ''For more than two decades, I've opposed efforts to ban guns, ban ammunition, ban magazines and dismiss gun owners as some kind of fringe group unwelcome in modern America,'' Mr. McCain told the group. ''The Second Amendment isn't some archaic custom that matters only to rural Americans, who find solace in firearms out of frustration with their economic circumstances. The Second Amendment is unique in the world. It guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms. To argue anything else is to reject the clear meaning of our founding fathers.''
 He added: ''The clear meaning of the Second Amendment has not stopped those who want to punish firearms owners, and those who make and sell firearms, for the actions of criminals. It seems like every time there is a particularly violent crime, the antigun activists demand yet another restriction on the Second Amendment.''
 At a town-hall-style meeting in Watertown, S.D., on Friday, Mr. Obama responded that he supported the Second Amendment, but that he believed in ''common-sense gun laws so that we don't have kids being shot on the streets of cities like Chicago.''
 The N.R.A.'s position, he added, is that ''any law related to gun ownership is a potential camel's nose under the tent, and that if we allow even, you know, the smallest concession, that somehow guns are going to be taken away from everybody.''
 Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton support limits on gun sales and extending the ban on assault weapons.
 Mr. McCain was preceded in the cavernous Kentucky Exposition Center on Friday by a long list of Republican speakers, including the former Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney; Karl Rove, the former top political aide in the Bush White House and now a commentator for Fox News; John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations; and Oliver L. North, the Reagan-era official who secretly sold weapons to Iran to support the anti-Marxist rebels of Nicaragua.
 Earlier on Friday, before Mr. McCain's appearance at the N.R.A. convention, Mr. McCain and a clutch of camera crews dropped in on the St. Albans Gun & Archery shop near Charleston, W.Va. But Mr. McCain avoided the guns. Instead, he and his wife, Cindy, looked for a scale to weigh catfish -- the shop did not have one -- and bought a $40 fishing rod, plus bobbers, hooks, sinkers and bait.
 It was unclear why Mr. McCain drew a line at walking down the aisle of rifles at the shop, although such a stroll would have generated endless loops on cable news. On his campaign bus Friday morning, Mr. McCain told reporters that he did not own a gun, although he carried a pistol as a Navy pilot.
 After the stop at the gun shop, Mr. McCain's traveling press secretary, Brooke Buchanan, said that Mr. McCain would use his new fishing rod on the artificial lake at his 10-acre Arizona spread in Sedona.

 The United States is being confronted with the limits of its clout in dealing with a Myanmar junta that human rights advocates say is putting its own survival before that of a storm-ravaged population. The junta still insists that it can handle relief operations on its own, and is rebuffing calls to open its borders to aid and offers to transport aid directly to the affected areas. PAGE A5

''I imagine there's some horror fantasy fusion: the well-off Park Sloper and co-op member who is obsessed with his kids,'' one neighborhood writer said. ''Oh, wait, I just described myself.'' PAGE 1

HEADLINE: As Gas Prices Rise, the City Gets Its Share, Too

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; David Giambusso contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With gasoline prices hitting new records daily, oil companies are not the only ones raking it in. New York City is profiting, too.
 The city's 4 percent sales tax on motor fuel sold brought in $26.4 million in December, January and February, or 8.6 percent more than the same period the year before. (Figures for March and April, when gas prices rose even higher, are not yet available.) In all of 2007, the city collected $105 million, a 7 percent increase from $98 million in 2006, which was 25 percent more than the $79 million in gas taxes from 2005. 
 The 4 percent city tax is one of eight surcharges on gas sold in the city, where prices hit a record average high of $4.03 a gallon on Friday. But all of the other taxes are fixed, cents-per-gallon rates rather than percentages, so they do not change with gas prices. The city's motor-fuel tax receipts, however, grow as prices rise, creating an unexpected -- if small -- bright spot in the city's otherwise dimming fiscal picture. 
 Some politicians have seized on the tax as a way to potentially give drivers relief from escalating prices at the pump, suggesting that percentage-based taxes be abandoned in favor of a fixed charge on each gallon. ''The city shouldn't be entitled to this huge windfall every time the price of gas goes up,'' Tony Avella, a city councilman from Queens who plans to run for mayor next year, said this week. ''What's happening is people who have to drive have to drive, and it's hitting them in the pocketbook.''
 Most states charge a flat gas tax rather than a percentage, but the picture is widely varied for cities and counties. 
 Mr. Avella's proposal comes as lawmakers across the country, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, call for gas-tax holidays during the summer travel season. Republican state senators in Albany, noting that New York has the nation's third-highest motor-fuel taxes, want to suspend three state gas taxes, amounting to about 32 cents a gallon, from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
 The idea of switching from a percentage-rate tax to a flat fee on each gallon is not new: Two years ago, a law change invited counties in New York to do just that and cap their sales taxes on motor fuel at 8 cents a gallon. Fourteen counties -- but not New York City -- made the switch, to ease the burden on consumers.
 But several of those counties found the change fell short of its promise. Prices at the pump barely budged, while tax receipts fell. Some county officials accused oil companies of soaking up the tax breaks that were meant to benefit drivers. Half of the 14 counties have reinstituted percent-based taxes.
 ''You're kidding yourself if you think that an industry that makes as much as it can will pass along the savings to the public,'' Michael F. Conners II, the comptroller in Albany County, which abandoned its flat-fee tax after six months. ''The oil companies say they would never take this tax away, but it's absorbed into the price.''
 Mr. Conners said that his county would have lost $4.6 million in taxes had it kept its cap in place for a full year. That would have amounted to 3.4 percent of the county's total receipts from all sales, property and other taxes. ''This was not help for the driving public,'' he added, ''but a transfer gift to the oil industry.''
 Next month, Onondaga County will scrap its flat tax and return to the percentage system. A study by the budget office compared gas prices in Syracuse, which is in Onondaga County, to those in Buffalo and Rochester, whose counties did not change their formulas, and found Syracuse stations consistently charged 2 to 5 cents less before and after Onondaga switched systems. So Onondaga stood to lose an estimated $10.3 million a year in taxes without saving drivers any money at the pump.
 ''The bulk of our budget is funded on property taxes, which have been escalating and strangulating people,'' said Benjamin T. Dublin, the director of intergovernmental relations in the Onondaga County executive's office. ''If we got the $10 million, we wouldn't have to tax them as much.''
 The experiences in these counties have only bolstered Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's resistance to changing New York City's gas taxes to a flat fee. Speaking to reporters earlier this month, Mr. Bloomberg said a gas-tax holiday was ''about the dumbest thing I've heard in an awful long time from an economic point of view.'' 
 He added, ''We're trying to discourage people from driving, and we're trying to end our energy dependence.''
 A spokesman for the mayor, John Gallagher, said that the extra money being pocketed by the city in gas taxes as prices go up is not nearly enough to offset the slowdown in revenue from commercial real-estate transactions and profits on Wall Street. ''Any characterization that this is a windfall is misleading,'' he said.
 While a precise correlation is impossible to calculate, because of fluctuating patterns in gas purchases among other factors, the 8.6 percent increase in tax receipts this winter compared to last winter is dwarfed by the estimated 31 percent jump in gas prices in the city over the same period. Part of that is probably because higher prices lead people to buy less gas, especially in a city where public transit is a viable option: A 75-cent-a-gallon tax the city charges on behalf of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority amounted to $4.5 million over the December-February period this year, 15.4 percent less than the same three months the year before.
 Each gallon of gas sold in New York actually includes eight different taxes. In addition to the city's 4 percent sales tax, and the transportation authority surcharge, there is a federal excise tax of 18.4 cents. The state also collects an 8-cent excise tax, an 8-cent sales tax and a petroleum business tax of 16.4 cents a gallon.
 In addition, drivers pay a ''spill tax'' of 0.3 cents a gallon for environmental preservation and a petroleum testing fee of 0.05 cents.
 Drivers in New York welcomed the idea of a flat gas tax.
 ''Of course it's a good idea, come on,'' said Dogan Soylemez, 32, who spends $600 a week filling up his Mister Softee truck, which was parked one afternoon this week near an On the Run gas station at Fort Hamilton Parkway and McDonald Avenue in Brooklyn where regular unleaded was $4.07 a gallon. ''They have to explain to the people why they have to sell at that price.''

HEADLINE: With Chavez In Check, Talks in Peru Stay Calm

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru 

 BODY:
To the relief of organizers of a summit meeting here of leaders from Latin America and Europe on Friday, the encounter was notable for being relatively free of insults being flung publicly. 
 No chancellor was accused of being a fascist. No president called another a lap dog of the United States. No king told a president to shut up. (Actually no kings were even in attendance.)
 For achieving such an incident-free meeting, Peru's hosts had primarily President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela to thank. Surprising many people here, he was on his best behavior, almost.
 Mr. Chavez hugged a former enemy, President Alan Garcia of Peru, whom he once called ''a crook, a liar, a manipulator and an irresponsible man.'' He sought to mend ties with Spain, speaking warmly with Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain; relations soured last November when King Juan Carlos asked Mr. Chavez to shut up at a summit meeting in Chile.
 Mr. Chavez even apologized to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. A few days ago he had accused her party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union, of sharing the ideas of Hitler.
 ''I apologize to you,'' Mr. Chavez told Ms. Merkel, after cozying up to her and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina during a break, according to news reports. ''I'm doing this in front of Cristina because every time I behave badly, she's the one who pulls my ears.''
 Mrs. Merkel smiled widely after her chat with Mr. Chavez, reflecting the relief here after he had said he would be traveling to Lima with his ''usual furor.''
 An alternative meeting held by leftist groups at the campus of the National Engineering University was more colorful than the meeting of the heads of state. It featured guitar sing-alongs, plates of coca leaves (for chewing) and a soccer match with President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who called a ban on high-altitude competitions a form of ''apartheid'' against Bolivian teams.
 At the official gathering, the heads of state culminated their meeting by drafting a document pointing to the importance of economic growth, and of combating climate change and rising food prices. On the edge of these talks, Mr. Chavez remained cordial -- until reporters asked him about President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, an ally of the United States with whom Venezuela has been feuding. ''One of the great problems we have is the government of Colombia,'' Mr. Chavez said, his smile melting away. 
 Mr. Uribe had his own harsh words for Mr. Chavez. ''The only thing we ask is for no one to shelter terrorists,'' he said, a reference to Colombia's assertion that Venezuela had assisted the largest guerrilla group in Colombia.

HEADLINE: Paulson Sees Turn In Economy

BYLINE: By MIKE NIZZA

 BODY:
The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., delivered a guardedly optimistic message to business leaders on Friday, saying that the economy was moving toward a rebound after months of malaise. 
 ''We are still working through housing and capital markets issues, and expect to be doing so for some time,'' he said in remarks at a conference sponsored by The Washington Post. ''We also expect to see a faster pace of economic growth before the end of the year.''
 Playing an important role, he said, would be roughly $100 billion in stimulus payments to Americans over the next few months.
 ''The fiscal stimulus will provide support to the economy as we weather the housing correction, capital markets turmoil, and higher energy and food prices,'' he said. 
 Another important factor, he added, was a less rambunctious Wall Street. ''The markets are considerably calmer now than they were in March,'' he said.
 Mr. Paulson also stressed that risks remained, albeit weaker ones. 
 ''Some bumps in the road'' are likely, especially in the housing sector, he said, but ''we are closer to the end of the market turmoil than the beginning.'' 
 Hours before his remarks, analysts debated the importance of housing figures from April. 
 New-home construction increased 8.2 percent last month, offering signs of life in a deeply troubled sector, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. But most of the gain came in multifamily housing, masking further bad news on single-family homes, whose groundbreakings dropped to a 17-year low.
 Housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 million. Construction of multifamily units surged 36 percent, compared with a 35 percent drop in March, a huge swing -- and an average one in recent months, the agency said in a report.
 While building permits were up 4 percent in both areas, ground was broken on 1.7 percent fewer single-family homes in April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000 from 704,000.
 There were varied reactions to the new figures, with one analyst telling Reuters that ''it's a nice upside surprise'' and another telling Bloomberg News that the trends remained ''horrific.'' 
 Michael T. Darda, of MKM Partners, said, ''The bump in starts owes entirely to multifamily dwellings.'' While the single-family figure was bad news, he also said it indicated that the builders were ''rapidly taking supply off the market, which ultimately will lay the foundation for stabilization in the sector.''
 The month-to-month figures may have been mixed, but the year-to-year comparisons left no doubt that housing was far from a full recovery. Overall housing starts plunged 30.6 percent compared with those in the month a year earlier, and permits sank by 34.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Saudis Offer Little in Response to Bush Plea for More Oil Production

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
President Bush used a private visit to King Abdullah's ranch here on Friday to make another appeal for an increase in oil production that might give American consumers some relief at the gasoline pump. The Saudis responded by announcing they had decided a week ago on a modest increase of 300,000 barrels a day.
 The White House said the increase would not be enough to lower gasoline prices, which are nearing $4 a gallon, and industry analysts called it mostly symbolic. 
 But Mr. Bush's request, his second in five months, coupled with rising anti-Saudi sentiment in the Democratic-led Congress, underscored the growing tensions between the countries over oil. The issue is also dominating the domestic agenda in Washington, where the Energy Department said Friday it was suspending shipments of oil to the strategic petroleum reserve.
 Mr. Bush's visit here was, in many respects, a reprise of a trip he made to the king's ranch in January, when he asked for an increase in production and was rebuffed publicly by the oil minister and privately by the king. This time, the Saudis again resisted Mr. Bush, while offering at least the appearance of a concession.
 The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told reporters that the kingdom had decided on May 10 to increase production, not in response to Mr. Bush but because customers, mostly in the United States, had asked for it. He said that over the last few months, as supplies from other countries had declined, the Saudis had filled in the gap.
 ''When supplies from Venezuela and Mexico were reduced to the U.S., who supplied the difference?'' Mr. Naimi said. ''We supplied, to the tune of an additional 300,000 barrels per day, from 1.4 to 1.7 million barrels per day, for our customers in the U.S. So how much more can we do?''
 Both Mr. Naimi and Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said the Saudis had held fast to their longstanding position that they were willing to pump more oil, but only if refineries wanted to buy more. Mr. Naimi said the current supply was meeting demand.
 Even so, Mr. Hadley said he had a sense that officials in the kingdom were concerned about sentiment in the United States.
 ''They are sensitive to the economic health of their customers,'' Mr. Hadley said. ''And they are also sensitive to, and aware of, I'm sure, about the unhappiness that is generated in the United States among the American people and in the Congress about these high oil prices.''
 The White House billed the visit on Friday as a way to celebrate 75 years of United States-Saudi relations, but that relationship, while strong under past presidents, especially Mr. Bush's father, has grown strained under this president.
 Mr. Hadley told reporters recently that ''the Iraq war was a stress'' on the relationship. Jon Alterman, a Mideast expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Saudi confidence in the United States has been ''extremely shaken,'' over the war as well as what Saudis perceive as Mr. Bush's lackluster effort on behalf of the rights of Palestinians.
 ''They'll be polite,'' Mr. Alterman said, ''but they're not really going to put themselves out to help this president.''
 Still, Mr. Bush had little choice but to try. In Washington, Congress voted this week to order the Bush administration to stop depositing oil in the national reserve. The White House initially opposed the move but then said it would comply, prompting the Energy Department's announcement on Friday.
 Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to use the issue to political advantage. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, for instance, is pressing to limit arms sales to the kingdom. In a statement on Friday, he asserted the Saudis have ''the ability to increase production capacity by two million barrels a day right now,'' and said an increase in production of one million barrels would reduce the price of gasoline by 60 cents per gallon.
 The Saudi government has long argued that high prices have been caused by a myriad of factors outside of their control, including a weak dollar and strong growth in demand from Asia, but not by a lack of oil in the market. Mr. Naimi reiterated that argument Friday, saying ''supply and demand are in balance today.''
 But the overall picture has become more clouded in recent weeks as oil prices have risen quickly, and energy experts say that the Saudis are starting to worry that high prices will end up crimping demand. 
 ''This is a recognition that there is a confluence of interest here, both on the producer side and on the consumer side,'' said Frank A. Verrastro, director of the Energy and National Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The Saudis are concerned that these higher prices might be leading to some demand destruction.'' 
 The International Energy Agency, which advises industrial countries, recently reduced its estimates for oil demand growth this year, with consumption expected to fall in the United States, Europe and Japan. But demand should still rise by one million barrels a day thanks to growth in China and the Middle East.
 Global supplies have suffered from a series of shortfalls this year, including a strike by oil workers in Nigeria that reduced production there by nearly one million barrels a day, and shortfalls in Mexico's output, which is suffering from a lack of investment. 
 But analysts doubted whether the modest increase in Saudi production would make any difference. 
 ''It's puzzling,'' said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consulting group in Washington. ''This might bring a little bit of relief in the very short term, but I don't think it will have any meaningful impact. I don't see many American refiners clamoring for oil right now.''

HEADLINE: A Subdued Clinton, and a Subdued Audience, on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: JUNCTION CITY, Ore. 

 BODY:
On the day Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was endorsed by the governor of North Carolina, a supporter gave her a three-foot-long balloon replica of herself, complete with blond hair, black pantsuit and wide pink smile, which Mrs. Clinton promptly took on her plane and laughingly showed off to reporters. 
 On Thursday, little more than two weeks later, the doll lay on the sofa by her seat on the plane, shriveled and deflated. 
 With her candidacy running out of time -- and perhaps air -- the Clinton campaign has taken on a distinctly subdued mood.
 Mrs. Clinton found herself largely ignored on Friday while a battle raged between Senator Barack Obama on one hand and Senator John McCain and President Bush on the other.
 And despite coming off a large victory in West Virginia, and anticipating success in Kentucky on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton's campaign in recent days has encountered a series of disappointments, not the least of which was the endorsement of Mr. Obama by the influential women's group Naral Pro-Choice America.
 Famous for her 16-hour days, her unflagging energy and her willingness to shout into a microphone until her voice gives out, Mrs. Clinton finds herself encountering long odds and a dwindling bank account. (David Letterman recently joked that with her campaign $21 million in debt, she is at ''the world's most expensive fantasy camp.'') And the new tone is palpable.
 ''I'm so grateful to all of you for letting us have this conversation,'' Mrs. Clinton said softly at an afternoon event, speaking to a group in which reporters outnumbered supporters by at least 3 to 1. 
 ''When you have just the big events with the rallies and all the rah-rah and all the speeches and the lights and everything,'' she said, ''it doesn't mean as much to many people as to be included and actually hear the stories and the concerns that everybody has.'' 
 It has always been difficult for Mrs. Clinton to compete against an opponent who once received thunderous applause for blowing his nose. But as Mr. Obama seized nearly every headline in the last several days, Mrs. Clinton appeared zapped of her usual enthusiasm. 
 The small crowd she attracted in rural South Dakota on Thursday was quiet and polite, with none of the exuberance that usually greets Mrs. Clinton at her campaign stops. (A campaign aide suggested it could have been due to the cultural mores of South Dakotans.) 
 In Oregon on Friday, her first event, staged in a house in a quiet residential neighborhood, was described as a round-table discussion on the economy. Mrs. Clinton, surrounded by six people at a dining-room table, frequently drifted back to telling stories of economic woe and despair. 
 She told the story of a couple she met in Ohio who faithfully mailed in their mortgage check every month, only to have their home taken away from them in a home-foreclosure scam.
 Mentioning the federal government, Mrs. Clinton said, ''There's such a sense of paralysis.''
 ''Here we are, the greatest nation in the world, the greatest problem solvers, but we're not solving our problems,'' she said. 
 Largely absent from her swing through South Dakota and Oregon, two of the four states (plus Puerto Rico) that have yet to hold primaries, was any mention of her opponent. On Thursday, she mentioned Mr. Obama only when she defended him from Mr. Bush's remarks that implicitly compared him to appeasers of Nazis. 
 The Clinton campaign began running three more television advertisements on Friday in Oregon and Kentucky, none of which criticized Mr. Obama directly. An aide said that in the coming days, Mrs. Clinton planned to focus on the economy and avoid directly criticizing Mr. Obama. 
 She cut short what was scheduled to be a two-day visit to Oregon, where Mr. Obama is expected to win, deciding instead to fly to Kentucky late on Friday. She will spend four days there, make an election-night speech on Tuesday and then return to Washington later that day. 
 With an eye to her financial situation, Mrs. Clinton squeezed in a visit to Los Angeles on Thursday night to appear at two fund-raisers, which brought in $400,000. 
 Late Friday, Mrs. Clinton stopped by her campaign office in Salem, Ore., to thank a group of excited volunteers, shaking hands and eating cannoli. 
 ''I don't really get the point of her carrying on,'' said Tim Ledford, 29, a store clerk who had wandered upstairs to catch a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton. ''If it's done, it's done.''

HEADLINE: Hard Roads Ahead

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Walt Disney would have been proud of John McCain's presentation on Thursday of what the world might look like at the end of a first McCain term as president.
 Listening to the speech was like walking through the gates of Fantasyland, which Disney always said was the happiest kingdom of them all. The war in Iraq will have been won. Crack intelligence work will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden. Taxes will be lower and the U.S. economy will be swell. And maybe best of all (I'm not sure for whom), work will have begun on 20 brand-new nuclear reactors. 
 Senator McCain never bothered to mention how we were to reach this wondrous state, and he bristled when a reporter suggested he was offering a ''magic carpet ride.'' 
 Elisabeth Bumiller of The Times had the best line when she wrote in Friday's paper that ''there were no real checkable facts in Mr. McCain's divination.''
 On the same day that the senator unveiled his candy-coated vision, a former governor of West Virginia, Bob Wise, came by my office to talk about a much more prosaic matter -- the terrible job that the nation is doing in getting its high school kids ready for the real world.
 At a time when the nation is faced with tough economic challenges at home and ever-increasing competition from abroad, it's incredible that more is not being done about the poor performance of so many American high schools.
 We can't even keep the kids in school. A third of them drop out. Half of those who remain go on to graduate without the skills for college or a decent job. Someone please tell me how this is a good thing.
 Mr. Wise is president of the Alliance for Excellent Education, a policy and advocacy group committed to improving the high schools. The following lamentable passage is from his book, ''Raising the Grade: How High School Reform Can Save Our Youth and Our Nation'':
 ''International comparisons rank the United States a stunningly unimpressive eighteenth for high school graduation rates, a lackluster ranking of fifteenth for high school reading assessments among 15-year-olds in developed countries, and an embarrassing 25th for high school math.''
 Those are not the marks of a society with a blissful future. Four years of college is becoming a prerequisite for a middle-class quality of life and we're having trouble graduating kids from high school.
 Mr. Wise believes (as does Bill Gates) that America's high schools are for the most part obsolete, inherently ill equipped to meet the needs of 21st-century students. The system needs to be remade, reinvented.
 ''It's not that our system is getting worse,'' he said. ''It's that other countries are coming on harder and faster.''
 More than ever, high schools need to be a conveyor belt to college. In 1995, the United States was second in the world (behind New Zealand) in its four-year college graduation rate. ''We've actually increased the percentage from that time,'' said Mr. Wise. ''The difference is we've gone from being second in the world to 15th because others have come on so strong.''
 The chief executive of AT&T, Randall Stephenson, said his company, based in San Antonio, has had trouble finding enough skilled workers to handle 5,000 customer-service jobs he had promised to bring back from overseas. A month ago, the AT&T Foundation announced that it was sponsoring a $100 million initiative to address the high school dropout problem and improve the readiness of American teenagers for college and the real world of work.
 Said Mr. Stephenson: ''We have an issue of education quality in this country right now. ... We're not giving our children or our young people all the opportunities they need to succeed.''
 The role of the federal government in improving secondary education should be one of the major issues in the presidential campaign, but it's not. The U.S. has stopped dealing honestly with difficult and complex problems. Politicians (and not just John McCain, by any means) spin fantasies of a wondrous, cost-free future. No investment and no sacrifice necessary.
 Our high schools are a perfect fit for that kind of backward, self-defeating approach to matters of extreme national importance.
 An issue that is front and center in the campaign is the economy. We're looking for ways to turn things around for the short and long term. One of the answers in this technologically advanced, highly competitive, increasingly globalized environment is staring us right in the eyes.
 As Mr. Wise put it, ''The best economic stimulus package is a diploma.''

HEADLINE: Places to Go, But Dreading The Fill-Up

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY. 
M. P. Dunleavey is the author of ''Money Can Buy Happiness'' (Broadway Books, 2007).

 BODY:
SOMETIME in the last couple of months, the price of gasoline crossed a line. It's not just that gas is now hovering around the dreaded $4 a gallon. It's that an unconscious expense has become a painfully conscious one.
 A year ago, the cost of gas was still a small enough portion of overall expenses that it didn't provoke constant comparisons to everything else in life. 
 Now gas prices have become the elephant in the middle of countless conversations. A tank costs roughly as much as the phone bill -- or a pair of shoes. For what you spend on gas each month, you could buy a new dishwasher or get a cheap weekend package to the Caribbean. Some day, the gas legends of '08 will live on like the myths of Paul Bunyan. ''I remember when gas got so high, you could have built a 17-room mansion from the ground up!''
 Actually, where I live in Delaware County, a rural area overlapping the Catskills that lies about three hours from New York City, the mood is anything but light. We are dependent on our cars here. Most of the county's 42,000-odd residents are scattered among a few dozen tiny towns and villages, with at least 10 or 15 miles between them. 
 Until recently, most people thought nothing of zipping 45 minutes down the road to take advantage of better shopping opportunities in the bigger towns. Now those basic routines are stretching people's budgets. For us to go to the nearest mall costs $16 round trip.
 ''You don't just get in the car anymore,'' said Laura O'Connor, who works in a kitchen goods store in Margaretville, but lives about 20 miles from there in Andes. ''If I have errands to run, I try to make a giant loop and do everything in one day,'' she said. ''Most of us are carpooling, too.''
 But with prices rising so rapidly, the usual ways of economizing aren't enough to keep gas costs down. In the Catskills, you can't just switch to mass transit.
 Steve Yaekel, who owns the Margaretville Liquor Store (yes, in Margaretville), said he was driving home to Roxbury, about 20 miles away, one night recently. When he passed a local gas station, he was too tired to refill his tank. ''I saw that it was about $3.74, and I decided I'd fill up in the morning,'' he said. 
 The next morning, he said, the price had spiked to $3.82. ''With prices going up this fast, how are you supposed to adjust the family budget?'' he asked, noting that it now costs $50 for just half a tank of gas for his truck.
 Many small-business men here depend on trucks or vans that get very low gas mileage. Allen Taylor, an appliance repairman based in Delhi, travels as much as 170 miles a day for work and says that he spends about $800 a month on gas.
 Mr. Taylor says he was appalled when his accountant told him, ''I had to increase my basic service charge from $60 to $65 just to break even,'' Mr. Taylor said. That was in 2007. With gas costs pinching his customers so much, Mr. Taylor says he is reluctant to raise his prices. ''I'm worried with the way the gas is going now, it's going to put small-business owners like me out of business,'' he said. ''There's only so much we can charge, only so much people will pay.''
 GAS has become a preoccupation for many people who own second homes in the region, a large number of whom live in New York City. Michael and Lily Idov said their old car consumed about 15 gallons to travel 300 miles round trip from their home in Brooklyn to their house in Andes. They recently bought a Mini Cooper, which gets about 40 miles per gallon, Mr. Idov said. Fuel economy was their chief concern. ''Now we go both ways on just two-thirds of a 10-gallon tank.''
 In the category of unintended but happier consequences, the backlash against driving may bolster some parts of the local economy.
 ''We can't believe how much business we're getting,'' said Helen Voultepsis, who works at Ace Hardware in Delhi and believes that people are less inclined to drive 40 miles to the nearest Lowe's or Home Depot. ''Local businesses are definitely benefiting.''

HEADLINE: Lowest Reading Since 1980 For Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: BYREUTERS

 BODY:
The confidence of American consumers tumbled to a 28-year low this month as rising prices strained household finances.
 The data on Friday also showed that consumers' short-term inflation expectations hit a 26-year high, fueling worries that the United States could be entering a period of stagflation like the late 1970s and early 1980s, characterized by a sluggish economy and accelerated price growth. 
 ''The Fed has continuously said they want to contain inflation expectations -- and they are not contained,'' said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial in Princeton, N.J.
 He added, ''The Fed is going to have to address inflation expectations in some manner, whether they talk it down or they force it down, possibly by taking away the aggressive rate cuts over the last year.''
 The data, from the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer confidence, highlighted the threat to economic growth, dropping to 59.5 in May -- the lowest level since June 1980.
 This is bad news for the United States, where consumers fuel two-thirds of national economic activity through their purchases of goods and services.
 ''Consumer confidence continued to slip in early May due to surging food and fuel prices,'' a statement from the Reuters/University of Michigan group said. ''Record numbers of consumers viewed the economy in recession and saw little hope of recovery anytime soon.''
 Meanwhile, the report's gauge of one-year inflation expectations surged to 5.2 percent -- the highest since February 1982 -- from 4.8 percent in April.
 Also worrying for policy makers at the Federal Reserve, five-year inflation expectations were the highest since August 1996, edging up to 3.3 percent from April's 3.2 percent.
 The inflation measures challenge the Fed's view that soaring commodity prices had not yet led to an increase in long-term expectations for price growth.

HEADLINE: A Fast-Fading Sway: The Nation's Leader, But Not His Party's

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush is not irrelevant. Presidents never are. But with eight months left in office, his ability to shape the country's legislative and political agenda has diminished more quickly than his aides and allies expected -- or at least hoped -- only weeks ago.
 This week's near revolt by Republicans on Capitol Hill, who broke with the president on two bills, punctuated a new political reality that will almost certainly hobble him to the last day of his presidency, Jan. 20. 
 The Republican bulwark that since 2007 has been Mr. Bush's strongest defense against a Democratic-controlled Congress, providing him the votes to sustain eight of nine vetoes, has cracked, though not crumbled. 
 Reeling from the third special-election defeat in the House this year, some Republicans have even begun calling on the party to distance itself from Mr. Bush. 
 Saddled with an ailing economy, an unpopular war and the lowest presidential approval ratings since those of Harry S. Truman, Mr. Bush has ceased to be the party's leader, even if he remains the country's. 
 ''A Congressional G.O.P. brand tied to George Bush is struggling,'' Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, a former leader of the party's Congressional campaign committee, wrote in a blisteringly frank memorandum to his colleagues released on Wednesday. (Mr. Davis equated the brand with dog food.)
 All the while, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, has been busily distancing himself from Mr. Bush on the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, on climate change and on a vision, if not a timetable exactly, for withdrawing from Iraq.
 ''If you're running for re-election,'' Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary, said of Republican lawmakers, ''you're scared.''
 Asked what Mr. Bush could do now to help the Republican Party, Mr. Fleischer paused and said, ''Osama bin Laden gets captured on his watch.''
 Mr. Bush does not yet face a mass defection in Congress, and Republicans have stood beside him on the issues the White House considers most important, foremost among them the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 Still, Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge a changing political landscape, especially on Capitol Hill. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has blocked his top legislative priority, a free-trade agreement with Colombia.
 In fact, most of the nearly two dozen legislative initiatives that Mr. Bush mentioned in his State of the Union address in January, already a modest agenda befitting a weakened president's last year in office, remain stalled and may never pass. Among them are a permanent extension of his signature tax cuts and a renewal of the No Child Left Behind education law.
 ''We can influence the legislation, but the leadership decides to move,'' said Keith B. Hennessey, Mr. Bush's assistant on economic policy, referring to Ms. Pelosi and the Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid. ''We wish they were doing more.''
 A new problem, from the White House perspective, is that Congressional Democrats are doing too much, increasingly with Republican help. 
 On Tuesday, the House and the Senate voted overwhelmingly to stop pumping oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the hope of easing soaring gasoline prices, an issue facing practically every American. The administration opposed the measure as meaningless but had to relent in the face of Republican support. 
 The same day, Mr. Bush issued a statement deriding a $307 billion farm bill that would continue subsidies for farmers and spend more on food stamps and food banks. The House promptly approved the bill anyway, with 100 Republicans joining the Democrats. The Senate followed a day later, clearing the way for only the second overriding of a veto in Mr. Bush's presidency. The first was on a $23 billion bill last November authorizing popular projects like dams and levees across the country.
 Mr. Bush's aides privately explain these as unsurprising reactions by lawmakers worried about ''kitchen table'' issues in what for most is an election year. But the votes showed how much Mr. Bush's efforts to shape his domestic legacy -- by vetoing spending bills, by opposing government intervention in the markets -- were increasingly at odds with Republican positions in Congress. 
 In such a climate, Republicans could break with Mr. Bush and provide new educational benefits for veterans, a politically attractive proposal by the Democrats. Some could even rethink their opposition to an expansion of children's health insurance, which Mr. Bush blocked last year, calling it expensive overreaching by government. Republicans are also seeking a deal with Democrats on legislation to address the mortgage crisis, despite White House reservations about bailing out mortgage holders. 
 ''You have to hand it to Barney Frank,'' Mr. Davis wrote in his memorandum, referring to the Democratic representative from Massachusetts, who has led negotiations on the House side. ''He produced a bill that gives homeowners hope. Never mind that it puts the government on the hook for $300 billion in loan guarantees and doesn't solve the problem. What is our reaction? Our leaders walk out of a White House/G.O.P. conference with the president and vow to uphold a veto!''
 To be fair, the Democrats have not delivered significantly on their own legislative agenda. Still, sensing a shift in momentum ahead of November, they sound satisfied with the Republican disarray.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic conference, said Mr. Bush's unwillingness to compromise with Democrats, as happened in January with the $160 billion economic stimulus package, was driving a wedge through the Republican Party. 
 ''In '88, facing a Democratic Congress, Reagan got immigration reform, welfare reforms and arms control, and Vice President George H. W. Bush became the next president,'' Mr. Emanuel said, calling attention to what he portrayed as President Ronald Reagan's more conciliatory approach. As for the current president, Mr. Emanuel said, ''I'm at a total loss about why he's pursuing a strategy to go down in a blaze of vetoes.''
 The president's aides counter that Mr. Bush continues to wield considerable influence and, more significant, retains executive powers. The latter were evident in Friday's announcement by Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters about steps to ease air-traffic congestion. 
 But Mr. Bush's influence appears to be waning even on matters of foreign policy, often a refuge for presidents in the twilight of their terms. As the president headed to Israel this week, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the prospects for a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians ''might be improbable, but it's not impossible.'' 
 Such language is a faint echo of the bold promise of peace Mr. Bush spoke of in November at an international conference in Annapolis, Md.
 Still, he relished the applause of at least some lawmakers this week, those in the Israeli Parliament.

HEADLINE: McCain's Superfuture

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
John McCain gave a speech this week describing what the world would look like after his first term in office.
 It looked great! The terrorists are on the run, Iraq is a ''functioning democracy,'' and back home the economy is terrific, thanks to a combination of business tax cuts and savings gleaned from eliminating useless government programs. For average citizens, the tax code has been made so simple and undemanding that filling out I.R.S. forms would probably become an enjoyable family activity, like miniature golf.
 It was a little like those old Victorian novels in which the hero visits the future and discovers that by 2000, America has become perfect. Not only have wars and poverty been wiped out, houses have self-washing windows and everyone gets free tickets to great sporting events and concerts, for which good seats are always available at the last minute. 
 The most intriguing part of the McCain vision is the League of Democracies. This is his plan for a planetary alliance of economically powerful, democratically governed nations whose leaders would work together to protect human rights and combat terrorism. The proper policy response, no doubt, is: what about the United Nations? But all I really want to know is: will there be uniforms?
 Jan. 1, 2013: President McCain celebrated the multitudinous achievements of his first four years in office with special friends in the White House. The tiny American contingent of troops still stationed in Iraq joined the festivities by satellite from a golf course in Baghdad, where they have been spending their time since the war was won.
 Members of the League of Democracies opened the New Year's ceremony with their pledge to ''fight a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the small-d-democratic way.'' Wearing their colorful terrorism-fighting costumes were French President Nicolas Sarkozy, now better known to the planet by his nom de guerre of Pate Man, and Germany's green-haired Angela (EcoGirl) Merkel, accompanied as always by her sidekick, Icy the Polar Bear. Silvio Berlusconi of Italy wore a business suit, but still wowed the crowd with his trademark power of shooting molten-gold bullion at his assailants.
 On the one hand, it's always helpful to hear a candidate's broad vision. On the other, the vision loses some of its import if you can't get there from here. Pressed for details on his foreign-policy strategies, McCain said the secret was ''setting goals and achieving.'' You can just hear the Democrats of 2013 kicking themselves: Goals and achievements! Why didn't we think of that?
 While McCain was unveiling his great expectations in Ohio, back in Washington Congress was voting by overwhelming majorities to pass an enormous, wasteful, ridiculous farm bill that provides massive subsidies to wealthy people who grow wheat, corn, soybeans, rice and cotton -- along, of course, with Senator Mitch McConnell's famous tax break for breeders of thoroughbred horses. McCain said he'd veto the bill if he were president, a threat that loses some of its wow quotient when the bill in question just passed both chambers by veto-proof majorities. (Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama dived into the tank and supported the package.)
 Among the smaller subsidies was one for goat mohair. This was a target for the Clinton administration's big efficiency drive, partly because the nation's well-being does not really require a secure supply of mohair, and partly because it has the disadvantage of sounding silly. Mohair price supports were eliminated with great fanfare and effort. Then Congress promptly reinstated them as an emergency measure. (I have fond memories of Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, yelping: ''Mohair is popular! I have a mohair sweater! It's my favorite one!'') Special breaks for mohair were cemented back into agriculture policy under George Bush, even though Bush really did seem to want to do something about wasteful farm spending. 
 All of which explains why presidents who run for office promising to cut the fat out of the budget wind up sighing and learning to live with goats on the dole.
 The farm bill is one big hairball of accommodations and trade-offs, and cheers to McCain for taking a principled stand against it. But unless he's been serving on a U.S. Senate in an alternate universe, he knows that getting rid of even a small sliver of the unnecessary programs beloved by somebody's constituents would be a Herculean challenge. It would be good to have a president willing to try. It would be scary to have one who builds his entire economic plan on the presumption that by 2013 he could wring ''great reductions in government spending'' that way.
 And if his domestic vision is that far removed from reality, what does that say about the goals-and-achievements stepladder to international peace and harmony via military interventions and a League of Democracies?
 Although if the costumes were neat enough. ...

HEADLINE: A Brighter Side Of High Prices

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CORN prices are at record high levels. Costs for other agricultural essentials, from wheat to coffee to rice, have surged, too. And many people are stunned, even frightened, by all the increases. 
 But some entrepreneurs and analysts -- recognizing that relative price increases in specific goods always encourage innovators to find ways around the problem -- say they see an opportunity for creative solutions. 
 ''When something becomes dear, you invent around it as much as you can,'' says David Warsh, editor of Economicprincipals.com, a newsletter on trends in economic thinking. 
 Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University, adds, ''All of a sudden, some things that didn't look profitable now do.''
 Smart people won't shift their efforts to agricultural problems, however, if they think that price increases are only temporary, says Henry Kressel, a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus and a pioneer in laser research. ''When you have a sudden blip in prices,'' Mr. Kressel says, ''it doesn't give rise to entrepreneurial activity.''
 Consider the periodic surges in prices for computer memory hardware. Because its price is declining over the long run -- a result of new technologies and automation -- innovators tend to stay away from the field, leaving it to a few large, established companies.
 For decades, declining prices for food had the same chilling effect. In the United States and Europe -- the world's two biggest consumers of new technologies -- food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive. Innovators turned their attention elsewhere. 
 With higher food prices possibly here to stay, clever people can now try things that simply weren't cost-effective before.
 ''I don't pay attention to inflation, but I do pay attention to big problems,'' says Bill Gross, chairman of Idealab, the business incubator based in Pasadena, Calif. ''If you can beat the price of the big gorilla in the marketplace, there's big opportunity.'' 
 One clearly ''big opportunity'' lies in changing the relationship between food and energy. Fertilizer lets farmers raise production but is energy-intensive to make. Transporting food great distances also requires much energy. So does processing. Finally, some foods are now being valued in relation to oil because of their potential use in fuel. 
 For some years now, innovators have trained their attention on alternative energy; they are now likely to concentrate on food production as well.
 For Americans, that would be going back to the future. Seventy years ago, farming was the technological high frontier. 
 In the 1930s, after the Depression wiped out so many small farmers, the federal government introduced ''price supports,'' which lifted the return to farmers on basic crops. Higher prices got the attention of innovators in farm equipment, seeds and other so-called inputs. 
 Sally Clarke, a historian at the University of Texas, has found in a study that higher prices enabled Midwest farmers, then reliant chiefly on animal-drawn plows, to justify investment in tractors, raising efficiency. A study in the 1950s by the economist Zvi Griliches of American farmers' adoption of more productive varieties of corn showed how higher prices reduced the cost of adopting new technologies.
 For the new agricultural innovators, these are early days. It will take time for the pipeline to fill with ambitious projects. Monsanto and BASF are among the relatively few big companies that remain active in agricultural innovation. And the most creative researchers can't immediately drop their other projects in response to price signals. 
 Given time, priorities change. Tomorrow's most intense technological battles will involve a range of agricultural topics, including these: 
 Using water and fertilizer more efficiently, so farmers can grow more with less.
 Finding new ways to suppress weeds, whose growing resistance to traditional herbicides is raising the cost of farming. 
 Designing better seeds, either through conventional means or genetic modification.
 Finding ways to meet the needs of the eat-local movement, promoted by the food writer Michael Pollan, among others, which requires innovative ''small batch'' processing techniques as well as a shift in values. 
 ''We need to pull out all the stops and do everything we can to improve farm productivity,'' says William Dyer, a plant biologist at Montana State University in Bozeman. 
 To be sure, engineering a new ''green revolution'' that will yield, say, cheaper wheat and rice -- all while meeting the concerns of various special interest groups -- will be much harder than designing a better music player. After all, we don't eat iPods. The food fabricator of the 1960s television show ''Star Trek'' remains an elusive dream, but not merely because of limits on human ingenuity. In agriculture, safety requirements can trump the need for productivity gains. 
 A new herbicide can cost $100 million to commercialize -- less than the amount needed for a new drug, but more than for many a new cellphone. Government regulations, however, need only raise the cost of innovation, not halt it. 
 Ultimately, higher food prices give innovators room to cover the cost of protecting human health. But prices are a democratic signal: when all innovators see them, their ability to sneak up on an opportunity, while others nap, vanishes. 
 ''The bigger the prize people are chasing, the more people go after it,'' says Paul Romer, a theorist on sources of economic growth. ''As people pile into an area, the expected return to any one innovator goes down.''
 Yet, fortunately, the return to society goes up.

HEADLINE: As Deaths Outpace Births, Cities Adjust

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS and SEAN D. HAMILL; Sam Roberts reported from New York, and Sean D. Hamill from Pittsburgh. David Staba contributed reporting from Buffalo, and Jo Craven McGinty from New York.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
This city has passed a grim demographic milestone: More people are dying here than are being born.
 What demographers call a natural decrease has been occurring for years in tiny rural towns and in some retirement meccas in the South. But the phenomenon is relatively new in metropolitan areas in the Northeast, the Rust Belt of the Middle West and Appalachia. 
 Hospitals are closing obstetrics wards and converting them to acute care. Local governments and other social service providers are adjusting to the emergence of entire neighborhoods where the average age is soaring, and private foundations are awarding scholarships to retain students and attract new ones. 
 In Pittsburgh, public school enrollment plummeted from about 70,000 two decades ago to about 30,000 and continues shrinking by about 1,000 a year. 
 ''At a certain point the school system becomes no longer viable,'' said Grant Oliphant, the new president of the Pittsburgh Foundation, which is overseeing a program that provides college scholarships worth up to $40,000 for any student who has attended the city's public schools since the ninth grade and graduates from high school with a grade point average of at least 2.0.
 ''The notion is to create an incentive to stay in school and graduate,'' Mr. Oliphant said. ''The second aspect is economic preservation -- to create an incentive for people to keep their kids in school or move here with their kids -- to keep enough taxpayers in town.''
 Since 1980, the city's population has plunged from 423,000 to about 312,000. Since 2000 alone, the metropolitan area has lost 60,000 people. 
 While natural decrease occurred in many Southern cities that were magnets for retirees, the overall population was replenished by the influx of younger migrants. But in Pittsburgh and other places outside the South, not only has the population aged in place, but also, to a lesser extent, the very old -- often disabled and widowed -- have returned to spend their last years with children and grandchildren and avail themselves of better medical treatment and transportation.
 ''You think of this as a rural or small-city phenomenon,'' said Gordon F. De Jong, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh. ''Here's a large metropolitan area where it's happening.'' 
 A 12-block portion of the city's Lawrenceville neighborhood is a good example. The working-class elderly residents have lived in their neat brick row houses most of their adult lives. They have stayed, even when the jobs left, creating what demographers call a naturally occurring retirement community, because nearly half the households are headed by people 65 or older.
 ''The senior citizens are good for me,'' said Jeffrey Wilson, 55, owner of Wilson Drugs, a mom-and-pop operation that his grandfather started in the Lawrenceville neighborhood in 1950. ''They took their pensions, or took other jobs when the mills closed, and continued to work, but they stayed.'' 
 Similar changes are happening in entire metropolitan areas, including the suburbs, which were traditionally havens for young couples and their children. 
 ''The older suburbs which formed when suburbanization began 50 years ago are now in the same precarious state that cities were 20 years ago,'' Mr. Oliphant said. 
 In the 1990s, births in metropolitan Pittsburgh outnumbered deaths by 11,500. Since this decade began, however, nearly 25,000 more people have died here than have been born. Health care has replaced steel as Pittsburgh's biggest industry. Parochial and public schools have closed.
 In more than a dozen municipalities in metropolitan Pittsburgh, more than 24 percent of residents are 65 and older, double the national average. 
 Other metropolitan areas, too, are teetering on the brink of natural decrease. 
 In the 1990s, deaths outnumbered births in only four metropolitan areas with more than 250,000 people, and three of those were in the South. Since 2000, 10 metropolitan areas -- half of them outside the South -- have suffered a net loss of population to natural decrease. 
 In three other areas hurt by vanishing industry, Buffalo-Niagara Falls and Utica-Rome in upstate New York, and Duluth, Minn., deaths exceeded births in at least one year in this decade.
 ''The Mohawk Valley region has natural decrease, and I suspect Buffalo will follow shortly,'' said Warren A. Brown, a demographer at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
 ''What we look like, you're going to start to see elsewhere,'' said Prof. Chris Briem, a regional economist at the Center for Social and Urban Research at the University of Pittsburgh. Mr. Briem traced the shift to the shuttering of steel plants in Pittsburgh, which prompted residents to seek work elsewhere.
 ''It was a very age-selective migration: young, working-age people took away their families and future families, leaving behind a population that aged in place,'' he said.
 In Scranton, Pa., where deaths have outnumbered births for more than a decade, two hospitals closed their obstetrics wards last year. Community Medical Center converted its postpartum unit to handle acute care surgery, procedures that the elderly undergo disproportionately. 
 In Buffalo, which suffered a natural decrease in population for the first time in 2005, business is flourishing at a chain of 14 funeral homes run by Anthony Amgione Jr., whose grandfather began the family business in 1927 from his own home. 
 ''I look at the death rate as our market,'' Mr. Amgione said.
 In nearby Niagara Falls, part of metropolitan Buffalo, 80-year-old Dr. Melvin B. Dyster used to deliver 100 or more babies annually. When he stopped last year, he was down to one or two a month. Now he cares primarily for elderly patients in a county where the median age has risen two years since 2000 alone, to over 40, and residents 65 and older outnumber children under 5 by three to one.
 ''We haven't had any 65- or 70-year-olds having babies,'' Dr. Dyster said. 
 Moreover, the children of many of those 65- and 70-year-olds typically left town years ago and are raising families elsewhere, leaving the elderly to fend for themselves. 
 The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the city's medical provider in Pittsburgh, now dispatches nurses and social workers as ''care coordinators'' to visit elderly former hospital patients at home and make sure they are taking proper medication. 
 ''This is my boss,'' Helen Bell, a retired baker who lives with her husband in the East Liberty neighborhood, said of Rose M. Whittle, a registered nurse and care coordinator who had just spent 30 minutes on a bimonthly visit arranging their pills by day of the week. 
 Betty Robinson, 73, a retired secretary, has lived in the Lawrenceville neighborhood her entire life. ''My adult children are always like: 'Mom, sell the house. Move here. Move there.' But I wouldn't think of being anywhere else,'' she said.
 She misses the energy of young families, but cherishes the camaraderie of longtime neighbors and having most services within walking distance.
 Peter A. Morrison, a demographer with the RAND Corporation, has documented the return of aging snowbirds to their roost. ''Healthy married people moved away to retirement destinations, and the people coming back are disabled widows and widowers,'' he said.
 Finding housing for middle-income elderly people remains a problem, said Rob Stephany, acting director of the city's Urban Development Authority, but some neighborhoods are attracting younger residents. 
 Pittsburgh has also adapted, in part, by capitalizing on what otherwise might be written off as a liability. 
 ''From an economic perspective,'' said Richard Schulz, director of the university's Center for Social and Urban Research, ''the region has benefited from its higher number of elderly persons in that it has enabled us to bring a lot of research money to the region as well as Medicare dollars.''

HEADLINE: The Scars of Losing a Home

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
ACROSS the United States, there were 243,353 foreclosure filings in April alone, nearly three times the total in the same month just two years ago, according to RealtyTrac, a company that follows the numbers. The trend is unmistakable, and suggests that, without government intervention, many millions of American families will be losing their homes before long. 
 What would this mean in human terms? Picture a line of moving trucks extending for hundreds of miles: they are taking the furniture of countless families to storage lockers. Picture schoolchildren saying goodbye to their classmates. They aren't going on vacation: they are being abruptly moved to the other side of town. 
 It's easy to take a stern view of this spectacle. The arguments go something like this: Foreclosure is not the end of the world. There are valuable lessons to be learned from such a life experience. After all, we live in a capitalist economy that thrives on the sanctity of contracts. The founders of our nation put the contract clause into the Constitution to make it clear that people need to live up to the documents they sign.
 This stern view may, in fact, be winning the battle of public opinion. On May 9, the House approved legislation aimed at helping some of the people facing foreclosure, but the president has said he would veto it. 
 This legislation, sponsored in the House by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and in the Senate by Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, is the only substantial proposed fix for the foreclosure mess that has gone anywhere. It would guarantee up to $300 billion in mortgages of troubled owner-occupants. But, right now, the bill's prospects are bleak, and the troubled homeowners may be left with virtually no help at all.
 Now, let's take the other perspective -- and examine some arguments against the stern view. They have to do with the psychological effects of strict enforcement of a mortgage contract, and economists and people in business may need to be reminded of them. After all, too much attention to abstract economic statistics just might make us overlook what is really important.
 First, we have to consider that we cannot squarely place the blame for the current mortgage mess on the homeowner. It seems to be shared among mortgage brokers, mortgage originators, appraisers, regulatory agencies, securities ratings agencies, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the president of the United States (who did not issue any warnings, but instead has consistently extolled the virtues of homeownership).
 Because homeowners facing foreclosure must bear the brunt of the pain, they naturally feel indignation when all of these other parties continue to lead comfortable, even affluent lives. Trying to enforce mortgage contracts may thus have a perverse effect: instead of teaching homeowners that they should respect the contracts they sign, it may incline them to take a cynical view of the whole mess.
 But instead of having sympathy for these homeowners, many people blame them for their predicaments. That isn't surprising. It's an example of a general tendency that was documented by social psychologists decades ago. 
 In his 1980 book, ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion,'' Melvin Lerner, a social psychologist, argued that people want to believe in the inherent justice of the economic system in which they live, and want to believe that people who appear to be suffering are in fact responsible for their own situations. He provided empirical evidence, derived from experiments, that after an initial pang of sympathy, people tend to develop negative views toward others who are suffering. That negative tendency seems to be at work today.
 Second, it is important to consider the psychological trauma of foreclosure. No one is likely to starve or sleep on the streets as an immediate result of a foreclosure, and the authorities no longer dump a family's furniture on the sidewalk when it happens. Nonetheless, there is deep trauma. 
 Homeownership is fundamental part of a sense of belonging to a country. The psychologist William James wrote in 1890 that ''a man's Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank account.'' 
 Homeownership is thus an extension of self; if one owns a part of a country, one tends to feel at one with that country. Policy makers around the world have long known that, and hence have supported the growth of homeownership.
 MAYBE that's why President Bush's ''Ownership Society'' theme had such resonance in his 2004 re-election campaign. People instinctively understand that homeownership conveys good feelings about belonging in our society, and that such feelings matter enormously, not only to our economic success but also to the pleasure we can take in it. 
 But we are now seeing the president's Ownership Society plan operate in reverse. Already, the homeownership rate has fallen -- from 69.1 percent in the first quarter of 2005 to 67.8 percent in the first quarter of 2008. That's almost back to the 67.5 percent level where it stood when Mr. Bush took office in 2001. And it is likely to fall further.
 The pain of this reverse movement could leave a psychological scar that will be with all of us for the rest of our lives.

HEADLINE: A Buyer's Market, a Seller's Pain

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
WITH a laser measuring device clipped to his belt and a reel of yellow tape tucked under one arm, Christopher Otteau roamed around a tidy house on a corner lot in Ridgewood, N.J., preparing to deliver the unwelcome news to its occupants.
 They, like many other homeowners whose property Mr. Otteau has appraised lately, were hoping to hear that their special house in their special neighborhood in their special town was immune to the gravitational force that has been pulling down home prices from coast to coast. Mr. Otteau's oft-repeated response: Sorry, but we are all in this housing slump together.
 These days even a well-kept house like this one, in a desirable town like Ridgewood, is likely to sell for a price that disappoints its owners. The five-bedroom ranch with a swimming pool was listed for more than $1.1 million, but Mr. Otteau, who is usually hired by the lender holding the mortgage, was just beginning to hunt for flaws.
 ''In a tough market, nothing is overlooked,'' he said as he examined a shallow hole near the front door where a tree had been planted. ''In a good market, lots of things are.'' 
 Clipboard in hand, he assessed everything from the topography of the lot (''slightly sloping'') to the type of street it bordered (a ''main feeder''). He gave it extra points for its curved stone walkway, which, he said, ''enhances curb appeal.''
 He would have to find out how much other houses in the neighborhood had sold for recently before he could fix a specific value on the home. But one conclusion was inescapable: On the section of the appraisal form that describes the condition of the local housing market, he would check the box for ''declining.''
 The suburbs of New York City were late entrants in the downturn that some economists think is already a recession. The main cause of the current weakness was the bursting of the American housing bubble, which had been pumped up by several years of hyper-aggressive lending and borrowing.
 Although prices rose much faster in newly developing parts of the Sun Belt, house values doubled in the metropolitan area, too, rising to $450,000 in 2005 from about $225,000 in 2000, according to the National Association of Realtors. Now, a reversal is well under way, but the concept is sinking in slowly for most residents of the area with property to sell.
 Those who have owned their homes since the start of the decade became accustomed to a steady, rapid appreciation. Buyers were lining up to tour houses and waging bidding wars that drove prices well above what sellers were asking.
 ''In 2005, it was almost impossible to overprice a home,'' said Mr. Otteau, 29, who has been appraising property from northern New Jersey to Delaware for six years since joining the real estate business that his father has operated for decades.
 But the tide turned more than two years ago, he said. With prices rising so much faster than people's incomes, houses started to become unaffordable and, he said, demand waned.
 Since then, home values statewide have declined about 15 percent and, he estimated, they will fall an additional 5 percent over the next year. In many towns, the inventory of unsold homes has been rising.
 But new statistics last week showed that sales volume increased statewide in New Jersey by about 4 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 The housing market has softened considerably in the suburbs north and east of New York City as well.
 On Long Island, the number of home sales in March was almost one-third lower than in March 2007, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The median price of those homes fell to $409,000 last month, down more than 8 percent from $445,000 the previous year.
 In Nassau County, almost a full year's supply of inventory was for sale as of March, up from a little more than eight months' worth a year ago, according to the service. In Suffolk County, it said, almost 15 months' inventory was for sale.
 In Westchester County, sales of single-family homes fell more than 30 percent and sales of condos plunged almost 35 percent during the first quarter of 2008, the sharpest decline in 28 years of record-keeping by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. In Putnam County, however, sales dropped by 9 percent, and prices fell 5 percent, according to the service.
 Westchester's real estate market is effectively on hold as prospective sellers wait for a better time to list their homes, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''You have to be aware that there are a lot of people who may want to sell property but don't have to do it at a particular time,'' Mr. Mercurio said.
 The sooner sellers let go of their dreams of cashing out at prices they once might have gotten, the sooner the market will stabilize, Mr. Otteau said.
 ''If people want to sell, they've got to get real with their prices,'' he said. Even then, he added, ''it's not going to be this everybody-rush-in market. It's going to be a cautious market.'' 
 Mr. Otteau may be too young to recall the ravages of the last severe housing slump in the New York metropolitan area. The median price of a home in the New York metropolitan area fell about 10 percent between 1988 and 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors. But he can fall back on the collected wisdom of his father, Jeffrey, who has been tracking New Jersey's property market for decades.
 Recently, Jeffrey Otteau has been the monthly bearer of bad tidings for New Jersey's builders and real estate agents. His company, Otteau Valuation Group, publishes town-by-town reports on the state of the housing market and, lately, the figures have looked progressively bleaker.
 The number of home-sale contracts signed in the state in March was down 27 percent from March 2007, according to the company's latest report. Growing fears about job losses, especially the waves of cutbacks announced by Wall Street firms, are compounding the weakening demand, Jeffrey Otteau said.
 ''Now, everything is in a stall,'' he said.
 To be sure, there are towns where demand is relatively strong and some houses are attracting multiple bids. But they represent a ''small, small sliver'' of the region, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 Most of those pockets of stability are directly linked to New York City, which has been the ''economic engine of the region for the last four years,'' Mr. Hughes said. Towns along the rail lines radiating from Manhattan, like Chatham and West Windsor, had some of the highest rates of home appreciation during the recent expansion, Mr. Hughes said. And those towns that have train stations and also lie near major highways, like Summit, received a double bonus, he said.
 ''If you live in those communities, for two working spouses it's the ideal location because you can satisfy one person working in New York and one working in New Jersey,'' Mr. Hughes said. Mr. Hughes said that even though more suburban residents throughout the region commute within the suburbs than travel back and forth to New York City, the closer-in communities have held up better because the city's economy has kept growing faster than the rest of the region's. With the financial services industry that powers New York City in the midst of a broad downshift, the staying power of that trend is now in question, Mr. Hughes said.
 If the cutbacks on Wall Street turn out to be part of a short, cyclical downturn, proximity to Manhattan may continue to be a prime determinant of home values, he said. But if it is the start of a ''long-term structural shift,'' he said, ''it's possible we could see a major long-term weakness in New York, and that would ripple through all these housing markets.''
 Even traditional destinations for investment bankers and lawyers decamping from the city, like Summit, in Union County, N.J., could suffer during a protracted downturn, Jeffrey Otteau said. ''The reliance on Manhattan overflow housing demand has, up until now, been a strength for Summit,'' he said. ''We now need to see how much weakness there will be.''
 Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, said she believes that on Long Island, ''communities that have rail linkages or other forms of public transit will hold up better in terms of value than other areas that are completely auto-dependent.'' But Mr. Mercurio said he had seen no evidence of a similar pattern in suburbs north of New York City.
 Beyond the data he collects and analyzes, Jeffrey Otteau has several sets of eyes scrutinizing the market, house by house and building by building. One pair belongs to his son, Christopher, who logs more than 40,000 miles a year on his Lexus hybrid as he traverses the region appraising property.
 In a soft market, like the current one, sellers can improve their prospects by dressing up their homes, Christopher Otteau said. Uncluttered houses are much more appealing, he said. ''We always recommend getting a storage unit and getting all that stuff out of the way.''
 He said that ''updated kitchens and updated bathrooms definitely add value,'' but added that owners could go too far in upgrading an entry-level home. Installing expensive cabinetry, appliances and marble tile in a smaller house is often a mistake, he said. ''In entry level, it's called overimprovement or superadequacy,'' he said, using appraisers' language for spending money that is unlikely to be recouped. 
 One thing owners routinely place too much value on is having a larger-than-average lot, he said. ''If it's not buildable, it's just excess acreage.'' 
 Just after dawn one day this spring, in Bernards Township, he hiked to the top of a hill on a 10-acre lot near Basking Ridge whose owner had scrapped a plan to build a house and had put it up for sale for $1.2 million. The property, with a creek running through it, was ''one of the most beautiful lots I've ever seen,'' he said. ''In 2005, it probably would have sold in a heartbeat.'' 
 An hour later, he was touring a house in Mendham, then he was on to another in Long Hill.
 Each property had its own strengths and weaknesses, and, ultimately, the selling price of each would be determined by how many potential buyers it attracted and what they were willing to pay. Christopher Otteau said he could not discuss the particulars of his valuation of any of them. But in each case, he said, it was almost certainly true that they would sell for less than they would have at the peak of the market a few years ago, and less than their owners had hoped to collect.
 When he breaks that news to them, he tries to do it ''nicely,'' he said, and they seem to find his candor ''refreshing.'' Often, the response he hears these days, he said, is ''At least you're honest.''

HEADLINE: A New Stamp On a Vast Space

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
THE historic American Bank Note building in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx is the kind of structure that inspires a second look. 
 This 420,000-square-foot brick behemoth -- easily spotted from the Bruckner Expressway -- is spread across three wings and a tower, with soaring windows and a jaggedly peaked roof. In February, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Committee designated the building a landmark. 
 For nearly a century, the American Bank Note Company printed stock certificates, foreign currency, letters of credit, postage stamps and, of course, bank notes there. But since the company moved to the Philadelphia suburbs in 1985, the building has languished. Some of the brickwork has crumbled, and only half the space is occupied. Somewhere along the line, the soaring, peaked skylights that once allowed sunlight to stream into the building were painted or covered over. 
 But changes are in the works. The building was bought in January by Taconic Investment Partners and Denham Wolf Real Estate Services, both based in New York, for $32 million, and the two companies are investing an additional $40 million for renovations. 
 Compared with the estimated $7 billion being poured into development projects in the Bronx, including the new Yankee Stadium and the redevelopment of the Bronx Terminal Market, that is a modest amount. But the new owners are hoping that the Bank Note building, with its loftlike space and panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline, will help in the neighborhood's revitalization by providing a haven for creative professionals, nonprofit organizations and other companies looking for attractive and affordable office space. Most of the tenants right now are a mix of nonprofit and arts groups.
 ''We're creating an image for the neighborhood and the building that will establish it as an office destination,'' said Charles R. Bendit, co-chief executive at Taconic with Paul E. Pariser. 
 Mr. Bendit has a track record of creating compelling properties from industrial space in neighborhoods on the cusp of change. In 1995, another company he had owned, along with a partner, acquired 1500 Broadway, a building at West 43rd Street and Broadway in Midtown Manhattan that had housed an assortment of tenants, including souvenir and electronics stores. There was a movie theater on the second floor, but the building had no electronic marquee.
 After the building was renovated and the other tenants bought out, the first three floors were leased to ABC, which uses space there as a studio for ''Good Morning America,'' and new office tenants rented space on the upper floors. The partner bought out Mr. Bendit's share in 1999. 
 Taconic had success with a similar project, at 111 Eighth Avenue, the former headquarters of the Port Authority of New York, a building that occupied an entire square block bounded by 15th and 16th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues. When Taconic bought the property in January 1998, the western part of Chelsea, the neighborhood where it is located, was starting to attract new investment. 
 The building was convenient to public transportation, and it literally sat atop a big fiber optic switching networking underground, according to Mr. Bendit. It also provided large floor plans, which are rare in New York, he said. 
 After a $50 million renovation added elevators and lobbies and improved infrastructure, tenants like Deutsch Advertising and, more recently, Google, leased floor-through office space.
 In 2000, Taconic redeveloped 600 West Chicago, a former Montgomery Ward warehouse and local landmark in a Chicago neighborhood in the early stages of transition. Taconic invested $165 million and managed to attract tenants in a wide range of fields before selling the building last May. 
 Taconic and Denham Wolf hope to transform the Bank Note building, helped along by city and other private efforts to revive the South Bronx. 
 The project was born when Denham Wolf, which had long served as a real estate consultant to nonprofit and arts groups, began searching for development opportunities about a year and a half ago. The Bronx seemed a good location because the company had many clients there. Jonathan Denham, a principal at the firm, saw the Bank Note building and fell for its soaring industrial space. He brought in Mr. Bendit, and the two finally persuaded the owners, the Blauner family, to sell. 
 Renovation of the historic building is being handled by Beyer Blinder Belle, an architectural firm known for high-profile restoration projects like Ellis Island, and will continue through 2009. Initial plans have been approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. They include adding or renovating lobbies and elevators, restoring the building's 50,000 or so square feet of skylights and replacing its aging windows (400 of them, with dozens of panels each). 
 Some decisions, like how to handle the main wing's sky-lit 100,000-square foot industrial space, will depend on the tenant mix.
 The building will also benefit from city plans to create a pedestrian-friendly ''greenway'' along Lafayette Street, on the structure's southern side. 
 Building on the diverse base of existing tenants -- including the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance; Sustainable South Bronx, an environmental group; the John V. Lindsay Wildcat Academy Charter School; and dozens of artists who rent small studios in one wing -- the new owners hope to make the building into a mecca for cultural groups that have been priced out of Manhattan. They also hope to attract architects, photographers and other professionals who might be inspired by the natural light and views. 
 The owners say they dream of creating a retail food market, similar to the Chelsea Market, drawing on local producers and the wholesalers that maintain warehouses in Hunts Point. A rendering in a marketing brochure shows its possible look, and the owners have had some discussions with food purveyors, but Mr. Denham acknowledges that it is just a vision for now. 
 The first new tenants are expected to be signed up by summer, according to the owners. Asking rents will be in the range of $20 to $30 a square foot, and tenants may be eligible for economic incentives like tax breaks that could further bring down their costs. (Comparable rents in the Bronx run from the mid-$30s to $40 a square foot, and in lower Midtown Manhattan, around $50 a square foot.)
 While much of the real estate world is mired in economic uncertainty, Mr. Bendit says he sees the Bank Note building as ''a defensive opportunity.'' 
 ''It plays right into what's going on in the market,'' he said, ''as people begin to tighten their belts a bit.''

HEADLINE: A Buyer's Market, a Seller's Pain

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

DATELINE: Ridgewood 

 BODY:
 WITH a laser measuring device clipped to his belt and a reel of yellow tape tucked under one arm, Christopher Otteau roamed around a tidy house on a corner lot in Ridgewood, preparing to deliver the unwelcome news to its occupants.
 They, like many other homeowners whose property Mr. Otteau has appraised lately, were hoping to hear that their special house in their special neighborhood in their special town was immune to the gravitational force that has been pulling down home prices from coast to coast. Mr. Otteau's oft-repeated response: Sorry, but we are all in this housing slump together.
 These days even a well-kept house like this one, in a desirable town like Ridgewood, is likely to sell for a price that disappoints its owners. The five-bedroom ranch with a swimming pool was listed for more than $1.1 million, but Mr. Otteau, who is usually hired by the lender holding the mortgage, was just beginning to hunt for flaws.
 ''In a tough market, nothing is overlooked,'' he said as he examined a shallow hole near the front door where a tree had been planted. ''In a good market, lots of things are.'' 
 Clipboard in hand, he assessed everything from the topography of the lot (''slightly sloping'') to the type of street it bordered (a ''main feeder''). He gave it extra points for its curved stone walkway, which, he said, ''enhances curb appeal.''
 He would have to find out how much other houses in the neighborhood had sold for recently before he could fix a value on the home. 
 But one conclusion was inescapable: On the section of the appraisal form that describes the condition of the local housing market, he would check the box for ''declining.''
 The suburbs of New York City were late entrants in the downturn that some economists think is already a recession. The main cause of the current weakness was the bursting of the American housing bubble, which had been pumped up by several years of hyper-aggressive lending and borrowing.
 Although prices rose much faster in newly developing parts of the Sun Belt, house values doubled in the metropolitan area, rising to $450,000 in 2005 from about $225,000 in 2000, according to the National Association of Realtors. Now, a reversal is well under way, but the concept is sinking in slowly for most residents of the area with property to sell.
 Those who have owned their homes since the start of the decade became accustomed to a steady, rapid appreciation. Buyers were lining up to tour houses and waging bidding wars that drove prices well above what sellers were asking.
 ''In 2005, it was almost impossible to overprice a home,'' said Mr. Otteau, 29, who has been appraising property from northern New Jersey to Delaware for six years since joining the real estate business that his father has operated for decades.
 But the tide turned more than two years ago, he said. With prices rising so much faster than people's incomes, houses started to become unaffordable and, he said, demand waned.
 Since then, home values statewide have declined about 15 percent and, he estimated, they will fall an additional 5 percent over the next year. In many towns, the inventory of unsold homes has been rising.
 The housing market has softened considerably in the suburbs north and east of New York City as well.
 On Long Island, the number of home sales in March was almost one-third lower than in March 2007, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The median price of those homes fell to $409,000 last month, down more than 8 percent from $445,000 the previous year.
 In Nassau County, almost a full year's supply of inventory was for sale as of March, up from a little more than eight months' worth a year ago, according to the service. In Suffolk County, it said, almost 15 months' inventory was for sale.
 In Westchester County, sales of single-family homes fell more than 30 percent and sales of condos plunged almost 35 percent during the first quarter of 2008, the sharpest decline in 28 years of record-keeping by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. In Putnam County, however, sales dropped by 9 percent, and prices fell 5 percent, according to the service.
 Westchester's real estate market is effectively on hold as prospective sellers wait for a better time to list their homes, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''You have to be aware that there are a lot of people who may want to sell property but don't have to do it at a particular time,'' Mr. Mercurio said.
 The sooner sellers let go of their dreams of cashing out at prices they once might have gotten, the sooner the market will stabilize, Mr. Otteau said.
 ''If people want to sell, they've got to get real with their prices,'' he said. Even then, he added, ''it's not going to be this everybody-rush-in market. It's going to be a cautious market.'' 
 Mr. Otteau may be too young to recall the ravages of the last severe housing slump in the New York metropolitan area. The median price of a home in the New York metropolitan area fell about 10 percent between 1988 and 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors. But he can fall back on the collected wisdom of his father, Jeffrey, who has been tracking New Jersey's market for decades.
 Recently, Jeffrey Otteau has been the monthly bearer of bad tidings for New Jersey's builders and real estate agents. His company, Otteau Valuation Group, publishes town-by-town reports on the state of the housing market and, lately, the figures have looked progressively bleaker.
 The number of home-sale contracts signed in the state in March was down 27 percent from March 2007, according to the company's latest report. Growing fears about job losses, especially the waves of cutbacks announced by Wall Street firms, are compounding the weakening demand, Jeffrey Otteau said.
 ''Now, everything is in a stall,'' he said.
 To be sure, there are towns where demand is relatively strong and some houses are attracting multiple bids. But they represent a ''small, small sliver'' of the region, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 Most of those pockets of stability are directly linked to New York City, which has been the ''economic engine of the region for the last four years,'' Mr. Hughes said. Towns along the rail lines radiating from Manhattan, like Chatham and West Windsor, had some of the highest rates of home appreciation during the recent expansion, Mr. Hughes said. And those towns that have train stations and also lie near major highways, like Summit, received a double bonus, he said.
 As prices have fallen, a clear pattern has emerged, Jeffrey Otteau said. The forces of supply and demand for homes have stayed in better balance in towns with high-speed transit links than elsewhere, he said.
 His monthly Otteau Report measures the health of a local real estate market in terms of inventory for sale. As a rule of thumb, he said, a market is in good shape if it has no more homes available than would be expected to sell within six months. Several towns in New Jersey, including Chatham and Ridgewood, still fit that bill, according to Mr. Otteau's data, and most of them have rail links.
 IN Morris County, for example, there was about nine months' inventory in March. But the prospects for home sellers varied widely within the county. In Mendham Borough and Mendham Township, there were 130 homes on the market in March, 50 more than in the first quarter of 2005, but the rate of sales had been cut nearly in half, to 8 per month from 15. At that rate, it would take 16 months to sell the 130 listed homes. Twelve miles away, in Chatham, whose station is the first stop in the county for trains leaving New York City, sales activity had held steady, leaving just five months' inventory. 
 In Bergen County, the market is similarly spotty. In Ridgewood, where many homes are within walking distance of a rail link to Manhattan, the pace of sales has slowed just a little since 2005, leaving about six months' inventory on the market in the first quarter.
 But in the more remote towns of Saddle River and Upper Saddle River, the number of homes for sale has risen faster and the pace of sales has slowed. At the rate houses were selling in 2008's first quarter, it would take 21 months to sell all 64 homes listed in Saddle River and 15 months to sell all 116 homes listed in Upper Saddle River, according to the Otteau Report.
 ''It's not playing out the same way everywhere, but there is weakness everywhere because we're now at the final stages of this housing decline,'' Jeffrey Otteau said. ''Real estate markets that are more automobile-oriented are suffering more than those that offer mass transportation.''
 Mr. Hughes said that even though more suburban residents throughout the region commute within the suburbs than travel back and forth to New York City, the closer-in communities have held up better because the city's economy has kept growing faster than the rest of the region's. 
 If the cutbacks on Wall Street turn out to be part of a short, cyclical downturn, proximity to Manhattan may continue to be a prime determinant of home values, he said. But if it is the start of a ''long-term structural shift,'' he said, ''it's possible we could see a major long-term weakness in New York, and that would ripple through all these housing markets.''

HEADLINE: The Language Of Loss for The Jobless

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
THE neighbor, a jovial suit-and-tie presence at the school bus stop in the mornings, disappeared for a while last fall. Nobody saw him for weeks. Finally he began to venture out -- at afternoon pickup, in jeans and a T-shirt. A senior manager of a technology department, he had been laid off. Neighbors didn't know what to say to him.
 Across the soccer fields of leafy suburbia, conversations are stilted these days; the bravado has a tinny ring, the gallows humor is more prevalent, the deft change of topic more abrupt. As classes let out at a city private school, a normally chatty top-of-the-heap woman, whose banker husband was recently escorted out of his office building, rushes in, sweeps up her child and dashes off, avoiding glances.
 As the economy blasts away at white-collar workers as well as blue-collar ones, the newly jobless are learning an ungainly new language: How to spin their situation to other parents on the Saturday morning sidelines. How to convey nonchalance during Pinteresque pauses in the golf-club locker rooms. How to fend off inquisitive family members at Memorial Day barbecues. 
 For so many, the loneliness is palpable. ''I stopped getting together with colleagues from the office,'' said a Manhattan man who had worked for nearly two decades in sales and trading for a large investment bank and was laid off in January.
 His office friends could offer little solace, he said. They are preoccupied with their own anxious limbo. Summoning the post-apocalyptic refrain, he added, ''It's like 'The living envy the dead.' '' 
 Friends tell him, '' 'You're probably better off,' even though they don't know what they mean by that.''
 Still trying to slough off his anger, he said: ''I see less of my closest friends in these past three or four months. Everyone I know works.''
 American companies have shed 240,000 jobs in the first three months of the year, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Business-page headlines announce layoffs by the thousands at major American corporations: 2,000 at AOL, 5,000 at Morgan Stanley, 4,000 at Merrill Lynch. 
 Despite the pervasiveness of the cuts, many people contacted for this article were unwilling to speak for attribution, citing confidentiality agreements or, simply, embarrassment.
 In general, middle-aged professionals seem more anxious and demoralized than younger ones; men tend to be more buttoned-up than women.
 When Janette La Vigne, an insurance company executive from Clinton Township, N.J., was laid off 10 days ago, she immediately told fellow lacrosse moms. The women were empathetic and bracing, particularly those whose husbands had been through layoffs, said Ms. La Vigne, who had been with the same company for 21 years. 
 ''But the guys are speechless,'' she said. ''They don't know how to handle it. Their body language says, 'Eww, I'm so glad I'm not you right now.' ''
 Breaking the news to parents who grew up under the shadow of the Great Depression is an art unto itself. Last summer, when Diane Gelman, a single mother, was laid off as a financial analyst at a Manhattan bank, she called her mother, masked her own shock and front-loaded the spin with optimism.
 ''I've been unhappy for so long at my job, Mom,'' she recalled saying. ''And now they're offering me money to leave! It's not personal, it's a business decision, and I am so fine with it.'' She has since found a position. 
 Those on the sidelines are also uncomfortable, fumbling for a protocol, an etiquette to support their struggling neighbors, while also respecting their dignity. ''As this has become more prolonged, friends are pulling away, probably because they think we can't afford to go out with them,'' said the wife of a former executive at a national apparel company, who asked for anonymity because the couple's friendships have become strained. ''They mean well. But I wish they would give us that option.''
 Deborah Tannen, a linguistics professor at Georgetown, explained the inarticulateness of the well-intentioned. ''People feel caught between two conflicting concerns,'' said Dr. Tannen, the author of ''You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation.'' ''You're caught between the need to show you care and the fear of offending because you're reminding them of something painful.''
 How are friends supposed to respond? ''People say, 'Oh, well, it's not so bad, it's happening everywhere,' '' said Anne Baber, co-author of ''How to Fireproof Your Career,'' which is based on interviews with several hundred laid-off employees. ''But to the person getting laid off, it is that bad.''
 Although layoffs are becoming dismayingly common, the term still has a lingering stigma. The slang for being laid off is inherently dehumanizing, notes Ms. Baber, a career workshop leader in Kansas City, Kan. Among the coarser expressions: Canned. Getting rid of dead wood. Pruning. Fumigating. Cleaning house. Made redundant. Axed. Sacked. Bagged.
 That stigma leads to the shunning felt by many in their communities. ''Some people skirted around us and wouldn't talk to us, as if they were thinking, 'How come he keeps losing jobs?' '' said Terryl Anderson of Bloomfield, N.J., whose husband, originally a computer programmer, has also been laid off as a surveyor and salesman. 
 Victim-blaming dates to Job's mourners. ''It helps people who are still employed to believe that people who have been laid off did something wrong,'' Ms. Baber said. ''If you can blame them, then you can feel protected. If it's just random -- 'they moved customer service to Dallas' -- then nothing will protect you either, and that's scary to people.''
 Certainly the sheer volume of layoffs is making brassy shoulder-shrug disclosure more acceptable. So is the battle cry of the outplacement services: Network! Tell everyone you know. Because you never know.
 And so by last weekend, merely two days after Bob Adler's finale as a market research analyst at a Fortune 200 insurance company, some people in Montclair, N.J., already knew, largely due to the efforts of the gregarious Mr. Adler.
 ''I understand you're sorry, so am I, but that doesn't do me any good,'' Mr. Adler, who starts paying college tuition this fall, is telling those offering condolences. ''If you really want to help, tell me what you think I do well, who you know, and where you think my skills fit best. And they were grateful for being given that option and I was glad I could redirect the nature of the conversation pretty much on a dime.''
 Mrs. Anderson also said that friends had been her family's greatest support. ''Friends have kept us alive and given us clothes for our kids,'' she said. ''One friend just found a job for my husband.''
 But networking on such a local, backyard level is hard for some, especially the innately private or shy and the staunchly proud, to say nothing of those who perceive neighbors in the same profession as competition for the small pool of jobs.
 A PUBLIC tennis court in the suburbs reverberates with gruff thwacks, the players almost all middle-aged men and women. It is 10 a.m., on a Wednesday. ''How's it going?'' ''Tough.'' ''Yeah.''
 Don't ask? Ask? How? Three monosyllabic words -- ''How are you?'' -- take on a spectrum of inflections. Breezy (''How are ya'!''). Earnest (''How are you?'' -- sotto voce). Funereal (''How are you?''). And, more recently, they translate as polite code for, ''Lose your job yet?''
 Patty Nigro, a hairstylist in West Caldwell, N.J., whose salon chair can double as a therapist's couch, says that these days, she doesn't ask. ''It's a sad, sour time for people, and it's a touchy subject,'' Mrs. Nigro said. The appointment is their opportunity ''to escape their worries, to have a treat.''
 The hair salon as economic indicator: ''The haircuts and hair color, those are the necessities because they're looking for work,'' Mrs. Nigro continued. ''But all the extra feel-good things about yourself -- the massages, the facials -- those are being cut.''
 Experts suggest that people take a gentle, open-ended approach: '' 'Well, how are you doing, what's new with you,' '' recommended Ms. Baber, ''Not, 'Why are you here in the middle of the afternoon, are you taking the day off?' ''
 The replies can deflect or invite pity parties, create entree for further questions, provide cover.
 The new euphemisms: ''They freed me up for my future!'' ''I got a great severance package.'' ''I'm between successes!'' ''We've been a two-career family for so long that we decided one of us should stay home with the kids.'' ''I've decided to take my career in a different direction.'' ''I got tired of the commute so I'm working out of the house.''
 Many people remain uncertain about whether a call intended to express concern will be interpreted as condescending or intrusive. But an investment banker from Manhattan who has seen many colleagues laid off recently recommended erring on the side of being helpful:
 ''Call! Say: 'Hey, I have no idea what you're going through or what you need, but I'd love to have coffee with you. Maybe there are a couple of introductions I can make,' '' said the banker, Joshua Schwartz. ''Even if you can't be helpful or they don't take your offer, it's the right thing to do.''

HEADLINE: Does the 'Real' Ireland Still Exist?

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY. 
DAN BARRY is the This Land columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
AN August night in the sea-scented village of Kinvara finds us at Connolly's, a pub so permanent that if some codger were to tell you it was here before Galway Bay, lapping now just outside the door, you'd nod and buy him a pint. My wife and I are hunched at a small table with friends when a smiling woman in a peasant skirt sits beside us, carrying a perfectly appropriate accessory in this corner of Ireland -- a button accordion.
 She is Mary Staunton, a musician known throughout the Irish west. When the inevitable call goes out, she obliges, her fingers skipping across the buttons like children playing frantic but sure-footed hopscotch. Then a white-haired man mentions an old song from his childhood. Does she know it? Why yes, she does, and when her fingers finish their dance, leaving the man smiling, there suddenly rises from across the room the hesitant but clear voice of a young woman who has summoned the nerve to sing. (''And I said let grief be a fallen leaf/At the dawning of the day.'') As she sings, all talking stops: an entire pub, transported. And I think to myself, now this would never happen where I'm from. 
 Was this the real Ireland? Or was it a rare dash of magic, sprinkled into Connolly's to validate an antiquated sense of Ireland -- a sense rooted in the days when economic inequity between two countries allowed American tourists to spend as though Ireland were one sprawling duty-free shop? Though the country is now experiencing some economic uneasiness, you still cannot help but think: How times have changed.
 Over the years, I have spent a lot of time in the western counties of Galway and Clare, and if nothing else, this is what I have gleaned: Ireland can be that place you missed as you traveled around Ireland, looking for Ireland. 
 Yes, you can find a thatched cottage here and there, if you try. Yes, you may even encounter a white clot of sheep blocking your rented car's path, raising from musty memory some postcard caption about Irish Rush Hour. But to wander about, looking to bag with a digital camera some approximation of a time-faded Irish postcard, is to miss the complexities of a country that is thoroughly enjoying its wealth and adapting to its European Union membership while at the same time trying to preserve its dreamlike landscape and proud cultural heritage. 
 You may indeed hear a young Irish woman suddenly break into song in Kinvara. But you may also walk around the corner and be served dinner by a young man with an Eastern European accent instead of a brogue. Travel 10 miles up the road to Gort and you might wade into a celebration of Brazilian culture, staged by a transplanted community that is now an integral part of that old market town. 
 There you have it: delightful, post-millennial Ireland.
 Well versed by now in the lesson that to search for Ireland is to miss it, my family and I once again settled into a self-catered apartment in Kinvara, a village cleaved to Galway Bay near the Clare-Galway border. A generation ago, even a decade ago, you might have called it an unhurried place; now Kinvara captures the transformation of Ireland in so many ways. 
 The village has a few narrow streets, some shops and pubs, and a stone-walled pier more than 200 years old, from which the distant lights of Galway City can be seen at night and the inhalations and exhalations of the sea can be measured. Across from the pier there looms Dunguaire Castle, which for nearly five centuries has stood on grounds near the ancient fort of Guaire, seventh-century King of Connaught.
 The castle's topmost open windows offer a panoramic view of a Kinvara in flux. Much of the surrounding farmland is being subdivided for new homes, some of them being offered for the equivalent of $1 million and more; they appeal to young professionals looking for an easy commute into Galway, and to affluent Dubliners seeking a second-home getaway. It all leaves one wondering whether the village's aesthetics are at risk; whether these new developments, and the taxing of the fragile infrastructure they represent, will make Kinvara less -- Kinvara-like.
 But for now, Kinvara presents curious juxtapositions of the old and the new. Here, for example, an inviting place called the Burren Beo Cafe occupies an old stone storefront where wireless access is available and where tombstones from a long-gone churchyard adorn the patio. You can sip your caffe latte and imagine the life led by one Bryan Daly, who departed this life at the age of 33, in 1816, and whose headstone lies flat at your feet.
 THOUGH Kinvara is perfectly situated for day trips to other points of the Irish west, I often struggle with whether to stay or to go, lulled as I am by the mundane daily rhythms of a village I have come to know in all seasons. 
 In the mornings, I watch the same white-bearded fisherman -- said to be Kinvara's last -- park his old black bicycle by the pier, row a skiff to his rusty-green vessel, and disappear into the bay. Sometime later I see him rowing back to shore, where he mounts his bicycle and vanishes down a narrow lane, leaving me to wonder whether I had actually seen him or simply imagined him.
 In the afternoons, I sometimes see the beer truck pull up to Connolly's, and I watch the deliveryman throw a seat cushion on the ground, bounce the beer kegs precisely onto the cushion, then spin them like squat and silvery dance partners toward the pub door.
 And in the evenings, I take walks with my wife and two young daughters along a worn path that meanders along the shoreline and through pastures where cows, horses and donkeys approach, as if seeking the latest gossip from Connolly's. At the stony pier we watch the bobbing of moored Galway hookers, traditional wooden sailing boats with single masts and glorious billowing sails. Once used to import turf from rocky Connemara, the hookers are now the star attraction of a mid-August festival called Cruinniu na mBad, or Gathering of the Boats.
 The sun drops, and somewhere voices are raised in song, seducing you to stay snug in Kinvara. But other places beckon, places dotted through the west that represent the old, the new, the real Ireland. If you were to climb again up those stone steps of Dunguaire Castle and peer again through one of those narrow windows, you would see beyond the village a limestone moonscape of hills and crevices, of wild goats and wildflowers, that stretches for more than 100 square miles across North Clare. This is the Burren. 
 Take any crooked Burren road, whether to Kilfenora or to Lisdoonvarna, to Tubber or to Cassidy's Pub, and something ancient -- a solitary Celtic cross, a crumbled farmhouse, one of the megalithic tombs of stone called dolmens -- presents itself. One rain-swept afternoon, friends led us to a Burren mountain called Slieve Carron, which stretches across the horizon like a giant in repose. We donned slickers and walked a mile across cow-pocked fields, through some brush, up a muddy hill, to a tree-canopied pocket as lush as any hobbit's grotto. Here was an altar made of rock slab beside a spring. And here, deeper in, was a cave where St. Colman MacDuagh is said to have lived and meditated. No beeping of backhoes clearing way for another luxury home; just the beating of rain against leaves. 
 This sense of exposure, even oneness, with sky, rock and water continues through the short, winding drive from Slieve Carron to New Quay. Found there is a semi-secret place called the Flaggy Shore, a stony stretch along Galway Bay that is alive with lime-green seaweed and bruised-purple algae, with tidal pools and breath-catching winds, with -- well, best to step aside and let the unmatchable Seamus Heaney describe the Flaggy Shore experience in his poem ''Postscript'':
 ... You are neither here nor there,
 A hurry through which known and strange things pass
 As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways
 And catch the heart off guard and blow it open.
 Half a mile away, at the back door of Linnane's Lobster Bar, fishing boats rock in the impatient tide; at its front door, two rumpled regulars sit on upturned kegs, offering nods and how-are-ye's. Between these portals, fine fish and chowder are served. But on this day, and on a patch of pasture just outside Linnane's and beyond a stone wall, there sit two sleek private helicopters, so out of place in these simple surroundings -- and yet very much in their proper place in the Ireland of today. The very rich in Ireland think nothing of zipping by helicopter the 130 miles from Dublin to Galway or Clare for a leisurely lunch of oysters and then back again, thus avoiding the off chance of traffic congestion caused by sheep on some secondary road.
 In the Ireland of today, even the famous Cliffs of Moher are different. Not long ago the amenities included a small parking lot, a modest cafeteria and a gift shop. But with the completion early last year of a multimillion-dollar renovation, the country's most popular tourist attraction now includes the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience, a multimedia center cleverly built into the hillside. It could have been cheesy; instead, it is mesmerizing, with audio-visual presentations that celebrate the intertwined stories of rock, water and humankind.
 But the real always trumps the virtual. The cliffs remain a pulse-racing place where a four-mile stretch of improbable green land suddenly stops, and walls of shale and flagstone drop several hundred feet to receive the angry white-foam crashes of the Atlantic. 
 A change in infrastructure is one thing; a change in culture is quite another. And nowhere is this change more strongly felt than in Gort, about 40 miles northeast of the cliffs and just a dozen miles from Kinvara. My mother grew up on a farm near there, and I've been visiting Gort since the 1970s. I have watched it gradually grow from an aged and insular town to a bedroom community for Galway City, some 20 miles away. Farms I remember are now Levittown-like subdivisions.
 The real change, though, is in Gort's new and sizable Brazilian community, attracted in part by job opportunities at a local meat-processing plant. The impact has been extraordinary: Brazilian music nights in one of the pubs, Brazilian necessities -- from maracuja to mandioca -- in the shops, and a Sunday Mass said in Portuguese. There has been the usual awkwardness in this marriage of two distinct cultures, but for the most part the newcomers have been warmly accepted; for example, when carbon monoxide from a faulty oil burner killed two Brazilian men nearly three years ago, townspeople banded together to raise money to help the families.
 And every June, Gort serves as host to a traditional Brazilian festival called the Quadrilha. The town center comes alive with folk dances and passionate sambas that could never be confused with an Irish step dance, while the air fills with the aroma of Brazilian cuisine that could never be confused with brown bread and tea. 
 You will see the Irish at the Quadrilha, some of them wearing the soccer jerseys of Brazil's national team, just as you will see Brazilians two months later at the Gort Show, an annual agricultural fair, where inside the community center, locals compete for best mince pie and handsomest heads of garden cabbage, while in the fields outside, judges in bowler hats ponder before selecting the best-colored colt, filly or gelding. The new Gort is reflected in the flags of Ireland and Brazil that sometimes hang in shop windows, the green in both nearly blending.
 Any day trip through the west of Ireland will lead to some new discovery, some new reflection of the steady departure from a twee past that was never quite as twee as tourists might imagine. Yes, there are still places like Cong, the adorable little village in County Mayo whose economy even now hinges on its serendipitous role as the setting for ''The Quiet Man,'' a movie from 1952 that starred John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. But a short drive from Cong into the Connemara wildness, where there are often stretches of nothing more than rock, craggy hills and the occasional car, you can find beside an abandoned stone farmhouse a recently built summer getaway, and another backhoe carving into the scenery to make way for another second home. Remote Connemara is no longer remote, and no longer cheap.
 There is so much to experience in Connemara, from the ruggedness of its Twelve Bens mountain range to the refined comfort at its old Renvyle House Hotel, that it can seem almost too much at times. And so I return to that place I know a little, Kinvara.
 I know that when the evening tide rises at the pier in nearby Parkmore, the sprat-chasing mackerel nearly leap into your pail. I know that on the short ride back to town, in a stamp-size spot called Nogra, there's a century-old pub and store called Fahy's Travellers Inn; you drink your pint, hear the murmur of local chatter, then toss your spare change into the can for the African Mission that sits on the bar.
 And I know that music tends to break out.
 Another August night finds us with 20 others, talking and drinking under an awning outside the Pier Head, a bar and restaurant across the quay from Connolly's. Those majestic boats called hookers rock gently in the bay. Dunguaire Castle, set aglow by floodlights, watches over Kinvara, as always. It is raining.
 Then a man I know starts singing, as is his habit at moments like these. With eyes closed, he sings an old song written by a Kinvara poet long gone, about the cuckoos calling from the woods within, and his love beside him and the tide full in. People fall quiet, many with heads bowed, creating a sense that in all of Ireland there are only these sounds: seawater lapping, rainwater tapping, and one man's song. 
 BUSTLE AND STILLNESS
 WHERE TO STAY
 One of the better options in and around Kinvara are ''self-catered'' accommodations that range from renovated thatched cottages to modern homes with up-to-date amenities and weekly rates of 270 to 900 euros ($425.60 to $1,422 at $1.58 to the euro). A list can be found at www.kinvara.com.
 As for Connemara, the twinning of the rugged and the luxurious can be found at the Renvyle House Hotel (Renvyle, County Galway; 353-95-43511; www.renvyle.com), once owned by the Irish writer Oliver St. John Gogarty. It offers a heated pool, a golf course, a fine restaurant that prides itself on using local ingredients (try the sea bream, for example) and the wild Atlantic just outside the door. In July and August the rates are about 120 euros a person, including breakfast, though the hotel also offers various family packages. 
 WHERE TO EAT AND DRINK
 For local seafood and ambience near the Burren, try Linnane's Lobster Bar (New Quay, County Clare; 353-65-7078120). For about 80 euros, two can enjoy a lobster dinner with drinks. But a bowl of robust seafood chowder, with a pint, can fill you up for 9 euros.
 The Pier Head (The Quay, Kinvara, County Galway; 353-91-638188) has a more refined atmosphere, along with a fireplace and a view of Galway Bay. There's a prix fixe menu for 35 euros that includes chowder, an entree (anything from sea trout to duck) and dessert, and an inviting bar menu that includes, for example, a smoked salmon platter for about 11 euros.
 Finally, for drink and chat and occasional bursts of music, try Connolly's (The Quay, Kinvara; 353-91-637131) and Fahy's Travellers Inn (Nogra, Kinvara; 353-91-637116).

HEADLINE: Out of Africa, Passionately Packaged

BYLINE: By ROBERT CHRISTGAU

 BODY:
BECAUSE he grew up in Ghana, Ken Braun knew about the Beatles sooner than most American kids. 
 Mr. Braun's father, a doctor, had been so moved by Albert Schweitzer's autobiography that in 1957 he and his wife, a public-health nurse, moved to Ghana, where they spent 22 years in the bush with a Methodist relief organization. Their young son heard a lot of highlife, Africa's major Anglophone pop style. But the boarding school he attended in Accra was mostly British, and after vacations the students would bring back hot new 45s. So in 1963 Ken Braun became an 8-year-old Beatlemaniac.
 In itself, this story is merely an object lesson in the vagaries of musical experience. But with Mr. Braun it resonates because he ended up drawing on his background to make a musical difference. He went on to manage the American branch of the London label Sterns, since the 1980s one of the world's finest disseminators of African music. The greatest achievement of his career so far is ''The Voice of Lightness'' (2007), a 29-track double-CD package that cherry-picks music from the Congolese singer-bandleader Tabu Ley Rochereau's career from 1961 to 1977, when he was Africa's premier singer. 
 Mr. Braun is one of the few hundred Europeans and Americans who have made it their business to provide an international platform for the wealth of music Africa has generated since World War II. Working at a high level of idealism and gut commitment, each of them has different tastes and a different story; since most of them run their own small labels, those differences are reflected in the music they sell. 
 ''Americans tend to think of Africa as a huge, monolithic place full of nothing but troubles,'' Mr. Braun said. ''One way to correct that false impression is to expose Americans to African music.'' 
 For 15 years Sterns's American operation was based in Lower Manhattan. But for the last two years Mr. Braun has run it out of a tidy 10-by-30 storage unit in Belleville, N.J., near the house in Nutley where he maintains a cramped office. In a pinched time for CD sales -- and also, crucially for an importer, the dollar -- the physical operation is a metaphor for today's record business. The warehouse space holds Sterns's stock, now sold wholesale to a shrinking network of brick-and-mortar stores and retail via the Internet. The office is where Mr. Braun evaluated 600 songs by Mr. Rochereau, painstakingly sorting out the 29 best. 
 Mr. Braun is still very much a record man. In this time of curtailed release schedules, the Rochereau set assumes that a market still exists for well-produced collections of historically durable, readily enjoyable music: in this instance, two CDs in a slipcase with a handsomely illustrated 48-page booklet, featuring a comprehensive essay by Mr. Braun (in English and French) and personnel listings for the six featured bands. To break even Sterns needed to sell 6,000 physical copies of the package, which is available for $25.49 on amazon.com. Sales are now around 9,000, with money from downloads also trickling in. For a label like Sterns, ''The Voice of Lightness'' is a hit. 
 Non-Africans who have heard of Mr. Rochereau at all identify him with the Afro-Parisian phase of the Congolese style whose name morphed from rumba into soukous as its guitar breaks gained propulsion. But the first disc of ''The Voice of Lightness,'' which covers the period 1961 to 1969, is more of a song record than a groove record -- 18 tracks in which melody and structure trump rhythm and improvisation. So figure it's a good thing that it was assembled by a Beatles fan.
 Mr. Braun's fellow champions of African music have their own conversion experiences and approaches. A graduate-school year abroad in Ghana connected Robert Urbanus, the Dutch-born president of Sterns, to John Collins, a Ghanaian musician, entrepreneur and scholar. Mr. Urbanus seeks out a European audience for indigenous African pop, a philosophy epitomized by a Sterns associate, Trevor Herman, a South African-born D.J. who dance-tested seamless compilations like ''The Indestructible Beat of Soweto'' and ''Guitar Paradise of East Africa'' for his Earthworks imprint. 
 Jacob Edgar, an ethnomusicologist, promotes potential touring acts like Habib Koite of Mali on his Cumbancha label. Phil Stanton of the World Music Network had a precollege teaching gig in Kenya; he hops across genres, eras and regions in his Rough Guide series. ''We don't exclude anything, on principle,'' he said. ''We're not trying to create a uniform, homogeneous sound.''
 Mr. Braun's route to the music business was more like a circle. After college he had publishing jobs in Manhattan, where he frequented CBGB and the Mudd Club and bought releases by King Sunny Ade and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Asked to edit a world music survey at Rolling Stone Press, he immersed himself in African music more single-mindedly than he ever had in his youth.
 And soon he went back to where he once belonged. A three-year stint with Habitat for Humanity in the north of Zaire (now Congo) introduced him to the Lingala language and his wife, who is now a nurse. After he returned to the United States, Mr. Braun took over Sterns's American operation in 1993 and ran its retail shop on Warren Street in Lower Manhattan. It was a haven for Afropop lovers until the World Trade Center attack shut it down for four months, and it never recovered. 
 ''We felt very strongly that staying open just three blocks from ground zero was the best way we could respond peacefully to a bellicose time,'' he said. ''But the street traffic never came back.'' 
 Mr. Braun's time in Zaire had intensified his interest in soukous and in Mr. Rochereau, who remained a legend on his home turf even as the economic policies of President Mobutu Sese Seko destroyed the country's music business. In the United States, however, most African-music fans knew Mr. Rochereau largely from their reading. His few American albums only hinted at his achievement. 
 Now 68, Mr. Rochereau, whose real name is Pascal Emmanuel Sinamoyi Tabou, emerged from a working-class family in Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Congo). While still a student he wrote a hit song for the pioneering guitarist Joseph Kabasele, whose band he joined in 1959. He sang lead on that group's 1959 hit ''Kelya,'' which opens ''The Voice of Lightness'' in a fuller version recorded three years later.
 Soon leading bands of his own, Mr. Rochereau recorded constantly and hired superb local sidemen, including auxiliary vocalists almost as gruff as his great rival Luambo Franco or as delectable as himself. Mr. Rochereau is known for expanding the sebene, the instrumental break in which a lead instrument improvises off the backup guitarists' repeated unison phrases; the typical effect is a gently prolonged climax that subsides into Mr. Rochereau's vocal embrace. And whether singing in three European languages, hiring a full-time trap drummer or adopting James Brown's trick of stretching a single over two sides of a 45, he always conceived himself as an innovative internationalizer.
 Yet along with Mr. Franco he remained first and foremost Congolese, dominating the feverish Kinshasa music scene. Like any other pop star, though, Mr. Rochereau had hits and misses, and they sink into sameness for outsiders who don't understand Lingala or have Congolese rhythms in their bones. Hear one song, and chances are you'll enjoy it unless he's essaying an ill-conceived crossover, like covering ''Let It Be.'' Hear five songs, and you'll have trouble remembering the thrill of the first. This overproduction was aggravated by slipshod contracts, widespread piracy, overheated personal rivalries and byzantine label dealings. Mr. Rochereau finally gained control of his multilabeled catalog after joining the post-Mobutu government.
 According to Mr. Urbanus, Mr. Rochereau wanted a flat advance fee rather than royalties on the ''Voice of Lightness'' compilation, so strong sales won't benefit him financially. (Mr. Rochereau did not respond to requests for comment.) But Modero Mekansi, the singer's music director from 1977 to 1997, said money wasn't Mr. Rochereau's only object. ''Even when you're well known, you still want to be known by people who didn't know who you were before,'' Mr. Mekansi said. ''You want to be better known.'' He added that with so many European-based African labels going into bankruptcy, ''it's only Sterns that can do something good to keep people in touch with this music.''
 And like much non-English-language pop, Mr. Rochereau's music embodies an unfamiliar culture in unfamiliar forms, offering no linguistic clues. To effect a cross-cultural breakthrough, someone has to sort through his outpouring. It took Mr. Braun more than six months to boil his 600 Rochereau songs down to the 29 on ''The Voice of Lightness.'' 
 ''I wanted to show how he employed a wide range of influences -- traditional Congolese, Cuban, French pop, rock 'n' roll and funk -- in subtle, sophisticated ways,'' Mr. Braun said. 
 Mr. Rochereau's early records are compact because the ''idea was being able to say a lot in a brief period without so much repetition,'' Mr. Braun added. The songs from the '70s on Disc 2 of ''The Voice of Lightness'' average about seven minutes each, but he said the same values apply. ''Tabu Ley was such an arranger he knew how much time he would give to the verses and how much to the sebene section,'' he said. ''It wasn't jamming in the rock sense. Musicians would improvise, and they'd be expected to perform on the spot, but there wasn't the same sense of 'let's see where this would take us' because they knew damn well where it would take them.'' 
 Mr. Braun said he plans a second Rochereau package, two CDs that he hopes will show the world just how beautiful a dance workout can be. After that he plans to compile the music of the Congolese guitarist Doctor Nico. And how about Joseph Kabasele? The possibilities aren't endless because nothing is. But they could still fill the life of a music lover who discovered the Beatles in Accra when he was 8 years old.

HEADLINE: Who Needs to Travel When There's Home?

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
How much have you really explored your neighborhood? There's the diner where you've never eaten, the store you've never bothered to enter, the statue in the park that commemorates something -- you've never found out what. Who needs London or Paris, with these cultural riches so close at hand? 
 It may be a good year to try out this line of thought, as rising oil prices, a falling dollar and general economic insecurity make the summer vacation a ripe target for elimination. According to a new survey commissioned by Access America, a travel insurance company, only 33 percent of Americans plan to take a summer trip this year, compared with 40 percent last year. 
 The survey, conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs, also found that of those who do plan a trip, almost half intend to scale back their plans by eating out less, spending fewer days away or staying closer to home. That's bad news for international tourist destinations, but could be good news for that diner down the street. PHYLLIS KORKKI

HEADLINE: So You Think Gas Costs a Lot?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
INCREASING its longstanding appeal to mileage-conscious drivers, diesel fuel has for years cost less than gasoline, and even as recently as last summer the two were no worse than equal in price. Since then, a gallon of diesel has become more expensive than unleaded regular -- now 16 percent more and poised to go higher still.
 Both fuels are up steeply this year because of the cost of crude oil, which has doubled in the last year and is now around $3 a gallon. But why is the price of diesel, distilled from the same raw ingredient, growing faster?
 It's because higher prices affect demand for each oil product differently, and diesel is ''the one product the world really wants,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, a nonprofit group financed by oil producers, refiners and marketers, with some government help. 
 The price spread has attracted the attention of Congress. This month, John Felmy, chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association, testified before the highway subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee. ''U.S. overall petroleum demand, including demand for gasoline, has flattened,'' he said. ''However, in the U.S., demand for diesel has remained strong.''
 He added: ''This follows a long-term trend here and around the world. Over the past five years, U.S. demand for highway diesel has been rising at triple the rate of gasoline.'' 
 Part of the American demand for transportation fuel is met by refineries in Europe, a link that usually helps keep prices down. But demand for diesel is rising in Europe as passenger car ownership and use there grow; many of those newly purchased vehicles are diesel-powered, a choice that had been encouraged by tax policy there. 
 As a result, production at European refineries is geared toward processing crude oil to meet the demand for diesel. That produces surplus gasoline, which the refineries export to the East Coast of the United States, experts said. That does nothing for diesel supply here. 
 A related problem is that while American demand for gasoline and demand for diesel are fluctuating separately, the supply is linked.
 Each 42-gallon barrel of crude oil yields about 19 gallons of gasoline, according to the Energy Department, and about 10 gallons of diesel fuel and heating oil combined. (The two are chemically similar.) Refineries can crack the big hydrocarbon molecules found in the heavier part of the crude oil feedstock into diesel, gasoline or other products, and thus have some flexibility, but there are limits to how much the ratios can be adjusted. 
 ''There is some ability to do that, but it's not by huge percentages,'' said Ronald J. Planting, the manager of information and analysis at the American Petroleum Institute. 
 Diesel production was actually up for the first few months of this year compared with the period a year earlier, Mr. Planting said. But the outlook is cloudy. With gasoline prices high, demand has fallen; for March, April and the beginning of May of this year, inventories were running nearly 10 percent higher than a year earlier, according to the Energy Department. 
 Mr. Goldstein's interpretation is that refineries have thus decided to process slightly less crude oil than they would otherwise have used, which would result in less production of diesel as well. It is as if sirloin had become so expensive that demand dropped, so farmers raised fewer cows, reducing the supply of hamburger -- but hamburger remained as popular as ever.
 Mr. Goldstein said that the increased production of ethanol was also pushing up diesel prices by offsetting some of the need for gasoline, because as refiners make less gasoline they produce less diesel as well. ''Refiners, for more than 50 years, have been configured to make gasoline,'' he said. ''Their hardware is geared to make gasoline; that's what they know how to do.''
 He pointed out that several refineries had lost money in the last quarter and thus were cutting back operations, further restricting diesel supply, although gasoline inventories are ample.
 Shifting to diesel engines had been promoted as one way to save oil and meet coming fuel economy standards; because diesel engines operate at higher cylinder pressures, they deliver more power for each B.T.U. of energy they use (and each gallon has more B.T.U.'s than gasoline). But while they may have a big edge in fuel efficiency, their cost efficiency, in cents a mile, is shrinking. 
 The shift in fuel prices is coming just as automakers, after years of work to make diesel engines cleaner, are preparing to sell diesel-powered passenger vehicles. The strategy now looks iffy because diesel models cost more than the equivalent gasoline vehicles.
 Automakers understand that high costs will make the vehicles harder to sell. ''In the marketplace, the consumer has to have a compelling economic reason to put a premium on fuel economy, or any particular engine technology,'' Greg Martin, a General Motors spokesman, said. 
 So is it a good idea to buy a diesel? ''It's a very good question when you consider the current price of diesel,'' he said. For a car shopper to buy a diesel model, he said, the perceived benefit must always equal or exceed the cost. ''Right now that would be problematic.''
 Mercedes-Benz is slightly more optimistic. Customers may still buy because of the long range on a tankful -- 700 miles in the E320 diesel sedan, the company said. And that model's fuel economy -- 23 in town and 32 on the highway compared with the gasoline-powered E350 at 17 and 24 m.p.g. -- is enough of a gain that there is still a cost advantage, though smaller than in the past. 
 The diesel E-Class costs $1,000 more than the gasoline model, said Nicole Weiss, a spokeswoman. And ''the luxury market typically lags behind in terms of reacting to changes in the economy,'' she said.
 Terry Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader, said the problem was that the oil industry, despite record profits, had not invested enough in refining capacity for diesel fuel. ''There's really no excuse why we've got this shortage of capacity, which in turn is driving prices far higher than for gasoline,'' he said.
 He added that the economic downturn should be depressing the demand for truck fuel, which should relieve strains on the diesel market. ''But I haven't really seen that,'' he said. ''I'm not convinced there's justification for the level of diesel we're seeing today.''

HEADLINE: Doctors Start to Say 'I'm Sorry' Long Before 'See You in Court'

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
In 40 years as a highly regarded cancer surgeon, Dr. Tapas K. Das Gupta had never made a mistake like this.
 As with any doctor, there had been occasional errors in diagnosis or judgment. But never, he said, had he opened up a patient and removed the wrong sliver of tissue, in this case a segment of the eighth rib instead of the ninth. 
 Once an X-ray provided proof in black and white, Dr. Das Gupta, the 74-year-old chairman of surgical oncology at the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago, did something that normally would make hospital lawyers cringe: he acknowledged his mistake to his patient's face, and told her he was deeply sorry.
 ''After all these years, I cannot give you any excuse whatsoever,'' Dr. Das Gupta, now 76, said he told the woman and her husband. ''It is just one of those things that occurred. I have to some extent harmed you.'' 
 For decades, malpractice lawyers and insurers have counseled doctors and hospitals to ''deny and defend.'' Many still warn clients that any admission of fault, or even expression of regret, is likely to invite litigation and imperil careers.
 But with providers choking on malpractice costs and consumers demanding action against medical errors, a handful of prominent academic medical centers, like Johns Hopkins and Stanford, are trying a disarming approach.
 By promptly disclosing medical errors and offering earnest apologies and fair compensation, they hope to restore integrity to dealings with patients, make it easier to learn from mistakes and dilute anger that often fuels lawsuits.
 Malpractice lawyers say that what often transforms a reasonable patient into an indignant plaintiff is less an error than its concealment, and the victim's concern that it will happen again.
 Despite some projections that disclosure would prompt a flood of lawsuits, hospitals are reporting decreases in their caseloads and savings in legal costs. Malpractice premiums have declined in some instances, though market forces may be partly responsible.
 At the University of Michigan Health System, one of the first to experiment with full disclosure, existing claims and lawsuits dropped to 83 in August 2007 from 262 in August 2001, said Richard C. Boothman, the medical center's chief risk officer.
 ''Improving patient safety and patient communication is more likely to cure the malpractice crisis than defensiveness and denial,'' Mr. Boothman said.
 Mr. Boothman emphasized that he could not know whether the decline was due to disclosure or safer medicine, or both. But the hospital's legal defense costs and the money it must set aside to pay claims have each been cut by two-thirds, he said. The time taken to dispose of cases has been halved.
 The number of malpractice filings against the University of Illinois has dropped by half since it started its program just over two years ago, said Dr. Timothy B. McDonald, the hospital's chief safety and risk officer. In the 37 cases where the hospital acknowledged a preventable error and apologized, only one patient has filed suit. Only six settlements have exceeded the hospital's medical and related expenses.
 In Dr. Das Gupta's case in 2006, the patient retained a lawyer but decided not to sue, and, after a brief negotiation, accepted $74,000 from the hospital, said her lawyer, David J. Pritchard.
 ''She told me that the doctor was completely candid, completely honest, and so frank that she and her husband -- usually the husband wants to pound the guy -- that all the anger was gone,'' Mr. Pritchard said. ''His apology helped get the case settled for a lower amount of money.'' 
 The patient, a young nurse, declined to be interviewed. 
 Mr. Pritchard said his client netted about $40,000 after paying medical bills and legal expenses. He said she had the rib removed at another hospital and learned it was not cancerous. ''You have no idea what a relief that was,'' Dr. Das Gupta said. 
 Some advocates argue that the new disclosure policies may reduce legal claims but bring a greater measure of equity by offering reasonable compensation to every injured patient. 
 Recent studies have found that one of every 100 hospital patients suffers negligent treatment, and that as many as 98,000 die each year as a result. But studies also show that as few as 30 percent of medical errors are disclosed to patients. 
 Only a small fraction of injured patients -- perhaps 2 percent -- press legal claims.
 ''There is no reason the patient should have to pay the economic consequences for our mistakes,'' said Dr. Lucian L. Leape, an authority on patient safety at Harvard, which recently adopted disclosure principles at its hospitals. ''But we're pushing uphill on this. Most doctors don't really believe that if they're open and honest with patients they won't be sued.'' 
 The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, and groups like the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have adopted standards encouraging disclosure. Guidelines vary, however, and can be vague. While many hospitals have written policies to satisfy accreditation requirements, only a few are pursuing them aggressively, industry officials said. 
 ''We're still learning the most effective way to have these most difficult conversations,'' said Nancy E. Foster, the hospital association's vice president for quality and patient safety. ''It's a time of high stress for the patient and for the physician. It's also a time where information is imperfect.''
 The policies seem to work best at hospitals that are self-insured and that employ most or all of their staffs, limiting the number of parties at the table. Such is the case at the Veterans Health Administration, which pioneered the practice in the late 1980s at its hospital in Lexington, Ky., and now requires the disclosure of all adverse events, even those that are not obvious.
 To give doctors comfort, 34 states have enacted laws making apologies for medical errors inadmissible in court, said Doug Wojcieszak, founder of The Sorry Works! Coalition, a group that advocates for disclosure. Four states have gone further and protected admissions of culpability. Seven require that patients be notified of serious unanticipated outcomes. 
 Before they became presidential rivals, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, both Democrats, co-sponsored federal legislation in 2005 that would have made apologies inadmissible. The measure died in a committee under Republican control. Mrs. Clinton included the measure in her campaign platform but did not reintroduce it when the Democrats took power in 2007. Her Senate spokesman, Philippe Reines, declined to explain beyond saying that ''there are many ways to pursue a proposal.'' 
 The Bush administration plans a major crackdown on medical errors in October, when it starts rejecting Medicare claims for the added expense of treating preventable complications. But David M. Studdert, an authority on patient safety in the United States who teaches at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said the focus on disclosure reflected a lack of progress in reducing medical errors.
 ''If we can't prevent these things, then at least we have to be forthright with people when they occur,'' Mr. Studdert said.
 For the hospitals at the forefront of the disclosure movement, the transition from inerrancy to transparency has meant a profound, if halting, shift in culture.
 At the University of Illinois, doctors, nurses and medical students now undergo training in how to respond when things go wrong. A tip line has helped drive a 30 percent increase in staff reportingof irregularities.
 Quality improvement committees openly examine cases that once would have vanished into sealed courthouse files. Errors become teaching opportunities rather than badges of shame.
 ''I think this is the key to patient safety in the country,'' Dr. McDonald said. ''If you do this with a transparent point of view, you're more likely to figure out what's wrong and put processes in place to improve it.'' 
 For instance, he said, a sponge left inside an patient led the hospital to start X-raying patients during and after surgery. Eight objects have been found, one of them an electrode that dislodged from a baby's scalp during a Caesarian section in 2006.
 The mother, Maria Del Rosario Valdez, said she was not happy that a second operation was required to retrieve the wire but recognized the error had been accidental. She rejected her sister's advice to call a lawyer, saying that she did not want the bother and that her injuries were not that severe.
 Ms. Valdez said she was gratified that the hospital quickly acknowledged its mistake, corrected it without charge and later improved procedures for keeping track of electrodes. ''They took the time to explain it and to tell me they were sorry,'' she said. ''I felt good that they were taking care of what they had done.'' 
 There also has been an attitudinal shift among plaintiff's lawyers who recognize that injured clients benefit when they are compensated quickly, even if for less. That is particularly true now that most states have placed limits on non-economic damages.
 In Michigan, trial lawyers have come to understand that Mr. Boothman will offer prompt and fair compensation for real negligence but will give no quarter in defending doctors when the hospital believes that the care was appropriate. 
 ''The filing of a lawsuit at the University of Michigan is now the last option, whereas with other hospitals it tends to be the first and only option,'' said Norman D. Tucker, a trial lawyer in Southfield, Mich. ''We might give cases a second look before filing because if it's not going to settle quickly, tighten up your cinch. It's probably going to be a long ride.''

THE BIG SORT 
 Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart. 
 By Bill Bishop with Robert G. Cushing. 
 370 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $25. 
 As catchy pop-social science coinages go, ''the Big Sort'' may not have quite the pith or resonance of, say, ''bobos'' or ''tipping points.'' But in attempting to define and argue the implications of the sweeping social and political balkanization that has swept across America over the last 30 years, Bill Bishop has set his sights ambitiously on David Brooks and Malcolm Gladwell territory: identifying a big, worldview-changing social science phenomenon, and interpreting it for a popular audience. 
 Superficially, the phenomenon Bishop is examining is not new, and the litany of division he recites is familiar. The two major political parties have become more extreme and can't find common ground anymore. National civic groups and mainline church denominations have withered away, replaced by smaller, more narrowly focused independent groups. Marketers (and political pollsters) have sliced up the population into increasingly ''microtargeted'' segments. The three-network era of mass media, which helped create a national hearth of shared references and values, is long gone, displaced by a new media landscape that has splintered us into thousands of insular tribes. We can no longer even agree on what used to be called facts: Conservatives watch Fox; liberals watch MSNBC. Blogs and RSS feeds now make it easy to produce and inhabit a cultural universe tailored to fit your social values, your musical preferences, your view on every single political issue. We're bowling alone -- or at least only with people who resemble us, and agree with us, in nearly every conceivable way. 
 This separation into solipsistic blocs would perhaps not be so complete if people of different political views or cultural values at least lived within hailing distance, and encountered one another on the street or in the store from time to time. But, increasingly, they don't. Over the last decade, as 100 million Americans have moved from one place to another, they've clustered in increasingly homogeneous communities. This is where ''The Big Sort,'' which grew out of a series of articles that Bishop, formerly a reporter at The Austin American-Statesman, wrote with Robert Cushing, a retired sociologist and statistician from the University of Texas, is both wonkiest and most original. Working with a team of collaborators (including Richard Florida, the author of ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), Bishop and Cushing swam around in different sets of data -- voting records; I.R.S. income figures; patent filings; poll numbers from advertising firms -- to figure out how thoroughly, and in what ways, Americans had sorted themselves. Their conclusion: ''By the turn of the 21st century, it seemed as though the country was separating in every way conceivable.'' 
 Americans have always moved around restlessly. But whereas in earlier times large flows of people -- the ''great migration'' of African-Americans to Chicago in the 1950s, for instance, or the ''hillbilly highway'' that took white Appalachians to the Midwest after World War II -- were motivated primarily by the quest for economic opportunity, American migration is now inspired at least as much by ''lifestyle'' choices as by economics. ''We have built a country,'' Bishop writes, ''where everyone can choose the neighbors (and church and news shows) most compatible with his or her lifestyle and beliefs. And we are living with the consequences of this segregation by way of life: pockets of like-minded citizens that have become so ideologically inbred that we don't know, can't understand, and can barely conceive of 'those people' who live just a few miles away.'' 
 Bishop argues that this clustering of like with like accelerated in the tumult of the 1960s when, unmoored from the organizations and traditions that had guided their choices about how to live, Americans grew anxious and disoriented -- and reflexively sought comfort in the familiar, cocooning themselves in communities of people like themselves. This sorting was compounded in the 1980s and '90s as the clustering of educated people in certain cities produced regional wage disparities -- which in turn attracted more-highly educated people to the richer cities, which in turn accentuated the economic disparities between cities, creating a cycle of division that shows little sign of relenting.
 This intense geographic sorting helps account for an abiding weirdness in American politics. Congress is split right down the middle, or nearly so; the last two presidential elections have been achingly close; half the nation, almost by definition, must disagree with you politically -- and yet you have probably met very few of your antagonists. ''How can the polls be neck and neck,'' the playwright Arthur Miller lamented during the 2004 election, ''when I don't know one Bush supporter?''
 Gerrymandering -- the redrawing of political districts by partisan legislation from above -- partly accounts for increasing polarization. But the more significant force, Bishop argues, has been movement from below. In 1976, the year in the postwar era when the average American was most likely to live alongside people of the opposing political party, barely 26 percent of us lived in counties that went in a landslide for one presidential candidate or another. In 1992, nearly 38 percent of us lived in a ''landslide county.'' By 2004, nearly 50 percent did. 
 Does this balkanization matter? Bishop argues convincingly that it does. Psychological studies suggest that the mere fact of division, even when there is no substantive content to it, can be corrosive: in a series of experiments in the 1950s and '60s, groups of similar people arbitrarily divided into subgroups quickly exploded into conflicts of ''Lord of the Flies''-like intensity. Other studies have shown that when relatively like-minded people are grouped together, they don't settle around the average point of view of the individuals in the group but rather become more extreme in the direction toward which they're already inclined. This gives clustering a powerful self-reinforcing quality, and helps explain how American counties have hardened into such immovable political clumps. ''It doesn't seem to matter if you're a frat boy, a French high school student, a petty criminal or a federal appeals court judge,'' Bishop writes. ''Mixed company moderates; like-minded company polarizes. Heterogeneous communities restrain group excesses; homogeneous communities march toward the extremes.'' 
 The founding fathers didn't need social psychology experiments to understand that homogeneity could be dangerous. In their wisdom, they created a system of government that called for constant conversation and compromise among competing interests -- what Alexander Hamilton called the ''jarring of parties.'' This system has proved durable and effective, but it breaks down when people of different parties or points of view no longer intermingle at all. 
 Are we doomed to retreat ever farther into our enclaves? A few pages from the end of the book, Bishop writes (in a notably wooden but unfortunately typical sentence) that ''it's wishful thinking to predict that a Generation Y L.B.J. will emerge to become ... some kind of Web-based 'deus ex MySpace' politician who could forge a national consensus out of our disparate communities.'' But then, as if hedging his bets, Bishop has included a footnote: ''Barack Obama presented himself early in the 2008 campaign as the man-of-the-earth candidate, the politician able and eager to speak to -- and listen to -- all sides.'' Even so, Bishop's view seems to be that no single candidate or election cycle can reverse these powerful trends; that only the rise of a ''cross-cutting'' issue -- something that realigns political alliances across existing boundaries -- can restore a sense of common purpose. 
 Actually, there may be another way. Bishop cites research suggesting that, contrary to the standard goo-goo exhortations, the surer route to political comity may be less civic engagement, less passionate conviction. So let's hear it for the indifferent and unsure, whose passivity may provide the national glue we need.

 Illustrated. 800 pp. Amistad/HarperCollins Publishers. $35. 
 If slavery is America's original sin, lynching is its capital crime. The historical memory dies hard: only last year, three nooses were hung from a schoolyard tree contested by white and black students in Jena, La. 
 The wave of mob killings of blacks in the South -- by hanging, burning, shooting and torture -- started after the end of Reconstruction. These public murders were carried out with the real purpose of keeping blacks in their place, economically and socially. The practice was supported by leading citizens and became a popular public spectacle, a carnival of cruelty that drew excited crowds. 
 According to ''Rope and Faggot,'' the 1928 study by the N.A.A.C.P. general secretary Walter White, between 1882 and 1927 there were 4,951 lynchings in the United States. About a third of them were aimed at whites, mainly in the West; 92 of the victims were women. 
 Ida B. Wells-Barnett was one of the first African-Americans to raise an informed protest against this outrage. Paula Giddings's devoted and scrupulous biography is not the first study of this pioneering woman, but it is a comprehensive work that attempts to portray her as part of the progressive movement that emerged among the black bourgeoisie in post-bellum America. Wells-Barnett dedicated her life to bringing lynchings to the attention of America and the world. Determined, outspoken and fearless, an incendiary pamphleteer, she was politically astute, anticipating the tactics of the civil rights movement. Giddings, a professor of African-American studies at Smith College and author of ''Where and When I Enter,'' a history of black women activists, brushes in the historical context of Wells-Barnett's campaign ably, if in occasionally numbing detail. Excavating scattered letters, fragmented diaries and second-hand references to her writings for short-lived African-American weeklies, Giddings aims, she writes, to uncover the achievements of a bold woman whose militancy and ''dominating style'' sometimes cost her allies in her own day and proper credit in the eyes of history.
 Ida Bell Wells was born to slave parents in 1862 in Holly Springs, Miss. Her father, a skilled carpenter, and mother, a housekeeper, were struck down by yellow fever when Ida was 16. Giddings writes of this turning point: ''Throughout the remainder of her life, she struggled to turn the negative emotions of abandonment into a righteous determination to reform herself and the society that had forsaken her race.'' 
 A precociously mature, bright and pretty teenager, standing barely five feet, Wells took charge of the upbringing of her younger siblings with help from relatives. She got some higher education, became a voracious reader with a love of Shakespeare and showed a talent for writing. She turned to teaching school to support her family, eventually moving in 1880 to Memphis. There she siphoned off some of her energy into journalism, turning out a column for a local African-American paper that regularly challenged the racist libels of the white press. Yet she remained very much the Victorian young lady who admired ''noble true womanhood and perfect ladyship'' and vowed to curb her ''unfeminine'' anger. 
 Her craving for ''perfect ladyship'' toughened into a demand for respect. Black women at the time were often demeaned as dusky temptresses, which presumably explained their illicit sexual attraction to so many white men. Wells lashed out against the ''wholesale contemptuous defamation of black women'' and the ''refusal to believe there are among us mothers, wives and maidens who have attained a true, noble and refining womanhood.'' Her determination to be treated as a lady provoked her first clash with white supremacy, in 1883, when she violently resisted being ejected from the whites-only ''ladies car.'' She sued the railroad, but the Tennessee Supreme Court, in a preview of Plessy v. Ferguson, ruled she was no lady, merely a ''mulatto passenger,'' separable and unequal, whose intention wasn't to ride comfortably but to ''harrass'' and litigate.
 Wells's anti-lynching crusade hinged on a word ladies did not utter: ''rape.'' Defenders of the Snopesian New South, fearing Northern capitalists would pull out investments, claimed that lynching was a necessary response to an epidemic of attacks on white women by ravening black men. Defying Victorian gentility, Wells debunked this propaganda with evidence that accusations of rape were a factor in less than one-third of lynchings.
 The campaign that became her life's work really started in 1892 with the murders of her friend Tommie Moss and two others by a Memphis mob. Moss's offense had nothing to do with rape; he was defending the cooperative grocery of which he was president against a group of whites he believed were bent on destroying it. A solid citizen who also worked as a postman, Moss was captured with two others and jailed. A mob abducted them and put them to a slow, painful death by gunshots. The Memphis Appeal-Avalanche boasted that the lynching was ''one of the most orderly of its kind ever conducted.'' 
 Wells, who had since moved to New York, was shocked by Moss's death. It was ''our first lesson in white supremacy,'' she declared. Writing about the affair in Free Speech, the paper she began editing in 1889, she almost got herself lynched by daring to suggest that white men who ''overreach'' in charges of rape might end up being ''very damaging to the moral reputation of their women.'' Infuriated whites trashed her newspaper office and would have killed her had she not been out of town.
 Wells decided to stay in New York, and soon set down in an African-American paper a long article, ''The Truth About Lynching,'' expanding on her contention that some white women chose to consort with black men and that black women were exploited by white men. She called for boycotts and strikes by blacks to protest lynchings. ''The Winchester rifle,'' she wrote, ''should have a place of honor in every black home,'' since government refused to protect them. She herself bought a gun, but investigative journalism was her primary weapon. From a variety of platforms, she broadcast authoritative facts, statistics and case histories. 
 One of her pamphlets was devoted to an 1899 auto-da-fe in Palmetto, Ga., where a laborer named Sam Hose was accused of killing his employer, raping his wife and throwing their baby onto the floor. (A private detective hired by Wells showed that the wife had never in fact accused Hose of rape.) Hose was taken to the town square, tied to a tree and stripped naked. His ears, fingers and penis were sliced off, and then he was burned alive. Afterward, bits of charred bone, slices of liver and even parts of the tree were sold as souvenirs. 
 The tide of lynchings continued to terrorize Southern blacks well into the 20th century. Local authorities covered up for the mobs, while the federal government looked the other way. In the early 1920s the federal anti-lynching legislation Wells-Barnett had championed died in the Senate. 
 Meanwhile, Ida had in 1895 married a Chicago lawyer named Ferdinand Barnett, a feminist who contributed his legal skills to the cause, suing to enforce Illinois's anti-lynching laws. She settled in Chicago and bore four children, even as she continued lecture tours and meetings and ran The Conservator, a black paper her husband owned. Inspired by Jane Addams, she created programs for young black men and women patterned after those of Hull House. Susan B. Anthony endorsed her cause, and Wells joined the suffragists. But Anthony and others in the movement feared alienating their Dixie membership, so Wells concentrated on organizing black women to get out the vote for race candidates in local elections. Not long before her death in 1931, she ran unsuccessfully for state senator.
 Ida Wells-Barnett was among the first to grasp that the battle against lynching was the moral cutting edge of African-Americans' struggle for equality. In fighting words and brave personal witness, she exposed lynching as a crime against a people.

HEADLINE: Biofuels For Jet Travel

 BODY:
To the Editor: The May 4 Green Traveler column (''Trying to Lighten that Carbon Footprint'') cites Friends of the Earth's negative comments regarding Richard Branson's biofueled flight and the drawbacks of producing biofuels for air travel. Friends of the Earth is considering only the current state of biofuel technology. Mr. Branson showed a successful ''proof of concept'' that might have boosted the confidence of consumers, industry, policy makers and investors and catalyzed more biofuel research. Evidence that biofuels work in a high-risk and unforgiving mode of transportation is a major step forward in powering them past the novelty stage. 
 Christopher M. Reddy Woods Hole, Mass.
 To the Editor: Presenting biofuels as an easy answer to climate change is misleading. Just because the term ''biofuel'' contains ''bio'' does not mean it's the best option.
 Beyond food shortages, biofuels cause a host of social and economic problems in developing countries. Important agricultural land and rich forests are converted into plantations that large landholders run, with no real benefits to local communities. What's worse is that we get little payoff. Biofuels still produce carbon and stopping climate change requires more than small declines in aircraft emissions.
 There's no magic pill to cure climate change, and it's time Americans understand this. Yet there is hope in our individual actions: the more we reduce consumption, the better off the whole world will be.

HEADLINE: World's Poor Pay Price as Crop Research Is Cut

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: LOS BANOS, Philippines 

 BODY:
The brown plant hopper, an insect no bigger than a gnat, is multiplying by the billions and chewing through rice paddies in East Asia, threatening the diets of many poor people. 
 The damage to rice crops, occurring at a time of scarcity and high prices, could have been prevented. Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute here say that they know how to create rice varieties resistant to the insects but that budget cuts have prevented them from doing so.
 This is a stark example of the many problems that are coming to light in the world's agricultural system. Experts say that during the food surpluses of recent decades, governments and development agencies lost focus on the importance of helping poor countries improve their agriculture.
 The budgets of institutions that delivered the world from famine in the 1970s, including the rice institute, have stagnated or fallen, even as the problems they were trying to solve became harder. 
 ''People felt that the world food crisis was solved, that food security was no longer an issue, and it really fell off the agenda,'' said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the rice institute.
 Vital research programs have been slashed. At the rice institute, scientists have identified 14 genetic traits that could help rice plants survive the plant hopper, which sucks the juices out of young plants while infecting them with viruses. But the scientists have had no money to breed these traits into the world's most widely used rice varieties.
 The institute is the world's main repository of rice seeds as well as genetic and other information about rice, the crop that feeds nearly half the world's people. 
 But nowadays at the International Rice Research Institute, greenhouses have peeling paint and holes in their screens and walls. Hallways are dotted with empty offices. In the 1980s, the institute employed five entomologists, or insect experts, overseeing a staff of 200. Now it has one entomologist with a staff of eight. 
 ''We've had an exodus here,'' said Yvette Naredo, an assistant geneticist.
 Similar troubles plague other centers in Asia, Africa and Latin America that work on crop productivity in poor countries. Agricultural experts have complained about the flagging efforts for years and warned of the risks. 
 ''Nobody was listening,'' said Thomas Lumpkin, director general of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico.
 Now, a reckoning is at hand. Growth of the global food supply has slowed even as the population has continued to increase, and as economic growth is giving millions of poor people the money to buy more food.
 With demand beginning to outstrip supply, prices have soared, and food riots have erupted that have undermined the stability of foreign governments. World leaders are scrambling to respond. On May 1, President Bush asked Congress for an extra $770 million to pay for food aid and to help farmers improve their productivity.
 But cuts in agricultural research continue. The United States is in the midst of slashing, by as much as 75 percent, its $59.5 million annual support for a global research network that focuses on improving crops vital to agriculture in poor countries. That network includes the rice institute.
 Robert Bertram, who oversees the funding for the United States Agency for International Development, said he was still trying to stop the cuts and argued that research to improve crop yields was ''like putting money in the pockets of poor people, and I mean billions of poor people.'' 
 The Agency for International Development is the primary vehicle for the American government to finance development projects abroad. James R. Kunder, its acting deputy administrator, said the agency hoped to reconsider the cutbacks if Congress allows extra money.
 Crop by crop and country by country, agricultural research and development are lagging.
 The center in Mexico has created drought-tolerant corn for Africa and higher-yielding, disease-resistant wheat for South Asia. But it does not have the money to get the varieties into the hands of poor farmers.
 In Africa, where yields have remained stagnant since the 1960s, efforts to bolster them have been hampered by cuts not only in research but also in programs like fertilizer distribution.
 Even in the United States, long a world leader in agricultural research, some money has been shifted away from crop-productivity work into issues like nutrition and food safety.
 The biggest cutbacks have come in donations to agriculture in poor countries from the governments of wealthy countries and in loans from development institutions that the wealthy governments control, like the World Bank. Such projects include not only research on pests and crops but also programs to help farmers adopt improved methods in their fields. 
 Adjusting for inflation and exchange rates, the wealthy countries, as a group, cut such donations roughly in half from 1980 to 2006, to $2.8 billion a year from $6 billion. The United States cut its support for agriculture in poor countries to $624 million from $2.3 billion in that period.
 ''Agriculture has been so productive and done so well, people have kind of lost sight of how fragile it really is,'' said Jan E. Leach, a plant pathologist at Colorado State University who works with rice. ''It's as if we have lost track of the fact that food is linked to agriculture, which is linked to human survival.''
 Cooperation on Crops
 Agricultural research and development work is never done. The demand for food keeps growing. Insects and plant diseases adapt, overcoming efforts to thwart them.
 In the 1960s, population growth was far outrunning food production, threatening famine in many poor countries. But then wealthier nations joined forces with the poor countries to improve crop yields. Countries like India and Pakistan embraced new plant varieties, irrigation projects and fertilizer programs in a vast effort that came to be known as the Green Revolution. 
 Yields soared, and by the 1980s, the threat of starvation had receded in most of the world. With Europe and the United States offering their farmers heavy subsidies that encouraged production, grain became abundant worldwide, and prices fell. 
 Many poor countries, instead of developing their own agriculture, turned to the world market to buy cheap rice and wheat. In 1986, Agriculture Secretary John Block called the idea of developing countries feeding themselves ''an anachronism from a bygone era,'' saying they should just buy American.
 Additional factors prompted wealthy countries to shift their donations away from agriculture. For instance, advocacy groups criticized some of the environmental problems arising from intensive farming, weakening support for the Green Revolution. And urgent new priorities like the AIDS crisis in Africa captured the world's attention.
 Advocates for agriculture fought a losing battle to stop the cutbacks -- nowhere more than in the World Bank, the huge institution in Washington that makes low-interest loans to poor countries for development projects. 
 Adjusted for inflation, the World Bank cut its agricultural lending to $2 billion in 2004 from $7.7 billion in 1980.
 The Green Revolution had led to creation of a global network of research centers focusing on agriculture and food production, with 14 institutes -- including the International Rice Research Institute -- scattered across Asia, Africa and Latin America, in addition to a research office in Washington. The centers, known collectively as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, carry much of the burden of improving crop yields in developing countries.
 As the world lost its focus on crops, the budgets of some of the centers were cut. At others, the budgets stayed level or even rose, but donors increasingly directed the money toward worthwhile but ancillary projects like environmental research. Spending fell on the laborious plant-breeding programs needed to improve crop productivity.
 As these trends played out, the stage was being set for a food emergency. 
 From 1970 to 1990, the peak Green Revolution years, the food supply grew faster than the world population. But after 1990, food's growth rate fell below population growth, according to a report by Ronald Trostle, a researcher at the Agriculture Department.
 Around 2004, the world economy began growing more quickly, about 5 percent a year. So as the food supply was lagging, millions of people were gaining the money to improve their diets.
 The world began to use more grain than it was producing, cutting into reserves, and prices started rising. Early this year, as stocks fell to perilous levels, international grain prices doubled or even tripled, threatening as many as 100 million people with malnutrition.
 Slow Recovery for Aid
 At the World Bank, agricultural financing has begun to recover. Under a new president, Robert B. Zoellick, the bank has decided to double its lending for such programs in Africa. After President Bush's request to Congress, other wealthy countries are joining the United States in increasing their support.
 But the case of the brown plant hopper shows there will be no quick fix for the years of neglect.
 The insect is not a new problem. In the 1960s, the rice institute, nestled between jungle and the bustling town of Los Banos, pioneered ways to help farmers grow two and even three crops a season, instead of one. 
 But with rice plants growing more of the year, the hoppers -- which live only on rice plants -- had longer to multiply, and became a bigger concern.
 The institute responded by testing thousands of varieties of wild rice for natural resistance. Researchers found four types of resistance and bred them into commercial varieties by 1980.
 But brown plant hoppers adapted swiftly, and the resistant strains started losing their effectiveness in the 1990s. An important insecticide lost its punch, too, as the hopper developed the ability to withstand up to 100 times the dose that used to kill it.
 While the insect was adapting, the rice institute was being gutted. 
 Its money comes come from government donations, foundation grants and assistance from development institutions like the Asian Development Bank, an affiliate of the World Bank. After peaking in the early 1990s, the rice institute's budget has been cut in half after adjusting for inflation, a reflection of the larger cutbacks in global agriculture.
 Several dozen important varieties of rice have been lost from the institute's gene bank through poor storage. Promising work on rice varieties that could withstand high temperatures and saltier water -- ideal for coping with global warming and the higher sea levels that may follow -- had to be abandoned.
 A potential solution is at hand for the plant hopper problem. No fewer than 14 new types of genetic resistance have been discovered. But with the budget cuts, the institute has mounted no effort to breed these traits into widely used rice varieties.
 Doing so now would take four to seven years, if money could be found. In the meantime, the hoppers have become a growing threat. China, the world's biggest rice producer, announced on May 7 that it was struggling to control the rapid spread of the insects there. A plant hopper outbreak can destroy 20 percent of a harvest; China is trying to hold losses to 5 percent in affected fields. 
 ''We must stay ahead of rapidly evolving pests -- and increasingly, a changing climate -- to assure global food security,'' said Mr. Zeigler, the rice institute's director. ''Cutting back on agricultural research today is pure folly.''

A WORLDWIDE RICE CRISIS: Demand for rice, which feeds almost half the world's people, is growing faster than supply. One reason is the brown plant hopper, which destroys rice plants. Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, the world's main repository of seeds, genes and other information about rice, are trying to solve these problems by developing stronger varieties of rice. But they say they have been hamstrung by years of budget cuts. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY LUIS LIWANAG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) CHART: LOSING FOCUS ON FOOD PRODUCTION: Amid food surpluses, agricultural development aid from wealthy nations to poorer ones declined . . . . . . which led to a decline in the kind of research that created higher crop yields. The importance of such research is becoming clear as annual demand for cereals like rice has begun to outstrip production. Agricultural output has particularly lagged in Africa.

HEADLINE: Stock Gains Defy Reports of Weakness

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market gained ground last week, despite surging oil prices and sharp declines in consumer confidence and in the construction of single-family homes. 
 Consumer confidence in May was at the lowest level since June 1980, according to a survey by Reuters and the University of Michigan. The Commerce Department said construction of single-family homes in April was at its lowest monthly level since January 1991, although construction of multifamily units rose significantly.
 Oil futures in New York rose to $126.29 a barrel, a new high, up from $125.96 the previous week. Alcoa gained 10.5 percent for the week, the biggest gain in the Dow Jones industrial average.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 240.92 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 12,986.80. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 37.07 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 1,425.35. The Nasdaq composite index gained 83.33 points, or 3.4 percent, to close at 2,528.85. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.84 percent from 3.77 percent the previous week.

Sniff, Sniff
 Q. When I buy flowers at a bodega, the flowers sometimes look perfectly fresh, but they don't seem to have any smell. Why not?
 A. Mother Nature didn't create those wonderful smells for you or your beloved. Alex Feleppa, director of horticulture at the Horticultural Society of New York, said she is always reminding people that the aromas are meant for bees and other pollinators. 
 Once a flower has been pollinated, Ms. Feleppa wrote in an e-mail message, it often loses its scent because it is no longer needed. ''In most cases,'' she added, ''the goal has been achieved and the task accomplished. End of fragrance.''
 The other big reason is the simple economics of the cut-flower industry. As Amy Stewart noted in her book ''Flower Confidential,'' many cut flowers were bred for shipping, color and shape, not for scent. And so the scent disappeared. 
 Without the Tourists
 Q. What would happen if all the tourists who visit New York stayed home one year?
 A. If that had happened last year, the city would have lost 46 million visitors and $28 billion in spending, based on projected figures prepared for NYC & Company, the city's marketing arm. (By comparison, the city's education budget is $17 billion.) 
 The city's 30,000 hotel employees would be in big trouble. There would have been 23 million more vacancies in the city's 73,500 hotel rooms. With average daily room rates at $295, the hotel industry would have been out $6.8 billion.
 The 39 Broadway theaters alone would have lost a substantial chunk of their 12.9 million ticket-buyers in 2007. By comparison, the stagehands' strike that darkened much of Broadway for two and a half weeks last year deprived the city of nearly $40 million.
 Disaster would befall restaurants, retail stores, cabbies and workers at the airports.
 On the other hand, Times Square would be less crowded, assuming anything was open.
 Once, Before Calculators
 Q. I often walk along Fulton Street and have become intrigued by the architecture of No. 127, built for the Keuffel & Esser Company. I'm especially curious about the images of measuring instruments on the facade. Does the firm have an interesting history?
 A. We asked the architectural historian Christopher Gray about the eight-story Renaissance Revival structure. 
 ''I love that building,'' he responded. ''My wild guess is that you are a young whippersnapper who never used a slide rule.'' Keuffel & Esser was known for its slide rules and other mathematical instruments, and requested that the architectural firm De Lemos & Cordes design its 1893 headquarters with images of a compass, triangle, pliers and mallet in the frieze.
 Keuffel & Esser vacated the property in 1961, according to a report for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and various businesses have occupied it since.

HEADLINE: As Goes the Rest of the Nation, So Goes Connecticut

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

 BODY:
WINIFRED WILKINS did not need numbers to tell her about the state of real estate in Connecticut.
 ''It's terrible,'' said Ms. Wilkins, 78, of Branford. Her house has been on the market 1 1/2 years, the first six months with an agent. Now she's trying to sell what she considers her biggest retirement account on her own so she can move to North Carolina to live near her family.
 ''There is money out there -- but people are very afraid in this present economy,'' Ms. Wilkins said. ''They don't want to be tied to a big mortgage.'' 
 The statistics are grim. After bucking the national downturn last year, Connecticut single family home sales and median home prices (excluding condos) slid dramatically in 2008's first quarter, according to data from the Warren Group of Boston, which tracks real estate in New England.
 Statewide, first-quarter sales were down more than 27 percent from the same period last year and median prices were down nearly 6 percent. 
 Fairfield County, which typically has more home sales than any other state county, as well as the highest prices, absorbed the worst of it. Sales for the quarter were off nearly 32 percent and March sales were not only down 37 percent, but were also outpaced by Hartford and New Haven Counties. Median prices were down 8.5 percent for the quarter and more than 10 percent in March. 
 The state's only bright spot was the median sales price in Litchfield County, which went up slightly, though overall sales were down about 30 percent for the quarter.
 Vincent Valvo, the Warren Group's publisher and a West Hartford homeowner, said that foreclosures in the state as well as the overall subprime mortgage crisis has had a ripple effect by flushing about one-third of potential buyers out of the market -- people, Mr. Valvo said, who should not have been in the market in the first place.
 ''We created artificial demand by creating artificial buyers,'' he said. ''It takes a while for all this stuff to really show up in the market place. Now that we've hit the spring buying season, Fairfield County comes in with the worst performance, and it's absolutely nightmarish given past performances.''
 Median home prices in Connecticut peaked last June at $325,000. At the end of March, they stood at $268,250. The drop between March 2007 and March 2008 was the largest single monthly decline since April 1995.
 ''What we're seeing is a stalemate between buyers and sellers,'' said Joe Piscitelli of Coldwell Banker in Milford, a specialist in luxury waterfront property in New Haven County who said inventory was about 2 1/2 times higher than normal. ''They're looking each other in the eye and not drawing their weapons.''
 Other agents around the state report the same standoff, with buyers looking for bargains but sellers still seeking last year's high prices. Those same agents say, however, that when sellers price homes appropriately for the new scaled-back market, houses go quickly, with multiple offers at their asking prices.
 ''I tell people if you overprice it you're dead,'' said Barbara Pearce of H. Pearce Company Realtors in North Haven. 
 Bellina Lim, 31, heeded that advice when she had to put her Southington home on the market last month after her husband accepted a job transfer to China. ''I was thinking the market has been slow, are we going to be able to sell the house?'' she said. Her house sold in four days, at the asking price.
 ''The mantra used to be location, location, location,'' said Kenneth DelVecchio, president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors and a broker at RE/MAX Heritage in Westport. ''The mantra now is price, condition and location, and the houses that are priced right are selling.''
 He said first-time homebuyers facing tougher lending practices found it difficult to get into the market. But he noted that in Fairfield County, the cap on FHA mortgages recently increased to $709,00 from $417,000.
 ''Housing prices are low and interest rates are low,'' said Beverly Walsh of William Raveis Real Estate, Mortgage and Insurance. ''I look out the window and say 'Wow, I should be buying.' ''

HEADLINE: Immigrants' Children Find Better Lives, Study Shows

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
A decade-long study of adult children of immigrants to the New York region has concluded that they are rapidly entering the mainstream and doing better than their parents in terms of education and earnings -- even outperforming native-born Americans in many cases.
 But the study also warned of problems that could block upward mobility for members of the ''second generation,'' including persistent poverty and poor school performance among Dominicans and racial discrimination against black immigrants from the Caribbean. 
 The results of the $2 million study are detailed in ''Inheriting the City: The Children of Immigrants Come of Age,'' published this month by Harvard University Press and the Russell Sage Foundation, which finances social science research. 
 It focused on five groups: Dominicans, Chinese, Russian Jews, South Americans (consisting of Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians) and West Indians, defined as immigrants from the English-speaking Caribbean, including Belize and Guyana. The researchers also interviewed native-born whites, blacks and Puerto Ricans (those born on the mainland) in the New York area for comparison purposes. 
 The study identified broad similarities among adult children of immigrants. They were overwhelmingly fluent in English; were less occupationally segregated than their parents; lived longer with their parents than native-born Americans; and were firmly rooted in the United States, with fewer personal and financial ties to their ancestral homeland than their parents.
 The Russian and Chinese second-generation adults had higher high school and college graduation rates than, and earned as much as, native-born whites their age. The other groups reported higher educational attainment and earnings than native-born blacks and Puerto Ricans their age. In almost all of the immigrant groups, women outperformed men in school, though men continued to earn more. 
 Family life varied considerably among the groups. Dominicans and South Americans tended to marry young, while the Chinese postponed marriage and children the longest. Caribbean immigrants had a high rate of single-parent households, but the disadvantages of being raised by a single parent were offset, in part, by close extended families and the heavy involvement of grandparents in child-rearing. 
 The study was based on 3,415 telephone interviews conducted between 1998 and 2000; 333 face-to-face follow-up interviews in 2000 and 2001; and a final round of 172 follow-up interviews in 2002 and 2003. The subjects of the study were 18 to 32 at the time of the initial interviews and were either born in the United States to at least one immigrant parent, or arrived in the United States by age 12. The study covered 10 counties: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Westchester and Nassau in New York and Essex, Hudson, Passaic and Union in New Jersey. 
 Three of the book's authors -- Philip Kasinitz, a sociologist at the City University of New York Graduate Center; John H. Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the Graduate Center; and Mary C. Waters, a sociologist at Harvard -- presented their findings at a panel discussion on Wednesday at the Graduate Center. (This reporter served as moderator.) The fourth author was Jennifer Holdaway, who directs the migration program at the Social Science Research Council. 
 In 1992, Herbert J. Gans, a Columbia University sociologist, published an influential essay suggesting that members of the post-1965 second generation might do worse than their parents, refusing to accept low-level, poorly paying jobs and adopting negative attitudes toward school and work. 
 But the authors of the new study found that Professor Gans's fears have not been realized. Most of the young people studied worked in white-collar clerical or service jobs in retail and major financial services and most had achieved ''real, if modest, progress over their parents' generation.'' 
 One important reason why, according to the authors, is that even poor, uneducated immigrants have often ''shown that they have the drive, ambition, courage and strength to move from one nation to another,'' and transmit their determination to their children. And the new second generation is able to take advantage of civil rights programs, including affirmative action policies, in applying to universities and for jobs. 
 The authors acknowledged that it was hard in some cases to explain why some of the five groups studied appeared to do better than others. The relative success of Russian Jews seemed clear: They immigrated with high levels of education, benefited from government programs because they came as refugees and received aid from established Jewish organizations. 
 The authors said it was more difficult to explain why ''Chinese youngsters have achieved the greatest educational and economic success relative to their parents' often humble origins.'' The Chinese have a fairly cohesive community with ''a high degree of social connection between its better- and worse-off members,'' the book argued, while ethnic newspapers, churches and media served as a link between middle- and working-class immigrants and helped share ''cultural capital,'' like information on how to get into the city's best schools. 
 Finally, Chinese parents were less likely to divorce, and they encouraged their children to put off marriage and children until their education was completed. 
 West Indians tend to have high rates of homeownership and do well in school and in the labor market, even though many grew up in single-parent households. But they also reported high rates of discrimination, particularly at the hands of the police. 
 ''In many ways they are assimilating into African-American neighborhoods and social networks,'' Professor Waters said in a phone interview. ''On the other hand, they tend to live on the outskirts of those neighborhoods.'' 
 The authors found that Dominicans ''probably present the clearest cause for concern.'' Many second-generation Dominicans are black and face discrimination, and unlike Caribbean immigrants, few have parents who spoke English on arrival. Many live in neighborhoods that are poor and attend some of the city's worst schools. 
 Nevertheless, the study found that second-generation Dominicans were much better educated than their parents.

HEADLINE: Doors Close, Doors Open, and the Homeless Trudge On

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THE old brick building that sits behind a tall iron fence at East 30th Street and First Avenue has been a haven for the lost since 1931. From that year until 1984 it operated as Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, and now its ivy-covered walls house some 600 homeless men, along with the main intake center for homeless men citywide. Soon, the building will provide more luxurious shelter: In March, the city's Economic Development Corporation announced plans to convert it into a hotel and conference center. 
 The building, the agency says, will be vacant and ready for development by June 2009. The Department of Homeless Services plans to shift its homeless occupants into similar shelters. But it is the fate of the intake center, where homeless people entering the system go to be processed, evaluated and assigned to longer-term housing, that is stirring opposition. 
 The city's plan, to move the operation to the shelter at the Bedford-Atlantic Armory in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, has raised objections on both sides of the East River.
 In Brooklyn, opponents object to the idea of moving more homeless people through their area. In Manhattan, opponents contend that removing the intake center from the borough with the most street homelessness -- a city study earlier this year showed that Manhattan had 58 percent of the city's street homeless people, compared with Brooklyn's 16 percent -- will discourage people from using shelters.
 ''I've been at the Bellevue intake center on cold nights, and I've watched men literally walk in off the streets,'' said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, which opposes the plan. ''It just doesn't follow that you would want to locate your intake center in the borough that only has 16 percent of the street homelessness.''
 The shift represents a change in city policy: a de-emphasis of the intake center, and of large shelters, in favor of outreach teams that find homeless people, along with smaller ''safe havens,'' shelters with few barriers to entry.
 According to Robert Hess, the Homeless Services commissioner, the chronically homeless prefer the smaller havens. ''They voted against the shelter system -- that's why they're on the street,'' he said. ''They've had the opportunity to come into the shelter system each and every night, and they said, 'No, the best place for me is on the streets.' That's a pretty strong statement.''
 Mr. Markee commended the outreach teams, but said he did not believe that they could replace a central intake center, a ''front door'' to the homeless services system, where people know they can go when they need help. Nearly 3,000 men new to the municipal shelter system walked into Bellevue this year, he said. The center serves about 40 people a day, according to a spokeswoman for the city's homeless services. That figure rises significantly in colder weather.
 On Tuesday, some of the homeless men at the center of the storm, standing on the sidewalk near the shelter as mild day turned into chilly night, tried to make sense of it all.
 A few of the men staying in the shelter said that they had come straight from living on the streets. One said he had been displaced in a fire, another said he had lost his job and apartment because of a medical condition, and a third said he had a minimum-wage job delivering free newspapers, but did not earn enough to afford a single-room occupancy hotel. As he spoke, rats from a nearby construction site scurried along the curb.
 Some of the men had not heard about the city's plans, and those who had reacted with cynicism. Ray Ramos, 58, predicted that more people would end up on the street or in crowded rooming houses, adding, ''Politicians know this will happen.'' 
 ''They don't give a damn,'' he said. ''They'll put you in a bird cage. All they want is the premises.''
 The shelter at Bedford-Atlantic has long had a reputation among the homeless for violence and drugs, according to Mr. Ramos and others. Some of the homeless men outside the Bellevue shelter said that they would rather sleep on the street than go there. But the man with the delivery job fidgeted with a cigarette, shrugged, and said people would go wherever there was shelter.

HEADLINE: A Buyer's Market, a Seller's Pain

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
WITH a laser measuring device clipped to his belt and a reel of yellow tape tucked under one arm, Christopher Otteau roamed around a tidy house on a corner lot in Ridgewood, N.J., preparing to deliver the unwelcome news to its occupants.
 They, like many other homeowners whose property Mr. Otteau has appraised lately, were hoping to hear that their special house in their special neighborhood in their special town was immune to the gravitational force that has been pulling down home prices from coast to coast. Mr. Otteau's oft-repeated response: Sorry, but we are all in this housing slump together.
 These days even a well-kept house like this one, in a desirable town like Ridgewood, is likely to sell for a price that disappoints its owners. The five-bedroom ranch with a swimming pool was listed for more than $1.1 million, but Mr. Otteau, who is usually hired by the lender holding the mortgage, was just beginning to hunt for flaws.
 ''In a tough market, nothing is overlooked,'' he said as he examined a shallow hole near the front door where a tree had been planted. ''In a good market, lots of things are.'' 
 Clipboard in hand, he assessed everything from the topography of the lot (''slightly sloping'') to the type of street it bordered (a ''main feeder''). He gave it extra points for its curved stone walkway, which, he said, ''enhances curb appeal.''
 He would have to find out how much other houses in the neighborhood had sold for recently before he could fix a specific value on the home. But one conclusion was inescapable: On the section of the appraisal form that describes the condition of the local housing market, he would check the box for ''declining.''
 The suburbs of New York City were late entrants in the downturn that some economists think is already a recession. The main cause of the current weakness was the bursting of the American housing bubble, which had been pumped up by several years of hyper-aggressive lending and borrowing.
 Although prices rose much faster in newly developing parts of the Sun Belt, house values doubled in the metropolitan area, too, rising to $450,000 in 2005 from about $225,000 in 2000, according to the National Association of Realtors. Now, a reversal is well under way, but the concept is sinking in slowly for most residents of the area with property to sell.
 Those who have owned their homes since the start of the decade became accustomed to a steady, rapid appreciation. Buyers were lining up to tour houses and waging bidding wars that drove prices well above what sellers were asking.
 ''In 2005, it was almost impossible to overprice a home,'' said Mr. Otteau, 29, who has been appraising property from northern New Jersey to Delaware for six years since joining the real estate business that his father has operated for decades.
 But the tide turned more than two years ago, he said. With prices rising so much faster than people's incomes, houses started to become unaffordable and, he said, demand waned.
 Since then, home values statewide have declined about 15 percent and, he estimated, they will fall an additional 5 percent over the next year. In many towns, the inventory of unsold homes has been rising.
 But new statistics last week showed that sales volume increased statewide in New Jersey by about 4 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 The housing market has softened considerably in the suburbs north and east of New York City as well.
 On Long Island, the number of home sales in March was almost one-third lower than in March 2007, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The median price of those homes fell to $409,000 last month, down more than 8 percent from $445,000 the previous year.
 In Nassau County, almost a full year's supply of inventory was for sale as of March, up from a little more than eight months' worth a year ago, according to the service. In Suffolk County, it said, almost 15 months' inventory was for sale.
 In Westchester County, sales of single-family homes fell more than 30 percent and sales of condos plunged almost 35 percent during the first quarter of 2008, the sharpest decline in 28 years of record-keeping by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. In Putnam County, however, sales dropped by 9 percent, and prices fell 5 percent, according to the service.
 Westchester's real estate market is effectively on hold as prospective sellers wait for a better time to list their homes, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''You have to be aware that there are a lot of people who may want to sell property but don't have to do it at a particular time,'' Mr. Mercurio said.
 The sooner sellers let go of their dreams of cashing out at prices they once might have gotten, the sooner the market will stabilize, Mr. Otteau said.
 ''If people want to sell, they've got to get real with their prices,'' he said. Even then, he added, ''it's not going to be this everybody-rush-in market. It's going to be a cautious market.'' 
 Mr. Otteau may be too young to recall the ravages of the last severe housing slump in the New York metropolitan area. The median price of a home in the New York metropolitan area fell about 10 percent between 1988 and 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors. But he can fall back on the collected wisdom of his father, Jeffrey, who has been tracking New Jersey's property market for decades.
 Recently, Jeffrey Otteau has been the monthly bearer of bad tidings for New Jersey's builders and real estate agents. His company, Otteau Valuation Group, publishes town-by-town reports on the state of the housing market and, lately, the figures have looked progressively bleaker.
 The number of home-sale contracts signed in the state in March was down 27 percent from March 2007, according to the company's latest report. Growing fears about job losses, especially the waves of cutbacks announced by Wall Street firms, are compounding the weakening demand, Jeffrey Otteau said.
 ''Now, everything is in a stall,'' he said.
 To be sure, there are towns where demand is relatively strong and some houses are attracting multiple bids. But they represent a ''small, small sliver'' of the region, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 Most of those pockets of stability are directly linked to New York City, which has been the ''economic engine of the region for the last four years,'' Mr. Hughes said. Towns along the rail lines radiating from Manhattan, like Chatham and West Windsor, had some of the highest rates of home appreciation during the recent expansion, Mr. Hughes said. And those towns that have train stations and also lie near major highways, like Summit, received a double bonus, he said.
 ''If you live in those communities, for two working spouses it's the ideal location because you can satisfy one person working in New York and one working in New Jersey,'' Mr. Hughes said. Mr. Hughes said that even though more suburban residents throughout the region commute within the suburbs than travel back and forth to New York City, the closer-in communities have held up better because the city's economy has kept growing faster than the rest of the region's. With the financial services industry that powers New York City in the midst of a broad downshift, the staying power of that trend is now in question, Mr. Hughes said.
 If the cutbacks on Wall Street turn out to be part of a short, cyclical downturn, proximity toManhattan may continue to be a prime determinant of home values, he said. But if it is the start of a ''long-term structural shift,'' he said, ''it's possible we could see a major long-term weakness in New York, and that would ripple through all these housing markets.''
 Even traditional destinations for investment bankers and lawyers decamping from the city, like Summit, in Union County, N.J., could suffer during a protracted downturn, Jeffrey Otteau said. ''The reliance on Manhattan overflow housing demand has, up until now, been a strength for Summit,'' he said. ''We now need to see how much weakness there will be.''
 Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, said she believes that on Long Island, ''communities that have rail linkages or other forms of public transit will hold up better in terms of value than other areas that are completely auto-dependent.'' But Mr. Mercurio said he had seen no evidence of a similar pattern in suburbs north of New York City.
 Beyond the data he collects and analyzes, Jeffrey Otteau has several sets of eyes scrutinizing the market, house by house and building by building. One pair belongs to his son, Christopher, who logs more than 40,000 miles a year on his Lexus hybrid as he traverses the region appraising property.
 In a soft market, like the current one, sellers can improve their prospects by dressing up their homes, Christopher Otteau said. Uncluttered houses are much more appealing, he said. ''We always recommend getting a storage unit and getting all that stuff out of the way.''
 He said that ''updated kitchens and updated bathrooms definitely add value,'' but added that owners could go too far in upgrading an entry-level home. Installing expensive cabinetry, appliances and marble tile in a smaller house is often a mistake, he said. ''In entry level, it's called overimprovement or superadequacy,'' he said, using appraisers' language for spending money that is unlikely to be recouped. 
 One thing owners routinely place too much value on is having a larger-than-average lot, he said. ''If it's not buildable, it's just excess acreage.'' 
 Just after dawn one day this spring, in Bernards Township, he hiked to the top of a hill on a 10-acre lot near Basking Ridge whose owner had scrapped a plan to build a house and had put it up for sale for $1.2 million. The property, with a creek running through it, was ''one of the most beautiful lots I've ever seen,'' he said. ''In 2005, it probably would have sold in a heartbeat.'' 
 An hour later, he was touring a house in Mendham, then he was on to another in Long Hill.
 Each property had its own strengths and weaknesses, and, ultimately, the selling price of each would be determined by how many potential buyers it attracted and what they were willing to pay. Christopher Otteau said he could not discuss the particulars of his valuation of any of them. But in each case, he said, it was almost certainly true that they would sell for less than they would have at the peak of the market a few years ago, and less than their owners had hoped to collect.
 When he breaks that news to them, he tries to do it ''nicely,'' he said, and they seem to find his candor ''refreshing.'' Often, the response he hears these days, he said, is ''At least you're honest.''

HEADLINE: Over the Long Haul, Diesels Appeal

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
THE first fuel crisis that followed the Arab oil embargo of 1973 persuaded Americans to give diesel cars a try. These proliferated at first, but quickly faded under a foul-smelling cloud. 
 By May 1974, the price of oil had risen from about $3 a barrel to $12. Gasoline rose from about 30 cents a gallon to nearly 60 cents (almost $3 a gallon in current dollars). There were shortages and gas lines. 
 In 1973, the typical American sedan was a two-ton behemoth that had trouble breaking single-digit gas mileage in city driving. Small imported cars were an economical alternative, but some people simply needed more room than the Volkswagens, Toyotas and Fiats could provide. 
 For these people, there were diesel-powered sedans from Mercedes-Benz, which pioneered diesel passenger cars in 1936, and Peugeot. Diesels are more efficient because of their higher compression ratios. 
 Also, diesel fuel -- a less refined petroleum fuel similar to kerosene -- has a higher energy density than gasoline. Diesel-powered cars are generally 25 percent to 40 percent more fuel efficient than equivalent gasoline-powered cars. 
 Older diesel cars had drawbacks: they were smoky, smelly, noisy and sluggish. Although more efficient, diesels operate at far lower engine speeds, or r.p.m., and produce much less horsepower than gasoline engines of equal size.
 (Consider the 1971 Mercedes 220D, as tested back then by Road & Track magazine: with only 65 horsepower to move a 3,500-pound sedan, acceleration was nearly imperceptible -- zero-to-60 took an excruciating 27.5 seconds; top speed was only 84 miles an hour.) 
 Starting a diesel also took patience, because the driver had to wait for the glow plugs, which aid starting, to warm up.
 Performance of the 220D's chief rival, the Peugeot 504 diesel, was about the same. That was not surprising because it had the same meager 65 horsepower. The Peugeot was cheaper and rode softer, the Benz was better built and had a real dealer network to support it.
 Larry Trochtenberg, who owned a St. Louis construction company in the early 1970s, bought his first diesel in 1974 -- a Mercedes 240D sedan -- during the first gas crisis. ''It just seemed like a smart thing to do,'' he said.
 Like most pioneers, he experienced his share of inconvenience. When temperatures fell below freezing, Mr. Trochtenberg's 240D did its best impersonation of a Panzer tank in a Stalingrad winter -- the diesel fuel would gel and the car would refuse to start. To counteract this, he snaked a heavy-duty power cable from his office door and into the parking lot to an engine block heater under the hood. 
 But all was not privation. Mr. Trochtenberg's 240D was durable and thrifty, as was the 1985 300CD coupe he owned later. By the time Mr. Trochtenberg bought the 300CD, technology had advanced considerably. The 5-cylinder turbodiesel gave the car adequate performance.
 Neal Caudle, a software executive in Atlanta, bought a 1983 300D in 1993 with 158,000 miles on it. He drove it through college and gave it to his sister in 1999 with nearly 275,000 miles on it. She drove it until 2003 when the transmission gave out. Left for dead, it was sold for $50.
 After the buyer paid, he disappeared under the car for a few moments. He then started it and drove off with the transmission functioning fine; a vacuum line had simply come loose. Mr. Caudle said the man still owned the car, which had now gone almost 420,000 miles.
 Prices of used Mercedes diesels remain strong. A 1984 300TD wagon with 164,000 miles on it recently sold for $11,900 on eBay.
 While the engines will seemingly run forever, rust has ravaged many of the early Mercedes diesels on the East Coast. But out West, it's a different story. Eco-conscious Portland, Ore., is home to many Mercedes diesels from the '70s and '80s, many of them wearing ''biodiesel powered'' stickers.
 Brady Joy, who owns an import repair shop in Portland, has worked on a number of these cars and said they were popular with the biodiesel crowd because the cars were cheap and their low-tech injections systems ''will pass a gallstone without doing damage.'' He added, ''You wouldn't want to try that with a new diesel that has $1,000 injectors.''
 Mercedes and Peugeot weren't the only ones hawking diesel cars in the United States in the '70s and '80s. Volkswagen sold diesel Rabbits, and BMW, Nissan and Toyota dabbled with diesels.

HEADLINE: As Prices Rise, Crime Tipsters Work Overtime

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and BRENDA GOODMAN

 BODY:
To gas prices, foreclosure rates and the cost of rice, add this rising economic indicator: the number of tips to the police from people hoping to collect reward money.
 Calls to the Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers hot line in the first quarter of this year were up 30 percent over last year. San Antonio had a 44 percent increase. Cities and towns from Detroit to Omaha to Beaufort County, N.C., all report increases of 25 percent or more in the first quarter, with tipsters telling operators they need the money for rent, light bills or baby formula. 
 ''For this year, everyone that's called has pretty much been just looking for money,'' said Sgt. Lawrence Beller, who answers Crime Stoppers calls at the Sussex County, N.J., sheriff's office. ''That's as opposed to the last couple of years, where some people were just sick of the crime and wanting to do something about it.''
 As a result, many programs report a substantial increase in Crime Stopper-related arrests and recovered property, as callers turn in neighbors, grandchildren or former boyfriends in exchange for a little cash. 
 On Friday, a woman called the Regional Crime Stoppers line in Macon, Ga., to find out when she could pick up her reward money for a recent tip. She was irritated to learn that she would have to wait until Monday.
 ''I'm in a bind, I'm really in a bind,'' she told the hot-line operator. ''There's a lot of stuff I know, but I didn't open my mouth. If I weren't in a bind, I wouldn't open my mouth.''
 When she learned the money was not available, she said she would call back with the whereabouts of another suspect whom she had just seen ''going down the road.''
 Elaine Cloyd, the president of Crime Stoppers U.S.A., a national organization of local tip programs, said that not all of the 323 programs in the country had reported an increase in calls, and that some, like those in Lafayette, La., and Broward County, Fla., attributed most of their spike to increased publicity or technological improvements like accepting tips by text message. But there was no doubt, Ms. Cloyd said, that the faltering economy was a significant factor.
 ''When the economy gets rough, people have to be creative,'' she said. ''They might give a tip where they wouldn't have in the past.''
 For tips that bring results, programs in most places pay $50 to $1,000, with some jurisdictions giving bonuses for help solving the most serious crimes, or an extra ''gun bounty'' if a weapon is recovered. In Sussex County, the average payment for a tip that results in an arrest is $400, Sergeant Beller said. 
 ''Usually you deliver the money in an unmarked car and meet them somewhere,'' he said. ''But these people come right to the office and walk right through the front door.'' 
 Some Crime Stoppers coordinators say their program appeals to community spirit and emphasize that not everyone who calls is after money. But their advertising makes no bones about the benefits of a good tip.
 ''Crime doesn't pay but we do,'' say the mobile billboards cruising Jacksonville, Fla. A poster in Jackson, Tenn., draws a neat equation: ''Ring Ring + Bling Bling = Cha-Ching.'' The bling, in this case, is a pair of handcuffs. 
 Some coordinators suggest that rising crime rates might be driving up the number of tips. But in Jackson, Tenn., Sgt. Mike Johnson said his call volume had gone from two or three a day to eight or nine. He theorized that rising crime there was not a factor because the program advertises steadily regardless of trends. ''People just need money,'' Sergeant Johnson said.
 Sergeant Johnson has been a Crime Stoppers coordinator for 15 years, watching crime rates and tips fluctuate. But, he said, ''I've never seen an increase like it is now.''
 Crime Stoppers programs strictly protect the anonymity of callers. Each tip is assigned a number, and if the tip results in an arrest, the caller can collect a cash reward, usually by going to a designated bank. Some programs pay tipsters within hours of an arrest; others have monthly meetings to approve reward amounts.
 Not only have the number of tips increased, several program coordinators said, but people are also more diligent about calling back to find out if and when they can collect.
 Jim Cogan, director of the Silicon Valley Crime Stoppers program in California, said most of the rewards offered by his program used to go unclaimed. But with large numbers of foreclosures and heavy job losses, Mr. Cogan said, ''now we're seeing rewards get picked up right away and our tipsters being frustrated when tips aren't available as quickly as they need the money.''
 Karen Keen, the tips coordinator for First Coast Crime Stoppers in Jacksonville, said she had, on occasion, been given approval to pay tipsters early, if they persuaded her that they needed the money to pay a light bill or some other necessity.
 Some people have made a cottage industry of calling in tips. Although repeat callers do not give their names, operators recognize their voices. 
 ''We have people out there that, realistically, this could be their job,'' said Sgt. Zachary Self, who answers Crime Stoppers calls for the Macon Police Department. 
 ''Two or three arrests per week, you could make $700, $750 per week,'' Sergeant Self said. ''You could make better than a minimum-wage job.'' 
 He said that his program typically averaged 215 arrests per year, but that this year it had already hit 100, and he projected it would make more than 300, a record, by year's end.
 In some cases, the quality of the tips is lagging as people grasp for any shred of information that might result in an arrest. A woman in Macon, for example, recently called to report that a family member -- who was wanted for burglary and whose name and address were already known to the police -- was at home. His home. 
 Such a tip might seem worthless on its face, said Jean Davis, who took the call. But many police departments do not have the personnel to watch a suspect's comings and going. In that case, the young man was arrested.
 Typically, the greatest number of calls comes in response to news coverage of a specific crime or a weekly list of wanted suspects. At other times, people call to report a crime the police might not even be aware of. Or, they might just call to report the whereabouts of someone with an old warrant. Warrant tips for minor crimes generate the lowest rewards, but that has not stopped people from turning in suspects. 
 ''We're getting a lot more calls related to wanted persons,'' said Sgt. Tommi Bridgeman, who coordinates the Beaufort County Crime Stoppers program. ''People who know that these people have warrants out for their arrest are calling to turn them in.''
 Sergeant Bridgeman said her calls were up 25 percent even though the program's one advertisement, a patrol car emblazoned with the hot-line number, was out of commission.
 ''Folks around here need the money,'' she said. ''There's not a lot of jobs here. We try to pay out every two weeks because we know they need the money.''
 Places with quick payments and particularly bleak economic conditions tended to report increases in call volume. Lee County, Fla., had the highest rate for home foreclosures in the United States in February and March, and its once-plentiful construction jobs have dried up. 
 Last week, the Crime Stoppers coordinator there, Trish Routte, got a call from a man reporting drug activity, a tip that paid him $450. It was his second call in a week, said Ms. Routte, who recognized the caller's voice.
 ''He told me he really didn't want to call but he just had a new grandbaby and he needed the money,'' Ms. Routte said.
 Economic problems for families, Ms. Routte acknowledged, were good business for Crime Stoppers. ''We're kind of banking on that, really,'' she said. ''If it helps put dinner on the table for somebody, that's wonderful.''

HEADLINE: Can a Dead Brand Live Again?

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER. 
Rob Walker writes the Consumed column for the magazine. His book, ''Buying In: The Secret Dialogue Between What We Buy and Who We Are,'' will be published by Random House next month.

 BODY:
Do you remember Brim?
 The coffee brand? Perhaps you recall its advertising slogan: ''Fill it to the rim -- with Brim!'' Those ads haven't been shown in years, and Brim itself has been off retail shelves since the 1990s. Yet depending on how old you are, there's a fair chance that there's some echo of the Brim brand in your brain. That's no surprise, given that from 1961 to around 1995, General Foods spent tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to get it there. But General Foods disappeared into the conglomerate now known as Altria, which also acquired Kraft, maker of Maxwell House. With much smaller sales than that megabrand, Brim soon disappeared -- except, perhaps, for a vague idea of Brim that lingered, and lingers even now, in the minds of millions of consumers. 
 What's that worth? A small company in Chicago, called River West Brands, figures that it's definitely worth something, and possibly quite a lot. The firm did its own research a year or so ago and claims that among people over the age of 25, Brim had 92 percent ''aided national awareness.'' What this means is that if you ask people anywhere in America if they have ever heard of Brim, about 9 out of 10 will say yes. If true, that's potentially a big deal. Building that level of recognition for a new brand of coffee -- or anything else -- from scratch would involve an astronomical amount of money, a great deal of time, or both. 
 Marketers like to talk about something called brand ''equity,'' a combination of familiarity and positive associations that clearly has some sort of value, even if it's impossible to measure in a convincing empirical way. Exploiting the equity of dead or dying brands -- sometimes called ghost brands, orphan brands or zombie brands -- is a topic many consumer-products firms, large and small, have wrestled with for years. River West's approach is interesting for two reasons.
 One is that for the most part the equity -- the idea -- is the only thing the company is interested in owning. River West acquires brands when the products themselves are dead, not merely ailing. Aside from Brim, the brands it acquired in the last few years include Underalls, Salon Selectives, Nuprin and the game maker Coleco, among others. ''In most cases we're dealing with a brand that only exists as intellectual property,'' says Paul Earle, River West's founder. ''There's no retail presence, no product, no distribution, no trucks, no plants. Nothing. All that exists is memory. We're taking consumers' memories and starting entire businesses.''
 The other interesting thing is that when Earle talks about consumer memory, he is factoring in something curious: the faultiness of consumer memory. There is opportunity, he says, not just in what we remember but also in what we misremember.
 River West is a young company, and few of its ideas have been directly tested in the marketplace. The revival of Brim, for instance, has yet to crystallize into a plan with real manufacturing and distribution partners. But River West is starting to bring some familiar names back into the consumer realm. It is thanks to River West that you can buy Nuprin again at CVS. The firm has also played a role in the return of Eagle Snacks to some grocery-store aisles. In late January, Drugstore.com began accepting orders for Salon Selectives, which is also making its way into 10,000 stores, including every Rite Aid in America and grocery chains like Winn-Dixie and Pathmark. And by way of a deal with River West, Phantom, a Canadian hosiery manufacturer, is pushing a new version of Underalls to department-store and boutique clients in the U.S. 
 Whether these brand-reanimation efforts pan out as a successful business strategy or not, they offer an unusual perspective on the relationship between brands and the brain. By and large, examinations of successful branding tend to focus on names like Harley-Davidson, Apple or Converse, which have developed ''cult'' followings. Such cases are misleading, though, because they are not typical of most of what we buy. A great deal of what happens in the consumer marketplace does not involve brands with zealous loyalists. What determines whether a brand lives or dies (or can even come back to life) is usually a quieter process that has more to do with mental shortcuts and assumptions and memories -- and all the imperfections that come along with each of those things. 
 River West's offices, on the 36th floor of the Chicago Board of Trade Building, are sprinkled with the bric-a-brac of obscure products: a Quisp cereal box, Ipana toothpaste packages, Duz detergent bottles. On a wall of Paul Earle's office is a framed, five-foot-by-three-foot sheet of uncut ''Wacky Packages'' stickers -- those 1970s trading-card-size brand-parody images that rendered the word Crust in the style of the Crest logo, for example. Earle has a Midwestern everyman quality about him: he's compact, with a big and friendly let's-get-along voice and a penchant for deadpan jokes. Only his designer-eyeglass frames deviate from his overall demeanor.
 Earle loves brands. They are not mere commercial trademarks to him, but pieces of Americana. He seems not just nostalgic but almost hurt about the fate of the ''castoff brands'' of the world. ''If commerce is part of the American fabric, then brands are part of the American fabric,'' he said to me on one occasion. ''When a brand goes away, a piece of Americana goes away.''
 Earle's professional entanglement with branding began at Saatchi & Saatchi, where he was a cog in a gigantic ad agency working for gigantic clients, like General Mills and Johnson & Johnson. That was in the mid-1990s, and he saw what happened as conglomerates merged: brands that didn't have the potential for global scale got squeezed to the bottom shelf, or out of existence. He was attracted to the idea of working with ''noncore'' brands, but when he figured out that big-agency economics made it impractical, he left Saatchi and went to the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and then took a brand-management job at Kraft.
 At Kraft he observed the same mergers-and-consolidation process from a different angle, and he seems to have found it equally frustrating. ''These are American icons with loyal consumers,'' he says. ''It's not their fault a $40 billion company doesn't like them anymore. Consumers like them.'' He sees reviving brands as ''a civic mission'' of sorts. ''If it weren't my job,'' he said, ''it would be my hobby.'' He says this in a way that sounds not just plausible but hard to doubt.
 Even so, he has set out to make this particular civic mission turn a profit. While he recognizes that a given brand might not be able to survive in the portfolio of a multinational, different sorts of business models might work to sustain it. As surely as the ownership of brands has consolidated through one megamerger after another, the consumer market seems to be moving in the opposite direction, with an individualism-fueled demand for almost unlimited variety. Earle's theory is that such demand means room for brands like the ones River West owns, and his idea is facing its most significant test to date, by way of the reanimation of Salon Selectives. 
 Helene Curtis began selling this line of shampoos in 1987, and sales shot past the $100 million mark within a year or so. It was, one Wall Street enthusiast claimed at the time, ''probably the most successful hair-care launch in the history of the universe.'' Heavily advertised, the brand was a pioneer of the sales pitch, now routine, of a ''salon'' product available for home use. Unilever bought Helene Curtis in 1996, acquiring a new batch of cosmetic, shampoo and deodorant brands that had to be integrated into those the conglomerate already offered.
 It's often hard to pin down the exact moment a brand disappears, because a product can linger on retail shelves for quite a while before it's sold down or otherwise liquidated. But by the early 2000s, Salon Selectives had become a casualty of brand-portfolio consolidation. A few years later, River West acquired what was left of it: intellectual property like the trademarks and the original formulas. 
 River West's partner in the Salon Selectives effort is called SSB, which has five full-time employees coordinating the efforts of various subcontractors (manufacturers, package-makers) out of River West's offices. Selective Beauty is run by Gene Zeffren, a former top executive at Helene Curtis with a Ph.D. in chemistry. Earle and Zeffren are partly motivated by the belief that there is a core of Salon Selectives fans out there who miss their product and are eager to buy it again. You would think, then, that the goal would be to give those consumers their old brand back, just as it once was. And sure enough, when I visited Anne West, the chief marketing officer of the new Salon Selectives, there was an array of pink plastic bottle samples in her office, part of an attempt to match the old color as closely as possible. She showed me a video in which a surprising number of randomly confronted Chicagoans, asked if they remembered Salon Selectives, responded by singing the jingle.
 Then she showed me storyboards for new Salon Selectives ads, which were not much like the original ones at all. She went on to explain that while the bottle color would be the same, its shape would be different. The reintroduced line also includes a number of new products, and the products are now more aggressively marketed as ''customizable'' (by hair length, thickness, texture, etc.) than they were in the earlier incarnation. Then there's the apple scent. West said fans of the brand in its heyday frequently cited that signature smell as one of the things they missed most about the shampoos. So the new version will have an apple scent -- but even that was being tweaked and ''updated.'' The bottom line is that Salon Selectives isn't coming back just as it used to be, but sort of as it used to be.
 West figures that fans of the brand who are nostalgic for their long-lost product just need to know that it's back. But the real point now is to attract younger customers who probably never used the stuff. The name ''Salon Selectives'' might sound familiar to them, so the strategy must balance that familiarity with something that makes the product seem fresh and novel. Later West sent me the new Salon Selectives ads, now running on VH1, Lifetime and other cable networks. The spots do not announce the return of a favorite old brand, or even allude to the fact that Salon Selectives was ever gone. In one, a woman escapes from prison and immediately washes her hair. The cop who confronts her admits that she doesn't look like an escaped con but (punch line) as if she ''just stepped out of a salon.'' This is followed by glimpses of the (pink) bottles and a quick ''mix and match'' pitch and then, at the very last second, a snippet of the familiar old jingle, rerecorded. West calls this snippet a ''button,'' and it clearly aims to function as the slightest mental nudge: this is something you know about. 
 Among River West's various projects, this is actually one of the more conservative in testing the boundary between the positive associations of a familiar memory and the attractions of novelty. There's less room to test that boundary because Salon Selectives hasn't been ''dormant'' all that long: At least some fans of the old apple scent are going to have opinions about the ''updated'' version. Much will depend on specific associations with a product -- which is not the same thing as a brand. Brands aren't quite so tangible, so quantifiable. That's what's interesting about them.
 One of Paul Earle's professors at Kellogg was John F. Sherry Jr. (now at Notre Dame), who has devoted some study to ''retromarketing'' and ''the revival of brand meaning.'' In 2003 he wrote an article (with Stephen Brown of the University of Ulster and Robert V. Kozinets of Kellogg) on the subject for The Journal of Customer Behavior. ''Retromarketing is not merely a matter of reviving dormant brands and foisting them on softhearted, dewy-eyed, nostalgia-stricken consumers,'' they asserted. ''It involves working with consumers to co-create an oasis of authenticity for tired and thirsty travelers through the desert of mass-produced marketing dreck.'' 
 I wasn't entirely sure what that meant, but Sherry turned out to be more straightforward in conversation. ''There's no real reason that a brand needs to die,'' he told me, unless it is attached to a product that ''functionally doesn't work.'' That is, as long as a given product can change to meet contemporary performance standards, ''your success is really dependent on how skillful you are in managing the brand's story so that it resonates with meaning that consumers like.'' 
 The holy grail example of brand reanimation is the Volkswagen Beetle, which a few years ago rose from dormancy and became a hit all over again in an updated form that was both nostalgic and contemporary. The reintroduced Beetle layered ''nostalgic reassurance'' over modern functionality. ''It's a brand that's memorable for a lot of different reasons,'' Sherry said. ''But largely because it evokes this past that never was -- that was morally superior or simpler, an era of better craftsmanship. That kind of thing.''
 Such abstract notions are much on display at the Licensing International Expo, an annual event at which the owners of cultural properties -- TV shows, movies, cartoon characters -- meet with makers of things and try to negotiate deals granting them a paid license to use the properties to add meaning and market value to whatever things they make. It is a good place to contemplate the business potential of ''the brand'' in free-floating form, unmoored to any product or company that may have actually created it. A surprising number of the symbols represented at the expo held last summer in New York were simply brand logos. Spam, for instance, had its own booth. IMC Licensing was there on behalf of its clients Oreo, Altoids, Dole and Oscar Mayer. At one point I encountered a person dressed up as a can of Lysol, which is represented by the Licensing Company. 
 Another firm that represents a number of consumer brands is the Beanstalk Group, which staked out a rather large chunk of floor space at the expo, complete with a coffee bar and about 20 tables. Owned by Omnicom Group, Beanstalk is the licensing firm for a wide range of cultural properties, from Harley-Davidson to Andy Warhol to the United States Army. None of these are dead brands, of course, but Beanstalk's track record with converting brand meaning into revenue is the reason Paul Earle was at the licensing expo. Beanstalk was exploring strategies to revive the Coleco and Brim brands as, essentially, licensing fodder.
 Michael Stone, the president and chief executive of Beanstalk, has a refined sense of the licensing business, and how consumer brands fit into it. He knows what many people think the business boils down to: I make plastic lunchboxes and you own the rights to reproduce images of Spider-Man. How about a Spider-Man lunchbox? Stone cheerfully explained to me that this is merely a ''decorative'' form of licensing, and that's not his game. As a point of contrast, he told me about Beanstalk's involvement with Stanley Works, the venerable maker of hand tools.
 Stanley hired Beanstalk about nine years ago. Stanley conducted ''consumer permission research'' to try to determine where the Stanley brand could go. ''I remember looking through the focus-group tests, and there was a guy who absolutely swore that he had a Stanley ladder in his garage.'' Stone paused. ''Stanley never made ladders.'' This is an excellent example of what ''brand equity'' really means in the marketplace. 
 In contrast to the fanatical-devotion theory, part of the point of most branding is very specifically to circumvent conscious thought. Psychologists use the word ''heuristics'' to refer to the mental shortcuts and rules of thumb that allow us to resolve the various routine problems of everyday life without having to make a spreadsheet for every trivial decision. Brand owners want a way into your purchase heuristics. Often it is not so much a matter of, say, a Stanley Works fanatic seeking out all products bearing that trademark; it's a matter of looking for a product and choosing one with a particular trademark that, for whatever reason, we find acceptable. This is not brand loyalty. It's brand acquiescence. 
 We've all seen the Stanley name, for instance. And by and large, we trust it. We have a general idea of Stanley that fits into our hardware-store purchase heuristics. But there is a great deal of imperfection and vagueness in these thought processes, and that is good news for a licensor. It suggests that there's potential -- or ''permission'' -- for the Stanley name to migrate onto new products. 
 What Beanstalk did not do when it took on Stanley as a client was recommend investing in a ladder-production facility and hiring a bunch of workers, plus a sales force to blitz potential retail channels. Stanley Works, as a company, has actually been moving in the opposite direction, closing factories and outsourcing its manufacturing since the 1980s. Instead, Beanstalk worked out a licensing deal with Werner, which was already the biggest maker and distributor of ladders in the country. ''They needed another brand because they couldn't expand the Werner brand anymore,'' Stone said. So Werner started making and selling ladders with the Stanley name on them. This gave Werner a way to get more shelf space, reach more consumers and make more sales. What it gave Stanley was its name on a new product and a licensing fee. Beanstalk has worked out many such deals, hooking up the Stanley brand with manufacturers of work gloves and boots, power generators and a variety of other things that Stanley never made (and does not make now). 
 Too many such deals, or the wrong kinds, can boomerang: this happens with some regularity in the fashion world, when a famous designer name gets spread over so many products, with so little regard to quality, that the entire image of the brand sinks. Still, if you see a ladder made by Stanley, you may well think, Well, there's a name I can trust. What you're trusting, though, isn't Stanley workers in Stanley factories upholding Stanley traditions and values under the watchful eye of Stanley managers. What you're trusting is Stanley's recognition that a badly made ladder with the Stanley name on it could be highly damaging to the Stanley brand. You are trusting Stanley's recognition of the value of its brand and its competence in defending that value. 
 We circled back around to Beanstalk's ideas for River West's brands, particularly Brim. Stone mentioned White Cloud. White Cloud is a brand of toilet paper once owned by Procter & Gamble. P.& G. also owned the Charmin franchise, so eventually it let the trademarks on White Cloud expire. These were then acquired by an entrepreneur, who worked out a licensing deal with Wal-Mart to make White Cloud an exclusive Wal-Mart product. It became, essentially, a store brand, but infused with equity of mass-market familiarity. It's very doubtful that the typical White Cloud buyer is aware that the product is available only at Wal-Mart. It's also very doubtful that P.& G. (which would surely prefer that its Charmin didn't have to compete against a brand that P.& G. itself created) will let anything like that happen again if it can possibly help it. 
 This is essentially the situation that River West brokered with the Nuprin brand, which was a dead line of ibuprofen painkillers (once upon a time backed by the widely known ''Nupe it'' ad campaign). Its trademarks were acquired by River West and sold to CVS, where it is back on the shelves as a stealth store brand. (And presumably enjoying better margins than it would if, like a traditional store brand, it competed solely on low price, not trustworthy-brand familiarity.) My read was that this is what Stone thought should happen to Brim -- and that Earle had mixed feelings, believing, perhaps, that Brim could come back as something bigger. Even Stone seemed at least somewhat intrigued with the possibilities of licensing a brand that was familiar but dead. ''With Stanley we have to be careful -- this is a famous brand; we have to do everything right and mitigate all the risks,'' he says. ''But with Brim, the risks. . . .'' He paused. ''There really are no risks.'' 
 This brings us to Earle's ideas about the potential upside of faulty consumer memory. Maybe, for instance, you're among those who remember Brim. But do you also remember that it was a decaf-only brand? That's actually why you could ''fill it to the rim.'' River West's research found that many who recall the Brim brand have forgotten the decaf detail. 
 The relationship between brands and memory (faulty or no) is a specialty of Kathy LaTour, an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In one of her most interesting studies, she worked with Elizabeth Loftus, a memory specialist and now a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a third researcher, Rhiannon Ellis, to take the issue to its logical extreme: What if, for example, an advertising campaign ''implanted memories into consumers of things that never happened?'' 
 The researchers found that subjects presented with a fake Disney World ad inviting them to ''remember the characters of your youth: Mickey, Goofy . . . '' were significantly more likely to say they recalled that as children they had met ''a favorite TV character at a theme resort'' than those who didn't see the ad. The fascinating thing was what happened when they repeated the experiment, tweaking the ads to include Bugs Bunny, who, of course, is not a Disney character at all. About 16 percent of subjects subsequently claimed that, as children, they shook hands with Bugs Bunny at a Disney theme park. Repeated fake-ad exposure apparently led to higher false-memory rates. In a separate study, Loftus asked subjects with Bugs in their memories what, exactly, they recalled about this incident; of these, 62 percent recounted shaking Bugs's hand, and more than a quarter specifically recalled him saying, ''What's up, Doc?'' 
 Earle says that this imperfection of memory can be used to enhance whatever new Brim he comes up with. This is ''a benefit of dormancy,'' he says. The brand equity has value on its own, but it can be grafted onto something newer and, perhaps, more innovative. ''Consumers remember the kind of high-level essence of the brand,'' he says. ''They tend to forget the product specifics.'' This, he figures, creates an opening: it gives the reintroduced version ''permission'' to forget that decaf-only limitation as well and morph into a full line of coffee varieties. '' 'Fill it to the rim with Brim' stands for full-flavored coffee,'' Earle says, with a chuckle. ''Fill it to the rim -- it's great stuff!'' 
 Finding the deceased brands that consumers are likely to remember -- sort of -- is a process that can begin, of all places, in the library. Earle spent hours going through old issues of People, Time, Glamour and other magazines, ''looking for brand names that sounded familiar but that I hadn't seen lately.'' This results in many, many possibilities that don't work out for one reason or another. But every so often the process yields an Underalls.
 Earle was intrigued with Underalls. Produced by Hanes from about 1975 to the mid-1990s, Underalls was once a prominent brand, advertised aggressively. (''O.K. America -- show us your Underalls!'') It spawned ''flanker'' brands like Summeralls, Winteralls and Slenderalls. It was unique and memorable: a good brand. ''You see the memorabilia on eBay,'' Earle says. ''That's usually a good indicator.''
 By way of MarketTools, a research company, River West asked 1,000 women ages 25 to 54 to answer an online survey about hosiery brands. About 850 did so, and among these, 72 percent had heard of Underalls. Among those who recognized the brand, about three-quarters remembered the ''Show us your Underalls'' tagline. Promising. But River West needed a partner to actually manufacture and distribute whatever the new version of Underalls might be. 
 It found that partner in Phantom, a hosiery maker based in Toronto. Phantom's main product line is called Silks, the dominant hosiery brand in Canada. The company also manufactures a number of store brands. Phantom wanted to get into the crowded U.S. hosiery market, says Svetlana Sturgeon, vice president of sales and marketing for Phantom, and it made a certain amount of sense to leverage a name far more familiar to American consumers than Silks would be. Sturgeon jokes that, at first, she did not want to admit at meetings that she remembered the brand (''I'm much too young for that!''). But she did. 
 The point of the original Underalls was that they combined panties and stockings into one undergarment. (''They were the pioneers in the whole idea of eliminating panty lines,'' is how Sturgeon puts this.) In early brainstorming sessions, Phantom and River West tried to come up with ''the most expansive but credible definition'' of the brand, Earle says. In this case that turned out to be ''intimate-apparel solutions,'' which means anything you wear under something else that's ''functional and fashion-forward,'' Sturgeon says. This includes camisoles and bras and other things the original Underalls never sold. The San Francisco design firm Thinc came up with a new graphic identity and packaging ideas that referenced classic elements of the old ads, but radically updated them. New slogan: ''Lovely underneath it all.'' With the prototypes complete, Sturgeon has begun the process of meeting with boutique and department-store buyers, in the hope of getting products into stores, at least on a test level, in the fall. 
 Brand familiarity alone guarantees nothing. Sears owns several well-known brand names -- Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard, the Sears name itself -- and is viewed by Wall Street as a basket case. Multinationals routinely go through cycles of acquiring and creating brands and then paring back when, inevitably, some underperform. A tiny number of hard-core loyalists not only doesn't mean a whole lot when reviving a brand, it might be a problem because those people do remember. A number of the more cultish devotees of the VW Beetle, in fact, forthrightly rejected its reanimated version as a fraud. In that case, those consumers were marginalized by a far wider buying public who weren't such sticklers.
 And really, something like the Beetle is actually a special case: it wasn't just a well-known product, it was a cultural icon on a level that very few products or brands ever achieve. River West is trying to reanimate brands that are sort of familiar but don't have anything like a VW level of built-in cultural capital to draw on. If there is a cult of Brim out there somewhere, it's pretty small and very quiet. 
 What River West really wants is to bring back these brands in a way that not only builds on their former popularity but also manages, via the skillful management of what we do remember and what we don't, to transcend it. This would be quite a trick. A few months after he returned from the licensing expo, Earle more or less dropped the strategy of turning Brim into a glorified store brand. These days he's talking about finding a ''really innovative'' coffee-manufacturing partner who could make the Brim brand an umbrella for groundbreaking (but unspecified) coffee advances that would work in the general market, not just one chain. He sounded almost protective of the Brim idea, and possibly a bit frustrated that he hadn't hit on the way to bring it back. ''Brim is, within our company, one of our best-known brands,'' he said to me at one point. ''In fact it's our absolutely best-known brand. So expectations are high.'' 
 Later he added: ''The strength of a dormant brand is we can remake this however we want. The challenge is we can remake this however we want.'' 
 Eventually, Earle introduced me at his office to Scott Lazar, chief executive of another River West partner, Reserve Brands, which is overseeing the revivification of Eagle Snacks. I'd never heard of the brand, but I was assured that plenty of Midwesterners knew it. Eagle had once been owned by Anheuser-Busch and was the beer maker's way into the salty-snack market dominated by Frito-Lay. Its most well known product, it seems, was the honey-roasted peanut, particularly in tiny bags given out as snacks on airlines. Anheuser-Busch eventually pulled the plug, selling its equipment to Frito-Lay and the trademarks to Procter & Gamble in the mid-1990s. Lazar said that while the new Eagle has acquired those trademarks, the new and expanded product line consists largely of snacks that the old Eagle never made, with names like ''Poppers!'' and ''Bursts!'' These are rolling out in a variety of grocery stores across the country. Lazar tried to give me about six large bags of samples, but I demurred on account of limited luggage space. 
 I ended up with two bags, which Earle and I took downstairs to the bar at the Ceres Cafe. It was crowded and loud, filled with big Chicago men who in some cases had spent the day screaming on the Chicago Board of Trade floor and who in all cases were not shy. We found a place to sit, plopping the Eagle snacks in front of us. And one man after another leaned into our space and pointed at the bags and boomed, ''Eagle!'' Big hands reached toward the bags to get a scoop of snacks that the old Eagle had never made, and at the time were not in stores, and big voices declared, ''I remember those!''

PERSON: Will Elder 

HEADLINE: Will Elder, Cartoonist of Satiric Gifts And Overpopulated Scenes, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Will Elder, whose frantic, gag-filled illustrations helped to define the comic identity of Mad magazine and who was a creator of the Playboy cartoon serial ''Little Annie Fanny,'' died Wednesday in Rockleigh, N.J. He was 86.
 The cause was Parkinson's disease, said Gary VandenBergh, his son-in-law. 
 A dead-on caricaturist with an anarchic sense of humor, Mr. Elder stuffed the backgrounds of his Madison Avenue parodies and comic-strip spoofs with inane puns, silly signs and weird characters doing strange things.
 ''That approach to humor seeped into the rest of the magazine and the DNA of its contributors,'' said John Ficarra, the editor of Mad. ''It set the tone for the entire magazine and created a look that endures to this day.''
 Mr. Elder called these background fillers ''chicken fat,'' explaining that they were ''the part of the strip that gave it some flavor but did little to advance the story line.'' This layered, free-for-all approach influenced the cartoons of R. Crumb and films like ''Airplane!'' and the ''Naked Gun'' series.
 Born Wolf William Eisenberg in the Bronx, Mr. Elder attended public schools and, an unimposing physical specimen, sat on the sidelines when teams were chosen for neighborhood sports. Chalk in hand, he kept score and drew caricatures, a valuable defense against bullies. ''My chalk was mightier than their sticks,'' Mr. VandenBergh recalled him saying.
 He attended the High School of Music and Art, where his fellow students included Harvey Kurtzman, the eventual founder of Mad, and Al Jaffee, who later became a cartoonist for the magazine. After studying for a year at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan, he was drafted into the Army, where he served with the 668th Topographical Engineers. His duties included drawing maps for the Normandy landing on D-Day.
 On returning to the United States, he changed his last name to Elder and began looking for work as an illustrator. His first assignment was to create a comic book based on a character called Rufus DeBree the Garbage Man, a trash collector with a fantasy life as a Knight of the Round Table.
 Mr. Elder married Jean Strashun in 1948; she died in 2005. He is survived by a brother, Irving Eisenberg, of Delray Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Nancy Elder VandenBergh, of Cresskill, N.J.; a son, Martin Elder, of Riverdale; and two grandchildren.
 With Mr. Kurtzman and Charles Stern, another artist, Mr. Elder created the Charles William Harvey Studio. ''It became a hangout for the lost and unemployed,'' he would recall. The hangers-on included Jules Feiffer and Rene Goscinny, who later wrote the stories for the Asterix comics. Largely through Mr. Kurtzman's connections with William M. Gaines's E.C. Comics, Mr. Elder did work for Weird Fantasy, Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat.
 In 1952, Mr. Kurtzman, encouraged by Mr. Gaines, assembled a team of artists and writers, including Mr. Elder, for a new satiric magazine, Mad. From 1952 to 1956, Mr. Elder was a mainstay there, usually working in collaboration with Mr. Kurtzman, although ''Ganefs!'' -- the madcap adventures of a gang of creepy crooks that appeared in Mad's first issue -- was a solo production. 
 Together, the two generated memorable comic mayhem in cartoon spoofs like ''Starchie'' and ''Mickey Rodent'' and in the adventures of Melvin Mole, a determined but hapless criminal who tries to dig his way out of prison with a spoon, then a toothpick and finally a nostril hair. 
 After Mr. Kurtzman left Mad in a huff, he and Mr. Elder worked together on Trump, a slick satirical magazine financed by Hugh Hefner. It ran for only two issues, whereupon Mr. Kurtzman, Mr. Elder and other colleagues from Mad pooled their resources to create Humbug. It quickly failed, although its successor, Help!, ran from 1962 to 1966.
 At Help!, Mr. Elder created Goodman Beaver, a Candide figure adrift in a corrupt world. In one episode, ''Goodman Goes Playboy,'' Archie, Jughead and other characters from Archie Comics headed to the Playboy mansion for a night of drinking, smoking and sex, lured by a satanic figure with a remarkable resemblance to Mr. Hefner.
 The executives at Archie Comics did not laugh. They sued and won, but Mr. Hefner loved the cartoon. The partners soon created a new property for Mr. Hefner, ''Little Annie Fanny,'' a comic strip chronicling the sexual adventures of a character who was essentially Little Orphan Annie grown up and outfitted with enormous breasts. Mr. Elder created a separate watercolor illustration for each panel of the cartoon, which ran from 1962 to 1988.
 Fantagraphics Books has published two collections of Mr. Elder's work: ''Will Elder: The Mad Playboy of Art'' (2003) and ''Chicken Fat'' (2006). It is scheduled to publish the full run of Humbug in August.

HEADLINE: A Rock, a Hard Place and an Exit Strategy

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
DO you feel that you're working harder and harder to get ahead financially, but can't even seem to stay in the same place? Do you feel trapped by larger forces that are increasing your cost of living but lowering your income? Do you worry about losing your job or having to change your career, even as news reports say the overall economy is growing and you see a privileged few enjoying unparalleled prosperity?
 Jared Bernstein offers an explanation for the causes of this economic disconnect in ''Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed?'' (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, $26.95). Mr. Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, also outlines a ''reconnection agenda'' to cure the nation's economic ills. 
 His basic thesis about the current state of the economics profession and the American economy is unapologetically left-leaning.''Economics has been hijacked by the rich and powerful, and it has been forged into a tool that is being used against the rest of us,'' he declares. ''Far too often, economists justify things many of us know to be wrong while claiming the things we believe are critically important can't be done.''
 ''Economics is not an objective, scientific discipline,'' he writes in one of the ''Crunchpoints'' that serve as his chapter summaries. ''It is a set of decisions about how to produce and distribute resources and opportunities.'' 
 Those decisions, he says, are based on power, not computer modeling. His goal is to demystify economics so as ''to rechannel the power of economic analysis back to the service of those who need it most: the ones in the vice grip of the crunch.''
 ''Crunch'' succinctly defines the quandary faced by many Americans. First, Mr. Bernstein duly notes that from 2000 to 2006, the American economy grew by a healthy 15 percent and achieved impressive efficiency gains. 
 But during that same period, he says, the inflation-adjusted weekly earnings of the typical, or median worker, were flat, and the portion of the population officially defined as poor increased to 12.3 percent from 11.3 percent. The costs of health care, child care, college tuition and housing, meanwhile, ''have been growing much faster than the overall average of all prices taken together,'' he says.
 ''The name of the problem is economic inequality, and it's been on the rise for decades,'' Mr. Bernstein says. Looking at the rise of inequality, he blames the breakdown of ''economic mechanisms and forces that used to broadly and fairly distribute the benefits of growth.'' These mechanisms and forces specifically include ''unions, minimum wages, employer and firm loyalty, global competitiveness, full employment, the robust creation of quality jobs, safety nets, and social insurance.''
 Mr. Bernstein acknowledges the benefits of globalization in numerous passages, including one in which he describes replacing his 25-year-old stereo with a better, foreign-made system for the surprisingly low price of $130. At the same time, he reminds us of the problems ranging from the outsourcing of American jobs to the demise of American industries because of competition from cheaper goods from abroad. He says, however, that the crisis created by globalization can at least be ''shaped'' by enlightened political leadership and a sea change in public policies.
 Mr. Bernstein believes that full employment -- as opposed to relatively low unemployment, in the 4 to 6 percent range -- is the key to restoring the bargaining power of workers and unions. He says that the Federal Reserve should focus on promoting job growth over limiting inflation.
 Mr. Bernstein would also reform health care by pooling risk and cutting costs with a government-operated system, because he says ''markets tend to be fairly lousy at providing public goods.'' He would reform immigration by controlling ''immigrant flows'' -- though he opposes building a wall -- and by instituting ''economic integration'' programs for those who earn legal status.
 He would grapple with the double-edged effects of globalization by taking ''some of the benefits of trade'' and plowing them into universal health care, pensions, public infrastructure and a drive for energy independence.
 Mr. Bernstein's efforts are as heartfelt and well-intentioned as those of a college economics professor trying to get through to his freshman students by showing that he's a hip dude, too. And it is definitely more entertaining than an Economics 101 text. But it is also far less comprehensive and is often marred by overly glib prose. 
 Mr. Bernstein sprinkles -- and occasionally drowns -- his presentation with references to the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger. At one point, in describing the Fed, he writes: ''They don't want us guzzling booze, slam dancing to the Clash, and wrecking the property -- that is, they don't want the economy growing too fast such that inflation begins to rise too quickly.''
 As part of his overall attempt to reconcile the apparent paradox of a growing economy and falling wages, he offers a chapter that parodies film noir. (''She had a neckline as low as the Nasdaq in '01, curves like sine waves, and a dress tighter than the global oil supply.'')
 IN any event, Mr. Bernstein makes a fairly persuasive case that economics is a tool that can be used to create a society with a far more equitable distribution of wealth and far more secure social safety nets than we have now. As he also notes, it remains to be seen whether our political leaders and government officials will take the initiative to use economics for the greater common good, or simply for the benefit of special interests.

HEADLINE: How to Stop Inflation From Devouring a Portfolio

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
IS inflation roaring back with a vengeance? It depends on whom you ask.
 ''The experience we have had in recent years harks back to the 1970s,'' when commodities prices surged, said Zvi Bodie, a professor of finance and economics at the Boston University School of Management. He recommends that investors reposition their bond portfolios, in particular, to try to minimize the ravages of inflation.
 But some strategists say the weak economy may help moderate inflation later this year. ''What is holding inflation down, even to this elevated level, is the sluggish economy,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, the global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. ''And I think growth is likely to stay quite sluggish all this year, in which case inflation should come back down.'' 
 In either case, many strategists say that there are few attractive options for investors who may worry most about inflation, like retirees and others who rely on their portfolios to supplement their incomes.
 For example, prices for all kinds of commodities -- from energy to basic materials to gold -- have risen sharply in recent years. Investing in commodities has often been regarded as a good way to hedge a portfolio against inflation, but ''just look at gold in the decades after the 1970s,'' Professor Bodie said. ''Gold's performance for the subsequent 20 years was terrible.''
 On the other hand, Professor Bodie is still a big fan of Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, as well as municipal and corporate bonds that also adjust for inflation. These bonds are often regarded as an alternative way to protect a portfolio from inflation, because of regular adjustments in the bonds' principal based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.
 In fact, he said he would not personally own any bonds now that did not adjust for inflation. ''I don't have to guess with TIPS,'' he said. ''I can lock that inflation-adjusted return in today.'' 
 But Mr. Schweitzer pointed out that inflation-protected bonds have already had a very good run. The Morningstar category for inflation-protected bond funds shows that they have returned 11.5 percent, on average, in the last 12 months. Although these bonds may be good for capital preservation, Mr. Schweitzer said that their current rich prices might mean that they will generate disappointing returns in the coming years -- unless, of course, the economy is entering a long period of high inflation.
 ''The bottom line is there is no free lunch,'' he said. ''If you try to protect yourself against inflation with either or both of these approaches, then you have to either give up return,'' by accepting the lower yields that are now available on TIPS, ''or take on more risk'' in the commodity markets.
 Some strategists adhere to the common advice that equities offer the best chance to beat inflation over the long haul. 
 ''If you are looking to outpace inflation, you should be investing in stocks,'' said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.
 For the moment, Mr. Stovall recommends underweighting bonds while maintaining a neutral position on stocks. For example, if an investor keeps 60 percent of her total portfolio in stocks, he might advise that she keep 25 percent of the total in bonds and 15 percent in cash. His usual recommendation would have been to put 30 percent of the portfolio in bonds and just 10 percent in cash.
 Moreover, Mr. Stovall said that once investors felt comfortable enough to put more money into the markets, they should buy stocks rather than bonds.
 Jim Floyd, a senior analyst and mutual fund manager at the Leuthold Group, an investment research and mutual fund company in Minneapolis, recommends a more defensive stance.
 ''I think you should keep half of your portfolio in stocks and the other half in bonds, but I wouldn't put any of that in U.S. Treasuries,'' he said. Mr. Floyd said that Treasuries were now too pricey and that he saw better opportunities in the foreign sovereign debt markets.
 Mr. Floyd, who edits Inflation Watch, a monthly newsletter for Leuthold, said he was most concerned about sky-high commodity prices.
 ''I think there is a real risk that they could burst just like the housing bubble,'' he said.
 Instead of focusing too much on the price spikes at the gas pump and in the grocery store -- and the huge profits that those increases have generated for commodity producers -- Mr. Floyd recommended taking a fresh look at some stocks that have suffered recently. He said that there might be opportunities in consumer products, utilities and financials, including insurance companies, banks and real estate investment trusts. ''You want to buy the companies that are beaten down before the good news comes out,'' he said.
 But there are still plenty of commodity bulls around.
 Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, based in Great Neck, N.Y., said he thought that commodity prices could have further to run. He cited rising demand in developing nations like China and India, combined with dwindling discoveries of raw materials that are relatively easy to extract.
 ''Let's face it, as much as we try to scratch the planet Earth, we don't find any cheap stuff around anymore,'' Mr. Yardeni said. 
 But he warned individual investors against buying commodities, for example, through one of the scores of commodity exchange-traded funds that have sprouted in recent years. Commodity prices are so volatile, he said, that individual investors who bought them would probably not sleep too well at night. 
 Instead, he advised investors to take a page from the San Francisco gold rush.
 If you are an investor who thinks that the commodity boom is far from over, he said, ''don't get yourself dirty digging for gold; open up a shop that sells picks and shovels.''
 He said that such ''pick-and-shovel'' stocks include shares of oil-field services companies, specialty chemical manufacturers, fertilizer makers and other companies that provide the materials or services on which the mining and agricultural industries rely.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Lenders Raise the Bar

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IF you have a mortgage, consider yourself lucky.
 That is the upshot of the most recent survey of mortgage lenders by the Federal Reserve Board, which found that banks' lending standards were significantly tighter in April than they had been in January, when credit was already tight.
 Some prospective borrowers who just a few months ago were considered easy bets for mortgages are being turned away with the slightest credit blemishes -- or even with stellar credit scores. 
 ''Standards are getting a lot tighter,'' said Bob Moulton, president of Americana Mortgage Group, a brokerage firm based in Manhasset, N.Y. ''For every 20 calls I get, I might close four or five loans. Two years ago, it'd be 18.''
 Mr. Moulton said that one recent client sought to buy a $2.5 million home on Long Island with a $1.5 million down payment and full documentation of his income. The bank refused the loan because the borrower's credit score was 672. A single recently missed credit card payment can sometimes be enough to drop a borrower's score below 700.
 ''It's all about the credit score now,'' Mr. Moulton said. ''I'd say 700 is a minimum score now. Some banks are requiring 740, particularly for interest-only loans,'' in which the borrower pays only interest for the first 5 or 10 years of the loan before starting to pay down principal.
 Brokers and bankers in the greater New York area said that stated-income loans -- typically used by the self-employed or workers paid on commission who cannot document steady streams of income -- are all but gone. (Mr. Moulton said he had recently found only two lenders who would write such mortgages.) The same is true for subprime loans, offered to high-risk borrowers.
 James Bremm, a senior mortgage banker with Atlantic National Mortgage, a brokerage firm based in Westport, Conn., said borrowers with credit scores between 680 and 700 can still find loans, especially from regional savings banks, which have been more active in marketing mortgages in recent months. But that threshold was 20 points lower until a few months ago, he said.
 Those with slightly lower credit scores have to make significantly higher down payments, Mr. Bremm and others said, and they must endure longer reviews. ''If you're self-employed, you might need a letter from your C.P.A.,'' he said, ''or if you're a landscaper for a family company, you might need to show two full years of tax returns.''
 Mortgage industry executives say they expect even further tightening of lending standards in the coming months, as banks protect themselves from the possibility of a deepening recession and stabilize their own financial situations.
 Meanwhile, those who can qualify for loans are facing more fees than in the past. David Hamermesh, an analyst with TowerGroup, a financial consultancy based in Needham, Mass., said, ''In the past, borrowers with credit scores below 680 and down payments of less than 30 percent could not get the best deals.'' Now, he said, the threshold for higher fees has been raised, dragging in those with credit scores below 720 and down payments of less than 40 percent.
 The fees range from 0.5 percent of the loan amount to 0.75 percent, which borrowers pay upfront or with a higher interest rate. Borrowers in areas where property values are declining, Mr. Hamermesh added, face additional fees of 0.25 percent and requirements for an additional five percentage points on the down payment.

HEADLINE: A Rock Star, Finally

BYLINE: By JUN HARAGUCHI; As told to GLENN RIFKIN. 
As told to Glenn Rifkin.

 BODY:
I WAS born in the city of Sasebo in southern Japan right near a United States naval base. My father, who had been a soldier during World War II, had his own construction company there and some of my mother's friends married Americans. So we had a lot of connections with American families. 
 I experienced World War II through my father, and I also experienced the Vietnam War in a unique way by growing up near a United States military base. Every night, I'd watch the news and hear about the miserable situation in Vietnam. 
 Two things happened in my life then. I started to listen to American music, which was strongly influenced by the war. And when I was in high school, my father's company went bankrupt due to the economy. I took that event as a positive thing because it meant I wouldn't be able to go to college and I could become a rock star. 
 I was seriously trying to be a rock star back then. My only restriction was that I was not an American so I didn't look like a rock star. 
 Music was not just a hobby. Music was a really good interpreter of what was going on in the world. And it became really important to me. I was heavily influenced by people like Joe Cocker. He had an amazing voice. Jimi Hendrix became my religion. No one could play like him. It was not just his technique; he drew a picture of the world through his guitar. Jimi Hendrix and I have the same initials, which gives me a spiritual connection to him. I was 15 years old and I played guitar in my rock band. I started to copy everyone, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Hendrix. My band played at the local high school's events. 
 My mother began crying that it was the end of the world: ''Jun, don't make so much noise. It doesn't satisfy or entertain anyone, so stop it.'' My father was quiet. He confessed to me that when he was young, he had played violin, which was considered very weird for a Japanese boy in those days. So he understood what I was feeling and didn't complain.
 In 1976, I decided to visit the United States. In Japan, there was an obsession with everything American, and I wanted to get the experience. I bought a two-month Greyhound bus pass and I took one bag. I spoke little English. I landed in San Francisco and traveled around, visiting music shops in all the big cities. 
 I was trying to meet musicians in the studios in L.A. to talk to them about music. A couple of guitarists were willing to invite me into a studio, and I realized I was just an amateur and this was a different world. It was a dream I couldn't fulfill. I was shocked. 
 Even with my dream shattered, the trip made me realize that I really liked the culture at that time in the States. I felt that there might one day be other opportunities for me in this country. I said to myself, ''I shall return!''
 I got a job back in Japan with Konica in 1979. It had a down-to-earth, friendly culture. I was a pretty unique guy in the company, wearing yellow shirts and blue ties. People said to me, ''You are from Mars.'' But that was the reason I liked the company: they tolerated different species. I was crazy, but I was also working hard and doing my job.
 I spent six years in Germany and Italy and eventually got my wish to return to the United States. One thing I learned is that in life, there are things we can control and things we can't. I decided not to be bothered by things I couldn't control. I realized you need humor. You can't be serious all the time.
 I play in a company band. At last year's office holiday party, I performed John Lennon's ''Happy Christmas (War Is Over).'' I am the lead singer. My wife thinks I sound like Billy Joel, and I can play ''Piano Man'' on the ukulele. Because I'm the C.E.O., everyone has to applaud.

 KIDNAPPED AMBASSADOR
 Freed by Captors
 Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan, who was kidnapped three months ago by Taliban militants as he traveled in Pakistan's tribal area, was released Friday night, the government said. The envoy, Tariq Azizuddin, arrived in Islamabad Saturday afternoon. The move came as the government was expected to complete a broad peace deal with the Pakistani Taliban in the coming days. PAGE 12
 TESTS ON MEDIA CONTROLS
 The earthquake in China has tested the country in many ways, including a climbing death toll and the logistical nightmare posed by a mountainous region with narrow, treacherous roads. One of the biggest challenges, though, is to the country's propaganda system, which has been hamstrung when trying to micromanage media coverage of the earthquake, as it does most major news stories in China. PAGE 6 
 BUSH'S PROGNOSTICATIONS
 President Bush's ''bold vision'' for the Middle East delivered last week to the Israeli Parliament was fine with most members of that body. But listeners in the next country on Mr. Bush's itinerary, Saudi Arabia, were not as enthused. A Reporter's Notebook. PAGE 12 
 NATIONAL
 EXPENSIVE BATTLE SEEN
 Over Marriage Initiative
 The California Supreme Court's decision affirming the right to same-sex marriage has set in motion a ballot initiative whose supporters hope will have the effect of undoing the ruling. Groups on either side of the issue expect to spend as much as $20 million trying to convince state voters of the merits of their argument. And interest is not limited to California. PAGE 18
 THE DIVIDE FOR DEMOCRATS
 House Democrats have been winning more elections of late, but at a price. Some of the new members from previously Republican districts are considerably more conservative than other members of the caucus they join. The challenge is how to bridge the widening ideological divide in their own ranks, and the strain has already been visible. PAGE 25

 FASHION SHOW 
 At a Troubled School
 Camden High School in New Jersey had weathered a cafeteria brawl that led to the arrest of 18 teenagers, a 14-year-old boy's smuggling a gun into school in his backpack and the firing of the principal. But it was a hip-hop fashion show, proposed by a clothing maker, that presented some of the most unusual issues. Among them: Were the students just being used? PAGE 27
 AN AGENCY IN DISARRAY
 The state's main economic development agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, has been in disarray, plagued by turf battles, poor management and the political collapse of Gov. Eliot Spitzer. It was blamed for the collapse of two of the largest projects in New York City. Hard questions about priorities linger. But it remains rudderless. PAGE 27
 CHANGING FACE OF AIDS
 They call themselves the Divas, a telling name for this group of African-American and Hispanic women over 50 who are H.I.V. positive. And they represent the changing face of H.I.V. and AIDS: Blacks and Hispanics make up 24 percent of the nation's female population, but 82 percent of new AIDS diagnoses among women. PAGE 29
 SPORTS
 LOOMING OVER BASEBALL,
 2003's Failed Drug Tests
 Documents linking more than 100 major league baseball players to positive tests for steroids in 2003 could soon be released to government prosecutors pursuing drug dealers. If so, leaks or public testimony would inevitably provide the names, a possibility neither the players nor the sport would relish. PAGE 1
 BASKETBALL'S SOCCER LINK
 No one is expecting to see N.B.A. players start passing with their feet, or scoring goals off headers. But as rosters increasingly grow international, the influence of soccer is undeniable. Just look at the Lakers and their quick-passing offense, predicated on proper angles, spacing and movement without the ball. That the fulcrum is Pau Gasol, the Spanish center with the vision of a playmaking soccer midfielder, seems more than coincidence. PAGE 5 
 OBITUARIES
 WILL ELDER, 86
 A cartoonist, his frantic, overstuffed illustrations helped to define the comic identity of Mad magazine. Mr. Elder took particular joy in drawing grubby-looking crooks with no talent for crime, like Melvin Mole; parody ads; and caricatures of public and show-business figures. He was also a creator of the Playboy cartoon serial ''Little Annie Fanny.'' PAGE 31

 MAKING MONEY
 From Defunct Brands
 Manufacturers spend millions of dollars building up a name for their products, and sometimes the products just disappear. But what marketers refer to as brand ''equity'' -- part familiarity, part positive associations -- doesn't go away so easily, and some people see using that memory as a way to make money. PAGE 48

 THE MAN BEHIND
 'Ich Bin Ein Berliner'
 The speechwriter Ted Sorensen grew so close to John F. Kennedy that it was sometimes hard to tell whose words were whose. He has now written a book, ''A Life at the Edge of History,'' that may sort some of that out, along with providing some other glimpses behind the scenes of history. PAGE 10
 Arts & Leisure
 CALL HIM A BAD DIRECTOR,
 And Then Duck
 There are unloved movie directors, and there is Uwe Boll. Mr. Boll, whose oeuvre has been largely inspired by video games, has engendered a particularly vocal kind of antipathy. He has challenged some of his ardent critics to boxing matches (and beaten them badly). His latest movie, ''Postal,'' is not likely to win over those detractors who call his work tasteless: It portrays President Bush as not only in league with Osama bin Laden, but also in love with him.

 PARK SLOPE: 
 Where Is the Love
 Why do so many people hate Park Slope? Theories abound. Some Slopers say that the vitriol reserved for their Brooklyn neighborhood is from people who are jealous that they do not live there. ''I imagine there's some horror fantasy fusion: the well-off Park Sloper and co-op member who is obsessed with his kids,'' one neighborhood writer said. ''Oh, wait, I just described myself.'' PAGE 1
 WHAT'S UP HIS SLEEVE?
 John Gaughan specialized in ''big magic.'' He has designed large-scale illusions for Siegfried & Roy, David Blaine and David Copperfield, as well as illusions used in films like ''Forrest Gump'' and Broadway shows. Among magicians, he is a legend, but most people outside the field do not know who he is. And he likes it that way. PAGE 1

 IN SEARCH OF
 The Real Ireland
 In post-millennial Ireland, a visitor may go to a restaurant and be served dinner by a man with an Eastern European accent instead of a brogue. Or maybe she will run into a Brazilian festival being observed by South American transplants. While it is still possible to come across a clot of sheep blocking your rental car's path, Ireland is in the midst of profound cultural change, with curious juxtapositions of the old and new. PAGE 1
 A JAUNT TO LUANG PRABANG
 Though much of Southeast Asia's cities are well traveled by tourists, Mary Billard says that the ancient Laotian capital of Luang Prabang still feels as if it's waiting to be discovered. Visitors can climb Mount Phousi's steep, snaking stairway, cruise down the Mekong, or give alms to a streaming line of monks. And for the hungry, there is always the roasted fattened pig face.

 BEIJING AS BOOMTOWN

 Since the Concorde was grounded in 2003, there has not been a non-military jet in the sky that has flown faster than the speed of sound.

 Myanmar opted to restrict access to its delta region after it was devastated by a cyclone. But China took another tack following its recent earthquake, with its government opting to give the world a vivid look at the disaster's aftermath. Phil Taubman points to Mikhail Gorbachev's push toward glasnost and reform in Soviet-era Russia, and says that once the genie of openness is out of the bottle, it is very hard for authoritarian governments to put it back inside.

 FINISHING YOUR FOOD

HEADLINE: A Honda on a Diesel Diet

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
HONDA has spent decades establishing a reputation for fuel efficiency. But nothing in the company's current lineup, including its Civic Hybrid, can match the mileage of the diesel Accord that I recently tested in and around New York City. 
 Minus its diesel powertrain, the European-market 2007 Accord that I drove is nearly identical to the car that Honda had been selling in the United States as the Acura TSX. That Accord should give a solid indication of the mileage and performance American consumers can expect when Acura offers a diesel option for the redesigned 2009 TSX. 
 The Accord -- a demonstration car provided by Robert Bosch, the German technology company, to highlight its fuel injectors and other diesel components -- returned a remarkable 53 miles a gallon on the highway, 34 in the city and 44 in combined driving. Those miles included a bumper-to-bumper crawl through Manhattan, the worst possible conditions for fuel efficiency. 
 The model I drove was powered by a 4-cylinder diesel displacing 2.2 liters and producing 140 horsepower and a stout 250 pound-feet of torque -- the force that drivers feel pushing them into their seats under acceleration. That huge torque relative to the engine's size is a main advantage of modern turbodiesels, making them well-suited to small economy cars and to burly S.U.V.'s that need torque for towing and hauling.
 The America-bound Acura will use a new version of the 2.2-liter engine that I tested. The engine is notable for meeting 50-state emissions standards with no need to carry an onboard tank of urea, an ammonia-generating solution that other diesels use to scrub smoggy nitrogen oxides from the exhaust. Honda's patented pollution system generates its own ammonia to fulfill the same mission. While that cleaner emissions system wasn't installed on the Honda I tested, engineers expect it to have no discernable effect on fuel economy. 
 As with other diesels I've driven recently, the Honda's frugal highway mileage and versatile power are important advantages over the typical hybrid. The Accord covered the zero-to-60 run in just under 9 seconds in my testing, which doesn't sound spectacular on paper. But its passing power from 30, 50 or even 70 miles an hour was terrific, as the Honda easily shot past slower cars. 
 And as more hybrid owners are discovering, their cars deliver little or no mileage gain on the highway. That's because battery packs and electric motors add several hundred pounds, and the system also contributes negligible energy at freeway speeds.
 Also unlike hybrids, which require drivers to go easy on the gas pedal, watch the speed limit and coast when possible to improve the mileage, the diesel Honda delivered brilliant economy with no special effort. Even spirited driving didn't dent the mileage much. The Accord delivered 50 m.p.g. even during a 75-m.p.h. cruise and 40 m.p.g. when I flogged it like a Nascar yahoo. 
 The Acura's only diesel telltale is an idle that's slightly louder than a gasoline car's, though it's not at all obtrusive. There was no trace of diesel smell or black exhaust and except for the enormous diesel decal on the car's side, my passengers would have been unaware that a diesel was under the hood. 
 I also recently spent a week with the Audi Q7 3.0 TDI sport utility, which will go on sale in January. That model, with a 3-liter turbocharged V-6, delivered about 25 m.p.g. on the highway. But the Audi's mileage seemed more fragile than the Honda's, dropping sharply in city traffic and in spirited driving. That was probably due to its sheer mass; the Q7 weighed more than 5,000 pounds. 
 Audi also demonstrates the performance possibilities of diesel with its exotic R8 V-12 TDI concept sports car, which I took for a too-brief test drive. That blood-red, all-wheel-drive Audi had a 12-cylinder diesel mounted behind my head, generating 500 horsepower and an astounding 737 pound-feet of torque. Audi claims the R8 will rocket from 0 to 60 in about 4 seconds and reach a top speed of 190 m.p.h., all while delivering 24 m.p.g. Audi has not said whether it will put the car into production.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Corbett's Request: Chapter 3: The Czechoslovakia Lady

BYLINE: By COLIN HARRISON

 BODY:
Chapter 3: The Czechoslovakia Lady
 You can find out a lot about a recently dead man on the Internet if you are willing to put in some time, even if you are philosophically opposed to the ease of the endeavor. Let me amend that: you can find out a lot about a recently dead man on the Internet if he was part of the world whose existence is recorded there, however incompletely. Which is also to say if he was part of organized, digitized society, as had been Roger Corbett. 
 James Hicks, the private detective, had given me an index card with the name and number of a Roberto Montoya, but before I called this person I wanted to know a little more about Roger himself. I'd seen on the security-camera video how he died. Maybe now I could see how he lived.
 So the next night I poured some more of my world-class $14 wine and went looking for whatever remains of Roger Corbett were buried on computer servers around the country. Such a strange time we live in. I like it and I don't. Of course, I found out about Roger in bits and pieces, and some facts suggested an interpretation that was not narrowly provable. But once I put the information in order, I began to get something. 
 Roger Corbett attended Columbia University, class of 1980, majoring in economics. He immediately got his M.B.A. from Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, and like a lot of well-credentialed young people in the 1980s, he found his way into one of the cells of the huge money hives in the city, as an ''analyst.'' At the age of 31 he married one Valerie Caruth, age 22, whose father owned a large Chrysler dealership in Atlanta. In their wedding announcement, Valerie Caruth was identified as ''an actress,'' but the credits I was able to find involved only several commercials for home-cleaning products, modeling for furniture advertisements and voice-overs for radio spots. The earliest photo of her that I could find, taken years later, showed a perky strawberry blond in her early 30s. It appeared that she had certain charms of contour, shall we say. In an even later photo she had acquired hair the color of Jessica Simpson's. After college (S.M.U., class of '89), the perky and increasingly blond Valerie Caruth apparently made her way to New York City and met Roger Corbett, who was by then six or seven years into a midlevel Wall Street career and, you might surmise, the owner of more than a few good suits and ties. The wedding announcement also mentioned Wilson Corbett as the founding partner of my law firm. 
 But Roger was not a killer, not one of those young partners to-be-at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. Not top-top drawer. Few are, let us remember. (I myself long ago realized that I was, at best, on my good days, clinging to the underside of the second drawer.) But on Wall Street you can be an inflatable clown and make a lot of money if you are in the right place at the right time, like America in the '80s and '90s. And it appeared that Roger Corbett did make a lot of money, by everyday standards. He and Valerie moved to the Orienta section of Mamaroneck, in 1993, to a six-bedroom house on Cove Road that they bought for slightly more than $2 million. Their name appeared on the annual reports for several charitable organizations, and although they were not usually listed as the most generous benefactors, their gifts were midlevel and respectable, as these things go. 
 Roger and his son, Timothy, appeared in an article about a local youth-league lacrosse team. A color photo showed Roger's brown hair thinning, weight creeping into his stomach and chest and face. The boy, who looked like a good kid, clutched his lacrosse stick enthusiastically. Valerie Corbett's name began to appear as ''campaign co-chairperson'' for several small charitable concerns. Roger gave small amounts of money to a variety of local and national political candidates, Republicans and Democrats. The sums suggested not congruency of belief but rather an adherence to the expectations of others, perhaps his corporate bosses. His wife's name appeared in a testimonial for a local landscape-design service called Green Acres, in which she was quoted as saying: ''We decided the old pool was too small, and so after the new pool was put in, Green Acres came in and redesigned everything, the formal garden, the pool-deck plantings and the barbecue area. They performed the job on time and kept the work site tidy. We are totally thrilled with the results.'' 
 Roger's career sailed smoothly through the 2000 tech meltdown, but all was not well. He and his wife sold their vacation house on Cooksey Drive on Mount Desert Isle in Maine, and he changed jobs soon thereafter to another investment bank. You hit 45, 46 in this city, you've got to make sure your feet are on solid ground. Roger lasted two years there, then moved to another firm. His name then appeared as one of eight portfolio managers in a new hedge fund called Goliath Partners Event Dynamics and Global Sector Fund, established in early 2006 and domiciled in the Bahamas. Was this supposed to be the big payday? Many of the hedge funds had been leveraging themselves like mad then, borrowing to buy the mortgage securities that looked so lucrative and that were later revealed to be financial toxic waste. This relationship did not appear to last long, because a year later, he was associated with a new Internet venture. Although I'm no expert on hedge funds (who is? Not the guys who run them), I assumed that this meant either that he was thrown overboard or that the fund soon failed. What if he told his colleagues they were taking on too much risk and they dumped him as a doom-and-gloomer? Or maybe it was the other way around. 
 Anyway, he moved on to the Internet venture, which suggested to me that he put some of his own money into it. His previous job as a hedge-fund manager was not mentioned. The new Internet venture involved the establishment of online real-estate franchises that would provide ''personalized and extraordinarily sophisticated'' market analysis for potential home buyers. Sounded like pure pixie dust to me, and given what happened to real estate starting in 2007, I doubt it had any chance at all, no matter how brilliant the idea might have been. In any case, the site was no longer active, and I assumed it went bust.
 Meanwhile, in January 2007 the house on Cove Road was sold for $4.4 million, and the wife rematerialized in San Diego as the host of a public-access cable-TV cooking show. Her name was listed in a fund-raiser for a big local hospital, which had photos, and I saw she was standing next to a tall, rather athletic-looking heart surgeon of about 60, as he smiled with sly amusement into the camera, his hand casually wrapped around her waist. He looked so good I wondered if he was taking HGH, like some of my older colleagues in the firm, who swear by it. Now about 40, Valerie Corbett still possessed certain charms of contour, and if anything, they had become more charming. Hicks, the private investigator, told me that her father and mother retired to San Diego, and it appeared that she'd fled there upon the collapse of her marriage. 
 How many children did she and Roger have? Hicks said there were ''kids.'' And kids cost money. If the Corbetts sold the house for $4 million, they probably had a few more million in retirement funds and savings. But divorces have a way of eating up huge sums of money. The lawyers, the costs of two households. And maybe they'd borrowed against the value of the house to launch the Internet venture. It was the kind of thing people did so confidently back then, so recently, yet so long ago. That could have eaten up a few million easily. 
 Where did this leave Roger? His Internet trail went dead in the summer of 2007. The last listing was in the white pages, showing an R. Corbett on Mulberry Street in Lower Manhattan. That was it; thereafter he ceased being virtual and existed only in the real world.
 I turned off the computer and looked at my notes. The points of information on the Internet suggested a sad and yet not unfamiliar arc. Raised with every economic and educational advantage, Roger Corbett was a young man of middling ability who somehow fell off the happy train of American capitalism circa 2005. Maybe disorder in the marriage was the cause, or maybe the marriage was a casualty. I could ask his former wife. 
 In the morning I found the index card Hicks had given me, with Roberto Montoya's name and number written in block letters, and called. The phone was picked up, and I heard the sound of machinery, maybe an electric drill. Then it stopped.
 ''Yeah?''
 I identified myself and said I was looking into Roger Corbett's affairs for his family.
 ''I knew I was gonna get a call like this,'' he breathed. ''Matter of time.''
 ''Any chance we could meet?''
 ''I'll be at the American Legion park Saturday morning. I got a game at 11. You want to talk, get there before that.''
 I asked him where ''American Legion'' was.
 ''You ain't from Brooklyn, I guess.''
 ''Nope.''
 ''Take the Belt to Canarsie Pier, straight up on Rockaway Parkway, right on Seaview, one block on your right.''
 ''Thanks,'' I said.
 ''Don't thank me,'' he warned, ''I ain't done nothing for you yet, and maybe it's going to stay that way.''
 arly the next Saturday morning I told my wife, Susan, I was going for a drive to Brooklyn.
 ''What? You're going to miss Rachel's call?'' Our daughter phoned from college every Saturday morning. It was a ritual we had. Her freshman year had been a little bumpy -- boys, tough professors -- and the calls had helped her. Her spring exams were coming up, and we wanted to keep tabs on them. Susan shook her head in anger. ''You know, George, this whole thing with Roger Corbett, this psychic expedition, is really a pain,'' she said. ''You're getting a little weird about it.''
 ''I am?''
 ''Don't you think you are?''
 ''Yes,'' I said, ''now that you mention it.''
 It was a good thing I left early because the pope was in town, affecting traffic. I cut across to the F.D.R., hopped on the Brooklyn Bridge and then on the Belt Parkway. The Verrazano Bridge soared in front of me, the big red-hulled tankers coming up the river to my right. People who live in Manhattan forget (if they ever knew) how huge Brooklyn is, how you can drive 15 miles just swinging around the big belly of the borough before you get to Queens. 
 I pulled into the American Legion fields through a chain-link fence. The gravel lot was jammed with S.U.V.'s and minivans, and I saw two umps putting on their uniforms. I walked toward a clubhouse set in the middle of four ball fields, one of them abandoned to the weeds. It had been a while since anyone emptied the trash bins. The fields lay right beneath the flight pattern for J.F.K., the jumbo jets floating overhead every minute or so. 
 The three fields each had two teams warming up, most of the kids black or Latino. I found Roberto Montoya standing on a field hitting flies to his outfielders. His team was called the East New York Diamond Kings. They wore sharp red and green uniforms and looked like a little professional team, with matching shoes, wristbands, even equipment bags. Montoya saw me standing behind the backstop, hit a few more, then handed the bat to another coach.
 ''You that guy that called?''
 I nodded. He shook my hand without conviction.
 ''Roger Corbett's family has asked me to look into the situation surrounding his death,'' I said.
 ''He got hit by that garbage truck over on Elizabeth Street,'' Montoya said. 
 ''He did.''
 Roberto hitched up his baggy shorts. ''So what's to look into?''
 ''There were some unresolved matters in his affairs,'' I said.
 His mouth puckered like something tasted bad to him. ''What d'you do again?''
 ''I'm an insurance lawyer.''
 This seemed to relieve him. ''I just thought I'd ask, because you know, sometimes people can get kinda crazy, get all -- ''
 ''How'd you know Mr. Corbett?''
 ''Me? I was his super. I run the building.''
 Then their connection was a reasonable one. I wondered why Hicks, the private investigator, had been so mysterious about Montoya's identity. ''Did you know Roger Corbett?''
 ''Nah, not really, how you doing, whatever. He was quiet, no trouble.''
 ''I'm looking for people who knew him pretty well.''
 ''You ask his girlfriend?''
 ''No, who's that?''
 ''The Czechoslovakia lady, she lives in the same building.''
 ''What's her name?''
 He winced. ''Geez, it's hard to remember.''
 ''You're the super of the building she lives in and you don't remember?''
 He looked at me. ''See the thing of it is, see, is we play in a wood-bat league here. The City of New York made all the high-school teams go from metal bats to wood because of the safety issue, balls get hit too hard. I like it because the wood-bat game is real baseball. You gotta do all the little things right, got to work the count for walks, got to run out grounders. Everything counts in wood bat, see. Can't fake it no more. But the whole reason they went to metal bats in the first place is that wood bats break. Kids break them constantly. Today my kids'll break one, maybe two bats. A good bat, like a Sam Bat or a Mizuno, they go a hundred bucks retail. Even a crappy bat is gonna cost you 50 bucks. Lotta these kids, see, their families don't got a lot of money, and our organization -- ''
 I pulled out my wallet. ''Maybe I can make a little contribution to your ball club.''
 ''That would be very appreciated, let me tell you.''
 I handed him $100, including one of those new $5 bills with purple and yellow in it.
 He studied me, then lifted his red and green ball cap. He looked inside the brim and fished out a piece of paper. He unfolded it. ''Here.''
 It was a sweat-dampened 8-by-10 color photograph of a woman's hand, posed reaching upward, with a phone number and the name Eliska Sedlacek printed below it.
 Montoya smiled at my instant interest. As far as he was concerned, I was getting my money's worth. ''See, the thing of it is, when you're a super, people always ask you questions, and you got to be prepared.''
 He turned and hollered in Spanish at his boys to hustle in to the dugout. We were done.
 The umps had arrived, and the parents were setting out coolers and portable canvas chairs. I would have liked to stay and root for Roberto's team, but I had one Eliska Sedlacek to find, Roger Corbett's girlfriend. I wondered if his lovely widow, now to be seen on the arm of a wealthy San Diego surgeon, knew about her. Maybe. But maybe a lot of things. Eliska Sedlacek. A name my Internet search hadn't turned up. But why should it have? For better or worse -- probably worse, Roger Corbett left his old life behind before leaving life itself altogether. 
 Next week: George goes down to the Blue Curtain Lounge and meets a bartender with stories to tell.

HEADLINE: Ethanol and the Energy Question

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Rethinking Ethanol'' (editorial, May 11):
 Waiving the renewable fuel standard and killing ethanol tax credits would be similar to eating seed corn. With no seed, there is no crop. The renewable fuel standard and tax credits are the seed we need to stimulate the next generation of cellulosic biofuels.
 It is unlikely that waiving the requirements of the renewable fuel standard would cause any reduction in corn prices, let alone food costs. Corn prices mainly affect consumer prices through livestock production, and the marginal price effects would take several months, even years, to work their way through to the consumer. 
 A good portion of the corn freed up by a waiver of the renewable fuel standard would very likely be snapped up by the export markets, and the price response would probably be limited to 10 to 20 cents per bushel.
 The renewable fuel standard lowers our current gas prices by as much as 15 percent, saving consumers roughly 50 cents a gallon. The production of 6.5 billion gallons of ethanol in 2007 displaced the need for 228 million barrels of oil.
 Experts never said ethanol would replace petroleum, but it is important. And it brings us one step closer to cellulosic biofuel, and that means greater energy independence.
 Bob Stallman President American Farm Bureau Federation Washington, May 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 There is an ethanol alternative that does not use food as a feedstock. It uses a negative-cost feedstock that we have plenty of: garbage.
 The municipal and industrial waste generated in the United States could provide up to 50 billion gallons per year of clean transportation fuels through the use of plasma gasification. It could also provide a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating methane gas from landfills.
 Building on progress over the last two decades, waste conversion using plasma gasification has become a commercial reality as an environmentally friendly and economical way to transform waste material into clean energy.
 Daniel R. Cohn Cambridge, Mass., May 12, 2008
 The writer, a senior research scientist at M.I.T., is a co-founder of a plasma gasification technology company.
 To the Editor:
 While you urge Congress not to ''give up on biofuels'' to help ''reduce the country's dependence on imported oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,'' your policy prescriptions would undercut this vital national goal.
 The current corn-based ethanol industry is not only keeping gasoline prices lower than they otherwise would be -- Merrill Lynch estimates gasoline prices would be 15 percent higher without biofuels -- but also only minimally contributing to higher food prices.
 Curiously, The Times itself has reported that the major factors behind rising world food prices -- which some self-interested parties want to blame on ethanol -- are sky-high oil prices, growing demand in China and other developing nations, droughts in Australia and elsewhere, commodity speculation and the falling dollar.
 Finally, there are many studies that document the global warming benefits of burning ethanol versus gasoline. How is it that you would rather support a policy that would result in more, rather than less, oil consumption?
 John R. Block Washington, May 14, 2008
 The writer was secretary of agriculture, 1981-86.
 To the Editor:
 ''Rethinking Ethanol'' misses an important point about the continued importance of support for corn-based ethanol, a point that Congress understood when crafting the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
 Congress wisely recognized the direct relationship between advancing today's corn-based ethanol and supporting the development of second-generation biofuels. Your editorial calls for an approach that, if followed, would undermine the very goals you support. 
 Ensuring demand for today's ethanol creates the conditions necessary for the large-scale investments in infrastructure and technology required to realize the promise of tomorrow's even better biofuels.
 We understand that people are looking for solutions to today's higher food prices. You are right to point out that spiraling energy costs and increased demand are the primary drivers of these costs and that ethanol plays only a small role. 
 So, retreat from current policies would not meaningfully reduce food costs; it would, however, increase gas prices, tailpipe emissions and our dependence on foreign oil.
 We see a bright future where policies that advance ethanol production today also drive investments that speed our progress to the next generation of biofuels. We hope that future is not undermined by shortsighted approaches that penalize consumers and discourage investment. Patricia A. Woertz Chairman and Chief Executive Archer Daniels Midland Company Decatur, Ill., May 13, 2008

HEADLINE: A Man Who Loves Big Museums

BYLINE: By JORI FINKEL

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
 WHEN James Cuno stepped into his job as director and president of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2004, employees were a touch nervous. The departing director, James Wood, had begun the most ambitious expansion in the museum's history. But ground had not yet been broken. And although he had raised $120 million, at least twice that would be needed. 
 It was a pivotal time, and after 24 years at the museum Mr. Wood was handing the reins to a man who had led the Courtauld Institute in London for less than 24 months.
 Then late one afternoon, one employee after another caught sight of Mr. Cuno moving into his office -- by himself. Although the museum has a staff of nearly 600, he was carting and carrying stacks of books on his own. It was an early sign that Mr. Cuno, who goes by Jim and not James, would be a down-to-earth, hands-on leader, one with a deep commitment to recent art-historical scholarship. 
 ''I'm a bit compulsive about my library -- the way it's organized, which is rather intuitive,'' said Mr. Cuno, 57. ''And physically putting the books away helps me to remember where they are.''
 This month he can add a new title of his own to those shelves: ''Who Owns Antiquity?,'' published by Princeton University Press. While it is far from his first book (he has written about Jasper Johns and Joseph Beuys, among other artists), it is his first dedicated to the political minefield of cultural patrimony. A condemnation of cultural property laws that restrict the international trade in antiquities, the book doubles as a celebration of the world's great border-crossing encyclopedic museums, among them the Art Institute and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
 The book carries a back-jacket blurb from Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Met. He calls it ''a must-read for all concerned with the fate of our ancient heritage.'' Others are calling Mr. Cuno a one of the front-runners to succeed Mr. de Montebello, who has announced plans to retire. 
 In an interview at his office on a rainy April day Mr. Cuno sat at a coffee table near advance copies of his book. Blueprints for the Art Institute's expansion by the architect Renzo Piano lined the wall. 
 He wore a dark suit and a clear plastic watch with orange and yellow hands and colorful gears. ''It's a Swatch watch designed by Renzo Piano,'' he said. ''He gave it to me. I teased him: 'What did you really do here? You just took the face off and colored the gears?' But those are his characteristic colors and sense of transparency.'' 
 He first worked with Mr. Piano over a decade ago in a failed attempt to build a new museum at Harvard, where Mr. Cuno headed the university's museums. ''I had the support of the president, but did not get the support of the corporation of Harvard -- the trustees,'' he said. Mr. Cuno later introduced Mr. Piano to Mr. Wood, who hired him for the Chicago expansion.
 Now, in one of those satisfying full-circle moments, Mr. Cuno is overseeing the completion of Mr. Piano's design for the Art Institute's new Modern Wing. When it opens in May 2009, this three-story building will house galleries for modern and contemporary art, architecture and design. At 264,000 square feet, it is over three times the size of Mr. Piano's new Broad Contemporary Art Museum in Los Angeles.
 The Chicago project carries a price tag of $370 million, including an endowment to keep up the new space. When Mr. Cuno arrived, just $125 million had been pledged or received. He has since raised over $200 million, including $50 million from an anonymous family that declined naming rights for the wing. 
 He chalked up his success in part to the ''instant and palpable'' excitement generated by Millennium Park next door, with its popular sculptures by Anish Kapoor and Jaume Plensa and a band shell by Frank Gehry. A footbridge will connect the Modern Wing to the park. 
 He credited Mr. Wood for making his job easier: ''There are always challenges to running a museum, but it's not like I had to overhaul the place because it was broken.'' (One cloud on Mr. Wood's watch, the loss of $39 million of the museum's endowment by the hedge fund Integral Investment Management, inspired a lawsuit by the museum that is still making its way through the courts.)
 Mr. Cuno talks in terms of renovation, not innovation, and that is his goal for the museum's main 1893 Beaux-Arts building. He said that by the end of this year 60 percent of its galleries will have been renovated and reinstalled to make for ''greater clarity and coherence of presentation.'' Still, Gustave Caillebotte's ''Paris Street; Rainy Day'' from 1877 will retain pride of place at the top of the grand staircase.
 He has also just completed a rebranding project with the Pentagram design firm. ''We realized this is a moment of renewal for the museum, and we wanted to communicate that graphically,'' said Mr. Cuno, noting that the museum's name has received 20 graphic treatments in a decade.
 He pulled out a magnet with the Art Institute's new logo, pointing out ''the Frank Lloyd Wright red'' of the background and the ''clear and crisp look'' of the Topaz font. ''The font has this contemporary edge but at the same time recalls Wiener Werkstatte or Secessionist architecture,'' he said. It also harks back to antiquity in at least one very visible way: the letter U in ''Institute'' appears like a V in classic Roman fashion, as it does on the museum's original Michigan Avenue facade.
 Abbott Miller, a partner at Pentagram, was impressed by Mr. Cuno's commitment to that angular U, which elsewhere ''could have been focus-grouped to death and disappeared,'' he said. ''I have worked with directors of a number of large art museums, and I think everyone has a stake in rebranding. But with Jim I would say there were more meetings, more attention to detail, more investment -- though I never thought it was excessive.'' 
 Mr. Cuno said the choice of font was no small matter. ''I think all of these things are terribly important because they represent the institution -- everything from the museum shop to our Web presence to our graphic identity to our publications to our exhibitions to how our guards greet you when you arrive.''
 But an expansion that created opportunity has also brought controversy. This summer the museum is lending some 92 Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces once scheduled for temporary storage to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth in a deal involving payment by the Texas museum. Most museums loans are free or quid pro quo. 
 ''It was said by some that we rented the pictures,'' Mr. Cuno said. ''That's just not what we do. The Kimbell is covering costs associated with mounting the exhibition, with producing the catalog and with reframing the pictures.'' He declined to disclose the total amount the Kimbell had paid, except to say that published estimates of $2 million were inaccurate.
 If the critics are vocal, so are his supporters. James Rondeau, curator of contemporary art at the Chicago museum, for one, praised Mr. Cuno's energy and his traditional -- ''I don't want to say old-school''-- leadership style. ''He has a terrific dual focus on institutional growth as well as on the important core values of the museum -- the collection, exhibitions, and scholarship.''
 While his own background as an academic is in 19th-century French printmaking, Mr. Cuno has become best known for his writing and speaking about the role of art museums today. At Harvard he started a program for art museum directors that led to ''Whose Muse?,'' a book of essays that he edited about museums and ''the public trust.'' The overriding theme is that museums should take themselves seriously and not become theme parks. 
 This sense of a museum's civic duties also shapes his new book. The title, ''Who Owns Antiquity?'' is disingenuous, as the book's answer is clearly nobody, or everybody. In a polarized debate that has pitted archaeologists against collectors, he takes the increasingly unpopular pro-trade side but seeks to give it an ethical framework. 
 Mr. Cuno contends that ''the accident of geography'' should not give nations exclusive claims on archaeological material that happens to be found within their borders. He asserts that a country's cultural patrimony policies reflect its political or diplomatic agenda more than a commitment to preserving culture. And he argues for the revival of partage, a practice in which museums or universities aid the excavation of an archaeological site in another country in exchange for some of the artifacts.
 ''People will assume my argument in favor of partage is a thinly disguised argument for imperialism,'' he said. ''But partage helped to create not just the university museums and encyclopedic museums in this country, but also museums locally on site -- like the national museums of Afghanistan and Iraq.''
 An Air Force brat who attended high school near San Francisco but moved around a lot, Mr. Cuno drew on a wide range of sources for the book, including Thomas L. Friedman, the columnist for The New York Times; the Indian economist Amartya Sen; and the Palestinian-American cultural critic Edward Said. 
 He also champions the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah's theory of ''cosmopolitanism'' -- a kind of moral worldliness -- as an alternative to nationalist ideology.
 In his preface Mr. Cuno thanked Mr. Appiah for their conversations over the years. He also thanked Mr. de Montebello, who read -- and apparently also copy edited -- the first full draft. ''I'm a terrible proofreader, so he corrected some spellings,'' Mr. Cuno said. 
 As for Mr. de Montebello's job, Mr. Cuno said nobody had contacted him about it. And if the Met were to call? 
 ''It would be impossible not to have a conversation because of the importance of the museum and its role in the profession,'' he said. (In an e-mail message later that day, he put it somewhat differently: ''I have not spoken with anyone at the Met nor do I intend to.'')
 He glanced around his office at the Art Institute. ''To put it simply, this place is a fit,'' he said. ''I believe I have a personality that is Midwestern.''

David E. Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent for The Times, is writing a book that examines the national security challenges facing the next American president.

 BODY:
THE RETURN OF HISTORY AND THE END OF DREAMS
 By Robert Kagan. 
 116 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95. 
 When Bill Clinton was in the twilight months of his presidency, he made a compelling case that by integrating China into the world economy we would gradually undercut the viability of its authoritarian government. It was only a matter of time, he told an audience of American and Chinese students in March 2000, before a Net-savvy, rising middle class would begin to demand its rights, because ''when individuals have the power not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.'' 
 Five years later, in his second Inaugural Address, George W. Bush added a more martial edge to the prediction that democracy was on an unstoppable tear around the world. It was only 22 months after the invasion of Iraq. Describing a grander justification for his mission, Bush declared that in a post-Iraq world it would become the mission of the United States to defeat tyranny and spread his ''freedom agenda'' around the world. Sovereign borders of authoritarian states, he made clear, would be no barrier. 
 Robert Kagan, in a brief and wonderfully argued volume on how the world has a nasty habit of spinning off in its own directions, has a message for Americans of all political stripes: Good luck with that one. The cold war may be over, he declares in ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams,'' but anyone who thinks the result was really ''the end of history'' -- a consensus that liberal democracy is the future -- should take another look. ''The world has become normal again,'' Kagan says in the first sentence of what is less a book than an extended essay. Deeper in, he puts his argument more plainly: ''Autocracy is making a comeback.'' 
 Kagan's arguments have particular relevance these days because he is one of the few foreign policy intellectuals that Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, seems to respect. When McCain talks about assembling a ''league of democracies'' to get things done, that's Kagan-talk for how to deal with a world where the United Nations Security Council is ''hopelessly paralyzed'' and NATO is happiest parachuting into territory where there is little chance of hearing gunfire. (He treads lightly on NATO's timidity in Afghanistan but has an understandable excuse: He lives in Brussels because his wife, Victoria Nuland, a former aide to Vice President Cheney, is the American ambassador to NATO.) A scholar and regular contributor to The Washington Post's op-ed page, Kagan is the rare happy neocon these days, because he steered clear of direct participation in the Bush administration's more disastrous adventures and can now offer advice to the incoming cleanup crews.
 Kagan's title, of course, is designed to tweak Francis Fukuyama and others who, in a fit of optimism after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, declared not only the end to ideological struggle but ''the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.'' That belief was an underpinning of the Bush doctrine. As the White House correspondent for The New York Times for the first six years of the Bush presidency, I would be a rich man if I had collected a Russian ruble, a Chinese yuan and an Iranian rial every time I sat through a speech in which Bush brought the faithful to their feet promising a prolonged struggle to confront every regime that represses God-given rights to freedom. 
 Kagan barely mentions Bush -- his wife's boss, after all -- as he brutally dissects the argument that freedom is still on an unstoppable march. ''Growing national wealth and autocracy have proven compatible, after all,'' Kagan notes. ''Autocrats learn and adjust. The autocracies of Russia and China have figured out how to permit open economic activity while suppressing political activity. They have seen that people making money will keep their noses out of politics, especially if they know their noses will be cut off.''
 In the world according to Kagan, 20 years after the cold war's end there is a new divide -- just one that isn't as neat as the one defined by the Iron Curtain. European democracies and Asian democracies have joined a floating, usually pro-American coalition, tempered by their economic interests. Increasingly, they are facing off against authoritarian regimes in Russia and China that maintain ties with Iran, bail out North Korea and cozy up to dictatorships in Africa, which are happy to sell oil to countries that won't make them sit through tiresome lectures about human rights. (Of course, we cozy up to Saudi Arabia, and Bush has been pretty disciplined about hitting the mute button on his lectures about liberty when the Al-Saud family is in the room.)
 On the other side, the Warsaw Pact may be gone, but a more subtle, less militarily driven grouping is rising in its place: the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The Russians celebrate it as an anti-NATO alliance; the Chinese see it as another vehicle, along with the cash generated by a huge trade surplus, for spreading their influence in Asia and drawing in the autocracies of central Asia. (Iran just applied for membership.) Yet it is barely on the American radar screen.
 For Kagan, such groups are a small collection of malignant cells, slowly turning into a new form of life. ''It may not come to war,'' he writes, ''but the global competition between democratic and autocratic governments will become a dominant feature of the 21st-century world.'' 
 He may be right, but what's missing from this otherwise striking thesis is much discussion of what to do about the countries that walk both sides of the line. Pakistan is now the classic example: designated a ''major non-NATO ally'' by the Bush administration, it seems to take that alliance seriously on Tuesdays and Thursdays, while it flirts with the Taliban on nights and weekends. 
 And what of India, the world's largest democracy? It has embraced the Burmese junta and does energy deals with the Iranians. Much as during the cold war, the return of history has brought with it a return of unaligned, partially aligned and reluctantly aligned nations. 
 Kagan's prescription for the future is that league of democracies McCain calls for, an intellectual improvement over the short-lived ''coalition of the willing'' of the Bush years. To make the league harmonious, the next American president will have to deal with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, the discordant notes that have made it so easy for America's opponents to mock the ''freedom agenda.'' 
 But that's the easy part. Far harder is grappling with the American impulse -- seen in Bosnia during the Clinton years and Iraq in the Bush years -- to assert the right of the ''international community'' to reach deep inside national borders and oust leaders who repress their own people. No American president will want to give up that option. And the world's autocrats, including those in Moscow and Beijing, will remain deeply suspicious, as Kagan notes, that ''the democracies, whatever they say, would welcome their overthrow.''

 BODY:
THE ASSAULT ON REASON, by Al Gore. (Penguin, $16.) The former vice president pulls out all the stops in this ''blistering assessment of the Bush administration and the state of public discourse in America,'' as Michiko Kakutani described it in The Times. Gore argues that ''reason, logic and truth seem to play a sharply diminished role in the way America now makes important decisions''; one example is the administration's tendency to ignore expert advice (from generals and scientists) so it can promote its ideological agenda. 
 A TRANQUIL STAR: Unpublished Stories, by Primo Levi. Translated by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli. (Norton, $13.95.) Levi, who died, perhaps by suicide, in 1987, is best known for his powerful memoirs, beginning with ''Survival in Auschwitz'' (1947), but he also wrote poetry and fiction. This collection of previously untranslated stories reveals his mastery of a sort of science fiction with a dark undertow. 
 THE FLANEUR: A Stroll Through the Paradoxes of Paris, by Edmund White. (Bloomsbury, $12.99.) ''Flanerie is the best way to impose a personal vision on the palimpsest of Paris,'' White writes of his strolls around the city where he lived for 16 years. Moving between past and present, White shows us what most interests him -- Arab Paris, homosexual Paris, offbeat museums. Reading the book feels like falling ''into the hands of a highly distractible, somewhat eccentric poet and professor who is determined to show you a Paris you wouldn't otherwise see,'' our reviewer, Angeline Goreau, said. 
 WHEN THE LIGHT GOES, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon & Schuster, $14.) Despite its lugubrious title, there's not much reflection on middle age or mortality in this cheerfully smutty little book. Duane Moore of Thalia, Tex., the focus of the trilogy that began with ''The Last Picture Show,'' is now a mostly retired widower of 64. He meets a 26-year-old woman who specializes in finding oil in old wells (nudge, nudge), and she does. 
 WEST FROM APPOMATTOX: The Reconstruction of America After the Civil War, by Heather Cox Richardson. (Yale University, $20.) ''The story of Reconstruction is not simply about the rebuilding of the South after the Civil War,'' writes Richardson, who teaches history at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Instead, she focuses on the importance of the West, whose romantic image made it possible for middle-class Americans in the 19th century to view themselves as rugged individualists even as they ''harnessed a newly active national government to their own interests.'' 
 DEPTHS, by Henning Mankell. Translated by Laurie Thompson. (Vintage, $14.95.) The protagonist of Mankell's nightmarish novel is not his familiar detective Kurt Wallander, but a Swedish naval engineer who is covertly sounding the channels of the approach to Stockholm at the beginning of World War I. The need to conceal an affair with a woman who lives alone on an island leads him into a web of lies and to murder, raising questions of political morality. 
 LAND OF LINCOLN: Adventures in Abe's America, by Andrew Ferguson. (Grove, $14.) Ferguson, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, conducts a tour of Lincoln shrines, statues, cabins and museums, ending with the Lincoln Memorial. He describes his travels ''expertly, with an understated Midwestern sense of humor,'' William Grimes wrote in The Times, and he sheds serious light on Lincoln's place in our culture along the way. 
 STRAWBERRY FIELDS, by Marina Lewycka. (Penguin, $14.) Lewycka's second novel (after ''A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian'') concerns the sometimes comic misadventures of migrant workers from Ukraine and Poland who have come to England to harvest berries. Her heroine is a professor's daughter from Kiev who hopes to write the Great Ukrainian Novel. 
 THE SUSHI ECONOMY: Globalization and the Making of a Modern Delicacy, by Sasha Issenberg. (Gotham, $15.) ''In few places are the complex dynamics of globalization revealed as visibly as in the tuna's journey from the sea to the sushi bar,'' Issenberg writes. In opposition to the Slow Food movement, he sees the infrastructure that puts toro on your plate as an example of good globalization. 
 TO MY DEAREST FRIENDS, by Patricia Volk. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) Two 60-ish Upper East Side women are brought together by a mutual friend who leaves them both a safe-deposit box containing a steamy letter from an anonymous lover in this ''cozy, kick-off-your-shoes-and-curl-up novel,'' as our reviewer, Ann Hodgman, described it. 
 THE DARK STREETS, by John Shannon. (Pegasus, $13.95.) A hard-boiled Los Angeles detective searching for a Korean film student who disappeared while filming a documentary about World War II ''comfort women'' finds himself present at a standoff between a paramilitary Asian-American group and the feds in this dark mystery.

THE AGE OF REAGAN 
 A History, 1974-2008. 
 By Sean Wilentz. 
 Illustrated. 564 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.95. 
 Strange to think that Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at Princeton University, would embrace Ronald Reagan as the historic alpha dog of postmodern American politics. For starters, Wilentz was trained as a Jacksonian-era scholar; the 20th and 21st centuries aren't his bailiwicks. Then, back in 1998, Wilentz testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the impeachment of Bill Clinton was an abomination. He also endorsed Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008. Considered by some the heir apparent to Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Wilentz is perceived more as an erudite spokesman for the Democratic Party than as a judicious analyst of the Republican agenda. Yet in ''The Age of Reagan'' -- a smart and accessible overview of the long shadow cast by our 40th president -- Wilentz largely abandons partisanship in favor of professionalism. Thus, the supposedly inflexible Reagan emerges here as the pragmatic statesman who greatly reduced the world's nuclear stockpiles. 
 Undoubtedly, Reaganholics will carp that Wilentz has a selective memory (giving more ink to Iran-contra than Reagan's diplomacy with Margaret Thatcher), and progressives will denounce him for drinking Gipper-flavored Kool-Aid (equating Reagan with Franklin D. Roosevelt). But, in truth, the main thrust of Wilentz's thesis is fair-minded, with a slight center-left tilt. It's hard to dispute his notion that the current Great Society rollback is straight from the Reagan playbook: tax breaks for corporations, a ''unitary executive'' theory of presidential power, welfare-state slashing, a federal judiciary bent rightward, and even the promotion of ''intelligent design'' over Darwinism in some schools. But instead of belittling Reagan, Wilentz -- who paints a picture of a desultory Democratic Party in the 1970s and '80s -- offers grudging admiration for his political adroitness. ''In his political persona, as well as his policies, Reagan embodied a new fusion of deeply conservative politics with some of the rhetoric and even a bit of the spirit of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and of John F. Kennedy's New Frontier,'' he writes. ''This is not to say that Reagan alone caused the long wave of conservative domination -- far from it. But in American political history there have been a few leading figures, most of them presidents, who for better or worse have put their political stamp indelibly on their time. They include Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt -- and Ronald Reagan.'' 
 Much like James T. Patterson's fine ''Restless Giant: The United States From Watergate to Bush v. Gore,'' Wilentz's book begins with Richard Nixon's collapse in 1974. Amid the felonies of Watergate, Nixon had nevertheless promoted civil rights, wilderness preservation, detente and other ''feel good'' Democratic ideals. Rebuking both Brooks Brothers elites like Nelson Rockefeller and cowboy libertarians like Barry Goldwater, he represented the heart and soul of the Republican establishment circa 1972. His resignation -- which Wilentz says ended America's ''gravest constitutional and political crisis since the Civil War and Reconstruction'' -- left a gaping void in the political landscape. The Democratic Party couldn't find permanent entry, so in walked Ronald Reagan on cue from stage right.
 Using John Updike's satirical novel ''Memories of the Ford Administration'' as his starting point, Wilentz breezes through Gerald Ford's 896 days in office, regarding them as essentially failed and even insinuating that his pardon of Nixon -- nowadays widely seen as a healing accomplishment -- was a mistake. The net effect of Ford's White House tenure was ''to push many ex-Democrats as well as longtime conventional Republicans into the political camp of the pro-Reagan right.'' By 1976, when Reagan tried to wrest the nomination from Ford, this actor turned politician had mobilized varied constituencies, including blue-collar whites, evangelical Christians, ''Southern strategy'' bigots, law-and-order suburbanites and anti-Communist hawks. In foreign affairs, Reagan's New Right coalition wanted to maintain ownership of the Panama Canal, abandon arms limitation talks, keep American troops in Southeast Asia and flush the very concept of detente into the Neville Chamberlain appeasement toilet. On the domestic front, this coalition held an almost mystical belief in supply-side economics. Reagan may have lost out to Ford, Wilentz argues, but he had cobbled together a powerful army of foot soldiers.
 Even though Jimmy Carter won the 1976 election, the real winner in the history sweepstakes was Reagan. Somewhat surprisingly, Wilentz rejects Carter revisionism that celebrates ''Jimmy Who?'' as a human rights warrior of the first order. The witch's brew of problems that beset the Carter administration -- double-digit inflation, long gas lines and the Iran hostage crisis -- sticks in Wilentz's craw. He even criticizes Carter for bellicosity toward the Soviet Union (including the boycott of the Moscow Olympics) that amounted to empty saber rattling. The result of Carter's faux-populist style, he argues, was to alienate liberal Democrats and left-wing activists alike. ''Reagan had the excellent fortune to emerge as a presidential contender just as Democratic liberalism fell into intellectual confusion and political decay,'' Wilentz writes. ''The electorate, despite misgivings, was prepared to give antigovernment conservatism a chance. More important, Reagan had the optimistic temperament and rhetorical skills to turn right-wing Republicanism into Reaganism.'' 
 Assiduously avoiding stereotypical put-downs about Reagan's intellect, Wilentz understands that a deep-seated fear of Armageddon wisely guided many presidential decisions during the 1980s. The mistake many pundits and scholars have made, he asserts, is tattooing a convenient label on Reagan's forehead, like ''conservative,'' ''hawkish'' or ''pro-business.'' One understands the man better, Wilentz says, by exploring the power of optimism and nostalgia. Drawing on psychological assessments of Reagan by Lou Cannon, Garry Wills and Edmund Morris, he concludes that Reaganism was never a party or a faction or a movement -- it was the persona of an old-fashioned Midwesterner enveloped in the mythic tenets of Main Streetism.
 What makes ''The Age of Reagan'' so appealing is Wilentz's skill at juggling the back pages of American history and the au courant. For example, he authoritatively invokes Alexander Hamilton and the Internet in the same sentence without overreaching. With the exception of gratuitously shoehorning in Bob Dylan lyrics (even titling one chapter ''New Morning''), he makes very few false steps. The reader can, however, discern a tone of glee that George Will, National Review and Commentary all misread Mikhail Gorbachev's negotiating motives in their 1980s editorials. While Clinton fares significantly better than the other presidents who served between 1974 and 2008, Wilentz says some people thought his ''New Democrat'' sloganeering and triangulating were essentially shell games -- Reaganism in drag. One does get the distinct impression that while Wilentz was charmed by Reagan's humor and Clinton's wonkishness, these affections don't transfer to George W. Bush, who is largely written off as a failed president practicing ''a radicalized form of Reaganism.'' 
 The self-effacing Wilentz makes no claim that ''The Age of Reagan'' is a definitive political history of our times. He admits to conducting no interviews, and relies on secondary sources and already released primary documents. But, he insists, sufficient time has passed for scholars to start taking Reagan's legacy seriously, to stop pretending the historic juggernaut doesn't exist. Even in the 2008 campaign, there has been no escaping Reagan's enduring appeal. Wilentz ends his narrative with John McCain -- a self-proclaimed Reagan Revolutionary -- procuring the Republican nomination. If he wins, the Reagan zeitgeist will continue. But whatever the outcome, Reagan's epoch-making accomplishments are secure. ''Indeed,'' Wilentz writes, ''one of the most satisfying if humbling aspects of writing history is to find one's prejudices and expectations challenged by the historical record and sometimes undone, as has happened to me repeatedly in writing every chapter of this book.''

HEADLINE: Other Options Beyond Congress for Inquiry of Patriots

 BODY:
Below are excerpts of e-mail messages to The Times and comments on The Fifth Down blog regarding last week's news developments about the New England Patriots, who videotaped opponents' signals; the N.F.L.'s investigation into the matter; Matt Walsh, who spent three seasons with the team's videotaping operation; and a call for an independent inquiry from Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania.
 What with the baseball steroid mess, the gambling N.B.A. referee and the Patriots' cheating scandal that appears to have gone on much longer than initially disclosed, one wonders if there are enough asterisks to go around. The records of the Patriots' team and the individual achievements of its players are now in doubt. Are there any honest sports left? David McAuley 
 McLean, Va.
 Seldom does a day go by that there isn't fresh evidence as to why approval ratings of Congress are so low.
 It is appalling that the Senate has so much time on its hands that it is devoting significant resources to further investigations of the New England Patriots' eavesdropping on other N.F.L. teams' signals.
 In the cosmic scheme of things, this problem has to rank near the bottom of valid concerns.
 William Stephenson 
 Princeton, N.J. 
 If Senator Arlen Spector is interested in honesty and integrity, there are far more important areas to be addressed than a football team that has already been punished. 
 Boyd L. Sprehn
 Charlotte Amalie, V.I.
 Given the economic, political, military, health and education problems that our country is facing, it boggles the mind that Arlen Specter thinks that the most important way to spend his time in the Senate is to deal with the looming problem that ''if the public loses confidence in professional football, it will be like wrestling.''
 It's a pity that he didn't concern himself earlier with the public loss of confidence in the Senate. Perhaps if he and his colleagues started working on some of the real problems of the country, they wouldn't feel the need to fluff out their schedules with time-wasting investigations of professional entertainers.
 Michael Sugerman
 Pelham, Mass.
 When athletes are making $39 million and up for ''banging heads,'' of course the teams are going to do everything they can to win.
 Posted by Nick
 Senator Arlen Specter is supposed to be working on the economy (which seems to be fine in the N.F.L.); health care for the disenfranchised (which members of the N.F.L. are not); our military situation in Iraq and Afghanistan (maybe he should have been more involved with the Pat Tillman investigation -- at least there is some relevance); working to make sure our businesses have opportunities and that our infrastructures are being maintained (N.F.L. -- no problem on either count). New stadiums are going up all over. Our bridges are falling down, however. Posted by Millie Bea
 No illegal conduct (like steroid use) is at stake here, and it is obvious that no one outside a few media folks has an interest in a prolonged fishing expedition into various forms of internal N.F.L. misconduct. The Patriots used tape to do what others do with binoculars and notepads, because these signals have long been in full view. Since all teams know that smart ones change their signals frequently.
 The Times, along with the Boston Herald, has already shamed itself in this matter, and would be well advised to stand down from the soapbox at this point. 
 Posted by Theda Skocpol
 Let's not underestimate the illegitimacy of Bill Belichick's techniques, his use of cover stories, his unwillingness, along with that of the Patriot front office and Commissioner Roger Goodell, to admit wrongdoing -- all to preserve the image of the N.F.L. Sound familiar? Just copying the standard set by the Bush administration the last seven years.
 Posted by Myke Merlow
 Please spare me the hysterics about all the other priorities Senator Arlen Specter should be working on. This story broke nine months ago. In that time we know that Specter sent a letter to Roger Goodell, sent a follow-up letter, spoke with Goodell and conducted a brief meeting with a person with knowledge of the situation.
 That doesn't seem like an unreasonable amount of time to spend on one of the many issues he deals with. He's the ranking member of the committee with oversight of the N.F.L.'s antitrust exemption. If the league conducted a sham investigation into cheating -- and the evidence suggests that's at least possible -- then it's totally appropriate for him to inquire into the matter. 
 Posted by Mikey
 If the N.F.L. would come clean about the Patriots' Spygate episode, then Senator Specter wouldn't even have to get involved with this mess. Commissioner Goodell is too consumed with creating a cover-up as opposed to the truth. Coach Belichick is too worried about being a winner, but no matter how many games he wins now, he will always be remembered as a cheater. Posted by Karen
 I can understand media outlets such as ESPN and HBO Sports taking Matt Walsh seriously. But I would have thought that The New York Times would have treaded a little bit lighter with this guy -- someone fired by the people he is now trying to smudge, someone in possession of stolen property, someone who has never had any sort of career, someone who did something he knew was so wrong, someone who waited over five years to come out of the shadows -- instead of acting like everything he has said is a stone cold fact. Posted by Joseph C.
 So who says cheaters never win?

HEADLINE: State Development Agency Buffeted by Slowing Economy and Internal Rifts

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For more than a year, the state's main economic development agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, has been in disarray, plagued by turf battles, poor management and the political collapse of Gov. Eliot Spitzer, business leaders and state officials say.
 Its three top officials had virtually stopped talking, officials say. There were disputes over upstate versus downstate developments. And the agency was blamed for the collapse of two of the largest projects in the city: the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the renovation of the Pennsylvania Station area. 
 Now with the economy slowing, credit markets tightening and tax revenues shrinking, the agency must make some hard decisions about its priorities. But at this important juncture, it remains rudderless.
 A co-chairman of the development corporation, Patrick J. Foye, was one of the first officials to lose his job when Gov. David A. Paterson took over in March. Mr. Paterson has yet to nominate someone to run the agency. 
 Moreover, the governor has sent conflicting messages, preaching fiscal austerity while suggesting that the state can move forward on a host of costly projects, including the Second Avenue subway, the extension of the No. 7 line, the $14 billion redevelopment of the West Side railyards, the $14 billion Penn Station project and the $4 billion Atlantic Yards basketball arena and residential complex in Brooklyn.
 A senior adviser to Mr. Paterson rejected the idea that the administration had sent mixed messages, saying the governor would not commit to projects that the state cannot afford. The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, also said the administration planned to release plans for revamping the agency. As part of that overhaul, Mr. Paterson will eliminate one of Mr. Spitzer's more contentious innovations: dividing the corporation's leadership into downstate and upstate leaders.
 ''There is a strong recognition on the part of the governor that this system has not worked, one hand did not always know what the other hand was doing,'' the administration official said. ''Right now, we're engaged in making sure there's leadership that serves the entire state. At the same time, there's an intense understanding that upstate needs an empowered leadership in a new structure.''
 The governor and a blue-ribbon panel he appointed have also been interviewing candidates, business and real estate executives said. The candidates include Alan H. Fishman, the former chief executive of Independence Community Bank; John Kanas, the former chief executive of North Fork Bank; Mark A. Willis, an executive vice president at JPMorgan Chase; and Sharon L. Greenberger, president of the School Construction Authority. A nomination is expected by early June.
 There is a growing consensus that whoever takes over will have to confront a difficult set of problems, including an economy tipping into recession, job losses on Wall Street, a lack of private financing because of the credit crisis, and sharply declining tax revenues. 
 Instead of unveiling sweeping, transformative projects, executives and economists say the governor and the state's top economic development official will have to make decisions about the ones that have been announced: which will survive and which will have to wait, possibly forever.
 ''Tax revenues are plummeting, and the state doesn't expect a recovery until the first quarter of 2009, and that may be optimistic,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. 
 ''And the capital budgets for economic development, transportation and other infrastructure projects favored by the state and the city are grossly under-funded,'' she continued. ''Yet the state's ability to invest in important capital projects and carry additional debt service is virtually nonexistent.''
 This gloomy picture is a far cry from the days when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki were issuing seemingly daily news releases on rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, developing the city's newest business district on the West Side and expanding the city's convention center, and creating a rail link from downtown to Long Island, as well as erecting a couple of stadiums and arenas.
 ''They were piling up projects as if there were no bounds to what New York could do,'' said James A. Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group. ''Under the best of circumstances, not all of them would have happened. But then the chickens came home to roost with the bursting of the real estate and housing bubble.''
 A slowing economy, the credit crisis and the escalating cost of construction have already taken a toll. In February, Mr. Spitzer abandoned the long-awaited $1.8 billion expansion of the Javits Center. Plans to demolish Madison Square Garden and build a half-dozen skyscrapers around a new Penn Station collapsed a month later. And Tishman Speyer Properties, one of the city's biggest developers, pulled out of a project to build 13 million square feet of office towers, apartment buildings and parks over the West Side railyards only six weeks after it was selected. 
 The state's new economic development chief will have to contend with trying to revive those projects, as well as with the political friction between the governor and the mayor. Last week, Senator Charles E. Schumer called on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to take over the state's project at Penn Station because it had the financing and the expertise to do it. Mayor Bloomberg blasted the notion, saying it was a ''terrible idea.'' But Governor Paterson has endorsed it.
 Then there is the upstate-downstate schism. Traditionally, the development corporation has focused on the state's economic engine, New York City, and given less attention to the upstate economy, which has suffered from a decline in manufacturing jobs and population.
 To address the problem, Mr. Spitzer appointed dual chairmen for the corporation, Mr. Foye for downstate projects and Daniel Gunderson, who was based in Buffalo, for upstate projects. Local economic development officials liked Mr. Gunderson's approach, but the structure proved unwieldy. 
 The development corporation was hobbled by disputes between Mr. Foye, Mr. Gunderson and the corporation's president, Avi Schick, who oversees work at the World Trade Center site. Mr. Schick was named acting chief executive after Mr. Foye resigned. 
 Governor Paterson said this month that he favored a return to a single chairman because the bifurcated approach ''wasn't working.'' With tax revenues falling sharply, Mr. Paterson also cut an upstate revitalization fund to $700 million from $1 billion. 
 Business executives said that the governor had planned on naming the chairman as soon as this week, until he met on Monday in Buffalo with local economic development officials and business leaders who feared that the upstate region would be ignored.
 They have written letters in support of Mr. Gunderson and criticized the composition of Mr. Paterson's advisory panel, high-powered executives who, they say, have no understanding of the upstate economy or employers. 
 ''We don't care what you call the person responsible for upstate,'' said Andrew J. Rudnick, president of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, which represents employers. ''But that person needs the authority to hire and fire personnel, allocate resources and make deals. Anything less than that is not only window dressing, but it adds a layer of nondecision-making authority.'' 
 The Paterson administration is also looking to appoint deputy-level officials to oversee New York City and the upstate region. Mr. Gunderson has interviewed to become the lone chairman, though he might also be considered for the upstate deputy.
 ''This is a critical time in the city's economic development,'' Senator Schumer said. ''The good news for New Yorkers is Governor Paterson takes the appointment to this position very seriously, as he knows how important new jobs and growth are both in the city and upstate.''

HEADLINE: Drilling for Defeat?

BYLINE: By DAVID SIROTA. 
David Sirota is the author of ''The Uprising: An Unauthorized Tour of the Populist Revolt Scaring Wall Street and Washington.''

 BODY:
Nearly two decades ago, Republicans won the West by linking Democrats to environmentalists, who supposedly cared more for the spotted owl and other favored species than they did for the jobs of loggers or miners. But now, as a boom in natural-gas drilling reshapes the region, Western Democrats have found success recasting environmentalism as a defense of threatened water supplies, fishing spots and hunting grounds. As a result, the party may hold the advantage this fall in the region's key Congressional races. The simultaneous rise of Western energy production and the Western Democrat is no coincidence. 
 The Rocky Mountain drilling boom has been aided by the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which was once considered a partisan political masterstroke. In providing incentives for energy development, Republicans delivered a profitable gift to an industry that directs most of its campaign contributions to G.O.P. candidates. That gift was sweetened by the Bureau of Land Management, which, under President Bush, has expanded the amount of federal land open to energy development and increased the number of drilling permits. 
 But the acceleration of energy exploration has split the national Republican Party from local Republicans upset by the downsides of the energy boom. ''Republicans created a monster for themselves,'' said Rick Ridder, a Colorado-based Democratic consultant. ''They put public policy in direct conflict with their base voters.''
 In Wyoming's Upper North Platte Valley, Jeb Steward, a Republican state representative, helped lead the successful 2007 opposition to the B.L.M.'s proposed sale of 13 oil and gas parcels. ''We have customs and cultures that have developed over a hundred years based on the utilization of multiple renewable resources -- agriculture, tourism, wildlife, fisheries,'' Steward said. ''When B.L.M. proposed issuing the leases, residents were asking, 'What does this mean to the lifestyles that we've all grown accustomed to?' ''
 One wing of the Bush administration appears to have heard the message. In February, the Environmental Protection Agency asked the Bureau of Land Management to revise its plan to allow nearly 4,400 new natural-gas wells on the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming, citing ozone pollution from drilling rigs. ''We have to balance economic success, energy development and the love that the people of Wyoming have for their special places,'' said Gary Trauner, the Democratic candidate hoping to replace Wyoming's retiring Republican congresswoman, Barbara Cubin.
 Energy is also likely to affect politics in two Western states where the offspring of conservation icons are running for Senate. In New Mexico, Representative Tom Udall, a Democrat and the son of Stewart Udall, secretary of the interior under Kennedy and Johnson, may face off against the Republican congresswoman Heather Wilson. Two years ago, Wilson belatedly backed Udall's bill to limit local drilling after being criticized on the issue by a 2006 election opponent. 
 In Colorado, Representative Mark Udall, Tom's cousin and the son of the late environmentalist congressman Morris (Mo) Udall, is running for the Senate against Bob Schaffer, a former Republican congressman who works for a natural-gas company. Colorado has experienced a sixfold increase in drilling permits since 1999, and the B.L.M. has leased a New Jersey-size 5.2 million acres of federal land for new energy exploration in the state. Already a conservative group has broadcast television ads attacking Udall for trying to limit drilling. But election trends suggest that such criticisms may be losing effectiveness.
 Of course, a recession -- and corresponding fears of job losses -- could halt the political shift. At a recent hearing convened by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, industry workers upbraided officials for considering rules that could slow gas drilling along the Colorado-New Mexico border. Century-old antigovernment emotions are now aimed at state regulators -- and much of the vitriol comes from working-class Democrats.
 But can they swing an election? According to Headwaters Economics, a Montana-based research group, the energy sector currently employs only 1.3 percent of the region's work force. And mining generated just 2.9 percent of all personal income in the five natural-gas-producing Western states in 2006. By contrast, retirement benefits, service jobs and professional industries generated about 55 percent of the region's income. Many of these sectors have an interest in reducing energy development. After all, retirees, professionals and tourism businesses often come to the region for the open spaces.
 ''Lots of drilling is great for the industry,'' said Headwaters Economics' associate director, Ben Alexander. ''But is it good for the region as a whole?'' The political battle for the West will be won by whichever party offers the most convincing answer.

HEADLINE: The Story of Obama, Written by Obama

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
Barack Obama was a first-time author and rookie politician embarking upon his first run for public office. Hermene Hartman was the publisher of N'Digo, a magazine in Chicago aimed at upscale black readers. As Ms. Hartman tells it, she got a call from Mr. Obama in the fall of 1995 saying he wanted to come and talk. He wanted her to read his newly published memoir.
 Ms. Hartman read the book, ''Dreams From My Father,'' but chose not to review it. Mr. Obama's life story struck her as too exotic for her readers -- the Kenyan father, the white mother, the childhood in Honolulu and Jakarta, Indonesia. But she felt she had gotten to know him from his writing; when he ran for the United States Senate eight years later, N'Digo became the first magazine to put Mr. Obama on its cover.
 ''Barack is a very focused, determined person,'' said Ms. Hartman, who now considers Mr. Obama a friend. ''Barack would go to people one by one and say, 'Here's my book, I want you to read it, give me feedback.' For me, as a publisher, he wanted me to write about it. He would call me every week and say, 'Did you read my book?' '' 
 Senator Obama understands as well as any politician the power of a well-told story. He has risen in politics less on his track record than on his telling of his life story -- a tale he has packaged into two hugely successful books that have helped make him a mega-best-selling, two-time Grammy-winning millionaire front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination at age 46. According to his publisher, there are more than three million copies of his books in print -- and two more books on the way.
 The story of Mr. Obama's life as an author tells as much about him as some of the stories he has recounted in his books. It possesses at times the same charmed quality sometimes ascribed to his political ascent -- an impression of ease, if not exactly effortlessness, that obscures a more complex amalgam of drive, ambition, timing and the ability to recognize an opportunity and to do what it takes to seize it.
 Just as he was eager to promote his first book to Ms. Hartman, he has made the most of his second. When his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention sent his memoir soaring out of obscurity and straight onto the best-seller list, he untethered himself from his longtime literary agent in favor of Robert B. Barnett, the Washington lawyer who had gotten Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton an $8 million book advance and then landed Mr. Obama a $1.9 million, three-book deal.
 He finished his second book, ''The Audacity of Hope,'' 18 months into his first term in the Senate, edited the proofs late at night on a Congressional fact-finding trip to Africa, plunged into campaigning for colleagues in the midterm elections, took time out for a 12-city book tour, appeared on programs like ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and ''Charlie Rose,'' then announced four months later that he was running for president.
 The books have defined Mr. Obama's public image in a way that few books by politicians have done. Reporters paw through them for insights into Mr. Obama the candidate, supplied by Mr. Obama the author. Out of his story, he has also drawn the central promise of his campaign: if a biracial son of a Kenyan and a Kansan could reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable in himself, a divided country could do the same.
 His memoir is, as one publisher put it, ''the single most vetted book in American politics right now.'' Written at a time when Mr. Obama says he was thinking less about a career in politics than about simply writing a good book, it leaves an impression of candidness and authenticity that gives it much of its power. Reporters have questioned Mr. Obama's use of fictional techniques like composite characters, but some editors and critics say that is common in memoirs.
 ''The book is so literary,'' said Arnold Rampersad, a professor of English at Stanford University who teaches autobiography and is the author of a recent biography of Ralph Ellison. ''It is so full of clever tricks -- inventions for literary effect -- that I was taken aback, even astonished. But make no mistake, these are simply the tricks that art trades in, and out of these tricks is supposed to come our realization of truth.''
 In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Obama said he would not be surprised if some people had gotten involved in his campaign ''because they feel they know me through my books.'' But he said he was not even thinking about political consequences when he wrote the memoir. In fact, he said, one editor warned him back then that his references to drug use could come back to haunt him -- if he were ever nominated for the Supreme Court.
 ''This is an example of what happens when you look at things backwards,'' Mr. Obama said when asked whether he had his political future in mind when he first began to write. ''Then everything looks like, 'Ah! Of course this was part of some well-calibrated consideration.' But frankly, no. It would have been very hard for me to anticipate that I'd be where I am today, where a book that I wrote almost 20 years ago now would even be read.''
 Early Exposure
 Mr. Obama's story first surfaced publicly in February 1990, when he was elected as the first black president of The Harvard Law Review. An initial wire service report described him simply as a 28-year-old, second-year student from Hawaii who had ''not ruled out a future in politics''; but in the days that followed, newspaper reporters grew interested and produced long, detailed profiles of Mr. Obama.
 The coverage prompted a call to him from Jane Dystel, a gravelly-voiced literary agent described by Peter Osnos, then the publisher of Times Books, as ''a good journeyman with a hard edge.'' The home page of her firm's Web site currently features clients' best sellers including ''Lies at the Altar: The Truth About Great Marriages.'' Ms. Dystel suggested Mr. Obama write a book proposal. Then she got him a contract with Poseidon Press, a now-defunct imprint of Simon & Schuster. When he missed his deadline, she got him another contract and a $40,000 advance from Times Books.
 Mr. Obama's original plan was to write a book about race relations. But, sitting down to write, he found his mind ''pulled toward rockier shores.'' So the book became more personal -- the record of an interior journey, as he put it in the introduction, ''a boy's search for his father, and through that a search for a workable meaning for his life as a black American.''
 Mr. Obama was given an office to write in at the University of Chicago through a surprising connection. Douglas G. Baird, a professor who was head of the law school's appointments committee, had learned of Mr. Obama from Michael W. McConnell, a conservative constitutional scholar then at Chicago whom President Bush would later make a federal judge.
 Professor McConnell encountered Mr. Obama during the editing of an article he wrote for The Harvard Law Review, Professor Baird said recently. ''He sent a note saying this person is really brilliant, we should have him on our radar screen,'' Professor Baird said. Professor Baird called Mr. Obama at Harvard and asked if he was interested in teaching.
 ''I don't remember his exact words, but it was something to the effect that, 'Well, in fact, I want to write this book.' What he really wanted was the Virginia Woolf equivalent of a clean, well lighted room.'' So Professor Baird got him one, a small office near the law library, along with a law school fellowship that Professor Baird hoped might later lead to his full-time teaching.
 By the time Mr. Obama landed at Times Books, he had a partial manuscript. He required minimal editing, said Henry Ferris, his editor, who is now a vice president and executive editor at William Morrow. He simply needed guidance in paring and shaping the sections already written and keeping the rest from becoming too long. The writing, Mr. Ferris said, ''is very much his own.''
 The two worked mostly by telephone and by manuscripts sent by Federal Express between New York and Chicago. Mr. Obama, an inveterate journal writer who had published poems in a college literary magazine but had never attempted a book, struggled to finish. His half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, said he eventually retreated to Bali for several months with his wife, Michelle, ''to find a peaceful sanctuary where there were no phones.'' He showed drafts to a few close relatives including his grandmother, of whom Ms. Soetoro-Ng said, ''It probably made her a little nervous, having the family written about, just because you don't do that in Kansas.''
 In the introduction, Mr. Obama acknowledged his use of pseudonyms, composite characters, approximated dialogue and events out of chronological order. He was writing at a time well before a recent series of publishing scandals involving fabrication in memoirs. ''He was trying to be careful of people's feelings,'' said Deborah Baker, the editor on the first paperback edition of the book. ''The fact is, it all had a sort of larger truth going on that you couldn't make up.''
 A Memoir Revived
 The book came out in the summer of 1995, shortly before Mr. Obama announced that he was running for the Illinois State Senate. At 57th Street Books, in Mr. Obama's neighborhood in Chicago, a few dozen people turned out for a reading. There were respectful reviews in newspapers including The New York Times and The Boston Globe. Times Books sold 8,000 to 9,000 copies.
 ''I joke that 290 million Americans did not buy the book,'' he said.
 Kodansha Globe, a now-defunct branch of a Japanese company, bought the paperback rights for $5,000 to $7,500 and printed about 6,000 copies in 1996, said Philip Turner, Kondansha's editor in chief at the time. The cover carried a blurb from Marian Wright Edelman: ''Perceptive and wise, this book will tell you something about yourself whether you are black or white.''
 ''Even now, it's hard to get my mind around the idea that this person is in politics,'' said Ms. Baker, who described Mr. Obama as a born writer. ''I actually think he could be a brilliant politician. He was ambitious as a writer in the same way -- very cunning in the way he structured the book. I remember thinking, 'This guy really knows how to tell a story.' '' 
 But within a few years, ''Dreams From My Father'' was out of print.
 Then in March 2004, Mr. Obama's political and literary fortunes abruptly shifted. His victory in a tightly contested United States Senate primary in Illinois made him an overnight Democratic Party sensation. In New York City, Rachel Klayman, an editor at Crown Books, read a Salon.com article on Mr. Obama by the author Scott Turow, an Obama friend, titled ''The New Face of the Democratic Party -- and America.''
 Ms. Klayman looked up Mr. Obama's memoir on Amazon.com and found that the rights were controlled by Crown, which now had the Times Books list. She sent an e-mail message to her boss, suggesting that Crown reissue the book. She contacted Ms. Dystel and asked Mr. Obama to write a new preface, which came in nearly word perfect. 
 Then Mr. Obama was chosen to give the keynote speech at the Democratic convention. 
 Crown moved up the publication date, Barnes & Noble increased its order to 20,000 copies, and the book hit the top 50 on Amazon before it was even reissued. Bidding on eBay for a first edition copy hit $255. By December, Mr. Obama was the senator-elect and his book had been on the best-seller list for 14 weeks. And Ms. Dystel had initiated discussions with Crown about a new book contract for Mr. Obama. 
 Two weeks before Mr. Obama's swearing in, Crown announced that it had signed a contract with him for three more books. The first would offer ''a window into the political and spiritual convictions that propelled Obama's recent U.S. Senate victory.'' The second will be a children's book about his life, and the third is yet to be defined. The deal had been initiated by Ms. Dystel, the announcement said, but ''negotiated and concluded by Robert B. Barnett of Williams & Connolly LLP.''
 What happened between Mr. Obama and Ms. Dystel is not clear. Ms. Dystel declined to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Obama said, ''It really had more to do with the fact that by the time 'The Audacity of Hope' was written, I was going to be in Washington and was obviously now very high profile.'' Mr. Osnos called Mr. Obama's decision to switch to Mr. Barnett, whose clients include former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, ''disloyal but not unusual.'' 
 Others said it was understandable. ''You're nobody in Washington without Barnett working for you,'' said a rival publisher, who asked not to be named. ''Bob knows how to deal with the politics of a book as well as the selling of the book, Senate ethics rules, the advance. Bob is a fixer.'' Unlike literary agents, who take a percentage of an author's earnings, Mr. Barnett bills by the hour.
 Mr. Obama completed ''The Audacity of Hope'' in the summer of 2006. This time, he distributed drafts to several dozen friends and Senate staff members, many of whom now advise his campaign. They included David Axelrod, his chief political strategist; Anthony Lake, who was a national security adviser for President Bill Clinton; Gene Sperling, a former economic adviser to Mr. Clinton; and Samantha Power, who recently stepped down as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama after calling his opponent, Mrs. Clinton, ''a monster.''
 ''He wrote very polished first drafts,'' said Cass R. Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor who read drafts of chapters on the Constitution and economic policy. ''He was very clear to me that these were drafts on which he hoped for comments. I wrote very detailed comments. And afterwards he accepted a small minority of my comments. I gave him some potential formulations for what he might write. He always put it in his own words. Not once did he use my words.''
 A Second Success
 The book's release in October 2006 must have been the envy of anyone who ever published a book or contemplated higher office. In Chicago, people started lining up outside 57th Street Books at 4:15 on the morning of Mr. Obama's book signing. For his Seattle signing, the Elliott Bay Book Company rented the 2,500-seat hall where the symphony performs, sold out the tickets in 90 minutes and reported a level of turnout that topped all previous records at the store for any author, including Mr. Clinton.
 Time magazine published an excerpt of the book and put Mr. Obama on the cover, with a line that said ''Why Barack Obama Could Be the Next President.'' An adoring photo essay inside shows him doing things like washing the breakfast dishes with his daughter. 
 ''Barack is worth millions now,'' Mr. Osnos said. ''It's almost all based on these two books, two books not based on a job of prodigious research or risking one's life as a reporter in Iraq. He has written about himself. Being able to take your own life story and turn it into this incredibly lucrative franchise, it's a stunning fact.''

HEADLINE: Trying to Sell Europeans On Connecticut Charm

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
 WITH summer just a month away, Connecticut tourism officials have a right to be nervous, as they face a shaky economy and soaring gas prices. Fortunately for them, when the legislature ended its session on May 7, it left the $4.3 million tourism marketing budget for the new fiscal year untouched, even though the state was $120 million in the red.
 ''In these economic times, we are very happy to have the budget that we have,'' said Karen Senich, executive director of the state Commission on Culture and Tourism. 
 What's at stake is one of Connecticut's major economic engines. Tourism provides an estimated $1.75 billion in annual tax revenues, supports 110,000 jobs (6.5 percent of the state's total) and accounts for the production of $8 billion in goods and services.
 State tourism officials have focused lately on attracting tourists from the New York metropolitan area. Now, they want to widen their focus to include tourists from Europe. ''You always have to be ready to revise and redirect marketing strategies in order to find the sweet spot where you can keep things growing,'' said Barbara Cieplak, the commission's marketing director.
 The current sweet spot is the weak dollar, a bonanza for European tourists because the euro continues to gain strength. Nearly 11 million Europeans, mostly from the United Kingdom and Germany, visited the United States in 2007 -- an increase of 12.6 percent from 2006 -- with tourists from Holland, France and Italy joining the shopping-mad crowd.
 They have time to spend, said Sue Norrington-Davies, managing director of Discover New England, the six-state marketing alliance. The typical European gets four to six weeks of paid vacation.
 Another factor drawing Europeans is the Open Skies treaty, which, since April, has permitted European carriers to make direct flights from any point in Europe to any point in the United States. 
 ''International tourism is the bright spot in our economy,'' said Jean Guinup, international marketing chief for Chelsea Premium Outlets, owner of 42 outlet sites, including Clinton Crossing, the shoreline shopping village with 70 stores including Calvin Klein, Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue and Coach. Foreign shoppers' numbers are increasing ''dramatically,'' she said.
 While tourists from Europe are more numerous, they are still a relatively untapped market, officials said, because many Europeans know little about the state.
 ''The problem with Connecticut is that if you ask the average British or French person, they don't know where it is. They don't even know how to spell it,'' said Richard Tenby of TourMappers, which sells tour packages to European tour operators.
 Wilfred Buss, Discover New England's representative in Germany, said German tours ''come through Connecticut mainly on their way to and from New York.''
 To fix the problem, Ms. Senich and her staff held seminars to teach the state's museums, historic and cultural venues, inns, wineries, casinos and other attractions how to market to Europe. They have also led European tour operators and travel writers on extensive tours from Mystic to Litchfield, with more planned for next fall.
 In April, the tourism commission hosted the annual Discover New England Tourism Summit in New Haven, attended by 385 industry representatives, including 32 tour operators from the United Kingdom, Germany, Holland, France and Japan. At the summit, 70 Connecticut tourist venues -- up from 23 last year -- had a chance to promote themselves and offer incentives to European tour operators to include them in their itineraries and brochures.
 Connecticut has marketing firms in Germany and the United Kingdom, and commission staff members will attend the nation's largest travel show, in Las Vegas in June, plus four other big shows in Europe. 
 Some local merchants believe the effort is paying off. At Clinton Crossing, Ms. Guinup said it was easy to spot the European tourists. ''They have more shopping bags than any other shoppers, and they're purchasing additional luggage to carry everything they've bought.''

HEADLINE: Park Slope: Where Is the Love?

BYLINE: By LYNN HARRIS

 BODY:
POOR Union Hall. First, there was the tempest in a sippy cup stirred up in Brooklyn last February by this bar-brunch-boccie spot's ban on children in strollers. And just last week, a subcommittee of the Park Slope community board -- swayed by an army of pitchfork-wielding locals -- dealt the joint a harsh, if symbolic blow: no liquor license renewal until you do something about the noise. Though the full board overruled the committee within days, the blogosphere's critics and conspiracy theorists had already drawn their conclusions: ''It's the revenge of the Stroller Moms.''
 But it's not just the moms; it's where they live. ''Park Slope isn't even part of Brooklyn anymore,'' wrote one commenter on Gothamist. ''It's seriously a lower rung of hell, filled with hateful English teachers.'' And on Eater.com, one posted comment said: ''Park Slope and its ilk are why NYC is becoming more and more pathetic by the day.''
 Yep: community fussbudgets, whiny parents, taverns crawling with toddlers, hip watering holes edging out old-man bars. It's everything New Yorkers love to hate about Park Slope. 
 Well, not everything. Check the comments on real estate blogs like Brownstoner and Curbed, or ask around. To its detractors, Park Slope is both haunt and hatchery of New York's smuggest limousine-liberal yuppies. 
 It is, if I may further summarize the bad publicity, overrated and hypocritical. Its glorious brownstone blocks and jaunty cafes are awash in carpetbagger entitlement, ruled by snarling ''Stroller Nazis.'' The neighborhood is a ground zero of all that is twee and lame. It is, God forbid, the suburbs. 
 ''Park Slope is a perfect storm of stereotypes that provoke derision,'' said Steven Johnson, a local writer and a father of three. ''Since Park Slope is the neighborhood most explicitly associated with urban parenting, it attracts the wrath of people who think parents have gone way overboard. I imagine there's some horror fantasy fusion: the well-off Park Sloper and co-op member who is obsessed with his kids. Oh, wait, I just described myself.''
 Perhaps you recall the much-publicized episode in which an innocent ''Found: Boy's hat'' message on the Park Slope Parents listserv sparked a brief debate about gender semiotics. (''What makes this a boy's hat?'')
 ''Every so often, we seem to fulfill people's worst expectations,'' said my friend and neighbor Lori Leibovich, whose contribution to SMITH magazine's six-word-memoir book was ''Husband. Kids. Park Slope. You know.'' Yes, we do.
 When I moved to the neighborhood in 1994, I promise you, Manhattanites did not think about Park Slope any longer than it took them to blow off a party invitation. But today, you mention Park Slope on a blog or even in conversation and, especially if the reference involves the word ''stroller,'' the haters lunge like sharks at chum.
 How did it come to this? Most of the above could be said of just about any other neighborhood in our tidied-up, child-rearing-friendly New York City. Doesn't the East Village have a Whole Foods? Hasn't the Upper West Side become Short Hills? 
 How did Slope Rage become a meme unto itself, even among people who won't take the F train below East Broadway? 
 We must take some hatred of Park Slope with a generous dash of salt (organic, artisanal, hand-harvested). Much anti-Slope invective is stirred up in comments on blogs, which are not known for universally trenchant insight (''Puke Slope!'') or for their warm embrace of, well, anything. 
 By the same token, when we talk about ''people who hate Park Slope,'' we are talking in large part about a certain stratum of the chattering, Twittering class. ''This whole thing sounds like white people being annoyed by and jealous of other white people, which I find kind of funny,'' said James Bernard, a union organizer and a member of the local Community Board 6. ''I live in the Slope. I love it. I talk about it as much as anyone else does. But I founded a charter school near Brownsville and I don't hear anyone talking about Park Slope over there.''
 To be sure, much has changed here. When I first arrived, my friends would say things like, ''Brooklyn? Do you need a passport?'' and ''So, do you think you'll move into Manhattan someday?'' (Actually, they called it New York.) Then, the Slope was the only place my roommates and I could afford a decent three-bedroom apartment. Then, Fifth Avenue was guys playing dominos and bodegas selling, as far as I could tell, only motor oil and sun-faded cans of Pringles. 
 Today, you don't need a passport so much as a windfall. The junky Fifth Avenue shop where I bought an already-dusty broom and a ream of paper towels on the day I moved in? Now, on the same spot, I can get cedar-planked salmon and quinoa pilaf. 
 Today, Park Slope is a brand, a concept. Fourth Avenue -- the Champs-Elysees of auto parts! -- is home to the vile Novo Park Slope condo-monstrosity and the ridiculous boutique Hotel Le Bleu, whose Web site reveals its high prices (up to $369), but not its location on a bleak slip between a taxi garage and a Staples. (What are the odds that its cocktail bar will serve as the gin joint of choice for the fabulous fictional Slopers in the drama about the neighborhood that is being developed, seriously, by Darren Star of ''Sex and the City''?)
 Many locals, and ex-locals, I talked to swore that something else has also changed. Phyllis Bobb, 42, lived here from 1990 to 2002, when she moved to Bed-Stuy because, she said, ''there were too many yuppies moving in.'' People on her block stopped sitting on stoops; a guy in the park kicked her dog. ''It wasn't a community anymore,'' she said, and she's still steamed. ''I feel like a jilted lover.'' 
 Then again, when I asked Paul Milkman, a teacher who has lived in Park Slope for 37 years, if he's experienced this new rudeness, he has no idea what I'm talking about. Same goes for my mother-in-law; she and my father-in-law live around the corner in the brownstone they bought for five figures in 1972. ''There are new layers to the neighborhood,'' she said. ''We feel economic differences, which are now dramatic, in ways we did not before, and they can be hurtful to some. But the sense of community and friendliness has not changed.''
 MY in-laws arrived in Park Slope, then largely working-class Irish, as part of the first wave of gentrification. ''Park Slope in the late '60s was the leading edge of urban revitalization,'' said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University Graduate Center. Founding block associations and planting trees, they were like urban kibbutzniks. 
 They were part of a ''postwar middle-class search for urban authenticity as a refuge from mass consumer culture,'' said Suleiman Osman, a Slope native and assistant professor of American Studies at George Washington University, who is writing a book about the history of gentrification in Brooklyn. That authenticity, he said, generally lasts only for the first phase of gentrification. It's a theme in modern urban history: the sense that authenticity is always slipping away. In short, this place was authentic until you people showed up. Repeat.
 Outside any authenticity smackdown, what has remained constant in Park Slope is the glory of Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Museum; the relative quiet and calm; and the fact that for the same bazillion dollars you might get a few more square feet than you get in Manhattan (maybe on a block with a tree). 
 Andmaybe that, when it comes to anti-Slopism, is all we need to know. Josh Grinker, the chef and an owner of Stone Park Cafe (the salmon and quinoa place), practically answered my question before I finished asking it. Why do people hate Park Slope? ''They're jealous because they can't live here,'' he said. 
 Many others whom I asked had the same response. ''There is all this class resentment in New York, and it's very tied up in real estate,'' Dr. Mollenkopf said. ''People who are well-housed are the envy of others.''
 Park Slope also may provide a peek into a crystal ball that some don't want to see. ''Hipsters and people who don't have kids are terrified of becoming grown-ups and parents, which is what Park Slope has come to represent,'' said Jeff Sandgrund, 30, a lifelong Park Sloper. ''So you lash out against that as if it's the worst thing in the world, when in five years, you know what? It's going to be you.'' 
 No consideration of Park Slope is complete without a discussion of stroller semiotics, of the stroller as synecdoche for the perceived evils of the neighborhood and indulgent urban child rearing in general. The high-end stroller -- which is not confined to Park Slope -- has become an epithet as inseparable from the Slope as ''wine-dark'' is from the sea.
 To their detractors, expensive strollers are in-your-face, in-your-way status symbols. They say, ''I paid for this stroller, to say nothing of my three-story town house, which authorizes me to take up nine square feet.'' 
 Sharyn Wolf, a psychotherapist in Manhattan, had fun with the query, taking it even further. ''They're a metaphor for power,'' she said. ''And whoever is in power, we hate.'' 
 As one Sloper recently groused on Brooklynian.com: ''How come the mommies get to make all the rules around here?'' 
 And lest we forget: these strollers, this privilege -- perceived and otherwise -- this Xanadu. Where is it? Brooklyn. 
 Brooklyn? 
 Brooklyn was supposed to be Manhattan's little burnout brother. When I arrived in New York, Brooklyn was the place you could reliably feel superior to, if you thought about it at all. New Yorkers don't hate the Upper East Side in the same way because that's old money, old news. But Brooklyn? ''There's the feeling that yuppies in Park Slope are washing away Brooklyn's grittiness and making it more like Manhattan,'' said Jose Sanchez, chairman of urban studies at Long Island University, Brooklyn. ''Brooklyn was supposed to be different. Park Slope, to some, now represents everything that Brooklyn was not supposed to be.'' 
 That's why our feelings about Park Slope are linked to our feelings about our entire city: our overpriced, chain-store city run by bankers, socialites and, it seems, mommies. The artists are fleeing and your friends, it seems, have become Park Slope pod people. (And they're coming for you, too.) It's starting to feel as if there's nowhere left to hide. And that if we lose Brooklyn, we lose everything. 
 Though actually, if you could keep hating Park Slope, that would be great. Maybe if it really falls out of favor, I'll be able to afford to stay.

HEADLINE: A Voice of Mother Russia, in English

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HEYMAN

 BODY:
JUDGING from the news lately, Russia is well on its way to restoring that old Evil Empire image. Military parades have returned to Red Square. Key businesses are choked by corruption or are under state control. Journalists who probe too deeply turn up dead. And critics of the Kremlin are jailed, pushed out of elections or, in one instance, mysteriously poisoned. 
 But on Russia Today, an English-language news channel begun in 2005 and financed by the Russian government, a more generous picture emerges. In this Russia, corruption is not quite a scourge but a symptom of a developing economy. And concerns about street thugs, poverty and Ukraine's aspirations for European Union membership trump fears over Vladimir V. Putin's grip on power.
 This Moscow-based channel's view of Russia is available to 120 million television viewers worldwide. That includes 20 million in the United States since last summer, when Russia Today was added to Time Warner Cable's digital package in the New York City region. 
 The Russian government has already poured more than $100 million into Russia Today, prompting charges that Kremlin sponsorship affects its coverage. Andrei N. Illarionov, a former adviser to Mr. Putin and now one of his critics, last year called the channel Russia's ''best propaganda machine for the outside world.'' The station is part of the state-owned news conglomerate RIA Novosti, and news organizations routinely refer to it as ''state-run,'' including The New York Times, which has said it was created to promote ''pro-Kremlin views.'' 
 Although it was conceived to counter what it sees as a Western news bias against Russia, the channel bills itself as ''an autonomous nonprofit organization,'' and its executives say they do not take orders from the Kremlin. 
 ''I'm a bit tired to try to explain that we are independent, that I don't get calls from the government -- I do not,'' said Margarita Simonyan, Russia Today's editor in chief. ''We want to develop into a really trusted name that people turn to because they want to know what's going on in the country.'' 
 Ms. Simonyan herself has been a focus of the channel's critics. Andrei Richter, the director of the Moscow Media Law and Policy Institute and a journalism professor at Moscow State University, said the editor, a 28-year-old former pool reporter for the Kremlin, was appointed because she is well-connected. 
 Ms. Simonyan acknowledged she once received flowers on her birthday from Mr. Putin, who stepped down this month but will retain power as the country's prime minister. Still, she said, her age often leads people to make assumptions about how she got her job.
 ''I realize that it's quite remarkable for someone who doesn't live in Russia,'' Ms. Simonyan said, adding that after the fall of the Soviet Union a new crop of young journalists was hired. ''I started my career when I was 18.'' 
 With a slick studio and polished graphics, Russia Today looks like most cable news channels. But there are a few differences. Technical problems plague live telecasts. While all the Russian reporters speak English, some have thick accents. And many staff members are as young as their editor. That youthfulness is reflected in many of the segments, like the campy ''Technology Update''; in one episode a reporter rolled around in a simulated skirmish with Russian special forces, testing out anti-sniper gadgetry to the tune of Eminem's ''Lose Yourself.'' 
 The channel has also reported on serious news events. In November, as water cannons struck anti-government demonstrators in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, the Russia Today correspondent Katerina Azarova was reporting so close to the protests that she was poisoned by tear gas. Watching the channel's round-the-clock coverage of the unrest in Tbilisi felt like peeking into a foreign newscast -- without needing to know a foreign language. 
 Despite such ambitions, several former Russia Today journalists said that working for a channel financed by the Kremlin made it difficult to cover news about Russia impartially. ''You are understandably walking a very fine line of being full and frank and biting the hand that feeds,'' said Carson Scott, a former business news presenter who is now with Sky News Business Channel in Australia. ''I had countless heated editorial debates with my editor, frankly speaking. I was very vocal. 'We have to give the other side of the argument. We have to be balanced.' And oftentimes eyes just glazed over.'' 
 But several of Russia Today's journalists said they were earnestly trying to tell Russia's story. ''No one is telling me what to say,'' said Peter Lavelle, the effusive host of ''In Context.'' Nevertheless, he said, the channel does take certain views. ''Part of our mission is public relations,'' he added.
 Some of the channel's specials seek to expose and correct Western biases about Russia. An episode of ''Cracking the Myths'' about Russia's economy opens with Jay Leno-style street interviews with Americans, who guess that most Russians subsist on penny-a-day incomes or wait in line for hours to get bread. The show then offers scenes of Russian prosperity, like a shopping mall brimming with members of the expanding middle class. 
 Mr. Richter said that this tendency to shape opinions reveals one of the channel's flaws. ''The idea of Russia Today is that our country is in a very hostile media environment,'' he said. ''The idea is very rotten because if you believe you're in a hostile environment, you want to persuade others that what they think is not true.''
 The concept of state-sponsored news aimed to viewers abroad is not new. During the cold war Western-financed radio stations like Voice of America, which began broadcasting in Russian in 1947, existed in part to counter Soviet spin. Russia Today has inverted the recipe, broadcasting in English from Russia in the hopes of improving Russia's increasingly ominous image in the West. And it is but the first in what has become a veritable parade of state-financed anglophone news channels.
 Since Russia Today's debut Iran (Press TV), China (CCTV-9), France (France 24) and Qatar (Al Jazeera English) have created their own English news networks. Al Jazeera's English spinoff is clearly the leader of this pack, drawing on the credibility of its Arabic-language counterpart and the deep pockets of the emir of Qatar. 
 Ben O'Loughlin, an international relations professor at the University of London's Royal Holloway campus, studies the emergence of state-financed news channels jockeying to have a voice in what he calls ''the anglosphere.'' 
 ''The journalists at Russia Today probably don't see themselves as political pawns,'' Mr. O'Loughlin said. ''They might say their goal isn't objectivity, it's balance -- having both sides. If we're interested in a pluralistic global media, then in many respects this could be a good thing, but that's very provisional.''
 For at least one viewer the question of the channel's independence is irrelevant. Alexandr Polin, a Manhattan event planner who left St. Petersburg in 1991, said he considered it propaganda, but not in the Soviet style. ''I watched a documentary yesterday about AIDS,'' he said. ''In Soviet times they would never say that people were sick somewhere.''
 Mr. Polin said that Western news coverage often eclipsed the good things happening back home: ''It's not only Mafia, Red Square, vodka and prostitutes.''

HEADLINE: McCain Can Run, But Bush Won't Hide

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE biggest gift President Bush has given his party this year was to keep his daughter's wedding nearly as private as Connie Corleone's. Now that his disapproval rating has reached the Nixon nadir of negativity, even a joyous familial ritual isn't enough to make the country glad to see him. The G.O.P.'s best hope would be for both the president and Dick Cheney to lock themselves in a closet until the morning after Election Day.
 Republicans finally recognized the gravity of their situation three days after Jenna Bush took her vows in Crawford. As Hillary Clinton romped in West Virginia, voters in Mississippi elected a Democrat in a Congressional district that went for Bush-Cheney by 25 percentage points just four years ago. It's the third ''safe'' Republican House seat to fall in a special election since March. 
 Party leaders have been haplessly trying to identify possible remedies ever since. It didn't help that their recent stab at an Obamaesque national Congressional campaign slogan, ''The Change You Deserve,'' was humiliatingly identified as the advertising pitch for the anti-depressant Effexor. (If they're going to go the pharmaceutical route, ''Viva Viagra'' might be more to the point.) Yet for all the Republican self-flagellation, it's still not clear that the party even understands the particular dimensions of its latest defeat and its full implications for both Congressional races and John McCain in November.
 The Mississippi election was actually a runoff, required by law after a preliminary vote left neither candidate with the required 50 percent. In the last round, on April 22, the Democrat, Travis Childers, beat the Republican, Greg Davis, 49 percent to 46 percent. (The rest went to minor candidates.) On Tuesday, that margin increased dramatically: the Republican remained at 46 percent while the Democrat jumped to 54 percent.
 What happened in the intervening three weeks helps explain why. The G.O.P. didn't merely step up its expensive negative campaign, attempting to take down Mr. Childers (who is a white, conservative Democrat) by linking him with Mr. Obama, a ranting Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Nancy Pelosi. It also brought in the party's big guns. Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain recorded mass phone pitches for Mr. Davis. Karl Rove and Mr. Cheney campaigned for him.
 The vice president's visit was last Monday, the centerpiece of a get-out-the-vote rally in DeSoto County, a G.O.P. stronghold. ''We'll put our shoulders to the wheel for John McCain,'' the vice president promised as he bestowed his benediction on Mr. Davis. Well, he got out the vote all right. In the election results the next day, the Childers total in DeSoto County increased142 percent, while the Davis count went up only 47 percent.
 The district as a whole is the second whitest in Mississippi. (Its black population is 27.2 percent.) It's the sole district Mr. Obama lost to Mrs. Clinton in the state's Democratic primary in March. Yet even in this unlikely political terrain the combination of a race-based Republican campaign and the personal intervention of Mr. Cheney energized enough white moderates and black voters to flip the district to the Democrats. Keep in mind, it's the Deep South we're talking about here. Imagine how the lethal combination of the Bush-Cheney brand and backlash-inducing G.O.P. race-baiting could whip up a torrential turnout by young voters, black voters and independents in true swing states farther north and west.
 Just 36 hours after the Mississippi debacle, Mr. McCain tried to distance himself from the administration by flip-flopping on his signature issue, Iraq, suddenly endorsing just the kind of timetable for withdrawal he has characterized as ''surrender'' when proposed by Democrats or Mitt Romney. (When Mr. McCain proposes it, he labels it ''victory.'') But hardly had Mr. McCain spoken than his message was upstaged by Mr. Bush's partisan political speech in Israel. The president implied that Mr. Obama would have enabled the Nazis even more foolishly than his own grandfather, Prescott Bush, did in the 1930s when he maintained ''investment relationships with Hitler's Germany,'' as Kevin Phillips delicately describes it in ''American Dynasty.'' 
 Mr. McCain's Iraq stunt was his second effort in a week to flee Mr. Bush, following a speech bemoaning administration inaction on climate change. These gambits were in turn preceded by Mr. McCain's attack on the White House response to Hurricane Katrina. Too bad he took this strong stand nearly three years after it might have sped relief to those suffering in New Orleans.
 The McCain campaign is hoping that such showy, if tardy, departures from Bush-Cheney doctrine will constitute a galaxy of Sister Souljah moments, each with headlines reading ''McCain Breaks With Bush on...'' and the usual knee-jerk press references to Mr. McCain as a ''maverick.'' Enough of these, you see, and those much-needed independent voters might be flimflammed into believing that the G.O.P. candidate bears no responsibility for the administration's toxically unpopular policies.
 You can't blame him for trying. Independents favor Democrats over Republicans on most issues, according to the April New York Times/CBS News poll, including the economy (by 30 points), Iraq (by 13 points) and health care (48 points). 
 But are independents suckers? They'd have to be to fall for the pitch that Mr. McCain is an apostate in his own party in 2008. He has been an outspoken Bush defender since helping him sell the Iraq war in 2002 and barnstorming for him in 2004. Despite Mr. McCain's campaign claims to the contrary, he never publicly called for the firing of Donald Rumsfeld. He is still one of the president's most stalwart supporters in Congress, even signing on to the president's wildly unpopular veto of an expansion of children's health insurance. 
 Mr. McCain's one major domestic policy rebellion, over the Bush tax cuts, has long since been ditched. Last Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' his economic surrogate, Carly Fiorina, implied that Mr. McCain would make budgetary ends meet by cutting earmarks -- federal pork that, in her inflated estimate, amounted to $42 billion over the past two years. But even if he cut all $42 billion, total federal spending would still be reduced by only 0.78 percent. 
 Hard as it is for Mr. McCain to run from the Bush policies he supports, it will be far harder to escape from Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney themselves. When Mr. McCain accepted Mr. Bush's endorsement at the White House in March, he referred three times to the president's ''busy schedule,'' as if wishing aloud that the lame-duck incumbent would have no time to appear at, say, get-out-the-vote rallies. Alas, Mr. Bush and company are not going gently into retirement. 
 Just look at Mr. Rove. Some Democrats are outraged that he is now employed as a pundit by Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal as well as Fox News. Instead of complaining, they should be thrilled that Mr. Rove keeps inviting Republican complacency by constantly locating silver linings in the party's bad news. His ubiquitous TV presence as a thinly veiled McCain surrogate has the added virtue of wrapping the Republican ticket in a daily and suffocating Bush bearhug, since Mr. Rove is far more synonymous with his former boss than Mr. Obama is with his former pastor.
 The Democrats can only hope that Mr. Rove will be a color commentator, so to speak, at the conventions. The parties' weeklong infomercials are shaping up as quite a study in contrasts. For all the fears of a Democratic civil war, the planets may be aligning for a truce, and possibly a celebration. As fate has it, the nominee's acceptance speech is scheduled for the night of Aug. 28, exactly 45 years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. electrified the nation with ''I Have a Dream.'' 
 The next day brings another anniversary: Mr. McCain turns 72. And then, on Sept. 1, comes the virtually all-white G.O.P. vaudeville in Minneapolis. You'll be pleased to know the show will go on despite the fact that the convention manager, chosen by the McCain campaign, had to resign last weekend after being exposed as the chief executive of a lobbying and consulting firm hired by the military junta in Myanmar. 
 The conventioneers will arrive via the airport whose men's room was immortalized by a Republican senator still serving the good people of Idaho. This will be a most picturesque backdrop to the party's eternal platform battles over family values, from same-sex marriage to abortion.
 For good measure, antiwar demonstrators from within the G.O.P. -- Ron Paul devotees -- could provide at least a smidgen of the 1968-style disruptions the Democrats may avoid. In April, the Nevada Republican state convention abruptly adjourned in midsession after the Paul forces won rule changes. The Los Angeles Times reported last week that other Paul cadres, operating below the national press's radar, have also been fighting guerrilla battles ''at county and state conventions from Washington and Missouri to Maine and Mississippi.''
 Already one of the national convention's de facto hosts -- Minnesota's endangered Senator Norm Coleman -- is frantically trying to save his seat by disowning his record as an Iraq war booster and disentangling himself from the president. Good luck! But how can Mr. McCain escape the dread specter of this White House at the convention? Surely Mr. Bush will exercise his prerogative to address the nation in prime time.
 Unless, of course, Labor Day week just happens to be the perfect moment for a second Bush daughter to tie the knot in Crawford.

HEADLINE: U.S. Television Taps More Imported Series

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
TO the lengthy list of commodities America imports that it also produces domestically -- oil, cars, clothing, cheese, wine -- you can add ideas for television series.
 Now that the biggest broadcast networks have presented their plans for the coming fall season, in an annual ritual known as upfront week, Madison Avenue is studying the schedules for 2008-9 season to help advertisers decide where to buy commercial time. One trend being noticed by the executives at media agencies is a growing reliance on series concepts from abroad.
 Among the newcomers whose roots can be traced overseas are ''The Ex List,'' at 9 p.m. Friday on CBS, from Israel; ''Kath and Kim,'' at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday on NBC, from Australia; ''Secret Millionaire,'' at 9 p.m. Thursday on Fox (starting in January), from Britain; and ''Worst Week,'' at 9:30 p.m. Monday on CBS, from Britain.
 In fact, two series with British pedigrees will face off against each other at 10 p.m. Thursday: ''Eleventh Hour,'' on CBS, and ''Life on Mars,'' on ABC. 
 Among the series with their genesis overseas that are already on the biggest broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, CW, Fox and NBC -- are hits like ''American Idol,'' ''Dancing With the Stars,'' ''Deal or No Deal'' and ''Survivor.''
 ''It's less expensive to acquire and adapt rights than develop something from scratch,'' said Shari Anne Brill, senior vice president and director for programming at Carat in New York, part of the Aegis Group.
 That is important as the shaky national economy throws into doubt the ability of marketers to spend more on TV ads in the fall and beyond. In other words, when revenue growth is threatened, cut costs.
 Another reason for relying on ideas from abroad is the interruption of the flow of home-grown scripts because of the 100-day strike by writers against the TV and movie studios. Although the strike was settled in February, it disrupted the production process for 2008-9.
 ''If you have a drought, you're going to look over the fence to see if there's water there,'' said Gene DeWitt, chairman at DeWitt Media in New York.
 ''The networks were searching internationally for ideas before the strike,'' he added. ''The strike was a catalyst.''
 Peter Gardiner, chief media officer at Deutsch in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, compared the networks to the National Basketball Association.
 ''There's a lot of good talent around the world,'' he added. ''Why not bring it to the U.S.?''
 ''Ben Silverman has been successful with that approach for a number of his shows,'' Mr. Gardiner said, referring to the co-chairman at the NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios units of NBC Universal, who in his previous career helped develop American versions of ''The Office'' for NBC and ''Ugly Betty'' for ABC.
 NBC even plans to add a spinoff of ''The Office'' to its lineup early next year. The series is ''already getting buzz,'' said Steve Kalb, senior vice president and director for broadcast media at MediaHub in Wenham, Mass., part of the Mullen division of Interpublic, even though NBC has disclosed nothing about it other than the debut date: Feb. 1, after the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII.
 The trend toward imported ideas is a variation on a practice that has long been prevalent at Spanish-language networks like Univision, part of Univision Communications. Their telenovelas -- serialized dramas that are prime-time mainstays -- are bought from foreign suppliers like Televisa and broadcast as they appeared abroad.
 Of course, wowing viewers in Bolivia or Belgium does not guarantee high ratings in this country.
 ''Everything won't necessarily translate to American tastes and sensibilities,'' Ms. Brill said, citing transplants that notoriously failed to take like ''Coupling,'' a flop for NBC, and ''The Kumars at No. 42,'' for which Fox bought the rights, produced a remake for American viewers (as ''The Ortegas'') and shelved, never broadcasting any of the six episodes.
 Also, MyNetworkTV lost millions of dollars in 2006 in an abortive effort to adapt telenovelas from countries like Colombia for American viewers. (MyNetworkTV, the smallest of the six English-language broadcasters, does not take part in upfront week.)
 Still, the media agency executive found appealing several of the new series inspired by shows from overseas.'' 'Eleventh Hour' is intriguing,'' said Gail Ettinger, executive vice president and director for national broadcast at KSL Media in New York. The drama is about a biophysicist, played by the British actor Rufus Sewell, who probes scientific mysteries. 
 Importing concepts for TV series ''is something that isn't alien to us, no pun intended,'' she added.
 ''Eleventh Hour'' has potential, said Mr. Gardiner of Deutsch, because the American version is being produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of all three ''CSI'' series on CBS. 
 Carrie Drinkwater, senior vice president and director for national broadcast at the Boston office of MPG, part of Havas, said she enjoyed ''Worst Week,'' a sitcom about a magazine editor, his girlfriend and his prospective in-laws.
 Ms. Drinkwater also singled out ''Secret Millionaire,'' a reality series in which wealthy Americans will live incognito among -- and share some of their fortunes with -- residents of poor neighborhoods.
 ''I liked the optimism that is the whole point of the show,'' Ms. Drinkwater said. ''We're all watching TV for escapism.''
 Another series inspired by a foreign show, ''The Ex List,'' may also attract an audience, said John Rash, senior vice president and director for broadcast negotiations at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, another Interpublic agency. ''The Ex List'' is about a woman whose search for a husband is guided by unusual advice from a psychic.
 One reason Mr. Rash gave for his forecast is that CBS has scheduled ''The Ex List'' to follow a popular returning series, ''Ghost Whisperer,'' which, like ''The Ex List,'' is aimed at female viewers.
 Another reason he offered is that ''sometimes shows are defined by expectations, and the lower expectations on Friday night will help give 'The Ex List' plenty of room.'' The reference was to the smaller audiences on Fridays and the scarcity of big hits that evening.
 On the other hand, Ms. Brill of Carat questioned the prospects for the American version of ''Kath and Kim.''
 ''It's a very crass show in Australia,'' Ms. Brill said. ''I'm not sure how it will play here.''
 Crassness on American TV? Heaven forbid. Now, where is that DVD of ''Family Guy''?

HEADLINE: The True Story of a Script, Big Dreams and Vanishing Private Equity

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Last September, when Sanjay Sanghoee set about turning his first novel into a Hollywood movie, the budding filmmaker had his pick of investors.
 The novel, ''Merger,'' a corporate thriller with an international espionage twist, was quietly published in 2005. Mr. Sanghoee saw the movie version as a $5 million to $7 million indie with broad appeal, maybe attracting a star like Jake Gyllenhaal. 
 But so many hedge funds and private equity investors wanted to sink money into the project that Mr. Sanghoee, himself holding down a day job at a New York hedge fund, pushed the needle higher. Soon the budget had tripled to $15 million. In October, he decided against a fund-raising trip to Dubai. ''We don't even need it now,'' he said in an interview at the time.
 But that was before Wall Street's mortgage mess, tight credit markets and the sour economy -- and before a parade of poor box-office results for investor-backed films. The torrent of private money flowing into Hollywood slowed to a trickle. Mr. Sanghoee now finds himself panning for gold in a very different stream. 
 Investors for ''Merger'' have either slammed on the brakes or disappeared altogether. A fund in Atlanta weighing a $7.5 million investment has cut back by $3 million. A $5 billion hedge fund group that was supposed to handle debt financing now has other priorities, namely liquidating 80 percent of its holdings.
 ''Things have gotten a bit hairy, and unexpectedly so,'' Mr. Sanghoee said.
 Mr. Sanghoee has been caught in the lurch of an uncertain economy and nervous lenders, like many other aspiring filmmakers, as private money has become harder to obtain. 
 Outsiders seeking a klieg-lighted life have always populated the movie capital. But over the last two years, as an estimated $12 billion in private deals has pumped money into movie production, achieving that dream became easier. Anybody with a little moxie and a few contacts could get some so-called dumb money and hang out a film shingle. 
 The spigot has not been completely turned off. Although there are no hard numbers on the amount of private equity now in Hollywood -- it is private, after all -- independent producers with distribution deals are still obtaining financing, albeit with difficulty. The bubble for upstart producers like Mr. Sanghoee, however, seems to have popped. 
 But dreams die hard in Hollywood. Mr. Sanghoee, a balding 35-year-old who wears a silver pinkie ring and Versace eyeglasses, urgently wants to trade his Midtown office for a poolside cabana. Rather than giving up, he is overhauling his financing plans and retooling his pitch to investors. From the start, he knew what to name his production company: Relentless Pictures. The logo, he decided, would be a man rolling a boulder up a hill.
 Starting a New Career
 In 2005, when a division of Macmillan published ''Merger,'' Mr. Sanghoee (pronounced SANE-go-ee) had a decision to make: try to option the film rights to a producer or seek investors to make a movie himself.
 Finding his own investors didn't seem far-fetched. He had managed to get a book deal without any experience, and the book landed some decent reviews. (''Glamour, gore and more,'' said Barron's.) Besides, he noticed that there was something in the zeitgeist about outsiders coming to Hollywood: even a story line on ''The Sopranos'' involved two characters lining up investors for a slasher picture based on their mobster experiences.
 ''What's Tony Soprano got that I don't got?'' Mr. Sanghoee recently asked, trying (unsuccessfully) to trade his Indian accent for a New Jersey one.
 Like so many other corporate workers, Mr. Sanghoee was a little bored. He left India in 1991 to attend Columbia, where he earned a degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in business administration. Over the next decade, he worked various financial jobs on Wall Street. 
 In 2005, Mr. Sanghoee worked at Ramius, an $11.5 billion Manhattan hedge fund. He commuted from his Upper East Side apartment to a Midtown office, where he invested the fund's money in alternative energy, radio stations and insurance. At night and on weekends, he worked on his book and wrote spec scripts for episodes of ''Law and Order.'' None were ever made.
 Fame and fortune, Mr. Sanghoee said, were things he could not help but think about. 
 He also had a front-row seat as hedge funds looked to Hollywood as a place to park money. Ramius decided in 2006 to start reviewing film financing deals to push into movie investments, tapping Mr. Sanghoee to lead the effort. He flew to Los Angeles to meet with executives at William Morris Agency and Brillstein Entertainment, a management and production company.
 Mr. Sanghoee landed in a boomtown. More than $12 billion was in the midst of flowing into 150 movies, according to trade estimates. Hedge funds, awash in cash, were eager to write checks. At the restaurant Spago, ''I'm raising some capital'' became the new, ''Don't you know who I am?''
 Ramius ultimately decided to take its toe out of the water -- too risky -- but Mr. Sanghoee saw an opening. With a novel and, now, a Rolodex full of hedge fund and Hollywood contacts, he would make a movie himself. 
 ''I had no idea what I was getting myself into,'' he said recently.
 In mid-2007, he started calling contacts. (He said he received permission from his bosses to pursue the movie.) One call went to Jai Khanna, a manager at Brillstein Entertainment who had read ''Merger'' and responded favorably. Brillstein counts ''Scary Movie 2'' and the television series ''Just Shoot Me'' among its producing credits.
 ''I saw the story as really commercial,'' Mr. Khanna said. He connected Mr. Sanghoee with a fledgling screenwriter, Neeraj Chaudhury, and they wrote a script.
 ''Merger'' is the story of an Indian corporate titan who begins a hostile takeover of a satellite company that transmits information from the C.I.A. A New York investment banker working on the deal smells something fishy and turns to a former girlfriend, a brassy newspaper reporter, for help. The corporate titan, it turns out, has pictures of the owner-operator of the satellite company having sex with young boys.
 As the banker and the reporter race to uncover the plot, dodging assassins in the process, a bigger evil is revealed: The Indian businessman plans to sell C.I.A. secrets to an Arab terrorist.
 With a script in hand, Mr. Sanghoee started chatting up hedge funds. A typical pitch occurred in a phone call on Nov. 3 with a principal at a private equity firm based in Connecticut. The firm, the principal said at the start of the call, was looking to invest $7 million in movies over the next six weeks.
 Mr. Sanghoee began by talking about his book. According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 75 percent of sales, ''Merger'' sold about 2,000 copies; Mr. Sanghoee puts the number closer to 20,000, explaining that many copies were sold through uncounted wholesalers.
 ''Movies and books sell each other very effectively in today's marketplace,'' Mr. Sanghoee started out, ''which is where I think 'Merger' becomes even more sensible a project. We know this book is going to sell the movie.''
 ''Fantastic,'' responded the potential investor, Alex, who agreed to let a reporter listen in on the condition that his last name not be used.
 They chatted for about 40 minutes about how a deal might be structured and about Mr. Sanghoee's plans to get a major studio to distribute the film. How would he rope a big studio? ''Ican pick up the phone and get the meetings I want,'' Mr. Sanghoee assured Alex.
 Mr. Sanghoee found another ''sucker,'' as he jokingly put it, while on a date. One night while out drinking, Mr. Sanghoee and his companion bumped into Peter Delahunt, a municipal bond trader and an acquaintance of Mr. Sanghoee's date. Mr. Sanghoee, always the pitchman, talked up ''Merger'' and, a few weeks later, gave his new friend an autographed copy of the book. Soon Mr. Delahunt had committed to chip in six figures for development costs.
 ''I thought it was worth the gamble partly because the story has so many hooks and angles,'' Mr. Delahunt said in an interview. He said he had figured that his own Hollywood connections might help push the project along. ''My son was a classmate of Anne Hathaway's brother,'' he said.
 Meryl Streep's brother, Dana Streep, was another contact. ''I used to work with him way back in the old days,'' Mr. Delahunt said. ''He doesn't know it yet, but he will be getting a call from me.''
 Big Names, Little Progress
 Despite the strong interest -- Mr. Sanghoee also had a Canadian investor offering to put in the entire $15 million, with caveats -- most investors were reluctant to complete a deal until they saw a cast list, even a tentative one. Mr. Sanghoee toyed with approaching Mr. Gyllenhaal, but Brillstein vetoed the idea.
 ''Everyone thinks that what they wrote is genius,'' said Mr. Khanna, of Brillstein. ''I'm here to tell Sanjay that certain things he wants are never going to happen.''
 With Mr. Khanna's help, Mr. Sanghoee hired two casting directors who had worked on movies like ''The Good Shepherd'' and ''Coyote Ugly.'' They came up with a list everybody thought was realistic. For the role of the investment banker, they would go after actors like Ryan Phillippe and Matthew Fox, according to a business plan that Brillstein helped develop. Winona Ryder and Claire Danes were possibilities to play the reporter.
 For the central role of the villain, they would go after Amitabh Bachchan, a Bollywood star who could help ''Merger'' cross into international markets, an increasingly important source of revenue for American movies.
 Navigating Hollywood was proving trickier than Mr. Sanghoee had thought. ''My lack of sleep and daily dose of hitting against walls is finally beginning to wear me down,'' he said in January. ''There is a passive-aggressiveness in the way this business functions. Basically the old adage that no one in Hollywood ever says no is shockingly true.''
 A bit of casting luck perked him up. The actress Lara Flynn Boyle gave a verbal agreement, via her manager, to take a supporting role as a sultry henchwoman. ''We can use her name when speaking to investors and when talking to agents/managers about their client roster for the other roles,'' wrote Stephen Vincent, one of the casting directors, in an e-mail message.
 Mr. Sanghoee had talked Harvey L. Pitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, into serving as a consultant on the movie. Mr. Pitt said in an interview that he got to know Mr. Sanghoee a few years back, when the writer approached him about tips for one of his scripts.
 ''Over all, the story is quite good,'' Mr. Pitt said. ''The character of the S.E.C. chairman isn't particularly attractive, but I guess that's poetic license.''
 Hedge funds and private equity investors apparently liked what they saw. Two professional basketball players (whom Mr. Sanghoee declined to identify), a fund behind the 2006 film ''The Namesake'' and the Connecticut fund started serious talks, according to Mr. Sanghoee. Southern Sky, the fund based in Atlanta, agreed to put in $7.5 million.
 In April, Southern Sky began to get nervous, Mr. Sanghoee said. Panic on Wall Street over the collapse of Bear Stearns had led to unprecedented intervention in the markets by federal regulators. The economy, already running on fumes, was further rocked by escalating oil prices and plummeting consumer confidence.
 As the bad news whipsawed the stock market, Mr. Sanghoee had another problem. ''People started asking if this is really the right time to be putting out a movie about Wall Street,'' he said.
 Meantime, pictures backed by investors like ''The Kingdom'' and ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' continued to disappoint at the box office. Maybe Hollywood was not such a smart bet after all. 
 Southern Sky did not pull its money but started pushing Mr. Sanghoee to come up with a less risky plan, like bringing on an experienced director instead of Mr. Sanghoee himself. To try to appease the financier, he suggested a smaller investment of $4.5 million. 
 When the hedge fund handling debt financing liquated most of its assets, Mr. Sanghoee thought of approaching GE Capital Solutions, which handles Hollywood financing deals, but he has not yet done so. 
 ''I know other people would have given up a long time ago,'' he said in an interview last week, ''but I'm now experienced enough to know that these setbacks are all just temporary.''
 In fact, Mr. Sanghoee said Grosvenor Park, an entertainment financial services company, on Thursday expressed interest in backing ''Merger.''
 When Mr. Sanghoee began his pitch in October, he promoted his lucky timing. That month he told one potential investor in a telephone call that 20th Century Fox was working on a sequel to ''Wall Street,'' the 1987 film starring Michael Douglas. ''We are going to be able to ride the publicity wave that movie will generate to get our movie noticed,'' he said during the call.
 His new angle? His biggest competitor is out of the way. 
 ''We think 'Wall Street 2' is not going to happen,'' he said in a mid-April interview. ''That is a golden opportunity for our picture.''

HEADLINE: Stranded In Suburbia

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
 I have seen the future, and it works.
 O.K., I know that these days you're supposed to see the future in China or India, not in the heart of ''old Europe.'' 
 But we're living in a world in which oil prices keep setting records, in which the idea that global oil production will soon peak is rapidly moving from fringe belief to mainstream assumption. And Europeans who have achieved a high standard of living in spite of very high energy prices -- gas in Germany costs more than $8 a gallon -- have a lot to teach us about how to deal with that world. 
 If Europe's example is any guide, here are the two secrets of coping with expensive oil: own fuel-efficient cars, and don't drive them too much. 
 Notice that I said that cars should be fuel-efficient -- not that people should do without cars altogether. In Germany, as in the United States, the vast majority of families own cars (although German households are less likely than their U.S. counterparts to be multiple-car owners). 
 But the average German car uses about a quarter less gas per mile than the average American car. By and large, the Germans don't drive itsy-bitsy toy cars, but they do drive modest-sized passenger vehicles rather than S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks.
 In the near future I expect we'll see Americans moving down the same path. We've already done it once: over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, the average mileage of U.S. passenger vehicles rose about 50 percent, as Americans switched to smaller, lighter cars. 
 This improvement stalled with the rise of S.U.V.'s during the cheap-gas 1990s. But now that gas costs more than ever before, even after adjusting for inflation, we can expect to see mileage rise again. 
 Admittedly, the next few years will be rough for families who bought big vehicles when gas was cheap, and now find themselves the owners of white elephants with little trade-in value. But raising fuel efficiency is something we can and will do.
 Can we also drive less? Yes -- but getting there will be a lot harder.
 There have been many news stories in recent weeks about Americans who are changing their behavior in response to expensive gasoline -- they're trying to shop locally, they're canceling vacations that involve a lot of driving, and they're switching to public transit. 
 But none of it amounts to much. For example, some major public transit systems are excited about ridership gains of 5 or 10 percent. But fewer than 5 percent of Americans take public transit to work, so this surge of riders takes only a relative handful of drivers off the road. 
 Any serious reduction in American driving will require more than this -- it will mean changing how and where many of us live. 
 To see what I'm talking about, consider where I am at the moment: in a pleasant, middle-class neighborhood consisting mainly of four- or five-story apartment buildings, with easy access to public transit and plenty of local shopping. 
 It's the kind of neighborhood in which people don't have to drive a lot, but it's also a kind of neighborhood that barely exists in America, even in big metropolitan areas. Greater Atlanta has roughly the same population as Greater Berlin -- but Berlin is a city of trains, buses and bikes, while Atlanta is a city of cars, cars and cars.
 And in the face of rising oil prices, which have left many Americans stranded in suburbia -- utterly dependent on their cars, yet having a hard time affording gas -- it's starting to look as if Berlin had the better idea. 
 Changing the geography of American metropolitan areas will be hard. For one thing, houses last a lot longer than cars. Long after today's S.U.V.'s have become antique collectors' items, millions of people will still be living in subdivisions built when gas was $1.50 or less a gallon. 
 Infrastructure is another problem. Public transit, in particular, faces a chicken-and-egg problem: it's hard to justify transit systems unless there's sufficient population density, yet it's hard to persuade people to live in denser neighborhoods unless they come with the advantage of transit access.
 And there are, as always in America, the issues of race and class. Despite the gentrification that has taken place in some inner cities, and the plunge in national crime rates to levels not seen in decades, it will be hard to shake the longstanding American association of higher-density living with poverty and personal danger.
 Still, if we're heading for a prolonged era of scarce, expensive oil, Americans will face increasingly strong incentives to start living like Europeans -- maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of our lives.

HEADLINE: Signs Fossella May Run Again Unnerve G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
There has been nothing but silence coming from the embattled Staten Island congressman, Vito J. Fossella, regarding his plans to run for re-election this year. And that uncertainty has caused waves of concern not only among Republicans in New York City, but in Washington as well.
 All signs indicate that Mr. Fossella, a Republican who was arrested in Virginia on May 1 on a drunken driving charge and then admitted to fathering a child out of wedlock, is leaning toward running for a sixth term in November. He has been telling friends and advisers that he thinks he can win. And though he canceled a fund-raiser scheduled for this past weekend, he has five or six events planned for the coming month, his spokeswoman said. 
 And on Saturday, he marched in the Memorial Day Parade in the Great Kills section of the island. He was greeted warmly while marching and while sitting on a platform with other politicians at the end of the route.
 But for all his popularity on Staten Island, long a Republican stronghold, Mr. Fossella, 43, faces daunting obstacles. If convicted of drunken driving, he would have to serve a mandatory five-day jail sentence. His acknowledgment of an extramarital affair -- he has three children with his wife, Mary Pat -- has clearly upset many voters in his conservative-leaning district. 
 He also confronts what many political analysts and Republican strategists view as Democratic momentum going into the fall elections. Three times this year, Democrats have defeated Republicans in special Congressional elections, most recently last week in a staunchly Republican district in Mississippi. 
 This year, said Guy V. Molinari, the former borough president and dean of the Republican Party on the island, ''is a bad Republican year, politically, and that doesn't help matters.'' 
 For all those reasons, the prospect of a scandal-tainted Mr. Fossella on the ballot in November has caused more than a little apprehension among Republican leaders in New York and Washington, though they decline to speak publicly about Mr. Fossella's problems. 
 Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican minority leader, has contacted Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney, to discuss the possibility of his running should Mr. Fossella resign or decide not to seek re-election.
 William J. Smith, Mr. Donovan's spokesman, said that there was little use speculating on what the district attorney might do, while Mr. Fossella remained silent on his plans.
 Julie Shutley, a spokeswoman for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, sought to put the best face on the situation. ''The 13th Congressional District has continually sent Republican representation to Congress,'' she said, adding that it was a district that believed in ''lowering taxes and a strong national security.''
 But when asked about the party's prospects should Mr. Fossella decide to run, she declined to comment. And John S. Friscia, the chairman of the Republican Party on Staten Island, did not return repeated calls seeking comment on the party's prospects.
 Even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has been a reliable source of campaign money and support for Mr. Fossella in the past, said he was uncertain whether he would support the congressman in a re-election campaign.
 Many Republicans on Staten Island, however, seem to be sticking with Mr. Fossella for the time being. Mr. Molinari, who has feuded with Mr. Fossella on and off in the past, says he will support him if he runs again. The congressman, he said, ''has made mistakes, and everybody now knows about those mistakes.''
 ''If he chooses to run, I think he can win,'' Mr. Molinari said. ''It would take an all-out effort and a substantial amount of money. But there are a lot of people pledging support for him.''
 The congressman has declined repeated requests to be interviewed on the topic of his re-election plans and the events of the last few weeks. 
 But over the past few days, Mr. Fossella has re-emerged, if gingerly. On Friday evening, he surprised many politicians by stopping by the Conservative Party banquet on Staten Island. He apparently did not tell any of the party's leaders that he would attend. He arrived after the formal program had ended and did not speak. (James P. Molinaro, the Staten Island borough president, is a longtime official of the state Conservative Party.) Then he went to the parade on Saturday.
 Mr. Fossella, the only New York City Republican in Congress, represents a district that includes Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn. It is the most conservative-leaning district in the city. And he has portrayed himself during his years in politics as a Republican moderate who exemplified traditional family values. 
 As a result, many politicians on Staten Island initially expected that he would resign shortly after the revelations of an extramarital affair and a daughter born from that relationship -- or at least not run again. 
 To be sure, Mr. Fossella has been popular in the 13th District since he won the special election that sent him to Congress in 1997. At the time, he was a 32-year-old city councilman and a darling of Staten Island politics; a Democrat-turned-Republican who was an ardent supporter of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 In his more recent elections, he has continued to win, but against opponents who have done increasingly well. Indeed, some Democratic leaders have said privately that they hope Mr. Fossella decides to run again, suggesting that the scandals would do nothing but help their cause.
 Stephen A. Harrison, a Brooklyn lawyer who was Mr. Fossella's Democratic opponent in 2006 and hopes to challenge him again this year, has stopped short of calling for Mr. Fossella to resign or step down after his present term. In a statement, Mr. Harrison said, ''If he decides to run, the people will decide in November if his recent behavior and revelations should disqualify him from continuing in office.''
 He added: ''There are great issues to be debated in this campaign -- the war in Iraq, health care, the economy, the environment and energy, just to name a few. It is now my intention to get past this distraction and return to those issues.''
 It remains to be seen whether the Congressional race will actually focus on those issues. For now, the attention seems to be firmly on Mr. Fossella rather than his opponents, or the issues.

Charter to Track Web Surfing
 Charter Communications, one of the largest cable systems in the United States, has started telling its high-speed Internet customers it is going to keep track of every site they visit on the Web. 
 The cable company will sell the data to a firm called NebuAd, which in turn will use it to show ads to Charter customers that are meant to be related to their interests. (Visit a knitting site today and see yarn ads tomorrow.)
 Charter started sending letters out to several hundred thousand customers in four markets: Fort Worth; San Luis Obispo, Calif.; Oxford, Mass.; and Newtown, Conn.
 Charter said it would start testing the system within a few weeks and then decide whether to introduce it to its 2.8 million Internet customers.
 Using data from Internet service providers to focus advertising raises all kinds of questions about privacy, disclosure and who owns the information about where Internet users surf.
 Ted Schremp, Charter's senior vice president for product management and strategy, said the company has ''told customers exactly what we are doing.''
 In a letter to customers, the company described the monitoring program as an ''an enhanced online experience that is more customized to your interests and activities.'' 
 ''As a result,'' the letter said, ''the advertising you typically see online will better reflect the interests you express through your Web-surfing activity. You will not see more ads -- just ads that are more relevant to you.''
 Mr. Schremp played down the privacy concerns. ''The mainstream Internet user is hugely aware of the fact that the fundamental economic model on the Internet is advertising,'' he said. ''All we are doing is, in an anonymous format, providing additional context to serve those ads. To the extent those ads are more meaningful to me as Ted Schremp, I will have a better Internet experience than the generic ads that are part of Yahoo and everything online.''
 For those customers who disagree, Charter is offering the ability to opt out of the system.
 NebuAd will pay Charter an unspecified fee for access to the customer data.

 FOR CHINA, TALES OF MIRACLES
 Give Way to Task of Burials
 There are fewer miraculous survivor stories on TV from China's earthquake, replaced with reruns of dramatic rescues. In towns and hamlets across Sichuan Province, where thousands remain missing, an air of hopelessness began to set in. The search for survivors was scaled back in many places, and rescue workers began focusing more on the task of cremating or burying the dead. In Beijing, officials announced a three-day mourning period during which the ceremonial relay of the Olympic torch, which has been traveling through China, would be suspended. PAGE A10
 LEADER VISITS CYCLONE VICTIMS
 The leader of Myanmar's ruling junta for the first time visited victims of the cyclone that destroyed wide swaths of the country, two weeks after the storm. State television showed video of the leader, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, touring a refuge camp, the images part of a broad effort by the state-run media to defend the government's relief efforts and to counter international criticism. Still, pressure continued to mount on the military regime. PAGE A6 
 MESSY MARRIAGE GOES NATIONAL
 It started out racy enough: South Korean soap opera actor accuses wife, another popular television star, of affairs with his close friend and a chef giving her private cooking lessons. He presses charges under the country's male-centric adultery law. She admits one affair, but files a petition challenging the constitutionality of the law. Now their messy marriage is a national issue. PAGE A8
 COLOMBIA DENIES INCURSION
 Colombia denied assertions made Saturday by Venezuela that Colombian troops had been detected Friday in Apure State in western Venezuela, the latest dispute between the two countries. ''There was no incursion,'' the Colombian defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, said. ''I looked into it and they were not doing anything.'' PAGE A9
 PAKISTAN BOMBER KILLS 11
 A suicide bomber killed 11 people and wounded 22 at a market close to an army base in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, local officials said, just days before the government was expected to complete a peace deal with Taliban militants. There was immediate speculation that the bombing was an act of revenge against the government for a United States missile attack last week on militants in the tribal agency of Bajaur. PAGE A9

 THE WATCHFUL EYE
 Overseeing Offenders
 Like every place else, probably, Dickinson, N.D., has its share of registered sex offenders. There are rules they have to follow, set by law. And there is one person who monitors those registered sex offenders: Detective Amanda McNamee, one of only two women on a force of about two dozen. She originally went to college to become a teacher, but the thought of herding kindergartners pushed her in another direction. PAGE A12
 A DEBATE REKINDLED
 After an investigation by the Interior Department found no merit to the claim by two professors that the winning design chosen for the Flight 93 National Memorial had evolved to contain elements of their own proposal, most people thought the debate over the memorial was over. But the debate and rancor has been reignited in anticipation of the professors' presentation of a paper on the issue on Tuesday at a conference in Charlottesville, Va. PAGE A13
 WHERE EAST DOESN'T MEET WEST
 Tuesday, when Oregon's mail-in ballots are tallied, Senator Barack Obama is expected to win, moving him closer to the Democratic presidential nomination. But Oregon is well known for the sharp divide between its more liberal and populated west and its rural east. And if Mr. Obama should end up meeting Senator John McCain on the ballot in November, it could be important to watch how the state's shifting demographics, coupled with a fondness for being out front on unconventional issues, play out.

 IDENTIFYING A KILLER IN HOSPITALS,
 And Working to Beat It
 Preventable infections were once considered part of the collateral damage of advanced lifesaving techniques, so routine that few people questioned their prevalence, or the deaths that resulted from them. But since New York City hospitals cracked down in 2005, they have dropped sharply, partly because of simple efforts to take seemingly obvious precautions. PAGE AB1
 FOSSELLA MAY RUN AGAIN
 Representative Vito J. Fossella's arrest this month on a drunken driving charge and subsequent admission of having fathered a child with a woman who is not his wife might be considered complicating factors in a bid for re-election. But signs indicate that Mr. Fossella, a Republican who represents Staten Island, is leaning toward running for a sixth term. Concern is rising not only among Republicans in New York City, but in Washington as well. PAGE B1
 A DAY TO VEG OUT
 Organizers called it Veggie Pride, a Manhattan parade starting at noon in the -- where else? -- meatpacking district and wending through Greenwich Village. About 600 people took part, some dressed up as bananas, or heads of broccoli, or pigs or bloodied cows. The event was the brainchild of Pamela Rice. ''Today's our day, we wanted to stand apart,'' she said. ''Apart from the yoga people. Apart from the new-age people. It's just us today. We usually get the short shrift.'' PAGE B3
 BUSINESS
 CRASHING THE HOUSE
 That Fashion Helped Build
 Conde Nast headquarters, with ''its fat, luscious magazines and elevators full of thin, luscious people,'' as David Carr writes, would not seem to be a haven for Internet geeks as well. These are the people who give the world Vogue and Gourmet, after all, and kept the Web at arm's length.

 NOT TO BE TAKEN. LITERALLY.
 The May issue of Wired magazine, in articles about how to enhance brain function, includes a chart: ''Do the Right Drugs.'' Eight are included, six of them prescription medications, one of them, methamphetamine, illegal. The magazine acknowledges that and warns that prolonged use of methamphetamine ''can also make you stupid and crazy.'' PAGE C14
 PREDICTING WANTS
 If you have that vague feeling that marketers are paying attention to which of their e-mail messages you open and which you do not, and whether you buy what they are pitching and if so how many and at what price and when, you are exactly right. And money is riding on the bet that it works. PAGE C6
 HOLLYWOOD DREAMS
 Last fall, Sanjay Sanghoee could pick and choose among the investors lining up to help turn his first novel into a Hollywood movie. Dreams of a $5 million to $7 million indie expanded to maybe triple that budget. But that was before Wall Street's mortgage mess, tight credit markets and the sour economy. Still, dreams die hard.

 AN APPETITE FOR IMPORTS
 Among the trends for the coming fall television schedule is the continued importation of series concepts from abroad, including Israel, Australia and that longtime favorite, Britain. The new series will join others with an overseas connection like ''American Idol'' and ''Dancing With the Stars.'' The process once provided ''All in the Family.'' Is this progress? PAGE C7

 SURVIVING AS GLORY
 Proves Fleeting on Broadway
 Things looked so much better in Arlington, Va., where ''Glory Days'' was a hit this year. Its creators, at 23 and 24, were so young. And then came the offer to take the show to Broadway. Could things get anybetter? Ooh, but then to close after opening night. Could it get any worse? Well, some shows don't even make it out of previews. PAGE E1 
 THE ARTS OF HISTORY
 ''Real Time: Art in Israel, 1998-2008,'' at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, is one of six exhibitions over the coming months that will mark Israel's 60th anniversary, one show for each decade of the country's existence. The works include paintings and photographs and videos and interactive installations in what Ethan Bronner calls ''an ambitious, sometimes macabre and often witty show.'' PAGE E1 
 THE VOICE STILL WORKS
 Among the new CDs out are ones by Bun B, Julianne Hough, the Dresden Dolls and Donna Summer. Ms. Summer, at 59 what Billboard magazine calls a ''heritage artist,'' clearly still has the voice to make a great new record, Ben Ratliff writes. This one, he adds, ''though consistently good-natured and glossily wise about life's learning curves, isn't it.'' PAGE E4 
 A WRITER TEES OFF
 Knopf must be betting that fans of Carl Hiaasen will follow him anywhere -- even unto ''The Downhill Lie,'' which is not one of his usual fiction romps, but an account of his enthusiasm for golf. Janet Maslin found it enjoyable nevertheless, writing, ''Even readers who find parts of this account boring, contrived or incomprehensible are liable to plow on anyway and not be sorry.'' PAGE E8

 Mary Chepkemboi was an elite distance runner in Kenya at a time when it was believed that a woman's place is in the home. But the spoils of her victories -- blankets, bed sheets, machetes, axes, tin sheeting for the roof -- put practicality ahead of cultural taboos.

But even with a genie, golf is still pretty hard. PAGE D5

HEADLINE: Bush's Speech Prods Middle East Leaders

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt 

 BODY:
After basking in a showy celebration of America's close ties with Israel, President Bush criticized other Middle East leaders on Sunday, prodding them to expand their economies, offer equal opportunity to women and embrace democracy if they want peace to become reality.
 ''Too often in the Middle East, politics has consisted of one leader in power and the opposition in jail,'' Mr. Bush said in an address to the World Economic Forum here, adding, ''The time has come for nations across the Middle East to abandon these practices and treat their people with the dignity and respect they deserve.'' 
 The speech, given to an audience of diplomats, world leaders, policy makers and business executives attending the forum in this Red Sea resort town, came at the end of a five-day Middle East tour that also took Mr. Bush to Israel and Saudi Arabia. The tone of the address, meant as a bookend to a speech the president gave last week to Israeli lawmakers, reflected what the administration sees as the obstacles its diplomacy faces in pushing a peace agreement in the last months of Mr. Bush's presidency. 
 The White House had portrayed the Middle East trip as a mix of symbolism and substance, and it had said Mr. Bush would use his time in the region to shore up the faltering Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
 But the president's three-day stay in Jerusalem, which included tours of the ancient fortress Masada, a private viewing of the Dead Sea scrolls and a host of laudatory exchanges between Mr. Bush and Israeli leaders, drew sharp criticism in the Arab world, where he was accused of being insensitive to Palestinian concerns.
 In Sharm el Sheik, Mr. Bush tried to soften that impression. He held a series of back-to-back meetings with regional leaders -- including those from Iraq, Egypt, Afghanistan and Pakistan -- at a spectacular villa overlooking the sparkling Red Sea. 
 Emerging from a session with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Bush said he had told Mr. Abbas that he was ''absolutely committed'' to a Palestinian state.
 ''It breaks my heart to see the vast potential of the Palestinian people really wasted,'' Mr. Bush said, with Mr. Abbas by his side. ''They're good, smart, capable people that, when given a chance, will build a thriving homeland.''
 Yet Mr. Bush's speech on Sunday afternoon contained some pointed criticisms of how Arab political leaders govern. It was a stark contrast to the speech Mr. Bush delivered to Israeli lawmakers a few days earlier, both in tone and in the reaction. In Jerusalem, Israeli lawmakers cheered Mr. Bush, while here he received only restrained applause.
 ''In our democracy, we would never punish a person for owning a Koran,'' Mr. Bush said, taking aim at those who, he said, claim democracy and Islam are incompatible. ''And we would never issue a death sentence to someone for converting to Islam. Democracy does not threaten Islam or any other religion. Democracy is the only system of government that guarantees their protection.''
 The president also warned that Middle Eastern economies would not thrive unless opportunities were offered to women. ''This is a matter of morality and basic math,'' he said.
 And after unsuccessfully trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to increase oil production enough to cause a drop in gasoline prices in the United States, Mr. Bush had a message for oil-producing nations, saying that as America and other countries look to alternative forms of energy, the market for Middle East oil will diminish, forcing countries here to diversify their economies.
 Mr. Bush did try to link his speech in Israel and his speech here. In the first speech, timed to coincide with the 60th birthday of Israel, Mr. Bush outlined his vision for what the Middle East would look like on Israel's 120th birthday. 
 He used some of the same language on Sunday, repeating certain passages word for word and telling his audience that his vision ''is not a Jewish vision or a Muslim vision, not an American vision or an Arab vision; it is a universal vision.''
 Mr. Bush did reserve some special praise for Egypt, lauding the rise of professional women here and strong Egyptian growth rates in telecommunications, tourism and trade. But he also took aim at President Hosni Mubarak's repression of political dissent. ''Economic reform must be accompanied by political reform,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 On Saturday, Mr. Bush told reporters that in a meeting with Mr. Mubarak, he specifically raised the case of Ayman Nour, Mr. Mubarak's main opponent in the 2005 elections, who was imprisoned on fraud charges that Mr. Nour's supporters regard as politically motivated. Mr. Bush has said before that he believes Mr. Nour has been ''unjustly imprisoned.'' 
 The trip was Mr. Bush's second to the region in five months, and his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, told reporters that one reason for the speech was ''to give some hope'' that progress toward peace was possible. 
 Many analysts say the most Mr. Bush can hope for is to hand off a working peace process to his successor. They say they are skeptical about Mr. Bush's pronouncements that the contours of a Palestinian state can be defined before he leaves office.
 But Mr. Hadley insisted that progress, though quiet, was occurring, and he hinted that Mr. Bush might return to the region before his term was over.
 ''The president will come back here,'' Mr. Hadley said, ''when there is work for him to do.''
 A New Message From bin Laden
 CAIRO (AP) -- Osama bin Laden released a message on Sunday denouncing Arab leaders for what he called their sacrificing of the Palestinians.
 In his second audio message in three days focusing on the Palestinians, Mr. bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda, urged fighting against Arab regimes that he said were protecting Israel. He called on Muslim militants in Egypt to help break the blockade of Gaza.
 Mr. bin Laden said Muslims should ignore the Islamic prohibition against raising arms against fellow Muslims, asserting it was legitimate to rise up against leaders who are not governing according to Islamic law. Those leaders, he said, came to power ''either by a military coup or with backing from foreign forces.''
 His 22-minute audiotape was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where Qaeda leaders have issued past statements. The voice sounded like that of Mr. bin Laden's, although the authenticity of the tape could not be independently verified.
 Mr. bin Laden's last audio message, released Friday to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Israel's establishment, vowed to continue what he called Al Qaeda's struggle against the Jewish state.

HEADLINE: Teeing Up the Next Mortgage Bust

 BODY:
In responding to the subprime mortgage crisis, most Congressional Republicans and many Bush administration officials apparently believe they have time on their side. They are wrong. 
 The housing bust is feeding on itself: price declines provoke foreclosures, which provoke more price declines. And the problem is not limited to subprime mortgages. There is an entirely different category of risky loans whose impact has yet to be felt -- loans made to creditworthy borrowers but with tricky terms and interest rates that will start climbing next year.
 Yet the Senate Banking Committee goes on talking. It has failed as yet to produce a bill to aid borrowers at risk of foreclosure, with the panel's ranking Republican, Richard Shelby of Alabama, raising objections. In the House, a foreclosure aid measure passed recently, but with the support of only 39 Republicans. The White House has yet to articulate a coherent way forward, sowing confusion and delay. 
 The fits and starts are harmful. The housing bust is in the downward spiral of price declines and foreclosures. Single-family-home prices dropped 7.6 percent from the first quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2008, the largest year-over-year decline since the National Association of Realtors began reporting prices in 1982. Conservatively estimated, 2.2 million homes will enter foreclosure this year. An additional nine million homeowners -- those with zero or negative equity -- are considered at high risk of default because they have no cushion if recession or inflation, or both, make it impossible for them to keep current on their mortgages. 
 Theoretically, when prices fall, consumer demand should rise, sending prices back up again. Unquestioning belief in that self-correcting mechanism is the reason many Republicans don't want to do anything to prevent foreclosures. 
 But in many cities today, house-price declines are so severe that potential buyers are staying on the sidelines, fearful of further collapse. The result is declines that are deeper than need be to restore affordability. That's everyone's problem, because as long as house prices continue to fall, the financial system will remain unsettled and the economy will not revive. 
 And if house prices fall more than expected -- a peak-to-trough decline of 20 percent to 25 percent is the rough consensus, with the low point in mid-2009 -- financial losses and economic pain could extend well into 2011.
 That is because a category of risky adjustable-rate loans -- dubbed Alt-A, for alternative to grade-A prime loans -- is scheduled to reset to higher payments starting in 2009, with losses mounting into 2010 and 2011. Distinct from subprime loans, Alt-A loans were made to generally creditworthy borrowers, but often without verification of income or assets and on tricky terms, including the option to pay only the interest due each month. Some loans allow borrowers to pay even less than the interest due monthly, and add the unpaid portion to the loan balance. Every payment increases the amount owed. 
 In coming years, if price declines are in line with expectations, Alt-A losses are projected to total about $150 billion, an amount the financial system could probably absorb. But until investors are sure that price declines will hew to the consensus, the financial system will not regain a sure footing. And if declines are worse than expected, losses will also be worse and the turmoil in the financial system will resume. 
 There's a way to avert that calamity. It's called foreclosure prevention. There is no excuse for delay.

HEADLINE: Online Search Ads Faring Better Than Expensive Displays

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
In the past few years, Web publishers have made a big bet on booming online advertising revenues. But the economic slowdown may be throwing a wrench into those plans. 
 While search advertising remains strong, there are signs that the growth in online advertising -- particularly in more elaborate display ads -- is slowing down. In the past few weeks, major online-advertising players, like Yahoo and Time Warner, have posted mixed results. 
 And online publishers may be getting less money for the ad space they do sell. The prices paid for online ads bought through ad networks dropped 23 percent from March to April, according to PubMatic, an advertising-technology company in Palo Alto, Calif., that runs an online-pricing index. Large Web publishers fared the worst in PubMatic's study, with the prices they received through networks dropping 52 percent.
 These are only preliminary results, and the economy could turn around more quickly than anyone expected even a month ago. But, these numbers must be worrisome for Web portals, newspaper publishers and news media companies like CBS (which announced a $1.8 billion deal last week to buy CNet Networks) looking to expand their revenues from high-priced display advertising, like graphics-heavy banners and column ads. 
 ''The weakest form, the one that's most susceptible to a downturn -- and this is what we're seeing -- is display advertising,'' said Jeffrey Lindsay, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
 Display advertising at the network AOL declined 18 percent, to $191 million. AOL is owned by Time Warner, which reported results last month.
 ''We were not satisfied with the performance of display advertising on our owned and operated inventory, which declined compared to last year's first quarter,'' said Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner. (Mr. Bewkes blamed AOL itself, not the economy, for the company's poor performance.)
 The growth in online advertising is also slowing at The New York Times Company. In the most recent quarter, Internet ad revenues increased 16 percent. A year earlier, though, they were increasing at 20 percent.
 In late April, WebMD Health reissued its earnings guidance for the year, revising revenue to a range of $380 million to $395 million, from a range of $395 million to $415 million. The change reflected ''a recent shift toward shorter-term buying commitments in certain of its customers' consumer advertising purchases, which the company believes is driven by increased caution in the current business climate,'' WebMD Health said in a statement.
 At Weather.com, a similar wariness has arisen. New advertisers are looking to test their ads before committing.
 ''The new advertisers are more cautious about requiring some sort of proof or evidence that something is working,'' said Paul Iaffaldano, executive vice president and general manager of the Weather Channel Media Solutions. Existing clients, he said, are continuing to spend, just not at the same pace. 
 One area that remains strong is search ads. They are considered cheap and effective among marketers -- even in a potential recession -- and they are how Google makes the majority of its money. In the most recent quarter, Google had a profit of $1.31 billion on revenues of $5.19 billion. Its United States revenue was up 30 percent from last year. 
 Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, dismissed talk of concerns that the company would be affected by the slowdown. ''It's clear to us that we're well positioned for 2008 and beyond, regardless of the business environment that we find ourselves surrounded by,'' he said on a call with investors. 
 Yahoo, which last year revised its guidance because of a weakening display market, had a first quarter that beat the average analyst expectations, with revenues rising 9 percent, to $1.82 billion. Yahoo did not specify how much of that was fueled by search, which makes up a chunk of Yahoo's revenues, and how much was display. 
 Microsoft's advertising revenue, excluding its acquisition of aQuantive, an online-advertising company that Microsoft bought for $6 billion a year ago, grew by 29 percent, up from 23 percent in the quarter a year earlier. However, overall profit dropped by 11 percent, to $4.39 billion.
 Mr. Lindsay, of Sanford C. Bernstein, said that recession fears might actually help some media companies, as marketers move their budgets online. 
 ''In a moderate or even quite severe downturn, online advertising actually improves, because people switch their advertising budgets out of traditional advertising formats -- TV, radio and print -- and move more online because it's got higher performance, it's cheaper and it's more measurable,'' he said. 
 He also cautioned that such a boost would only go so far. ''If the downturn is so severe that advertisers stop advertising altogether, or face financial difficulties, then online is affected like everybody else,'' he added.
 Some of the ad dollars that in the past had been spent at portals are being spread around instead. Ad networks, which fan out ads to thousands of sites, are adding targeting and are signing up reputable sites, making them more attractive for advertisers. 
 ''There was a time when we would go out and buy inventory on the portals,'' said Quentin George, global head of digital media and strategic innovation at Universal McCann, which plans media for clients like L'Oreal and Sony. ''Portals make it easier for us to buy and place media on behalf of our clients. But as time continues and as analytics capabilities increase, you find that your media dollars can work better elsewhere across a range of different sites.''
 Michael Hayes, senior vice president and managing director for Initiative Interactive, which handles digital spending for clients like Home Depot and Bayer, said that advertisers might be turning away from broad buys and looking for more targeted campaigns on smaller sites.
 ''This is hurting the portals,'' he said. ''There are more options.''
 A bright spot for these publishers is, if the economy remains sluggish, they may convince marketers that have never spent money online that this tough economy is their chance.
 Cheryl Barre is one of those marketers. She arrived 18 months ago at the Arby's Restaurant Group as chief marketing officer, but did not introduce her first ad campaign until April of this year. By the time the campaign was supposed to begin on April 27, though, worry about a recession was mounting. 
 So Ms. Barre put together commercials offering deals on food. But she kept Arby's online piece of the campaign, marketing the company for the first time through a Yahoo homepage takeover and a Facebook page. 
 ''I'd hate to say we're late to the party, but we're getting our act together. For the first time, this year we allocated some significant resources to online media,'' Ms. Barre said. ''We haven't scaled back at all.'' 
 General Motors is continuing its big move of money from traditional advertising to online. ''We have been shifting more and more resources to digital and will continue to do so,'' said Betsy Lazar, executive director for advertising and media operations at General Motors. The company seems to be hurting from the economy -- it reported a quarterly loss of $3.3 billion in April. 
 A recession, she said, does affect a digital spend, but not by forcing a pullback.
 ''If you think about the fact that industry sales are down this year, year to date, and when you think about fewer people being in- market,'' she said, ''digital is even more important to be able to talk to those consumers who are in market.''

HEADLINE: Obama Draws Huge Crowd in Oregon as Clinton Courts Kentucky

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER and JULIE BOSMAN; Larry Rohter reported from Portland, and Julie Bosman from Bowling Green, Ky.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama drew the largest crowd of his campaign so far on Sunday, addressing an estimated 75,000 people who had gathered here on the banks of the Willamette River.
 ''Wow! Wow! Wow!'' were his first words as he surveyed the multitude, which included people in kayaks and small pleasure craft on the river on an unseasonably hot day in Oregon.
 It is ''fair to say this is the most spectacular setting for the most spectacular crowd'' of his campaign, he told the audience. His wife and daughters, who have been with him most of the weekend, joined him on the stage at the beginning of the event but left as he was about to speak. 
 Mr. Obama has been campaigning extensively in Oregon, a state he hopes to win in Tuesday's primary, as the Democratic presidential nominating race ticks down to its last handful of contests. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on a four-day swing through Kentucky, which also holds its primary on Tuesday and where she appears likely to draw the most votes.
 Mr. Obama stopped earlier at an ice cream parlor, Lew's Dari-Freeze and Drive In, in Milwaukie, a suburb of Portland. There, answering questions from reporters, he edged closer to declaring victory in the Democratic battle than has been his habit. He said he was returning to Iowa to await the results of the primaries on Tuesday night because ''we thought it was a terrific way to bring things full circle.''
 If things ''go as we hope,'' he said, ''then we think we will have a majority of pledged delegates at that point.'' That, he continued, would be ''a pretty significant mark.''
 While ''that does not mean we declare victory,'' Mr. Obama added, it puts him close and makes it easier for undecided and undeclared superdelegates to endorse him.
 In Kentucky, Mrs. Clinton's campaign events have had a simple feel, with speeches at street fairs, in parking lots or on the grassy lawns of college campuses. 
 ''She's doing what she needs to do,'' said Mo Elleithee, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, gesturing at the crowd gathered for a Sunday rally in western Kentucky. 
 Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she was staging a one-sided war for votes in the state.
 ''My opponent said the other day he wasn't coming back, so I've got the whole state to myself,'' Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday afternoon at an outdoor rally in Bowling Green. ''What a treat!''
 Oregon is one of the greenest states in the nation, in both the literal and political sense. As such, it is viewed as particularly receptive to Mr. Obama's promises ''to change politics'' in ways large and small.
 Mr. Obama played to those sentiments in his speech on Sunday afternoon, in which he criticized the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, at great length while virtually ignoring Mrs. Clinton. He again rejected a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax, criticizing Mr. McCain for supporting the idea while failing to mention that Mrs. Clinton has also endorsed it. 
 He denied, however, that he was effectively conceding Kentucky to his rival by focusing almost exclusively on the Oregon vote. ''I don't give up on things,'' he said at the ice cream parlor. ''We have got to make choices, and I can't be everywhere at once.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton has continued to make the case that she is a better candidate than Mr. Obama, delivering a stump speech in Bowling Green that highlighted many familiar points: that she will be ready on Day 1, will be a more capable commander in chief, and is more experienced in foreign policy matters. 
 ''I'm going to get to work as soon as I'm inaugurated to make sure that we do build a strong and prosperous middle class,'' she told a crowd at the Maker's Mark distillery in Loretto, Ky.
 And she has argued to audiences here that she is leading in the popular vote, based on a count that includes the elections in Florida and Michigan, whose votes were moved up in violation of Democratic Party rules. (Mr. Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan; neither candidate campaigned in Florida.) 
 ''I'll tell you where this race stands right now,'' Mrs. Clinton told a crowd in Mayfield on Sunday. ''Right now I am leading in the popular vote. More Americans have voted for me. And the states that I have won are states that a Democrat has to win to be elected in the fall.'' 
 But her planned attack on Mr. McCain in a speech on Saturday, which criticized his economic policy in unusually strident tones, failed to generate any response from his campaign. The Obama and McCain campaigns, meanwhile, continued to fire at each other over Social Security and foreign policy on Sunday in dueling memorandums to reporters. Talk about Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain also dominated the morning political shows.
 Mr. Obama spoke only briefly about Mrs. Clinton on Sunday, in remarks that were so magnanimous that he almost seemed to be speaking of her in the past tense.
 ''She has been a formidable candidate, smart and tough and determined,'' he said as some in the crowd applauded politely. ''She has worked as hard as she can. She has run an extraordinary campaign.''

Silicon Valley Likes Obama Proposal
 Senator Barack Obama's proposal that the federal government spend $150 billion over 10 years to promote alternative energy and create several million jobs has found receptive ears in Silcon Valley. 
 Mr. Obama reiterated the investment plan on Wednesday in a speech in Michigan, but his words reverberated in Silicon Valley, where the plan is being interpreted as a boon for the local economy.
 As part of his proposal, Mr. Obama pledges that, if president, he will invest $10 billion a year in a ''Clean Technologies Deployment Venture Capital Fund'' that would help finance companies involved in alternative energy.
 ''This is great news,'' said Josh Green, an alternative energy investor at Mohr Davidow Ventures, a venture firm. ''It would be an incredibly helpful thing for clean tech.''
 Daniel M. Kammen, an adviser to Mr. Obama on energy issues and the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, has said alternative energy investments could use support from the government if they are going to make a dent in the $3 trillion global energy market. Alternative energy solutions now represent a tiny fraction of that market.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is vying with Mr. Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination, has her own proposal for alternative energy. She would spend ''$150 billion on clean energy projects in the next decade, including $50 billion in a strategic energy fund,'' according to her campaign.
 It is no secret that Silicon Valley's venture capital investors are eager for government support for alternative energy. They say the playing field has favored oil, gas and coal concerns, and subsidies and government policy are necessary to level it.
 A thriving clean energy industry could also mean millions of new jobs -- which was why Mr. Obama introduced his proposal in Michigan, where workers have been battered by the troubles in the auto industry. MATT RICHTEL

HEADLINE: Where Industry Once Hummed, Urban Garden Finds Success

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Amid the tightly packed row houses of North Philadelphia, a pioneering urban farm is providing fresh local food for a community that often lacks it, and making money in the process.
 Greensgrow, a one-acre plot of raised beds and greenhouses on the site of a former steel-galvanizing factory, is turning a profit by selling its own vegetables and herbs as well as a range of produce from local growers, and by running a nursery selling plants and seedlings.
 The farm earned about $10,000 on revenue of $450,000 in 2007, and hopes to make a profit of 5 percent on $650,000 in revenue in this, its 10th year, so it can open another operation elsewhere in Philadelphia. 
 In season, it sells its own hydroponically grown vegetables, as well as peaches from New Jersey, tomatoes from Lancaster County, and breads, meats and cheeses from small local growers within a couple of hours of Philadelphia.
 The farm, in the low-income Kensington section, about three miles from the skyscrapers of downtown Philadelphia, also makes its own honey -- marketed as ''Honey From the Hood'' -- from a colony of bees that produce about 80 pounds a year. And it makes biodiesel for its vehicles from the waste oil produced by the restaurants that buy its vegetables. 
 Among urban farms, Greensgrow distinguishes itself by being a bridge between rural producers and urban consumers, and by having revitalized a derelict industrial site, said Ian Marvy, executive director of Added Value, an urban farm in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn.
 It has also become a model for others by showing that it is possible to become self-supporting in a universe where many rely on outside financial support, Mr. Marvy said.
 Mary Seton Corboy, 50, a former chef with a master's degree in political science, co-founded Greensgrow in 1998 with the idea of growing lettuce for the restaurants in downtown Philadelphia.
 Looking for cheap land close to their customers, Ms. Corboy and her business partner at the time, Tom Sereduk, found the site and persuaded the local Community Development Corporation to buy it and then rent it to them for $150 a month, a sum they still pay.
 They made an initial investment of $25,000 and have spent about $100,000 over the years on items that included the plastic-covered greenhouses and the soil that had to be trucked in to cover the steel-and-concrete foundation of the old factory site.
 ''The mission was: How do you take postindustrial land and turn it into some kind of green business?'' said Ms. Corboy, an elfin woman with the ruddy cheeks of someone who works long hours out of doors. 
 She approached her early lettuce-growing operation with conventional business goals and little thought for what an urban farm could achieve.
 ''I thought you didn't have to have a relationship with the community,'' she said. ''You would just be a business person.''
 Customers said the farm was a breath of fresh air in a gritty neighborhood.
 ''It's a little piece of heaven,'' said Janet McGinnis, 47, who lives on nearby Girard Avenue. ''We live in the city, and it makes me feel good to wake up and see flowers.''
 Ms. McGinnis said she could buy herbs, bread and produce elsewhere but did so at Greensgrow because it is part of the community. ''We've got to keep it in the community,'' she said. ''We have to give back.''
 Despite the community goodwill, the farm lives with urban problems like theft and violence. ''I have gone through every tool in the box eight or nine times,'' Ms. Corboy said.
 Although no one at Greensgrow is getting rich from the operation -- after 10 years' work, Ms. Corboy is making an annual salary of $65,000 -- there is a sense that their time has come.
 ''Ten years ago when I said we were going green, people thought we were out of our minds,'' Ms. Corboy said. ''Now we are top of the party list.''

HEADLINE: Economic Tide Is Rising For Repo Man

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: HARRISON TOWNSHIP, Mich. 

 BODY:
So many people have so many things they can no longer afford. This is an excellent time to be a repo man.
 When a boat owner defaults on his loan, the bank hires Jeff Henderson to seize its property. The former Army detective tracks the boat down in a backyard or a marina or a garage and hauls it to his storage area and later auctions it off. After nearly 20 years in the repossession business, Mr. Henderson has never been busier. 
 ''I used to take the weak ones,'' he said. ''Now I'm taking the whole herd.''
 Boating was traditionally the pastime of the well-off, but the long housing boom and its gusher of easy credit changed that. People refinanced their homes and used the cash for down payments on a cruiser, miniyacht or sailboat. From 2000 to 2006, retail sales for the recreational boating industry rose by more than 40 percent, to $39.5 billion, while the average loan amount more than tripled to $141,000. 
 Last year, as real estate faltered, the gears went into reverse. The number of boats sold fell 8 percent. Many boats are fuel hogs, and rising gasoline and diesel prices meant a weekend jaunt could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Owners found they could not sell a boat for what they owed and could not refinance either.
 The solution for some is simply to stop paying on Jersey Dreamin' or Just Do It or Bally Hoo. Then one day they come home and it is gone.
 Mr. Henderson's company, Harrison Marine, has seven employees as well as half a dozen part-timers, making it one of the largest boat repo operations in the country. The business usually slacks off in the spring as the boating season begins and delinquent owners try to fend off the bank long enough to have some fun.
 Not this year. Mr. Henderson, 48, is repossessing nearly a boat a day, most from the Great Lakes area but a few farther afield. He is looking for a man from the Bronx named Rocko, who told the bank his 34-foot cruiser was at a marina that does not exist. He is trying to get a Michigan woman to tell him where to find her husband's pontoon boat. 
 The bigger the boat, the harder to hide. A few miles from Mr. Henderson's office is a house that, even in depressed Michigan, would sell for a million dollars. Tied up on the canal in back, just visible from the street, is a 40-foot Silverton yacht. As Mr. Henderson surveyed the area the other day, something nagged at his memory. 
 Finally he remembered: ''I've taken this boat before.'' Owners of repossessed boats have a few weeks to redeem them, and this fellow had availed himself of the opportunity. Now, a few years later, he was in trouble again. Mr. Henderson shrugged. ''I took it before, I'll take it again. After I take it a few more times, he'll be eligible for a Christmas card. One guy, I took his boat four times.''
 Boat loans, like car loans, give the bank permission to recover its collateral in the case of default, which explains why a repo man can go into a yard without technically trespassing. Nevertheless, the custom is to get in and get out before the owners, neighbors or authorities notice anything amiss. 
 If the boat is in a marina, the pace is somewhat more leisurely. People delinquent on their boat loans also tend to be behind with their dock payments; since Mr. Henderson pays any overdue charges, most marinas are delighted to help him.
 In search of Toy Box, a 34-foot Donzi Express with green stripes, he called about two dozen marinas, finally finding it on the Detroit River. On a recent afternoon, he had it pulled out of winter storage.
 As soon as it was in the water, Mr. Henderson and his assistant, Larry McClelland, went through their set of master boat keys until one fit. Mr. McClelland fiddled with the engines, which were not in great repair. Tune-ups are another expense that the delinquent tend to avoid. 
 After about 15 minutes, Toy Box seemed seaworthy enough to start the 90-minute trip back to Harrison Marine. It was a nice day, but Mr. Henderson was not particularly enjoying himself. He is the sort of man who likes to travel under sail, not by motor. 
 ''Sailing is a pure sport,'' he said. ''It's you against the water, you against the wind. It's more pleasurable than sitting here bouncing down the lake.''
 No one grows up aspiring to be a repo man. Mr. Henderson got out of the Army in 1989, another year when the economy was uneasy. Unable to find a job in law enforcement, he followed a friend's recommendation into the repossession business.
 When he meets strangers and they ask what he does, he merely says he is in the marine industry. He has repossessed the boats of friends and one relative, a cousin. ''Somebody's got to do it,'' he said. ''Might as well be me.''
 Toy Box was rocketing up Lake St. Clair when Mr. Henderson's cellphone rang. It was the marina he had just left, saying the owner had shown up looking for his boat. He was now driving up to Harrison Marine.
 The possibility of violence shadows every repo man. ''Sometimes people have a bit of an attitude,'' Mr. Henderson said. He was seizing a pontoon boat from a yard in northern Michigan when a woman came out pointing a hunting rifle. Another time, an off-duty police officer pulled a gun, perhaps confusing the repo man with a thief.
 But when he steered Toy Box up to his dock, no fisticuffs ensued. Robert Dahmen, a lanky 49-year-old, was peaceful, even apologetic. He wanted to salvage whatever he could off the boat, and offered in return to detail its history to any possible buyers. Mr. Henderson was polite but distant. Hard-luck stories have ceased to interest him.
 Some people lose their house or their boat to abrupt setbacks: illness, job loss, divorce. Mr. Dahmen, who works as a technology manager for a car manufacturer, belongs to a second, probably larger group: he simply spent beyond his means. He is one of the millions of reasons the consumer-powered American economy did so well for most of this decade, and one of the reasons its prospects look so bleak now. 
 ''There's a certain sense of failure about all this, to tell you the truth,'' Mr. Dahmen said. ''There really is.''
 He originally bought a smaller, more affordable boat, but a salesman talked him into an upgrade. ''Oh yeah, I said, that would be cool.'' And it was: There were many pleasant cruises during the brief Michigan summers. 
 The merriment came at a price, though. Toy Box cost $175,000. With the trade-in and a down payment, Mr. Dahmen ended up with a $125,000 loan. ''You pay the interest up front,'' he observed, ''and the principal never goes down.'' After seven years he still owed $111,000, about twice what the boat is worth. Meanwhile, he lost his condominium when his mortgage readjusted and those payments went up. His 401(k) is down to $9,000. 
 ''I oversaturated myself with long-term debt,'' he said. ''It was a risk, a calculated risk. I obviously lost.'' He is declaring bankruptcy. 
 As soon as the Harrison Marine crew winched Toy Box out of the water, Mr. Dahmen boarded for the last time. He removed a wooden wine rack, life preservers, a case of Absopure water, paper plates, swizzle sticks and yachting shoes. His S.U.V. was soon full.
 From now on, Mr. Dahmen said, the consumer economy would have to get by without him. ''I have no intention of ever buying anything, ever,'' he said. ''I don't think I could if I wanted to.''
 Mr. Dahmen gave Toy Box a hug. ''O.K., I'm gonna go cry now,'' he said. He drove away without looking back. Mr. Henderson left, too. His house is about 15 miles away, inland. He used to live on the water, but it reminded him too much of work.

HEADLINE: House Conservatives to Offer Ideas for G.O.P. Message

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Conservative Republicans in the House plan to urge their colleagues to rally behind a new manifesto that mixes antispending initiatives and tighter restrictions on government benefits as the party seeks a fresh message after a string of election defeats.
 Leaders of the Republican Study Committee intend to use a closed-door party meeting on Tuesday to present a seven-point proposal calling for a constitutional limit on federal spending, a new simplified income tax alternative and a proposal to require recipients of food stamps or housing aid to meet work requirements.
 ''Clearly, we have been sobered by three special election losses in a row,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the group of more than 100 Republican lawmakers. ''We are sobered by the massive cash advantage that Democrats have to get their message out.'' 
 Mr. Hensarling said that getting off the political defensive would ''take unity, and it is going to take unity behind a handful of messages.''
 The proposal from the group of conservatives is likely to be just one of the ideas circulated at the session as Republicans look for ways to right themselves heading into what is promising to be a difficult election year. 
 The party leadership in the House has already begun to roll out its own agenda under the rubric ''The Change You Deserve,'' but some lawmakers have said the party needs to be more aggressive. Others are skeptical about overreacting to the elections or embracing too strong a conservative theme.
 A spokeswoman for Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 2 Republican in the House, said the leadership was open to constructive suggestions from lawmakers. 
 ''It's healthy and good for our members to weigh in and put forward ideas,'' said the spokeswoman, Antonia Ferrier. ''That's how we get the energy leading into November.''
 Several Republicans have said it is not their goal to force changes in the House leadership team. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said Sunday that he intended to remain in his position.
 Some of the ideas from the conservatives have been circulating for months, including an immediate moratorium on seeking money for the pet home-state projects known as earmarks. But other Republicans have rejected that idea, arguing it is a chief responsibility of representatives to win federal aid for local initiatives. 
 A draft of the conservative agenda calls for the endorsement of a constitutional amendment to prohibit federal spending from growing faster than the economy except in times of war or national emergency. The plan seeks support for an income tax overhaul that would provide a simplified flat tax and allow people to choose between it and the current system.
 The conservative proposal seeks tax credits for buying health insurance, more domestic energy production and a streamlined terrorist surveillance program. The draft also said that House Republicans should extend existing welfare work requirements to food stamps and housing assistance ''so that those who are not old, young or disabled are either working in the private sector or serving in their community.''
 Mr. Hensarling said his group was emphasizing fiscal policy because polls and recent electoral experience showed that voters viewed Republicans as having strayed too far from the party's tradition on spending restraint. That approach could also mesh with the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona, the party's presumed nominee, who has made his opposition to excessive federal spending a central theme.
 ''We have to get back to our core identity,'' Mr. Hensarling said, adding that ''there is work to be done.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Few pieces of legislation generate the level of public scorn consistently heaped upon the farm bill. 
 Presidents and agriculture secretaries denounce it. Editorial boards rail against it. Good-government groups mock it. Global trading partners formally protest it. Even farmers gripe about it. 
 But as Congress proved again last week, few pieces of major legislation also get such overwhelming bipartisan support -- enough, in the case of the current farm bill, to override the veto expected by President Bush any day now. The Senate vote on Thursday, 81 to 15, was the widest margin for a farm bill since 1973, when food stamps were added. 
 While most of the complaints are directed at Congress for squandering an opportunity to revamp farm subsidies when crops are at record-high prices, the sweeping 673-page bill touches on so many other issues of enormous importance to lawmakers and their constituents, rural and urban alike, that many say it is no longer accurate to call it the ''farm bill.'' 
 Amid high food prices, it increases spending on food stamps and other nutrition programs, sealing the support of urban lawmakers. It aids fruit and vegetable growers for the first time, attracting votes from California, Florida and Michigan. 
 High gasoline prices added urgency to the bill's creation of a subsidy for ethanol made from prairie grass and other plant matter with strong backing from Minnesota lawmakers who see economic opportunity for parts of the state that do not grow corn.
 The bill also helps the dairy industry that is crucial to New England milk producers and the sugar beet farmers concentrated in the Dakotas. It sets up a disaster fund sought by Senator Max Baucus of Montana, among others, and appeals to cattlemen in Kansas, Nebraska and Texas by adjusting country-of-origin labeling rules for meat and produce. 
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, emphasized the abundance of reasons for lawmakers to vote for the bill, even as critics derided its subsidies as an unconscionable giveaway of taxpayer money at a time of booming profits for many farmers. ''I, too, am not satisfied that it does enough in terms of subsidies, but I want to talk about what it does do,'' Ms. Pelosi said, adding, ''If there was one reason for members to vote for this bill, it would be the nutrition piece of it, but there are other reasons as well.''
 Indeed. 
 Millions of Americans, for instance, will see slight increases in their food stamp benefits and about 100,000 families will now be able to deduct child care costs from their income and qualify for substantial increases in food stamps, averaging $40 a month. 
 The bill also provides a big increase for food banks and other emergency food distributors, $250 million a year up from $140 million. The bill raises foreign food aid, creates a healthy-snack program for schoolchildren, and increases spending on land conservation and rural development. 
 And there is a provision that will benefit endangered species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker in Georgia. In addition, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, inserted a tax break for racehorse owners, and Ms. Pelosi, of California, added $170 million for the struggling Pacific salmon industry at the request of West Coast Democrats. 
 ''It is no wonder that nutrition groups, food bank organizations, conservation and wildlife groups, commodity organizations, cattlemen and ranchers, renewable-energy advocates and specialty-crop producers have all united in strong support of this farm bill,'' said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the senior Republican on the agriculture committee. ''Given the amount of investments in the many critical areas to all Americans in this bill, it is actually inaccurate to simply call this a farm bill.'' 
 Of the bill's $307 billion cost over five years, as projected by the Congressional Budget Office, $35 billion is for commodity programs, including crop subsidies, while $209 billion is for programs to feed the poor. ''That's why we talk about this being a food bill,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, the agriculture committee chairman. 
 Critics say lawmakers should have slashed the $5 billion a year in so-called direct payments disbursed based on acreage, regardless of market conditions or even if the land is farmed. 
 Mr. Bush has denounced the bill as bloated and expensive, filled with gimmicks that hide its true cost. He has complained that it will continue providing overly generous subsidies to farmers when high grain prices and bountiful profits make the payments impossible to justify. 
 The president has also said that the bill does not do enough to limit subsidy payments to wealthy farmers or owners of farmland. Mr. Bush had called for government farm payments to be limited to those with incomes of no more than $200,000. The bill approved by Congress sets a limit of $750,000 in farm income and $500,000 in nonfarm income. 
 ''You need a few members of Congress here to stand up today and say the emperor has no clothes,'' Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in last week's debate. ''It's more status quo.''
 Mr. Kind added: ''The president is right. We ought not be giving taxpayer subsidies to wealthy individuals at a time of record-high commodity prices in the marketplace.'' 
 Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said: ''Sometimes here in Washington, we tend to drink our own bath water and believe our own press releases. And to hear some of the debate here, you would think this is the best bill in the world and that everybody out there has just got to support it.'' 
 Supporters of the farm bill insist that substantial improvements were made this year.
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said in a speech that the White House had refused to acknowledge major improvements in the subsidy programs. ''We have heard the critics say there is no reform, no reform in this bill,'' Mr. Conrad said. ''That is the biggest fiction of all.'' 
 Mr. Conrad and other proponents noted that the law now contained no limit on farm income and allowed individuals with up to $2.5 million in nonfarm income to qualify for subsidy programs. They pointed to new provisions that clearly identify who is receiving subsidy payments and that close a loophole to prevent individuals who own multiple farm entities from exceeding limits on payments. 
 Supporters also praised a new program that allows farmers to give up some direct payments in exchange for a crop insurance program that will provide greater assistance should commodity prices decline sharply. And they noted that the bill made a slight, across-the-board cut in direct payments. ''Facts are stubborn things,'' Mr. Conrad said. 
 Experts disagree about whether this bill makes advances. 
 ''I think it's really hard to look at this farm bill and say the status quo won,'' said Carl Zulauf, professor of agriculture marketing and policy at Ohio State University. '' I think there are meaningful changes throughout the farm bill.'' 
 Ken Cook, the president of Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that is a fierce critic of farm subsidies, said the status quo was exactly what taxpayers got in the bill. ''If you are not going to make these changes now, when on earth are you going to make them?'' Mr. Cook asked. ''It really is shocking that they did so little.''
 He added: ''It's a measure of the pressure this bill can put on people. If you are from subsidy country, you are expected to bring home the bacon.'' 
 Mr. Cook andother critics say that fruit and vegetable growers, long ignored by the farm bill, settled for way too little. Supporters say a new section dedicated to growers of fruits, vegetables and other specialty crops is a major achievement, even if they get less money than they had hoped. 
 The expanding reach of the bill is partly why it took lawmakers far longer to finish than they expected -- driving many lawmakers and their staffs to exhaustion. The protracted toil over the legislation prompted Representative Collin C. Peterson, the Minnesota Democrat who leads the House Committee on Agriculture, to declare at the close of debate, ''We'll appreciate a good vote to get this over with.'' And he got it.

HEADLINE: Index Implies Slowdown May Prove A Short One

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators rose in April for a second month, the first back-to-back gain since October 2006, suggesting that the current slowdown will be short-lived. 
 The index, compiled by the Conference Board, increased 0.1 percent, better than forecast and matching the gain in March, the group said Monday. The measure points to the direction of the economy over the next three to six months.
 ''The message on the economy is that activity is soft but not moving down sharply,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. ''The economy is muddling along.''
 The index was forecast to be unchanged, according to the median estimate of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The increase in March was the first gain since September.
 ''The small increases in the leading index in both March and again in April could be a signal that the economy may not weaken further,'' Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said in a statement.
 Six of the 10 indicators in the report contributed to the gain in the index, led by rising stock prices and a widening spread between the Fed's benchmark interest rate and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, also known as the yield curve. 
 A slump in consumer expectations about the economy and a decline in manufacturing hours were among the components that restrained the index.

HEADLINE: Rising Food Prices Sharpen a European Debate

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
The recent sharp rise in global food prices added an element Monday to the long-running debate over farm subsidies in the European Union, with some government ministers seeing a new reason to dismantle the multibillion-euro payouts and defenders countering that the system was needed more than ever. 
 At a meeting in Brussels, countries led by France emphasized the need to keep certain subsidies paid directly to farmers in return for producing staples like meat. 
 ''The solution to the crisis is not, first of all, through free trade,'' the French agriculture minister, Michel Barnier, said in rejecting the market position promoted by countries like Britain and Denmark as a response to rising food prices. 
 Mr. Barnier said that the food crisis highlighted the need for Europe's so-called Common Agricultural Policy, or CAP, which he called a cornerstone of the Continent's food security. And he suggested exporting the model to promote food security in other parts of the world, including developing areas like North Africa, where neighboring countries could help one another in the same way European nations do. 
 But other countries, like Britain, argued for allowing markets a greater role in influencing what is grown in Europe, and against back-tracking on cuts agreed upon in years past. 
 ''If anyone argued it should return to where it was previously, that would be a mistake,'' Hilary Benn, the British agriculture minister, said, referring to the agricultural policy. 
 During the meeting, ministers discussed channeling more foreign aid to help developing countries improve their agricultural output. Some ministers also underlined the importance of developing fuels from agricultural waste to reduce demand for low-carbon fuels from crops, which could also be used for food. 
 But, if anything, the rise in commodity prices has sharpened arguments on both sides about the future of farm policy, setting the scene for a divisive debate over the future of the 100 billion euro ($155 billion) budget -- and over the agricultural policy in particular, which is worth more than 40 percent of that amount -- later this year. 
 ''Views are diverging as to the line to be taken with regard to the CAP in the future,'' the agriculture minister of Slovenia, Iztok Jarc, said. He added that the situation was complex because of the diverse causes of high commodity prices. 
 Linked to Europe's reluctance to overhaul its system more thoroughly is the logjam over agriculture at the World Trade Organization, where negotiations for a new global trade accord have repeatedly stalled. So long as American farm support remains in place, Europe would be unlikely to alter its existing system. Last week, American lawmakers generally confirmed continuation of the present system. 
 Minor changes to the European farm subsidy system will be presented Tuesday by the European Commission, the union's executive arm. 
 The commission will propose abolishing the so-called set-aside -- which requires some land to be kept out of production -- as well as a special subsidy of 45 euros a hectare (2.5 acres), now given to farmers to grow crops for biofuels. 
 The commission also will propose annual increases in milk production quotas ahead of the planned abolition of the quota system in 2015. And it will call for a ceiling on payments, reducing those given to such big landowners as the queen of England, in a move opposed by Britain and Germany, two nations that would lose most from such a move. 
 Europe's agricultural policy arose after World War II, when a scarred Western Europe sought to rebuild its crippled farming infrastructure and guarantee food supplies. A half-century later, new member countries like Hungary and promarket members like Britain argue that radical changes in the global marketplace mean agriculture has become much more profitable and sustainable and that the need for state subsidies is largely outdated. 
 But Germany and France are arguing that the rise in food prices means subsidies should continue, with funds being diverted to revive investment in Europe's farming sector to ensure steady and affordable supplies. 
 The differences were magnified last week, when Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, sent a letter to colleagues appealing for changes to allow farmers to react more to demand. 
 He said it was ''unacceptable, that at a time of significant food price inflation, Europe continues to apply very high import tariffs to many agricultural commodities.'' 
 In the longer term he said Europe should end direct payments, worth 32 billion euros each year to farmers. 
 The rising price of foodstuffs has been attributed largely to the rising cost of crude oil and natural gas, which in turn raises the cost of nitrogen fertilizer -- a critical item for farmers. 
 Other immediate factors are the rising costs of land and shipping, and the effect of poor harvests. 
 Jonathan Blake, the manager of an agriculture fund begun Monday by Barings Asset Management in London, said that rising prices are also part of long-term population growth, increasing incomes in India and China, and climate change. 
 ''Pressure on food prices is immense,'' Mr. Blake said. ''Limited resources and bottlenecks mean that supply is struggling to keep pace with demand whilst global warming is likely to create additional pressure on supply in the years to come.'' 
 The European agriculture commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel sought to ease fears about the economic impact of rising food prices in her comments Monday to agriculture ministers. She said global food prices were likely to decline, after recent record highs in such crucial areas as grain and dairy, as supplies of basic commodities slowly began to increase. 
 Even though adverse weather in many regions over several seasons had hurt supplies, the situation now seemed to be returning to normal and was set to take some pressure off prices, she said. Even so, she conceded that higher food prices were not temporary.
 ''Prices are likely to fluctuate in the medium term around a level that is higher than what we have seen in recent decades,'' she said. ''But we do not think that the record levels reached in recent months are likely to persist.''

HEADLINE: Landmark Hotel Among Sites Seen as in Peril

BYLINE: By SARAH ABRUZZESE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When it opened in 1956, the Statler Hilton Hotel in Dallas was a marvel of modern architecture, its size a tribute to imagination and a booming economy. Now it stands empty, another white elephant on the American landscape.
 On Tuesday, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a private nonprofit organization, will announce that the Statler Hilton and 10 other sites have made its 2008 list of the country's most endangered historic places.
 ''Historic buildings in cities all over the country, they are being changed and destroyed,'' said the trust's president, Richard Moe, noting that scores of other sites could have been added to the list. 
 The Statler was chosen because it represents an important moment in the history of Dallas, a time of growth and success, the trust said. Buildings of midcentury modern design are at risk of demolition around the country. The Statler, designed by William Tabler, was the first glass-and-steel hotel in America.
 The City of Dallas is hoping that the designation will bring attention to the building's plight and attract a buyer for the building, which is owned by a corporation based in the British Virgin Islands, Hamsher International Limited. But any renovation could be complicated by environmental issues, and potential buyers might be put off by the city's razing of a parking structure across the street to install a park. 
 The city says that it is willing to help the buyer, and that the park gives greater prominence to the building. Thomas Keen, a lawyer for the corporation that owns the building, said the hotel was for sale but doubted that the designation would draw buyers. 
 The trust's list also includes the Lower East Side of New York, whose historic character is imperiled by development, and a neighborhood in Buffalo that dates to the 1850s, Peace Bridge, where as many as 100 homes and businesses face demolition so the Department of Homeland Security can increase the size of a plaza at the Canadian border.
 Also on the list is the Sumner School in Topeka, Kan., the all-white school that excluded a black student, leading to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. The list also includes Charity Hospital in New Orleans and its adjacent neighborhood, along with Boyd Theatre, the last of the Art Deco movie palaces in Philadelphia. 
 The California state park system is making the list because decades of budget cuts have left it in grave danger, the trust said. Even though Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said last week that he would not follow through on a plan to cut 10 percent from the state parks budget, the system is still in danger, said Elizabeth Goldstein, the president of the California State Parks Foundation.
 Completing the list are Great Falls Portage in Montana; Hangar 1 at Moffett Field in Santa Clara County, Calif.; the Michigan Avenue street wall in Chicago; and Vizcaya and Bonnet House in Florida.
 The trust's annual designations, which began in 1988, do not confer any legal protection. And though the future of many of the places is uncertain, only 7 of the more than 200 sites listed over the last 20 years have been lost.
 ''There is a cost to every loss,'' Mr. Moe, the trust president, said. ''We don't argue that every old building should be saved, but the purpose is to illustrate the most important kinds of structure or sites that can and should be saved.''

HEADLINE: Let's Be Serious

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The general election is about to unfold and we'll soon see how smart or how foolish Americans really are. The U.S. may be the richest country on earth, but the economy is tanking, its working families are in trouble, it is bogged down in a multitrillion-dollar war of its own making and the price of gasoline has nitwits siphoning supplies from the cars and trucks of strangers.
 Four of every five Americans want the country to move in a different direction, which makes this presidential election, potentially, one of the most pivotal since World War II. 
 And yet there's growing evidence that despite the plethora of important issues, the election may yet be undermined by the usual madness -- fear-mongering, bogus arguments over who really loves America, race-baiting, gay-baiting (Ohmigod! They're getting married!) and the wholesale trivialization of matters that are not just important, but extremely complex.
 In his book, ''Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed?,'' Jared Bernstein reminds us that the economic expansion from 2000 to 2006 was something less than nirvana for working people. The economy grew by 15 percent during that period, and the official rates of joblessness and inflation were low. But as most of us know, the benefits of that expansion were skewed to the high end of the economic ladder.
 Mr. Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, writes: ''Over the course of this highly touted economic expansion, poverty is up, working families' real incomes are down and some key prices are growing a lot faster than the average.''
 Steven Greenhouse, the labor correspondent for The Times, has also written a book that examines, among other things, the imbalance in the way the benefits from the expansion have been distributed. In ''The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker,'' he says:
 ''This is a decade during which the American economy has thrived by many measures, with corporate profits and C.E.O. salaries soaring, yet wages have languished for most workers, and health and pension coverage has grown worse.''
 Let the candidates wrestle with this issue of increasing economic inequality, rather than President Bush's spurious and deeply offensive rant comparing advocates of international diplomacy with those who appeased Hitler and the Nazis.
 Let the candidates wrestle with the war without end in Iraq that is not just destroying lives but is taking a toll on this nation's soul. The war is sapping the resources and energy needed for the hard work of putting the U.S. back on a sound socioeconomic footing.
 And the way we are treating the troops belies the pretty words that never get farther than a bumper sticker.
 The country that professes to be so proud of its men and women in uniform is playing Russian roulette with their lives by sending them into the war zone for three, four and even more tours. Stop-loss, the involuntary extension of an individual's term in the military (making them subject to still more combat duty), is another dangerous affront to those who have already given so much.
 The Houston Chronicle did a long takeout on Sunday on the suicide in March 2007 of an Army recruiting sergeant, Nils Aron Andersson -- just one day after his marriage to Carry Walton. Sgt. Andersson, 25, had spoken of the many horrors that he had encountered in Iraq and was deeply depressed. He shot himself while sitting in his pickup in a parking garage. Distraught, Ms. Walton bought a 9-millimeter handgun at a sporting goods store the next day and killed herself.
 Suicides have become a big problem for the military. Combat does terrible things to people. An independent study by the RAND Corporation found that nearly 20 percent of the troops who returned from tours in Iraq or Afghanistan reported symptoms of major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.
 Let the candidates talk about these things. Let them talk about the fact that the Bush administration, which has pushed the troops so unmercifully, opposes a bill (sponsored by Senator Jim Webb and widely supported in Congress) that would expand the education benefits of veterans who have served since Sept. 11, 2001.
 Let them talk about health coverage, which is a scandal, and the vanishing American pension. Let them offer competing plans for rebuilding the American infrastructure and creating real employment opportunities for the newest generation of workers. Let them go at it over energy policy.
 Forget the foolishness for a change. No Willie Hortons this year. No Swift boats. No attacks on John McCain like the mugging he endured at the hands of the Bush crowd in South Carolina some years ago.
 For once, let the election be serious. Show the hacks and the hypocrites the door. Argue substance. And then let the people decide.

HEADLINE: Myanmar to Widen Neighbors' Aid Role

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS and ALAN COWELL; Seth Mydans reported from Bangkok, and Alan Cowell from Paris. Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations.

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
Myanmar agreed Monday to let its Southeast Asian neighbors help coordinate foreign relief assistance for cyclone victims, bending somewhat to international pressure to allow more outside aid, Singapore's foreign minister, George Yeo, said. 
 But the supply of aid and the entry of relief workers from countries outside the Southeast Asian bloc will continue to be limited, he said. 
 ''We will establish a mechanism so that aid from all over the world can flow into Myanmar,'' Mr. Yeo said, speaking at an emergency meeting in Singapore of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, which includes Myanmar. 
 ''Myanmar is also prepared to accept the expertise of international and regional agencies to help in its rehabilitation efforts,'' he said at a news conference. Referring to the continuing limits on help from countries outside Southeast Asia, he said, ''We have to look at specific needs -- there will not be uncontrolled access.'' 
 Since the cyclone, which struck Myanmar on May 3, Western nations and major relief groups have expressed alarm about Myanmar's refusal to allow in large-scale shipments to the estimated 2.5 million survivors in need of aid.
 Myanmar has permitted a small flow of aid from several nations, including the United States. But relief officials say that this amounts to only 20 percent of the needed supplies. Without more aid, they say, many more people may yet die of disease and starvation. 
 International pressure continued to build on Monday from several directions, with the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, warning that the ruling junta could be guilty of ''crimes against humanity'' if it continued to restrict the supply of aid into the country. 
 However, despite the international criticism, Myanmar's foreign minister, Nyan Win, was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters that there had been no delay in accepting aid. ''We always welcomed international aid,'' he said.
 The government said Monday that beginning Tuesday, flags would be lowered as part of a three-day mourning period for the victims of the cyclone.
 After failing to receive a reply to letters and telephone calls made to the military junta, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations was due to travel to Yangon, Myanmar's main city, this week in hopes of meeting the country's leader, Senior Gen. Than Shwe. 
 On Sunday, state-run television broadcast the first public video images of the general since the cyclone, showing him meeting ministers involved in the rescue effort and touring some affected areas. 
 The United Nations under secretary for humanitarian affairs, John Holmes, toured the Irrawaddy Delta region by helicopter on Monday, according to Michele Montas, Mr. Ban's spokeswoman. 
 Mr. Yeo, the foreign minister, said Asean would work with the United Nations at the conference in Yangon on Sunday to coordinate aid deliveries. He said Myanmar had agreed to allow in medical teams from any of its nine neighbors in Asean. Thailand has already sent a contingent of more than 30 medical workers. 
 In addition, Myanmar has allowed in 50 medical workers from India. China's official news agency, Xinhua, reported that a team of 50 Chinese medics arrived in Yangon on Sunday night. 
 Mr. Yeo said the Myanmar government estimated losses at $10 billion in the cyclone, which swept through the Irrawaddy Delta and Yangon. 
 Myanmar has raised its official death toll to 78,000. The United Nations and the Red Cross estimate that the toll is more than 100,000, and that it might be as high as 138,000. 
 Representatives of United Nations relief agencies said that some of their supplies were getting into Myanmar but that the authorities were still severely limiting delivery and withholding many visas from foreign relief experts. 
 The United Nations World Food Program said it had managed to deliver food aid to just 212,000 of the 750,000 people it thinks are most in need. 
 The United States and France have naval vessels just outside Myanmar's territorial waters, and are prepared to deliver supplies directly to affected areas along the coast, but they have not received clearance from the government. 
 In a column in the French newspaper Le Monde, Mr. Kouchner said the United Nations should intervene by force, or would be guilty of cowardice in the eyes of the world. 
 ''What we need to bring is hand-to-hand, heart-to-heart help, not donor conferences with all their bowing and scraping,'' he said later in an interview with French radio. ''In the meantime, people are dying.'' 
 Mr. Yeo rejected the idea of delivery by force. ''That will create unnecessary complication,'' he said at the news conference. ''It will only lead to more suffering for Myanmar's people.''
 On Saturday, Myanmar's powerful neighbor and ally, China, said other countries must show ''due respect'' to Myanmar in its handling of the disaster within its borders. 
 ''Myanmar is a sovereign country,'' Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said at a briefing. ''In the end, rescue and relief work will have to rely on the Myanmar government and people.''

 IRAQI RAID UNEARTHS CACHE OF ARMS
 In Mosque Northwest of Sadr City
 Iraqi troops uncovered a large cache of arms in a raid on a Baghdad mosque amid signs that Shiite militants had stepped up their attacks outside Sadr City. ''The size of the cache in such an obvious place says that this group was not afraid of the Iraqi security forces in their area,'' said Maj. Brian North, who leads the American military team advising the Iraqi Army's 42nd Brigade. PAGE A15 
 FRANCE CONFIRMS HAMAS CONTACTS
 France confirmed that it had been engaged in contacts with the leaders of Hamas, the radical Islamic group that is running Gaza, to try to better understand its positions. The Bush administration, which recently likened talks with Hamas to appeasement of the Nazis, quickly criticized the French. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian president. PAGE A6 
 U.S. INTRUSION ON VENEZUELAN AIR
 The Venezuelan defense minister said that an American fighter plane violated Venezuelan airspace over the weekend, prompting the government in Caracas to summon the United States ambassador to explain the incident. ''We believe this action to be deliberate on the part of the North America Navy,'' the Venezuelan defense minister said. A State Department spokesman said the incident was a navigational error. PAGE A6 
 MOMENT OF SILENCE AFTER PANIC
 China observed an official period of silence to mourn the tens of thousands of earthquake victims. The silence followed a night of panic as thousands of people trying to evacuate the capital city of Sichuan Province by car became mired in gridlock after provincial television issued a warning of the possibility of a severe aftershock. Others gathered blankets and rushed outside to sleep on the street or in parks. PAGE A12 
 MYANMAR AGREES TO SOME AID
 Myanmar agreed to let its Southeast Asian neighbors help coordinate foreign relief assistance for cyclone victims, bending somewhat to international pressure to allow more outside aid, Singapore's foreign minister said. But the supply of aid and the entry of relief workers from countries outside the Southeast Asian bloc would continue to be limited. ''We will establish a mechanism so that aid from all over the world can flow into Myanmar,'' Singapore's foreign minister said. PAGE A10

 PHILADELPHIA TO FIRE OFFICERS 
 Involved in Taped Beating
 Four Philadelphia police officers will be fired after they were caught on video beating suspects in a drug-related triple shooting, and three others will be suspended. The city's police commissioner said he did not know why the officers responded the way they did, but said that emotions were running high after the shooting death of a police sergeant two days earlier. The men who were beaten are in custody on attempted murder, assault and firearms charges. PAGE A16 
 A NEW LIST OF ENDANGERED SITES
 The Statler Hilton Hotel in Dallas was a massive emblem of architectural imagination and a booming postwar economy. It is empty now, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a private nonprofit organization, plans to add it to its latest list of the country's most endangered historic places. The list includes the Lower East Side in New York, whose historic character is being threatened by development, and the Sumner School in Topeka, Kan., the all-white school that excluded a black student, leading to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. PAGE A18 
 A NEW LOOK AT 'CRISIS FOR BOYS'
 In 1992, the American Association of University Women issued a report that said that girls were shortchanged in classroom, which set off a national debate over sex equity. The same group is now focusing on the ''boys' crisis,'' or what they say is the lack thereof. In a new report, the organization says that girls' gains in the classroom have not come at the expense of boys, and that the largest disparities in educational achievement are not between boys and girls, but between those of different races, ethnicities and income levels. PAGE A17 
 G.O.P. LAWMAKERS RECAST PITCH
 Following a string of election defeats, conservative Republicans in the House are trying to get off the defensive by issuing a seven-point plan intended to present a fresh message to voters. The proposal includes calling for a constitutional limit on federal spending, a simplified income tax alternative and a proposal to require recipients of food stamps or housing aid to meet work requirements. ''We have to get back to our core identity,'' one Republican lawmaker said. ''Cleary there is work to be done.'' PAGE A21

 THE NEURONS ARE ALIVE
 With the Sound of Music
 Dr. Claudius Conrad believes so much in the power of music as a healing tool that he recently published a provocative paper that said music may exert healing and sedative effects by stimulating a growth hormone generally associated with stress. That led him to wonder if Mozart, who was always battling one ailment or another, composed soothing music in part to make himself feel better. PAGE D1 
 OF RHESUS AND REESE'S CUPS
 A laboratory full of rhesus monkeys found that females lower in the pecking order eat less than their social superiors. (Scientists think it's because of stress.) But when given a banana-flavored pellet -- the monkey equivalent of a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream -- the normally less-hungry females kept going back for more, while their social superiors did not. ''Essentially, eating high-calorie foods becomes a coping strategy to deal with daily life events for an individual in a difficult social situation,'' one researcher said. PAGE D1 
 A TENSE FEW MINUTES FOR NASA
 NASA's Phoenix Lander was launched in August of last year, and has traveled 422 million miles to its final destination. The space agency expects it to touch down Sunday in the unexplored northern regions of Mars. There is, however, the not-insignificant issue of actually landing the craft in one piece: it will hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,750 miles an hour, with friction heating its shield to 2,600 Fahrenheit. PAGE D3 
 RETHINKING THE SENIOR MOMENT
 When older people forget the name of a person they met at a party, it often gets chalked up to the mental decline that attends aging. But several studies suggest that the older brain is actually reconfiguring itself to process new information more efficiently. ''It may be that distractibility is not, in fact, a bad thing,'' a psychology researcher said. ''It may increase the amount of information available to the conscious mind.'' PAGE D5

 WHEN GOING TO THE MAILBOX 
 Is Just Too Taxing
 Netflix, the company that popularized DVD rentals by mail, is teaming with a start-up company in California called Roku to begin marketing a $99 device that will allow the service's subscribers to play movies and shows on their televisions instantly, for no charge beyond their monthly subscription fee. The device has hurdles, including limited selection and competition from cable and satellite companies. PAGE C3
 TROUBLE IN HIGH PLACES
 DayJet, a company that used small jets for short-haul, on-demand service, was poised to expand. Then the credit crisis hit, expansion was put off, and the company laid off 100 of its 260 workers. ''All of the metrics are wonderful,'' the company's founder said. ''We're getting repeat buys. We're getting people buying at the price points we want. But we haven't been able to raise the capital.'' PAGE C1
 BUFFETT'S EUROPEAN SHOPPING SPREE
 Warren E. Buffett, the investor whose words are treated by Wall Street like revealed truth, announced in Frankfurt that he was headed to Europe to buy some family-owned business. Two hundred reporters showed up, wondering in which countries he was looking. He said that he wished the dollar was stronger against the euro, before adding ''you want to fish in a pond where the fish are, and Europe is a much better pond.'' PAGE C3 
 QUIET PLEASE. WE'RE BRITISH.
 Britain's Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice, which lays down the rules for the advertising industry, adopted a new rule that said television commercials should not be ''excessively noisy or strident.'' In theory, violators could be sanctioned by the country's media regulators, but that rarely happens. There's always the mute button. PAGE C7 
 NEW YORK REPORT 
 COMPANY TO SALVAGE PLAN
 To Develop West Side Railyards
 Less than two weeks after the collapse of a billion-dollar deal to develop the railyards on Manhattan's Far West Side, a new developer, Related Companies, has agreed to salvage the plan. The chief executive of the company signed an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to develop 12 million square feet of office towers, apartment buildings and parks over the 26-acre railyards.

 UNIQUE TEST FOR BUILDING INSPECTORS
 When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office, he promised to reform the Department of Buildings, a 116-year-old institution plagued by corruption and accused of incompetence. Despite some progress, a recent spate of fatal construction accidents led to the resignation of the buildings commissioner. The Bloomberg administration has now pledged to hire 63 more building inspectors, who face prodigious challenges. PAGE C11

 WILLIS E. LAMB JR., 94
 His discovery of a minor discrepancy in quantum theory helped earn him a share of the 1955 Nobel Prize, and led to the rethinking of quantum mechanics. The discrepancy -- which became known as the Lamb shift -- was one of the first direct experimental signs that empty space is not empty. PAGE C13

 Really Is Rocket Science
 Chuck Bower is an astrophysicist at the University of Indiana who has spent years developing a football coach's personnel decisions and close calls. The program costs ''in the six figures,'' but so far he and his partners have found no takers. ''I think a lot of these teams and coaches form opinions based on memories that statistically are not significant,'' he said. Easy for him to say: he doesn't have to answer to fans or team owners if a call backfires. PAGE C14 
 FROM LEGEND TO GROWN-UP
 Lamar Odom was once considered New York's best homegrown basketball talent since Lew Alcindor. But his career has been marked by assorted misfortunes and scandals, including allegations that he took money from college recruiters and the death of his infant son. But Odom, whose story is part cautionary, part inspirational, has had a breakthrough year with the Los Angeles Lakers. ''From now on,'' he said, ''every game is the biggest game of my life.''

 RUNNER GETS ANOTHER CHANCE
 Oscar Pistorius was denied a chance to run in the coming Olympic Summer Games after an athletic governing body ruled that he had an advantage: his artificial curved feet. But an arbitration panel overturned the ban, saying that the governing body had not sufficiently proved its case. ''It feels better to be on the side of hope and opportunity -- particularly since the three-person arbitration team backed it up, unanimously,'' George Vecsey writes. PAGE C15

 SIX YEARS LATER,
 R. Kelly Trial to Begin
 Remember the R. Kelly criminal trial? The trial over the R&B singer's alleged videotaping of himself having had sex with a 13-year-old girl has been delayed almost six years, giving Mr. Kelly ample time to tour and write a bizarre, sprawling 18-part (so far) opus about unfaithful lovers. But the trial itself has its own oddities, including the fact that the girl who is reported to be on the video is now an adult, and maintains that she is not on the tape. PAGE B1 
 TOUGH STUFF FOR DAD TO CHEW ON
 The western is nearly as old as the medium of film, and had already been through several cycles of boom and bust by the time ''The Big Trail,'' the visionary movie starring John Wayne, made its debut in 1930. Just in time for Father's Day, movie studios are releasing DVDs of some classic westerns (and others less so) that trace the arc of the western through the '50s, the genre's aesthetic and cultural height.

 NOT LETTING HIM DISAPPEAR
 Carl Brenner was dying of cancer, and when he died he wanted to vanish without a trace. He rid himself of all his possessions and attempted to trash any personal effects. But his sister, Marie Brenner, wrote a memoir of his life nonetheless, and recounts not just the life of her maddening, obsessive-compulsive brother but the lives of her uncommon family. Michiko Kakutani says it is ''a book that explores the difficult algebra of familial love and the possibility of its renewal in the face of impending loss.'' PAGE E1

HEADLINE: Words of Caution Deflate Optimism

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed Monday after weakness in the technology sector punctured some of the market's enthusiasm over a report that suggested the economy could still be growing.
 Comments about soft sales from the SanDisk Corporation, a maker of memory chips, helped pull stocks off their highs and sent tech shares lower. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up more than 100 points, finished well off its highs. 
 The Conference Board's report on leading economic indicators showed a 0.1 percent rise for April, following a similar increase in March. The index, intended to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months, bolstered investors' belief that the nation's economy, while weak, was positioned for recovery.
 After five months of declines in the leading indicators, some investors were concerned that March's increase was an anomaly, so April's advance was met with relief, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors.
 But technology shares tugged at the market after SanDisk issued cautious comments at a JPMorgan technology conference, said Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management in Boston. SanDisk fell $2.42, or 7.5 percent, to $30.02. SanDisk's remarks came on a day of light trading and dented but did not sink an upbeat mood on Wall Street.
 ''Even though you're up only 0.1 percent, it's very good news that the declining trend may have been reversed,'' Mr. Johnson said, referring to the leading indicators report. ''That is important for this reason: It's consistent with the message of the markets.'' 
 The Dow rose 41.36 points, or 0.32 percent, to 13,028.16. The blue chips had been up nearly 150 points at their highs of the session.
 Broader stock indicators finished mixed. The S.& P. 500 advanced 1.28 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,426.63, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 12.76 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,516.09.
 Government bonds rose as the rally in stocks cooled. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 100 12/32, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 3.83 percent, from 3.84 percent.
 The dollar rose against most other major currencies, while gold prices also climbed.
 One pressure point for the economy, rising energy prices, appeared relatively in check Monday. While many investors remain mindful of the rising price of oil and its effect on consumer spending, Wall Street seemed somewhat unfazed as oil advanced. Light crude rose 76 cents to settle at a record $127.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Financial shares also pulled back after the market came off its highs. Merrill Lynch fell $1.14, or 2.3 percent, to $47.71, while Lehman Brothers Holdings fell 85 cents, to $42.79.
 The Lowe's Companies posted a first-quarter profit decline and issued an outlook for the year that was below analysts' estimates. The second-largest home improvement chain fell 64 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $24.25.

HEADLINE: Ex-Officers Of AOL Accused Of Fraud

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
In a reminder that the wreckage of the disastrous merger between America Online and Time Warner is still being sifted, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday filed fraud charges against eight former AOL executives, saying they had inflated online advertising revenue by more than $1 billion.
 The specific allegations made by the S.E.C. in two civil lawsuits are well-trodden territory. The company settled the charges three years ago. But the action is the most far-reaching yet against executives, who are accused of inflating revenue at AOL around the time of its 2000 announcement that it planned to merge with Time Warner. 
 The allegations involve a series of online advertising transactions beginning in 2000 -- a time when AOL was under increasing pressure to reach revenue targets to justify its merger with Time Warner -- that eventually led to several earnings restatements. The lawsuits were filed Monday in United States District Court in Lower Manhattan.
 The actions by the accused had the effect of conveying to investors and Wall Street analysts that AOL Time Warner was a ''healthier, stronger company than it really was,'' Scott W. Friestad, an associate director in the S.E.C.'s division of enforcement, said in an interview. ''The conduct occurred at a time when the Internet bubble was deflating.''
 Four of the defendants in the case settled the charges without admitting wrongdoing, while four are contesting the charges.
 The four who settled are James F. MacGuidwin, AOL's former controller; David M. Colburn, the former head of AOL's business affairs unit; Eric L. Keller, a business affairs executive; and Jay B. Rappaport, another former AOL business affairs executive. 
 Mr. MacGuidwin will pay $2.4 million and Mr. Colburn will pay nearly $4 million to settle the charges. Both were barred from serving as directors in public companies for 10 and 7 years, respectively. Mr. Rappaport will pay close to $750,000, while Mr. Keller will pay about $1 million to settle the claims.
 The four contesting the charges are John Michael Kelly, the former chief financial officer of AOL Time Warner; Joseph A. Ripp, former chief financial officer of the AOL division; Steven E. Rindner, a former AOL business affairs executive; and Mark Wovsaniker, the former head of accounting policy.
 David F. Geneson, a lawyer at Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton in Washington who represents Mr. Ripp, said his client was the one who discovered fraud at AOL and brought it to the attention of federal investigators. ''Mr. Ripp is a straight shooter who consistently uncovered fraud and did not commit it,'' Mr. Geneson said. ''There is no question this lawsuit is plain wrong.''
 Mark J. Hulkower, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson who represents Mr. Rindner, said in a statement: ''Steven Rindner is a decent and honorable young man who conducted himself appropriately during his three years at AOL. While he is disappointed that the S.E.C. has decided to pursue this unjustified course of action, he looks forward to the opportunity to clear his name.'' 
 A lawyer for Mr. Kelly said, ''Mr. Kelly flatly denies the S.E.C.'s claims and will vigorously defend himself in the courts.''
 A lawyer for Mr. Wovsaniker was not available for comment.
 In 2005, two years after Time Warner dropped AOL from its corporate name, the S.E.C. settled with the company over the charges, which are similar to those outlined in Monday's complaints. Time Warner agreed to pay $300 million to settle the case, without admitting or denying any fault. Also, on three occasions beginning in January 2003, Time Warner restated its quarterly earnings reports to lower the figures that had been inflated.

HEADLINE: Son of a Gun, Hollywood Has Big Fun on the Bayou

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

DATELINE: SHREVEPORT, La. 

 BODY:
There is a backlot feel to Shreveport, tucked in ''Ark-La-Tex,'' the nexus of three states where the piney woods encircle sloughs and bayous. Its post-boom downtown -- the oil and gas petered out in the mid-1980s -- has plenty of fine old buildings, not many people and, along with a bit of dissipation, an air of expectation, as if the circus might suddenly crest a hill and bring all manner of hoopla.
 Look closer and you will see that the circus, or its Hollywood cousin, is already here. A spoof called ''Disaster Movie'' has closed off a downtown street, turning the Chamber of Commerce building into a natural history museum. All those trucks near Swepco Park in North Shreveport? That's the gang from ''Microwave Park,'' including Val Kilmer, Sharon Stone and 50 Cent. Not long ago, both Mr. Kilmer and 50 Cent stopped by the Noble Savage, a downtown bar, where they welcomed the director Oliver Stone and the crew that had just arrived to make ''W,'' a dark comedy about the 43rd president of the United States. 
 Shreveport, home to about 200,000, equally divided between black and white, has become a kind of Hollywood South. More than 40 mostly independent productions, both television and film, have turned this very Southern city into a location stand-in for New York, Alaska and Maine in movies like ''Blonde Ambition,''''Factory Girl,''''The Mist,'' ''Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay'' and ''The Great Debaters.''
 Major film-industry companies like Paskal Lighting, Cinelease and Panavision all have permanent presences here. And last month Nu Image/Millennium Films, a producer and distributor of independent films like ''Mad Money'' and ''My Mom's New Boyfriend,'' announced the construction of a 6.7-acre production campus with a planned expansion to a 20-acre full-service studio that will have three sound stages, production offices, a mill and a prop house.
 Filmmakers arrive at this unlikely destination first and foremost for the incentives. The state offers a 25 percent tax credit for in-state spending, which bumps to 35 percent when the money goes to Louisiana production crews. 
 That still does not explain the choice of Shreveport, which has its charms but is close to not much of anywhere. Two evacuations, one caused by market forces and the other created by Hurricane Katrina, help to explain how pictures of the actor Oliver Platt and the director Harold Ramis came to hang in the local Starbucks. 
 When the local economy went bust in the 1980s, a lot of jobs in heavy industry disappeared. But the city was left with a substantial infrastructure, with varied architecture and numerous highways, nice characteristics if you're making a movie. And when Hurricane Katrina came along in 2005, many productions working with state tax credits in New Orleans had to scramble for both higher ground and a place to finish their films. 
 And though there are no direct flights to Shreveport from Los Angeles and New York, city officials try to overcome what would seem to be a deal-breaker by doubling down on the hospitality.
 Lampton Enochs and Alissa Kantrow are partners in Louisiana Production Consultants, and they manage Mansfield Studios, a converted former Western Electric building with 26-foot-high ceilings and 120,000 square feet of production space. 
 ''Shreveport was not a city I was familiar with,'' said Mr. Enochs, whizzing around the space in a golf cart. ''But when the storm came, we were in New Orleans and a month away from production on 'Thief' for Fox. The crews came up, and then we found this amazing old downtown and all of these great neighborhoods with turn-of-the-century homes. The costs were low, the weather was good, and when you'd shoot in somebody's home, some of them even bake cookies for the crew.''
 Last week Arleena Acree, the city's liaison with the film industry, was making the rounds and dealing with various frantic requests on her cellphone, including those for potential sets for ''Billy the Exterminator,'' a reality show from A&E, and a production that was shopping for closed schools. With plenty of parks, cemeteries and public buildings, the city does not charge location or shooting permits and closes streets on very short notice.
 ''In a city of this size, the economic impact of these film projects is felt by everyone,'' said Michael P. Moorhead, who runs StageWorks of Louisiana, a production complex housed in a former convention center. ''There is zero degrees of separation, and when you are looking at $200 million to $300 million in spending, it becomes very tangible.''
 Jason White, a local merchant who runs Foam It, which fabricates architectural elements, can attest to that. When ''Year One,'' a coming Jack Black movie, came to town, the producers ordered 90,000 square feet of manufactured paving stones. Wearing his L.S.U. hat, Mr. White walked around a business on the outskirts of town that has grown to 12,000 square feet from 2,000 square feet. 
 ''Eighty percent of that growth is from the movie business,'' he said, mentioning that just that morning, the producers of ''W'' had come in looking for architectural elements to mimic Kennebunkport, Me., and Crawford, Tex.
 It is that economic infusion, the kind that pumps new blood and money into a post-industrial city, that has state and local governments all around the country constantly wooing the entertainment industry. New York, for example, recently announced new incentives, partly to make sure that American productions stay in its state, not Connecticut or Vancouver or, sometimes, Romania. With the dog fight among all the competing locales, there is a chance that it will turn into a zero-sum game. 
 At Shreveport's City Hall, Mayor Cedric B. Glover said that while he enjoys bumping into 50 Cent and all, he is more interested in other, more financially material byproducts. ''The spending is very significant, they don't pollute, and almost everything they touch they leave behind better than they found it. What's not to like about that?'' he said.
 Shreveport will never be mistaken for SoHo or West Hollywood. But it is not without charms. Herby K's Shrimp Buster will satisfy crews or fatten up talent; the fried chicken at the Cotton Boll will do the same even quicker; and the Blind Tiger and the Superior Steak House will meet more sophisticated culinary needs. For the moviegoing experience, there's the gorgeous new $4.2 million Robinson Film Center, with screening rooms and a restaurant of its own.
 ''From what I was told to expect, I pulled up looking for a dirt road and a McDonald's, and it was nothing like that,'' said Jerry Jacobs, a producer of ''Disaster Movie.'' ''For our purposes, it is as easy to shoot here as it would be on the backlot of Universal. And the only real culture shock has been adjusting to how unusually friendly people are.''
 The producer David Friendly, who made ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' recently got back to Los Angeles from Shreveport after producing ''Soul Men'' with Bernie Mac and Mr. Jackson. He did not consider it a hardship tour.
 ''My two-room suite on the 11th floor of the Hilton, complete with two large plasma TVs, cost about the price of a decent dinner in L.A., about $159 per night,'' he recalled. ''The bar was sort of the general congregating spot for folks from any of the six movies either in preproduction or shooting while we were there.''
 Last Tuesday, inside Freddy Mac's, a bar downtown, workers were laying tiles on the dance floor when Mr. Stone emerged, having just walked through the scene with Josh Brolin, who is playing George W. Bush. 
 ''I'm used to making movies around here,'' Mr. Stone said. ''I made four movies in Dallas. And where we are right now,'' he said, gesturing toward the town and the plains beyond, ''is Bush country, so it feels right.''
 ''You get something working with extras from here,'' Mr. Stone added. ''Look, these people are gamblers and roughnecks. They know all about boom and bust. This is a second-chance town. I just read that there may be a huge reserve of gas right under the city that was not discovered until very recently.''
 Mr. Stone is right. Speculators are already moving in on word a few weeks ago that the so-called Hayneville Shale field may be a mother lode of gas deposits. The backlot of Shreveport, already rich in lore, may be picking up a few new characters and a twist in the plot.

HEADLINE: Development Agency Is Losing Its President

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Avi Schick, president of the state's economic development agency, which is in the midst of a political overhaul, will step down in September.
 Mr. Schick's departure from the agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, follows that of Patrick J. Foye, its co-chairman, who resigned under pressure in March. Since then, Gov. David A. Paterson has been looking for a new chairman and a new structure for an agency that had been hobbled by internal disputes among its top executives, the collapse of a $1.8 billion expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and other high-profile problems.
 Mr. Schick, who has also served as acting chief executive since March, plans to rejoin the private sector in September, but will not leave government altogether. The governor said on Monday that he had asked Mr. Schick, a friend, to continue to serve on the boards of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which oversees the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, and the Governors Island Restoration and Education Corporation. 
 Governor Paterson said in an interview that he had asked Mr. Schick to stay on even after he expressed a desire to return to the private sector. The governor said Mr. Schick had been particularly helpful to him in shepherding a project in his old district -- Columbia University's $7 billion expansion into Manhattanville -- and in helping to devise a state program for minority- and women-owned businesses. 
 ''We've been wrestling with Avi's desire to go and my desire to rule the world and do what I want,'' the governor joked on Monday. ''Now that I'm starting to feel my way, I've relented.''
 Mr. Schick, 41, said that his decision was related to his family. He said he had three children when he entered government nine years ago and now has five, the oldest in high school.
 Mr. Schick, a lawyer, joined state government in 1999, when he went to work for the newly elected attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. During his eight-year stint, Mr. Schick, a former rabbinical student who more closely resembles a blocking fullback than a religious scholar, handled two important cases. He led the case against Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who was ordered to repay $100 million of a compensation package that Mr. Spitzer contended was in violation of state laws regarding nonprofit institutions. He also represented New York in the $206 billion Master Settlement Agreement with tobacco companies.
 After Mr. Spitzer was elected governor, Mr. Schick moved to the Empire State Development Corporation, becoming its president. He was responsible for the state's role in rebuilding Lower Manhattan, as well as Governors Island, and the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, Columbia University's expansion plan for Manhattanville and the Brooklyn Bridge project.
 Mr. Spitzer had reorganized the development corporation, installing dual chairmen, Mr. Foye for downstate projects and Daniel Gunderson for upstate projects. But the structure proved problematic, as the two men barely spoke, did not get along with Mr. Schick and often worked at odds, officials have said. Governor Paterson has indicated in recent weeks that he planned to restore a single chairman, but may have separate deputies with responsibilities for upstate and downstate projects.
 Last week, however, upstate business leaders and local development corporations told the governor that they were concerned that a single chairman would be consumed with New York City and would ignore the different needs of the upstate region. Governor Paterson said he was ''disappointed'' that those leaders had not called him earlier, but said he understood their reservations.
 ''No one who works at E.S.D.C. thought that this bifurcated system worked,'' Governor Paterson said on Monday. ''In the next couple of weeks we'll have a new structure in place. If you make a bad decision, you have to live with it for a long time. So we thought that taking a little extra time to figure it out might be the better course.''

HEADLINE: Leading Bidder In Road Auction

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa. 

 BODY:
A Spanish company and a unit of Citigroup teamed up to submit the highest bid for the right to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike for the next 75 years. 
 Abertis Infraestructuras of Barcelona, an Abertis investor, Criteria CaixaCorp of Spain and Citi Infrastructure Investors offered $12.8 billion, beating their nearest competitor by $700 million, Gov. Ed Rendell said Monday.
 Mr. Rendell described himself as ''strongly in favor of it.'' But the Legislature must approve any deal, and one leader in the Democratic-controlled House said he was not impressed with the bid.
 ''To be quite candid, the number is less than overwhelming,'' said Keith R. McCall, a Democrat. ''It's certainly not dead on arrival, but it's something we do need to discuss with the entire caucus.''
 Mr. Rendell, also a Democrat, has pursued the plan to have a private entity operate and maintain 500 miles of the turnpike system to raise billions for Pennsylvania's transportation needs.
 The lease deal would let the operator increase tolls 25 percent in January, and then by 2.5 percent or an amount equal to consumer price inflation after that. The turnpike's operating revenue was $608 million in the fiscal year that ended last May.

HEADLINE: Senate Leaders Reach Deal On Housing Assistance

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate negotiators on Monday said they had reached a deal on legislation aimed at helping hundreds of thousands of homeowners in danger of foreclosure by expanding the availability of government-insured mortgages. 
 The Bush administration, which previously said it would oppose legislation to rescue troubled homeowners, suggested that it was willing to consider the Senate deal because lawmakers had found a way to eliminate any direct cost to taxpayers. 
 The Senate bill would create an affordable housing fund, financed by the government-sponsored mortgage-finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that fund would be used in its first year to provide about $500 million for the foreclosure rescue effort. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, who announced the agreement, said his goal was to create a solid foundation underneath the nation's depressed housing market. 
 ''The primary goal here is to keep people in their homes, but also to establish a floor, a bottom to all this,'' Mr. Dodd said. The foreclosure aid is tied to legislation creating a new regulatory agency to tighten oversight of the government-sponsored mortgage financiers. 
 The House this month approved a similar foreclosure rescue bill by a vote of 266 to 154, which was cast mostly along party lines. Only 39 Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the bill, many of them from states hit hard by foreclosures. 
 Under both the House and Senate plans, lenders could limit their losses from potential foreclosures by agreeing to reduce the principal balances of loans at risk of default. The borrowers, many with expensive adjustable-rate loans, could then apply to refinance with a more stable, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage insured by the government through the Federal Housing Administration. 
 In addition to paying interest and principal, the lender would pay a monthly insurance fee, which would go into a fund to protect taxpayers from losses. 
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that under the House bill, up to 500,000 mortgages would be refinanced over the next five years, at a cost to taxpayers of about $2.7 billion. 
 Mr. Dodd said that his bill included several changes, including shortening the life of the foreclosure assistance plan to three years, which would reduce the cost to about $500 million. He said that roughly the same number of mortgages could be refinanced. 
 That $500 million would be taken from a new affordable housing fund, which would collect slightly less than half a cent on every dollar of mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. 
 That fund, proposed by Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, would continue to exist after the foreclosure assistance plan ended, with the money directed to creating affordable housing, including low-income rental housing. 
 Rhode Island has one of the highest foreclosure rates on subprime mortgages in the country. 
 A day before the House approved its foreclosure rescue plan, President Bush had flatly threatened to veto the bill, saying it would put taxpayer money at risk and ''reward speculators and lenders.''
 Many lawmakers interpreted the president's remarks as a signal to Senate Republicans to kill the housing legislation before it could reach Mr. Bush's desk. 
 But the White House reacted with a more agreeable tone to news of the deal between Mr. Dodd and Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee. 
 Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House, said the administration still needed to review the specific language in the bill. But, he said: ''We appreciate and encourage the efforts to create a strong, independent regulator'' for the government-sponsored companies. ''We'll look forward to seeing the details of the bill,'' he added, ''especially provisions to expand programs of the Federal Housing Administration.'' 
 A spokesman for Mr. Shelby said the senator was ''optimistic that the White House will support what we're doing.'' 
 In a statement, Mr. Shelby said: ''My primary consideration during negotiations on this package has been to protect the American taxpayer, and I believe we've made significant progress toward that goal on each component.'' 
 Mr. Shelby had been particularly intent on tightening regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the deal with Mr. Dodd would create a new Federal Housing Finance Agency. The agency would oversee the companies, which are private but are virtually assured of government assistance should they experience financial difficulty. 
 The regulator would be empowered to order an increase in capital in the event that the ''safety and soundness'' of the institutions were somehow at risk. In addition, the bill would set a new limit on so-called conforming loans, up to about $550,000 in the most expensive markets. The current conforming loan limit is $417,000, but was raised temporarily to $729,250 in the most expensive housing markets under the economic stimulus plan approved by Congress and signed by the president in February.

HEADLINE: Talking Versus Doing

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1965, Mancur Olson wrote a classic book called ''The Logic of Collective Action,'' which pointed out that large, amorphous groups are often less powerful politically than small, organized ones. He followed it up with ''The Rise and Decline of Nations.'' In that book, Olson observed that as the number of small, organized factions in a society grows, the political culture becomes more divisive, the economy becomes more rigid and the nation loses vitality.
 If you look around America today, you see the Olson logic playing out. Interest groups turn every judicial fight into an ideological war. They lobby for more spending on the elderly, even though the country is trillions of dollars short of being able to live up to its promises. They've turned environmental concern into subsidies for corn growers and energy concerns into subsidies for oil companies. 
 The $307 billion farm bill that rolled through Congress is a perfect example of the pattern. Farm net income is up 56 percent over the past two years, yet the farm bill plows subsidies into agribusinesses, thoroughbred breeders and the rest. 
 The growers of nearly every crop will get more money. Farmers in the top 1 percent of earners qualify for federal payments. Under the legislation, the government will buy sugar for roughly twice the world price and then resell it at an 80 percent loss. Parts of the bill that would have protected wetlands and wildlife habitat were deleted or shrunk.
 My colleagues on The Times's editorial page called the bill ''disgraceful.'' My former colleagues at The Wall Street Journal's editorial page ripped it as a ''scam.'' Yet such is the logic of collective action; the bill is certain to become law. It passed with 81 votes in the Senate and 318 in the House -- enough to override President Bush's coming veto. Nearly everyone in Congress got something.
 The question amid this supposed change election is: Who is going to end this sort of thing? 
 Barack Obama talks about taking on the special interests. This farm bill would have been a perfect opportunity to do so. But Obama supported the bill, just as he supported the 2005 energy bill that was a Christmas tree for the oil and gas industries.
 Obama's vote may help him win Iowa, but it will lead to higher global food prices and more hunger in Africa. Moreover, it raises questions about how exactly he expects to bring about the change that he promises.
 If elected, Obama's main opposition will not come from Republicans. It will come from Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. Already, the Democratic machine is reborn. Lobbyists are now giving 60 percent of their dollars to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The pharmaceutical industry, the defense industry and the financial sector all give more money to Democrats than Republicans. If Obama is actually going to bring about change, he's going to have to ruffle these sorts of alliances. If he can't do it in an easy case like the farm bill, will he ever? 
 John McCain opposed the farm bill. In an impassioned speech on Monday, he declared: ''It would be hard to find any single bill that better sums up why so many Americans in both parties are so disappointed in the conduct of their government, and at times so disgusted by it.''
 McCain has been in Congress for decades, but he has remained a national rather than a parochial politician. The main axis in his mind is not between Republican and Democrat. It's between narrow interest and patriotic service. And so it is characteristic that he would oppose a bill that benefits the particular at the expense of the general.
 In fact, in this issue, McCain may have found a theme to unify his so far scattershot campaign. He has always been an awkward ideological warrior. In any case, this year may not be the best year for Republicans to launch a right versus left crusade. But McCain has infinitely better grounds than Obama to run as a do-what-it-takes reformer. 
 He has a long record of taking on not only the other party, but his own. In the current Weekly Standard, the brilliant young writer Yuval Levin suggests that McCain put reforming America's decrepit governing institutions at the center of his presidential race.
 Levin points out that the health care system, the immigration system, the regulatory system and the entitlement system all need reforms. Instead of talking about personal honor or perpetual tax cuts, McCain should focus relentlessly on modernization. 
 In fact, Monday in Detroit, McCain declared: ''In all my reforms, the goal is not to denigrate government but to make it better, not to deride government but to restore its good name.'' 
 Obama, sad to say, failed the farm bill test. McCain may have found a theme for a nation that has lost faith in its own institutions.

HEADLINE: Obama Talk On Iranians Draws Fire From McCain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Billings, Mont., and John M. Broder from Maysville, Ky.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain put Senator Barack Obama on the foreign policy defensive once again Monday, criticizing him here in his hometown for saying Iran did not pose the serious threat to the United States that the Soviet Union once did.
 Mr. Obama's willingness to engage with adversaries like Iran was a source of disagreement between himself and his Democratic opponent, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, early in the presidential primary campaign. Now it is quickly emerging as a central issue in his likely general election showdown with Mr. McCain. 
 National security is where Mr. McCain's advisers hope to keep the debate, and the candidate himself, who was in Chicago on Monday to address a gathering of the National Restaurant Association, digressed from prepared remarks on economic issues to focus it there.
 Iran, Mr. McCain said, provides explosives used to kill American soldiers in Iraq, supports terrorism in the Middle East and is committed to destroying Israel.
 ''Obviously Iran isn't a superpower and doesn't possess the military power the Soviet Union had, but that does not mean that the threat posed by Iran is insignificant,'' said Mr. McCain, who at another point accused Mr. Obama of ''reckless judgment.''
 Mr. Obama replied by saying Mr. McCain was ''using the same George Bush textbook'' that had brought ''failed cowboy diplomacy.'' 
 Mr. Obama was campaigning in Montana, which holds its Democratic primary on June 3. Four other contests against Mrs. Clinton remain as well, including those in Kentucky and Oregon on Tuesday. He picked up five more superdelegates on Monday, including the Senate's longest-serving member, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, less than a week after Mr. Byrd's state went for Mrs. Clinton by 41 percentage points.
 That endorsement was emblematic of a nation vastly changed over the last half-century. Mr. Byrd once opposed integrating the military, filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, as a young man, was briefly a member of the Ku Klux Klan. He has frequently expressed regret for that past.
 As for Mrs. Clinton, she campaigned in Kentucky on Monday, telling voters there that ''this is nowhere near over'' and vowing to stay in the race until the last primaries.
 The attack by Mr. McCain was prompted by comments Mr. Obama made on Sunday in Pendleton, Ore., where he urged engagement of the nation's foes and said that ''strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries.''
 ''That's what Reagan did with Gorbachev,'' he said, adding: ''I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela -- these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying, 'We're going to wipe you off the planet.' ''
 Mr. Obama said in a Democratic primary debate last year that he would be willing to sit down, without preconditions, with adversaries like the leaders of Iran. He has since sought to draw a distinction between such engagement by an Obama administration and his personal involvement as president, saying the latter would require the Iranians' meeting certain benchmarks.
 But Mr. McCain, in his remarks here, said, ''Senator Obama has declared and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions, likening it to meetings between former American presidents and the leaders of the Soviet Union.''
 Such a position ''betrays the depth of Senator Obama's inexperience and reckless judgment,'' Mr. McCain said, adding, ''Those are very serious deficiencies for an American president to possess.''
 In his response later, Mr. Obama said: ''Let me be absolutely clear. Iran is a grave threat.'' But, he argued, just as ''Kennedy talked to Khrushchev,'' the United States should have the ''courage and confidence'' to talk to its current adversaries.
 ''Demanding that a country meets all your conditions before you meet with them, that's not a strategy,'' he said. ''It's just naive, wishful thinking.'' 
 The bulk of Mr. McCain's remarks to the restaurant association dealt with the economy, on which he sought to distinguish himself from his Democratic counterparts over taxes, trade and farm subsidies. He told his audience that he supported President Bush's threat to veto the farm bill overwhelmingly passed by Congress last week.
 ''Senator Clinton and Senator Obama have agreed to raise your taxes, to regulate your business more than ever and to spend more of your money in Washington,'' Mr. McCain said. ''That's their idea of change, but it sure sounds familiar to me.''
 Mr. McCain noted his presence in Mr. Obama's hometown, drawing laughter and applause with a joke: ''Many Democratic voters in Illinois are especially proud of their junior senator. They believe more than ever that Barack Obama was the right choice for the Senate in 2004. I couldn't agree more, and I promise to do everything in my power to help him finish his first term in the United States Senate.''

HEADLINE: McCain Finds A Thorny Path In Ethics Effort

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER and KATE ZERNIKE; Michael Luo contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Sorting out the lobbying entanglements of his campaign advisers is proving to be a messy business for Senator John McCain.
 On Monday, just days after it issued new rules to address conflicts of interest, the McCain campaign was furiously sifting through the business records of aides and advisers. The new rules were prompted by disclosures that led to the abrupt departure from the campaign of a number of aides who worked as lobbyists, including some with ties to foreign governments.
 Mr. McCain's political identity has long been defined by his calls for reducing the influence of special interests in Washington. But as he heads toward the general election as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, he has increasingly confronted criticism that his campaign staff is stocked with people who have made their living as lobbyists or in similar jobs, leaving his credentials as a reformer open to attack.
 The process of trying to purge the campaign of conflicts that in appearance or reality might violate Mr. McCain's stated principles or cause him political trouble has so far focused only more attention on the backgrounds of his aides and advisers. 
 The delicate task of writing and enforcing the new conflict-of-interest policy has fallen to Mr. McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, who was himself a lobbyist until he took a leave of absence from his firm, Davis Manafort, two years ago.
 In 2005, Mr. Davis was registered as a lobbyist for corporate clients like the telecommunications company Verizon. Under the campaign's new rules, issued by Mr. Davis on Thursday, lobbyists who are currently registered either for American companies or for foreign governments or businesses cannot be employed by the campaign. They must also disclose their lobbying work even if they are working for Mr. McCain on a part-time, voluntary basis.
 But while Mr. Davis took a leave from Davis Manafort in 2006, the company has developed a specialty in recent years in a type of lobbying for which firms do not have to register -- namely, representing the interests abroad of foreign politicians and businessmen.
 In recent years, the company's clients have included the richest man in Ukraine and a former premier of that country whose opponents were supported by Mr. McCain. The Washington Post reported in January that Mr. Davis also set up a meeting in Switzerland in 2006 between Mr. McCain and a Russian businessman, who has been barred from entering this country, apparently because of accusations about past ties to organized crime in Russia. That businessman, Oleg Deripaska, has denied such links.
 Another senior McCain campaign aide who has lobbied on behalf of foreign governments over the past seven years is Randy Scheunemann, the chief foreign policy adviser. 
 Over the past several years, Mr. Scheunemann met several times with Mr. McCain to discuss his clients' interests. He introduced the senator to the foreign ministers of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia as they tried to win admission to NATO, and a representative of Taiwan as it lobbied for free trade, records show. Mr. Scheunemann also accompanied Mr. McCain to Latvia in 2001 and Georgia in 2006.
 Mr. Scheunemann was a registered foreign agent until March, when he ended his registrations for several countries. He had joined the McCain campaign several months earlier. 
 A campaign spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said he would not comment on questions raised about Mr. Scheunemann or any other campaign advisers.
 ''We're not going to get into specifics of volunteers, staffer by staffer, supporter by supporter,'' Mr. Bounds said. ''We can't be in a position where we're litigating the process of the process. 
 ''The campaign has put a very strict policy in place and every member of the campaign is expected to be compliant with it. There may be perfectly good people that have situations that are not reconcilable. They will not be compliant with the policy.''
 Senior McCain advisers were hoping the conflict-of-interest policy would quell questions about the number of lobbyists working on behalf of the campaign. 
 But at a campaign stop on Monday in Oregon, the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Barack Obama, said: ''It appears that John McCain is very much a creature of Washington. And one of the things that we have said at the outset of this campaign is that if we are going to change policies, we were going to have to change how Washington works. We can't have special interests dictating what's happening there.''
 The campaign of Mr. Obama, too, includes lobbyists among its unpaid advisers, and staff members who try to help private clients influence government policy. 
 When asked about the ongoing vetting process in his campaign, Mr. McCain repeatedly told reporters on Monday, ''We have enacted the most comprehensive and most transparent policy concerning lobbyist activities, and I challenge Senator Obama to adopt a similar policy.''
 But even senior McCain advisers have acknowledged the difficulty of disentangling the complicated web of relationships between lobbyists and candidates. Last week, after Mr. Davis issued the new conflict rules, two other advisers resigned, including Tom Loeffler, the campaign's general co-chairman, whose lobbying firm had represented Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong, as well as a host of corporate clients. 
 And it appeared unlikely the resignations would stop there. The campaign's new policy could affect people at all levels of the McCain operation. 
 Wayne Berman, the campaign's deputy finance chairman, has lobbied for the governments of Cyprus and Trinidad and Tobago, along with many other corporate clients. Christian Ferry, who is a lobbyist for Mr. Davis's firm, is Mr. McCain's deputy campaign manager. 
 Susan Nelson, the finance director of the campaign, was as recently as last year a registered lobbyist for the Loeffler Group, for companies, including AT&T that have had business before Mr. McCain on the Commerce Committee. John Green, who has been reported to be coordinating the campaign's efforts with congressional Republicans, is registered as a lobbyist for Ogilvy Government Relations, Mr. Berman's firm. Carlos Bonilla, described by the McCain Web site as an economic adviser, is also a registered lobbyist.
 The new rules require all staff members, including part-time volunteers, to complete a questionnaire ''to identify issues and clients that could be embarrassing for the senator and the campaign.'' 
 In Washington, an entire establishment cycles between campaign work in the even numbered years and lobbying in the odd -- a combination pioneered by Charlie Black, who is now serving as a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. 
 Traveling on Monday with Mr. McCain, Mr. Black said voters would pay little or no attention to the vetting process. ''This is complete inside-the-Beltway nonsense,'' Mr. Black said. He said he was now in retirement, after stepping down as chairman of his lobbying firm, BKSH & Associates Worldwide, in March, although he had been advising Mr. McCain for months prior to leaving the firm.
 The lobbying clout of Mr. Davis, the campaign manager, derives from his longtime Washington connections, which he drew attention to as recently as three years ago. 
 In January 2005, he apparently pitched executives of Pegasus Capital Advisors, a private investment firm in Cos Cob, Conn., on the idea of putting money into a new firm in which he would be a partner, documents indicate. He told Pegasus Capital's representatives that experienced ''Washington insiders'' like him could use their ties to advance the interests of companies seeking federal contracts, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. A spokesman for Pegasus did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.
 The proposal never bore fruit. But it came at the same time Mr. Davis was lobbying the Defense Department on behalf of Imagesat, an Israeli company that sells satellite imagery in which Pegasus Capital had invested. He was also then drawing a salary as the part-time president of the Reform Institute, a Washington group Mr. McCain helped found to champion ideals like reducing ''the influence of special interests'' in politics and government.
 Mr. Black also defended Mr. Davis, saying the campaign manager had not taken any money from his lobbying firm since 2006. The two men are working on an unpaid basis for the campaign.
 Mr. Black contended that nobody at Davis Manafort had been a registered lobbyist for five years. ''Rick Davis and nobody else at his firm, either, has been a registered lobbyist in five years,'' he said. ''Five years.'' But a check of lobbyist records shows associates at the firm have represented clients numerous times as recently as 2005.
 The campaign's new policy appears to provide a loophole for some aides. Under the policy, no one working for the campaign may be a registered lobbyist or represent foreign countries, or be paid for that kind of work. But volunteers are required only to disclose their lobbying work. 
 But they are not allowed to participate in any campaign conversations about the issues for which they lobby, which would seem to pose a conflict for someone like Mr. Scheunemann. His work as a foreign agent could overlap on any number of issues with his foreign policy advice.

HEADLINE: New Developer Signs $1 Billion Deal to Transform West Side Railyards

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Less than two weeks after the collapse of a billion-dollar deal to develop the railyards on Manhattan's Far West Side, a new developer has agreed to salvage the plan and help keep alive the Bloomberg administration's campaign to transform the area into a major business district.
 Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, signed an agreement Sunday night with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to develop 12 million square feet of office towers, apartment buildings and parks over the 26-acre railyards, which sit on both sides of 11th Avenue, between 30th and 33rd Streets.
 It was a welcome turnabout for the authority, which is counting on the railyards deal to provide hundreds of millions of dollars for new trains, stations and rail work. The speed of the new agreement, occurring 10 days after the collapse of the authority's earlier deal with Tishman Speyer Properties, is also a measure of how much Mr. Ross, one of the city's most prolific developers, wants control over the railyards. 
 Mr. Ross, who had bid on the yards before and clearly suffered loser's remorse, essentially agreed to the same tentative $1.054 billion deal that Tishman had signed in March. The deal requires the approval of the authority's board, which will vote on the agreement at a special meeting on Thursday. The two sides will take the next four months to complete a contract to buy the development rights.
 ''We knew we had this one opportunity,'' said an elated Mr. Ross, who sealed the deal with an $11 million deposit. ''We weren't going to start negotiating.'' 
 ''It's not often that you get a second chance at a dream of a lifetime,'' added Mr. Ross, who returned from China on Saturday for the last round of negotiations. ''We will create New York's next great neighborhood: the Hudson Yards.''
 Tishman Speyer, which had won a bidding war with four other developers, abandoned the deal amid growing concerns about the softening economy, tightening credit markets and the lack of an anchor tenant.
 Gary Dellaverson, the authority's chief financial officer, vowed to strike a new deal with one of the other bidders within a week, a promise that many real estate executives scoffed at. Even Elliot G. Sander, executive director of the transportation authority, conceded on Monday that he had been unsure Mr. Dellaverson could make good on his vow.
 Mr. Ross had effectively abandoned the bidding for the railyards in March when his partner and anchor tenant, News Corporation, dropped out. But even without an anchor, he said he ''jumped on'' a second chance to grab the largest undeveloped site left in Manhattan, one that offers unobstructed views of the Hudson River and New Jersey.
 Mr. Ross's financial partner is Goldman Sachs.
 ''The selection of Related demonstrates that even in an uncertain credit market, the ability to unlock the value of this area can substantiate the price the M.T.A. is seeking,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan L.L.P. 
 Under the agreement, Related is required to pay $18.8 million at the closing on the eastern part of the railyards later this year. The company would close on the section west of 11th Avenue once it completed environmental and land use reviews -- a process that could take 18 months. At that closing, Related would pay another $24.7 million.
 The transportation authority's agreement with Tishman Speyer had fallen apart because the company wanted to delay payments on both the eastern and western portions until after the land review was done. Under the new deal, Related can suspend its annual rent payment for up to two years because of a recession or a lack of tenants, a clause intended to keep it in the deal, people on both sides of the talks said. But the deal also requires the company to pay penalties if it suspends rent payments. 
 Though the profits from the project are potentially huge, it is not without great risk. The developer must spend about $2 billion erecting platforms, columns and foundations over a working railyard before it can build the first tower. The company will also be competing for commercial tenants against three big developers: Brookfield Properties, which plans to start construction at a site at Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street; Larry Silverstein, who is building three towers at the World Trade Center site; and the Port Authority, which is building the Freedom Tower there.
 Related Companies, like the four other teams competing for the project, spent millions of dollars hiring architects to design the towers that would sit atop the platform. Although News Corporation is no longer part of the deal, Mr. Ross and Related plan to use the same general layout and design, although few executives expect any of the 13 towers to look like the images distributed by Related Companies.
 The plans call for about 5.5 million square feet of commercial space, including a hotel, and about 5,500 apartments, as well as a park and a cultural center. The architects include Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arquitectonica and Robert A. M. Stern.
 Much as he did on March 26, when the authority selected Tishman Speyer, Gov. David A. Paterson said yesterday that the railyards deal represented ''a renewed commitment to the future of the city and the region.''
 ''This agreement highlights the resilience of public-private partnerships in the face of the national economic downturn that we are experiencing,'' Mr. Paterson said in a statement. ''An alliance between Related Companies, one of the country's premier real estate firms, and Goldman Sachs, a global financial leader, will lay the foundation for a reimagined Far West Side.''
 Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber said the city had worked hard with the transportation authority to revive the agreement. ''This is such a unique project with such a long-term upside,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''We had to strike quickly. The outcome speaks for itself.''
 But critics of the project were not so quick to embrace Related.
 ''Until we get a handle on the level of subsidies involved, there's no way to determine whether this is a good deal or a bad deal,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who is holding a hearing on West Side development on Friday.
 Some residents of the area derided the design as a grassy yard surrounded by tall towers.
 ''The giganticism of the proposed developments on the yards and the speed with which the M.T.A. and the city seem to be rushing to adopt a plan are a great concern,'' said Andrew Berman, a member of the Hudson Yards Community Advisory Committee. ''Development of this scale could completely transform our neighborhoods, overwhelm our infrastructure and offer very little in return in terms of affordable housing or other much-needed amenities.''
 But transportation and city officials were relieved yesterday, particularly since a number of projects on the West Side have stumbled in recent months. Earlier this year, the state abandoned long-awaited plans to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. More recently, plans to demolish Madison Square Garden in order to build a monumental train station and a half-dozen skyscrapers also collapsed. 
 ''The fact that developers are willing to put money in to this project shows that New York will certainly need more office space in the near future,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer said. ''It now makes it even more important that the 7 train extension is built, and built on time.''

HEADLINE: Gambling in New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Gambling Is Never Enough'' (editorial, May 10):
 In arguing against expanding gambling in New York, you acknowledge that a ''minority of players'' are problem gamblers. You then oppose increasing gaming availability, in part because you fear increased availability will increase the problem. 
 That is not the case. Despite the opening of hundreds of new casinos across the country in recent years, the prevalence of pathological gambling has not increased.
 We understand that about 1 percent of our potential market can be classified as ''pathological gamblers,'' and we are committed to helping them. But acknowledging this tiny minority doesn't change the reality that millions of adults enjoy gambling and that gaming creates jobs, tax revenue, economic expansion, higher property values and increased tourism.

HEADLINE: An Oracle of Oil

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Arjun N. Murti remembers the pain of the oil shocks of the 1970s. But he is bracing for something far worse now: He foresees a ''super spike'' -- a price surge that will soon drive crude oil to $200 a barrel.
 Mr. Murti, who has a bit of a green streak, is not bothered much by the prospect of even higher oil prices, figuring it might finally prompt America to become more energy efficient.
 An analyst at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Murti has become the talk of the oil market by issuing one sensational forecast after another. A few years ago, rivals scoffed when he predicted oil would breach $100 a barrel. Few are laughing now. Oil shattered yet another record on Tuesday, touching $129.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas at $4 a gallon is arriving just in time for those long summer drives.
 Mr. Murti, 39, argues that the world's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil means prices will keep rising from here and stay above $100 into 2011. Others disagree, arguing that prices could abruptly tumble if speculators in the market rush for the exits. But the grim calculus of Mr. Murti's prediction, issued in March and reconfirmed two weeks ago, is enough to give anyone pause: in an America of $200 oil, gasoline could cost more than $6 a gallon. 
 That would be fine with Mr. Murti, who owns not one but two hybrid cars. ''I'm actually fairly anti-oil,'' says Mr. Murti, who grew up in New Jersey. ''One of the biggest challenges our country faces is our addiction to oil.''
 Mr. Murti is hardly alone in predicting higher oil prices. Boone Pickens, the oilman turned corporate raider, said Tuesday that crude would hit $150 this year. But many analysts are no longer so sure where oil is going, at least in the short term. Some say prices will fall as low as $70 a barrel by year-end, according to Thomson Financial.
 Experts disagree over the supply of oil, the demand for it and whether recent speculation in the commodities markets has artificially raised prices. As an energy analyst at Citigroup, Tim Evans, reportedly put it, trading commodities these days is like ''sticking your hand in a blender.''
 Whatever the case, oil analysts like Mr. Murti have suddenly taken on the aura that enveloped technology analysts in the 1990s. 
 ''It's become a very fashionable area to write about,'' said Kevin Norrish, a commodity analyst at Barclays Capital, which began predicting high oil prices around the same time as Goldman. ''And to try to get attention from people, people are coming out with all sorts of numbers.''
 This was not always the case. In the 1990s, oil research was a sleepy area at banks. Many analysts assumed oil prices would hover near $15 to $20 a barrel forever. If prices rose much above those levels, they figured, consumers would start conserving, suppliers would raise production, or both, causing prices to decline. 
 But around the turn of the century, oil company after oil company started missing predicted production. Mr. Murti, who covers oil companies like ConocoPhillips and Valero Energy, decided to study the oil spikes of the 1970s.
 Since starting his career at Petrie Parkman & Company, a Denver-based investment firm acquired by Merrill Lynch in 2006, he had been conservative in his calls on oil. But by 2004, he concluded the world was headed for a long supply shock that would push prices through the roof. That summer, as oil traded for about $40 a barrel, Mr. Murti coined what has become his signature phrase: super spike.
 The following March, he drew attention by predicting prices would soar to $105, sending shock waves through the market. Angry investors questioned whether Goldman's own oil traders benefited from the prediction. At Goldman's annual meeting, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the bank's chief executive and now Treasury secretary, found himself defending Mr. Murti. 
 ''Our traders were as surprised as everyone else was,'' Mr. Paulson reportedly said. ''Our research department is totally independent. Our trading departments have no say about this.''
 Over time, Mr. Murti was proved right again. Oil crossed $100 in February. Mr. Murti's forecasts now feed into many of Goldman's economic and corporate forecasts, affecting research of companies like Ford and Procter & Gamble. His research is distributed widely among investors.
 ''Even if you disagree with their views, the problem is that Goldman does carry so much credibility,'' said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president for global energy futures at Macquarie Futures USA. ''There are a lot of traders who are going to buy based on their reports.''
 His sudden fame unsettles Mr. Murti. He rarely grants interviews, citing concerns about privacy, and he declined to be photographed for this article. He is not the bank's only gas prognosticator: Jeffrey R. Currie predicts oil prices out of London. 
 Mr. Murti, for his part, discounts suggestions that his reports affect market prices. ''Whenever an analyst upgrades a stock or downgrades a stock, sometimes you get a reaction that day, but beyond a day, fundamentals win out,'' he said.
 Mr. Murti falls into the camp of oil analysts who believe that supply is likely to remain tight because of geopolitical factors. These analysts predict higher prices because production is declining in non-OPEC countries like Britain, Norway and Mexico. 
 The analysts who predict lower prices say there are supplies of oil that the bullish analysts are missing. ''This year will be a year in which supply will be put into the market by stealth by OPEC and by countries we call black-hole countries,'' said Edward L. Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers. China is one example, he said.
 But while oil and gas prices have been rising for a while now, Americans have only just begun to reduce gasoline consumption, so their efforts to conserve have not dragged down oil prices.
 ''The fact that the U.S. gasoline demand can be down and that the U.S. gasoline consumer is no longer driving world oil prices is a monumental event,'' Mr. Murti says. He spends most of his time talking to money managers and analysts, many of whom keep asking him if oil prices will stay high if speculators abandon the market, and says he applauds investors for driving up oil prices, since that will spur investment in alternative sources of energy. 
 High prices, he says, ''send a message to consumers that you should try your best to buy fuel-efficient cars or otherwise conserve on energy.'' Washington should create tax incentives to encourage people to buy hybrid cars and develop more nuclear energy, he said. 
 Of course, if lawmakers heed his advice, oil analysts like him might one day be a thing of the past. That's fine with Mr. Murti. 
 ''The greatest thing in the world would be if in 15 years we no longer needed oil analysts,'' he says.

HEADLINE: Actuaries Scrutinized On Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
By firing its actuarial consultant last week, the New York State Legislature shone a light on one of the public sector's deepest secrets: All across the country, states and local governments are promising benefits to public workers on the basis of numbers that make little economic sense.
 The numbers are off-base for a variety of reasons. Sometimes there is a glaring conflict of interest, as there was in Albany, where the consultant was being paid by the workers seeking richer benefits. More often, there is subtle pressure on the actuary to come up with projections that make the pension fund look good. 
 Most of all, public pension actuaries use old methods that have fallen far out of sync with the economic mainstream. That does not necessarily mean their figures are wrong, but it does make them vulnerable to distortion, misunderstanding and abuse. 
 ''Financial burdens have been hidden'' as a result, said Jeremy Gold, a New York actuary and economist who was one of the first to call attention to the gap between actuarial figures and economic reality. Many economists now agree with Mr. Gold, saying they believe actuaries are routinely underestimating the cost of providing governmental pensions by as much as a third.
 The difference ''is going to come out of services, and the services are for the working poor,'' Mr. Gold said. 
 In the private sector, pension funds are highly regulated, and actuarial numbers are less of an issue. But in government, actuaries and the consulting firms that employ them are starting to draw lawsuits in places like Alaska, San Diego, Milwaukee County, Wis., and Evanston, Ill. 
 In Texas, the attorney general is calling for actuaries to be registered, so the state can keep them on a shorter leash. Federal regulators are also flexing their muscles, and the actuarial rules-making board is being pushed to change. 
 Two big problems are being laid on actuarial doorsteps: overly aggressive investing and overly rich benefits. Benefits can go off the scale because widely used actuarial methods tend to make them look inexpensive. And this tends to encourage aggressive investing, because the greater the risk in the portfolio, the less costly it can seem to provide the benefits.
 ''Actuarial assumptions based on misinformation are a recipe for disaster,'' said the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott. 
 After the Fort Worth pension fund was found to have a crushing $410 million deficit, Mr. Abbott sent his staff to dig through more than a decade's worth of documents, to find out why. They found that in 1990, an actuary had calculated that the city could put less money into the pension fund and increase workers' benefits simultaneously -- without making a dent in the fund -- if he assumed that the fund would earn 10.23 percent a year on its investments.
 This worked on paper but not in the real world. In reality, Fort Worth actually lost money on its pension investments that year. And the new benefits did, in fact, have a cost. But the city forged ahead, armed with an actuarial opinion letter stating that ''the numbers are correct.'' It generously sweetened public workers' benefits five times in subsequent years. 
 From time to time, the actuary issued muted warnings, but he was ignored. He also began tweaking other numbers in his calculations, which kept the plan looking viable on paper. Meanwhile, the imbalances in the pension fund compounded. 
 ''It went bust,'' said David C. Mattax, the attorney general's chief of financial litigation.
 Fort Worth is now trying to come up with a reform package to bring the city pension fund back into balance. It is struggling, though, because its proposals are expensive, and some have been found unconstitutional.
 Something similar happened in New Jersey. In 1994, the state needed money, and it made actuarial changes that allowed it to avoid putting billions of dollars into its pension fund. The state then spent the money on other things. 
 Members of the pension oversight board resigned in protest, and employee groups sued, but an actuary for the state provided a detailed opinion letter saying the new method ''will securely fund the present benefits'' and even produce a modest surplus. 
 Two years later, a state senate committee called back the actuary, Robert D. Baus, for questioning, to make sure all was well. Senator Peter A. Inverso noted that a $4 billion deficit had appeared in the pension fund. ''That frightens me,'' he said. But Mr. Baus said that while the deficit had grown, ''it does not change the fact that the system is funded.'' He said New Jersey would have to close the shortfall at some point, but in the meantime, ''it does not mean that there is not enough money to cover the liabilities right now. There is more than enough.'' 
 No one asked exactly when the shortfall would have to be closed. Instead, legislators kept withholding pension contributions, even as they increased benefits again and again. Over the years the imbalances in the fund finally snowballed. 
 Now the fund is so deep in the red that Governor Jon S. Corzine's administration cannot find the cash to catch back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.
 Alaska is also struggling with a sick pension fund, and complaining its actuary got it into trouble. In Alaska, the state pension fund pays for retirees' health care as well as pension benefits. The actuarial firm that crunched the numbers for the plan, Mercer, made the assumption that health care inflation would fall to 4.5 percent by 2009. Instead, health care costs have gone up. 
 The difference looks small in percentage terms, but multiplied over many years, and 80,000 workers and retirees, it is enormous. Alaska has sued Mercer for $1.8 billion, arguing that it ''failed to take into account real-world data,'' and, therefore, allowed the state to make unreasonably low contributions. 
 Mercer has said that it did nothing wrong, and that Alaska is trying to blame it for investment losses and other factors beyond its control. 
 Mercer is also being sued by Milwaukee County, where the pension fund has been draining the budget for years. The county accuses Mercer of underestimating the cost of new benefits that were promised in 2001. Mercer says the county caused the problems itself, through its mismanagement. 
 In Evanston, Ill., a former actuary has been accused of using aggressive assumptions about such things as investment returns, after a new actuary discovered a big shortfall. The former actuary has said his assumptions were valid and the plan had weakened because it was highly leveraged.
 San Diego's official numbers produced by an outside actuarial firm were found to be so misleading that the S.E.C. sanctioned the city for securities fraud. The city sued the actuarial firm, which settled. 
 The New York State Legislature has dropped several proposed pension enhancements since lawmakers learned that the actuary, whose opinion was that the cost of the benefits would be zero, was being paid by a labor group. The actuary said his assumptions were within acceptable ranges. But the state's actuarial methods continue to be contentious, showing the pension fund is fully funded even when markets turn down. 
 Actuaries worry their profession cannot withstand too many large lawsuits. The board that writes actuarial standards has been working on revisions in how to make economic assumptions. 
 But change is coming at a creep. There are still a large number of actuaries for public plans who vigorously defend current methods. 
 In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service is seeking to intervene. It is an active regulator of corporate pension funds, but has seldom been involved with public plans until recently. At a recent informational event, I.R.S. officials explained that they wanted to help, and would send out an anonymous questionnaire.
 ''The law in this area is complex, and mistakes do happen,'' said Joyce Kahn of the I.R.S.'s Employee Plans Voluntary Compliance division. ''They happen all the time.'' She said errors cost much less if they are corrected right at the beginning. 
 Many public fund officials, however, have resisted cooperating with the I.R.S., citing states' rights doctrine.

HEADLINE: More Glory: Talking Baseball, From the '50s and '60s

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MAHLER. 
Jonathan Mahler, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, is the author of ''Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics, and the Battle for the Soul of a City.''

 BODY:
WE WOULD HAVE PLAYED FOR NOTHING 
 Baseball Stars of the 1950s and 1960s Talk About the Game They Loved 
 By Fay Vincent 
 Illustrated. 327 pages. Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 Bart Giamatti, the former commissioner of Major League Baseball, was fond of saying that the history of the game was oral. This may sound somewhat counterintuitive, considering how much great literature the national pastime has produced. But there is an essential truth to Giamatti's words. For baseball lovers nothing is more delicious than the firsthand stories of those who lived the dream and made it to the big leagues.
 Nobody understood this better than Lawrence S. Ritter, an economics professor who crisscrossed the country in the 1960s with a reel-to-reel tape recorder, interviewing ex-ballplayers from the early 20th century for his oral history, ''The Glory of Their Times,'' probably the greatest baseball book ever written. Fay Vincent, a former commissioner of baseball himself, makes no secret of his debt to Mr. Ritter, citing ''Glory'' as his inspiration in the opening sentence of the brief introduction to ''We Would Have Played for Nothing.'' 
 And yet these are two fundamentally different books. Unlike ''The Glory of Their Times,'' which brought to life a distant period and the forgotten baseball men who inhabited it, ''We Would Have Played for Nothing'' taps into the pre-existing nostalgia surrounding the game's most celebrated era. Perhaps no single event is more emblematic of these golden years of baseball -- cue the black-and-white footage of flannel-clad ballplayers and fans in fedoras -- than Bobby Thomson's ''Shot Heard 'Round the World'' for the New York Giants. Mr. Vincent interviews the pitcher who, in 1951, served up the most famous gopher ball in baseball history, the Brooklyn Dodgers' Ralph Branca. He recalls being greeted at his car after the game by a cousin of his wife's, not coincidentally a priest. (In response to Mr. Branca's obvious question, ''Why me?,'' the cousin answered, ''God chose you because he knew your faith would be strong enough to bear this cross.'')
 If Mr. Vincent's goal was to land big interviews, he has succeeded. All 11 of his subjects were prominent players in their day, and he never misses an opportunity to ask them about their even more famous teammates. (Among other things, we learn from Mickey Mantle's best friend, Whitey Ford, not exactly the most objectively reliable source, that Mantle wasn't really such a big drinker after all.) 
 These are the least engaging moments in ''We Would Have Played for Nothing,'' the second volume in Mr. Vincent's continuing oral history project. Much more enjoyable, not to mention resonant, are the personal, even quotidian, anecdotes, whether it's the Brooklyn pitcher Carl Erskine recalling ''this magic feeling that I had something special'' as a boy playing catch with his father in Anderson, Ind., or the Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts remembering being summoned from bed to the lobby of a hotel in Hagerstown, Md., where his minor-league team and manager greeted him with the news that he'd been called up by the big-league club and a pen and pencil set engraved with his name and the word ''Phillies.'' 
 A couple of broader themes appear and reappear throughout the book, including that of money. During the 1950s and '60s, the final two decades before the advent of free agency, baseball salaries were still artificially suppressed by the game's feudal ''reserve system,'' which kept players tied in perpetuity to the teams that first signed them. For even the most productive ballplayers, this necessitated finding other sources of income. Brooks Robinson, the Baltimore Orioles third baseman, describes spending his winters on the banquet circuit, at $25 a pop. To Whitey Ford, who was broke when he retired from the Yankees, being voted into the Hall of Fame wasn't simply an honor; it was a financial boon, sending the price of his autograph soaring at baseball-card shows.
 The early integration of the game -- Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier in 1947 -- is another recurring theme. Here, one of the limitations of the form is glaringly obvious. Mr. Vincent interviews the Milwaukee Braves pitcher Lew Burdette, who once reportedly shouted racial epithets at Robinson after he bunted on him during a game. Burdette, who died last year, tells Mr. Vincent that this never happened -- ''I said to him the same thing I would have said to my brother, you know: 'You dirty bunting so-and-so' '' -- and that he and Robinson eventually cleared up the matter in private. 
 This very well may be true, but as far as I know, Robinson never spoke about this reconciliation, nor have I ever read anything else to support Burdette's claim that the whole thing was just a misunderstanding. What's more, Burdette was involved in a separate but similarly racially charged incident with the Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella, which goes unaddressed. 
 In other words, the historical record should be left to the historians. And anyway, as far as baseball oral histories are concerned, the most fruitful line of questioning may be the least controversial. There's plenty of evidence to prove the point right here in this entertaining book. Consider the Giants shortstop Bill Rigney reflecting on his first game at the Polo Grounds:
 ''I said if there's a Lord in heaven, let him hit the first ball down to me so I'll get it over with. Well, the batter hit it right through the box, and I went over and sucked it up and threw him out, and I said: 'Hey, this looks like it's got a chance, you know. Hey, I may be all right up here.' ''

HEADLINE: In Milan, a Diva Finds a Home

BYLINE: By ERIC SYLVERS

 BODY:
MILAN
 If you believe in destiny, it was only to be expected that Madelyn Renee would live on the Via Mascagni.
 Just before Ms. Renee, an American soprano, moved into the apartment on that street, she played the lead character in Pietro Mascagni's 19th-century opera La Cavalleria Rusticana. (She also sang the role for the climactic scene of ''The Godfather Part III.'')
 But, belief in destiny aside, Ms. Renee and her husband, Alberto Saravalle, a lawyer in Milan, began renting their five-bedroom four-bath apartment in 2005. ''We decided to rent because we didn't really know if we wanted to stay in Milan,'' Ms. Renee said on a recent morning, sitting near a grand piano covered with framed photos of herself in various opera roles. 
 A Boston native, Ms. Renee came to Italy 25 years ago to study opera and performed as Madelyn Monti, using her first husband's last name.
 ''We wanted five bedrooms and to have that in Milan you have to spend 2 or 3 million euros,'' said Ms. Renee, who at one point broke into song to demonstrate to a visitor the ''pureness'' of Italian vowels. ''That's a lot of money. We weren't sure this was going to be the apartment for the rest of our lives, and we didn't want to spend that much money without knowing.'' 
 ''I don't think you get what you pay for in Milan,'' she added. ''For what a two-bedroom apartment costs here, you can get a house with a pool in Arizona.'' 
 In lieu of the house and pool, Ms. Renee and Mr. Saravalle have a 400-square-meter (4,400-square-foot) apartment with a living room naturally lighted from a series of large windows. The room has a coffee table full of opera books and two large framed photographs by the German photographer Candida Hofer, one an enormous view of the interior of La Scala, the famous Milanese opera house.
 The fifth-floor apartment also has a den, a kitchen and a dining room that seats 10. Two separate corridors give access to the bedrooms and bathrooms.
 Among the pictures on the piano is one of Ms. Renee and the renowned tenor Luciano Pavarotti -- she was his assistant for almost a decade and performed with him in many operas. There are also photos of her meeting President Jimmy Carter at the White House and a picture of her with Francis Ford Coppola, who directed her in the finale of his ''Godfather'' series. 
 The apartment is on a busy street off Piazza San Babila, one of Milan's central squares. 
 Together with Mr. Saravalle, Ms. Renee, who had been living in a small town 24 kilometers (15 miles) outside Milan, decided to limit the search to the San Babila neighborhood because Mr. Saravalle wanted to be within walking distance of his office. (Ms. Renee has one son from a previous marriage; Mr. Saravalle has a son and a daughter.)
 The apartment is the first one they saw, though they continued looking for a month before signing a rental contract. It doesn't have everything the couple wanted. ''I would have liked to have a huge terrace,'' Ms. Renee said, adding, ''You could sit out and eat while surrounded by enough plants and trees to forget that you are in the city.'' 
 She also wanted a working fireplace. The rental agent had told her the one in the apartment was operational, but after they moved in, the couple discovered the chimney was sealed with concrete.
 Ms. Renee and her husband have done as much remodeling as was allowed by the rental contract, although they were not able to redo the bathrooms and are still furnishing the master bedroom.
 ''You have to live in a house for a while to know what needs to be done,'' she said. ''You think you want the house to develop in a certain way, but then it develops differently, like with kids.''
 Real estate listings show that similar apartments in the area generally sell for about 8,000 euros a square meter ($1,193 a square foot), which would put the sale value of her rental over 3 million euros ($4.78 million). Ms. Renee would not say how much the couple pay in rent, but based on similar nearby properties, the monthly payment is probably about 8,000 euros ($12,760). 
 As economic growth in Italy has ground to a halt, recent government figures show house sales are down by 12 percent in Milan over last year. But real estate experts say the decline has not affected the top end of the market. ''It might seem counterintuitive, but it is generally easier to sell a very expensive large house rather than a midsized one,'' said Annamaria Lucca, who helps manage Le Case del Centro, a real estate agency that sells and rents costly apartments in the city center. ''If it costs more than 1 million euros, we don't have much trouble selling it because the people who had money before this economic slowdown still have it now.''
 While Ms. Renee said she would not rule out the possibility of eventually buying a smaller apartment, perhaps 225 square meters (2,240 square feet), she said she was enjoying their current location -- even though it is much different from their previous home in a villa outside Milan.
 ''It's obviously two different ways of life,'' Ms. Renee said. ''The advantage of being in the city center is that restaurants, movies and the theaters are in walking distance, but I miss the green and being in a real neighborhood.''
 ''I grew up in Boston,'' she added, ''and everybody had their little house and a garden, and it felt like a neighborhood. You'd bring a homemade apple pie when a new person moved into the neighborhood. That doesn't happen here.''

 WITH QUAKE, PREMIER'S PERSONA
 Is Cemented in Popular Lore
 Wen Jiabao of China is widely known as ''the crying prime minister,'' although he prefers to be called ''Grandpa Wen.'' Over the past week, Mr. Wen has hollered out words of encouragement to those trapped beneath buildings and shared tearful moments with orphaned children, becoming the public and inescapable face of a nation's grief. His cultivated image as a ''man of the people'' is rare in the pantheon of Chinese leaders, Andrew Jacobs writes in a news analysis article. PAGE A6 
 HUSSEIN DIPLOMAT GOES ON TRIAL
 Tariq Aziz, the diplomat who served as the public face of Saddam Hussein's regime, appeared in court accused of being part of a ''systematic campaign'' to kill Iraqi merchants, which amounted to crimes against humanity. Mr. Aziz, 72, could face the death penalty if convicted in the 1992 execution of 42 Baghdad merchants who were accused of profiteering on foodstuffs in contravention of the regime's strict price controls.

 U.S. DENIES REPORT IN ISRAELI PAPER
 The White House sharply criticized a news organization for the second time in two days over reports about administration policy toward Iran, dismissing an Israeli report that President Bush was preparing to order an attack on Iran before leaving office in eight months. The White House statement, which rejected a report in The Jerusalem Post, followed an attack on NBC the day before. PAGE A17 
 BASEBALL, MINUS THE CRACKER JACK
 The trickle of young Dutch ballplayers now entering the minor and even the major baseball leagues in the United States is a testament to the enduring popularity of the sport in the Netherlands, where young children took to America's pastime to antagonize the German occupiers during World War II. ''You bat, you run, you catch the ball,'' said one Dutch softball player and mother of two young baseball players. ''It's a bit of thinking, a bit of doing.'' PAGE A14 
 POISON LIQUOR KILLS 110 IN INDIA
 A moonshine liquor containing poison has claimed at least 110 lives in India. A vast majority of the dead came from slums in Bangalore, but several dozen deaths were also reported in nearby rural areas and across the state border in neighboring Tamil Nadu. The episode was as much an indictment of India's public health system as a window into the danger of illegal liquor among India's poorest classes. PAGE A6

 MCCAIN CRITICIZES OBAMA ON CUBA
 In a trip to Florida, Senator John McCain used a speech on Cuba to criticize Senator Barack Obama, who he said was too willing to talk to America's enemies.

Dodd responded on behalf of the Obama campaign, arguing that the country needed a change from the Bush administration's approach. PAGE A26 
 ABORTION LAW STRUCK DOWN
 A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., struck down a state law that made it a crime for doctors to perform what the law called ''partial birth infanticide.'' The panel said the law was more restrictive than the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld last year by the United States Supreme Court. In their decision, they wrote that the federal law imposes criminal charges only when doctors intend at the outset to perform the procedure, while Virginia law also made it a crime for doctors to perform the prohibited procedure by mistake.

 NANOTUBES MAY POSE HEALTH RISK
 Nanotubes, which are basically rolled-up sheets of carbon that can be used to produce materials that are lighter and stronger than steel, are one of the new wonder materials born in the field of nanotechnology. But a team of researchers has warned that the needle-like tubes could pose a similar risk to needle-like asbestos fibers, after injecting tubes into the abdomens of mice produced lesions similar to those that appear on the lungs after inhaling asbestos.

The departure of Mr. Fossella might seem to present the Democrats with a major opportunity, but the party's leaders have yet to agree on a candidate, and disputes have broken out over whether the candidate should come from the Staten Island or Brooklyn side of the district.

 ANGER FOLLOWS PRIESTS' TRANSFERS
 Forty active priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York have been reassigned over the last several weeks, and some of them say that Cardinal Edward M.

 A PUBLIC SECTOR SECRET

 The New York Legislature fired its actuarial consultant last week, which brought attention to one of the public sector's deepest secrets: the benefits paid to public workers on the basis of numbers that are miscalculated, fudged or tabulated with outdated methodology. Fort Worth, Alaska and New Jersey are all grappling with unexpected shortfalls in their pension funds from bad actuarial work. PAGE C1 
 BRINGING BACK THE LIVE AD SPOT
 TiVo has been a blessing for couch potatoes, but advertisers who want viewers to not skip over their commercials have been less enthused.

 IS A COLLEGE DEGREE OVERRATED?
 It is taken as a given that a college degree gives workers better career prospects, but David Leonhardt decided to put that idea to the test. He looked at data from a largely overlooked natural experiment, and found one large group of Americans who have become vastly more educated, while another group has remained roughly as educated as it used to be. (To keep it simple, he refers to the first group as ''women,'' and the second group as ''men.'') PAGE C1 
 WORRIES OVER HOUSING BILL
 The Senate approved a bill that would help homeowners refinance costly loans, and said it would likely help hundreds of thousands of homeowners avoid foreclosure and stabilize the ailing housing market.

 It is tempting in hard times for business owners to make wholesale reductions and take a passive approach while waiting for the economy to improve. But that could deepen the pain.

 Neither Dana Foley nor Anna Corinna knew much about design or business when they turned their flea-market friendship into Foley & Corinna, a fashion label that now has $20 million in annual retail sales. But Ms. Corinna has an eye for vintage fashion, and Ms. Foley is intuitive about how to make new versions of those styles, so customers have sought them out -- as have knockoff artists. A copy of one of their pieces was so exact, a group of designers seeking copyright protection from Congress used it as an example of the pervasiveness of fashion piracy. PAGE H1

 A STAR AND A LESS-STELLAR PAYCHECK
 In the three weeks since its release, the video game Grand Theft Auto IV has made the kind of money usually reserved for major blockbusters, and its main character, Niko Bellic, has become something of a star in his own right.

 TYING THE MANY KNOTS THAT BIND
 ''The Edge of Heaven,'' a German-Turkish drama that won the award for best screenplay at Cannes last year, centers on a pair of mothers, a pair of daughters, a father and a son.

 Jon Lester of the Boston Red Sox threw a no-hitter on Monday at Fenway Park, and his teammates jumped on top of him to celebrate.

HEADLINE: Owners Opt Out of Labor Contract

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Even for very wealthy N.F.L. owners, difficult economic times can sting. 
 But their struggles are relative -- one of their biggest concerns is how much they have to spend to make more money. An indication of the prosperity of the league comes from a figure the N.F.L. released Tuesday. Players, who receive nearly 60 percent of league revenue, received almost $4.5 billion this year.
 Still, owners, who are contending with the soaring costs of stadium construction and renovation, are not feeling quite so flush. They voted unanimously on Tuesday to cut short the collective bargaining agreement, forcing a return to the bargaining table with the players union in an attempt to avoid playing the 2010 season without a salary cap and having a work stoppage in 2011. 
 ''They did do very well on this deal,'' the Pittsburgh Steelers' chairman, Dan Rooney, said of the players. ''It's hard to give back, I know what they are saying. But some of our teams -- I'm not saying they're losing money, but it's hard for them to compete.''
 The current labor deal was struck two years ago, and both sides, clearly concerned about fan reaction, stressed Tuesday that there were still three full seasons to be played before the possibility of a work stoppage.
 The 2008 and 2009 seasons will be played with the salary cap. The crunch time for a new deal is 2010. If a new deal is not done by the start of the league year -- sometime in March 2010 -- the season will be played without a salary cap. Players would also have to wait six years to become free agents (now, they wait four), a poison pill the union is not likely swallow.
 So while rhetoric is sure to fly until then, the two sides will almost certainly not get serious for another two years. Both sides had the option of opting not to extend the agreement by two years, and it has been clear for at least a year that the owners were tilting in that direction. 
 Owners decided to do it now -- they had until November to decide -- in part because they did not want it to be a distraction during the season. 
 ''Really, there was no reason not to do it now, because it isn't working for us,'' said the Denver Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen. ''We might as well get that part of it out of the way, so we can hopefully get into some serious negotiations and get a deal.''
 The decision was expected. When Commissioner Roger Goodell e-mailed Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the union, on Tuesday morning to tell him the decision, Upshaw's written response was: ''Thanks. What a surprise.''
 Owners said they also wanted to negotiate a rookie wage scale -- a hot topic because the top draftees receive deals that dwarf those of veteran players -- and to be able to recoup bonus money from players who are unable to perform under their contracts. Upshaw said the union would not support either idea, and he has already begun discussing with players the process of decertifying the union if no deal is struck. ''What owners are asking us to do is take less than what we're making,'' Upshaw said in a conference call. ''Why should we take less when they're making more? When they say they're not making as much, that's what they mean. They can say they aren't making more, but there's a big difference between that and not making as much.''
 Upshaw said he would have to see audited financial statements to be convinced that owners were facing financial difficulties, a suggestion that Bowlen, who has already met once with Upshaw, flatly rejected. 
 Upshaw said the union was already helping owners who were facing spiraling stadium costs by granting exceptions for some work, meaning that some new revenue-producing streams, like premium seat licensing, would not count toward total revenue.
 Among the ideas owners are discussing to increase revenue is to eliminate the fourth preseason game, in which few starters play, and add a 17th regular-season game, which would boost money made from television contracts. Home field in the 17th game would alternate between conferences each season. 
 ''The players will still play the same number of games, but it may give us the opportunity to put higher quality football out there,'' Goodell said. ''We are not satisfied with the quality of the preseason right now. We'd like to improve on that.''
 When the last agreement was made, owners also had to devise a method of revenue sharing to bridge the considerable gulf between high and low revenue teams, friction that Rooney said still exists, but to a lesser extent than in the past. Rooney says revenue sharing will have to be addressed again in a new deal, although Goodell indicated he did not think revenue sharing was a primary issue. 
 ''As I told the players this fall, they hate paying the players, no doubt about that,'' Upshaw said. ''But they hate paying and sharing with each other even more than they hate paying the players. That's going to always be there.''
 EXTRA POINTS
 Commissioner Roger Goodell, responding to remarks made last week by Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he had no plans to conduct an independent investigation into the Patriots' videotaping practices. ... Starting this year, teams will be fined when their players are suspended for violations of the personal conduct code. The fines, which will be based on the players' salaries withheld as part of the suspension, can escalate if teams have numerous offenders. ... The league plans to issue a fan conduct policy, intended to reduce the incidence of abusive behavior in the stands. The new policy will not include discipline for teams that fail to control rowdy fans. ... The league awarded the 2012 Super Bowl to Indianapolis, which opens a new roofed stadium this season. Few Super Bowls go to cold-weather cities, and the Colts' owner, Jim Irsay, jokingly assured other owners that they would not be hearing another such pitch from him. ...The owners did not vote on a proposal by the Chiefs to restrict the hair length of players.

HEADLINE: Investors Retreat On Gloomy Forecasts

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Tuesday as several reports suggested that the worst may not yet be over in the financial markets or in the broader economy. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.9 percent, its biggest drop in nearly two weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 199.48 points, or 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite was down about 1 percent.
 Stocks have staged an impressive rally since mid-March, and many on Wall Street have been saying that the financial system is on the mend and that the economy is likely to avoid a recession. On Tuesday, that view got doused by a bit of cold water. 
 Grim news and forecasts came from several quarters. Two retailers, Home Depot and Target, reported lower profits for the first quarter. A prominent banking analyst said financial firms would require further write-downs of their mortgage holdings and other securities. 
 ''There is still a lot of overhang in the financial system and the economy,'' said Douglas Peta, chief investment strategist at J.& W. Seligman & Company in New York. ''We are more likely to experience a long U-shaped bottom than a V-shaped bottom that we all hope for.''
 At the same time, news from the inflation front was far from reassuring. The Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale level rose more than expected in April. The report was of particular concern because it showed that prices of goods other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent last month, up from 0.2 percent in March. Including food and energy, the index was up 0.2 percent, compared with a rise of 1.1 percent in March.
 In the futures markets, crude oil prices surged to another record and flirted with $130 a barrel. Crude oil for June delivery closed at $129.07, up $2.02, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 There were signs of improvement elsewhere -- particularly in credit markets, which have suffered the most in recent months. Prices for high-yield bonds and mortgage securities moved higher again, and the cost of short-term credit used by banks and other financial firms fell.
 In a speech on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, offered a cautiously optimistic outlook for the credit markets and the economy. Many analysts took his remarks as an indication that the Fed would not cut interest rates in the coming months.
 Mr. Kohn said, ''Although the current financial and economic situation remains quite difficult, I believe that the most likely scenario over the next year or so is one in which economic activity firms during the second half of this year and then gathers some strength in 2009,'' according to his prepared remarks. 
 The tax rebate checks that the government has started distributing should increase consumer spending, he added.
 The central area of concern for the Fed and investors remains the housing market. Falling home prices and rising mortgage defaults are driving up losses in the financial system and forcing investors and banks to become more conservative in whom they lend to and at what terms. 
 The banking analyst, Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer & Company, said in a research note that the banks she follows would have to increase reserves for losses on investments by $170 billion by the end of 2009. Her report also said that those banks have already taken $70 billion in write-downs related to real estate.
 Some market specialists said her forecast helped drive down stocks on Tuesday. Losses of that magnitude could prolong weakness in the economy by further depressing lending, said Max Bublitz, chief strategist at SCM Advisors, an investment firm in San Francisco.
 ''Are we not going into a deep recession? I don't know,'' he said. ''But I don't see any way that it's not prolonged.''
 Shares of financial stocks in the S.& P. 500-stock index fell 2.6 percent and accounted for nearly 40 percent of the drop in the index. The index closed at 1,413.40, down 13.23 points, and the Dow closed at 12,828.68, with JPMorgan Chase and Home Depot among the biggest losers.
 The 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32, to 100 26/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 3.78 percent from 3.83 percent late Tuesday.
 Following are the results of the auction on Tuesday of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Airlines' Cuts Making Cities No-Fly Zones

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Earlier this decade, city officials in Hagerstown, Md., started making the case to build a longer runway at their airport to lure service by regional jets, instead of the turboprop planes that provided its only flights. 
 Several years and $61.4 million later, the city opened its concrete welcome mat, a new 7,000 foot runway, last November -- two months after the airport lost scheduled air service altogether. 
 Despite its costly investment, a dogged marketing effort by local officials and even help from Congress, the airport has had no luck attracting a new carrier, as the industry struggles under soaring fuel prices.
 ''Could we pick a worse time to go out and get commercial service? Probably not,'' said Carolyn Motz, director of the Hagerstown Regional Airport, which had 10 daily flights a decade ago. 
 The airports have grown quiet in many other communities, too. 
 Financially strapped airlines are cutting service, and nearly 30 cities across the United States have seen their scheduled service disappear in the last year, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Others include New Haven, Conn.; Wilmington, Del.; Lake Havasu City, Ariz.; and Boulder City, Nev.
 Over the same period, more than 400 airports, in cities large and small, have seen flight cuts. Over all, the number of scheduled flights in the United States dropped 3 percent in May, or 22,900 fewer flights than in May 2007, according to the Official Airline Guide.
 And the service cuts are far from over, as jet fuel prices rise, airlines shut down and companies consider mergers, like the Delta-Northwest deal.
 For American travelers, the shift means that they can no longer bank on scheduling flights to reach their destination within a single day, said Robert W. Mann Jr., an industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y.
 ''Everybody expects frequent, convenient, high-quality service with great connectivity to the rest of the world,'' Mr. Mann said. But given the steep rise in fuel prices, which are up 84.5 percent from a year ago, airlines have to make difficult choices on service. 
 Fewer passengers are expected to fly this summer, traditionally the peak season for air travel -- partly because of the soft economy, of course, but the difficulty of traveling may also be a factor. 
 The Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, predicts 211.5 million people will fly between June 1 and Aug. 31, down more than 2 million passengers from last year's record of 213.5 million.
 Flights seem to be disappearing by the day. 
 Last week, Mesa Air Lines, a regional carrier based in Phoenix, said it would shut down Air Midwest, a regional subsidiary, on June 30. The move will eliminate service to 16 small cities in the 10 remaining states where Air Midwest, which had already cut flights, still operated. 
 Eliminating flights is the latest move by the airlines in a cost-cutting drive that also has led to ticket prices climbing 10 times this year and new fees, from charges for checking extra bags to changing itineraries. 
 Almost every major carrier, from American Airlines to Delta Air Lines and US Airways, is crossing cities off its list, leaving passengers with fewer choices than a year ago.
 Some travelers have no choices, but it is not for lack of trying by city and state officials. After Hagerstown briefly lost its eligibility for a government program called the Essential Air Service last year, Maryland's Congressional delegation helped win an extension that allowed Hagerstown, as well as Lancaster, Pa., and Brookings, S.D., to remain in the program until Sept. 30.
 The Essential Air Service program was created in 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, to ensure that communities in rural and remote areas would be linked to the nation's air system. 
 Under the program, the government provides subsidies of about $100 million a year to the airlines, resulting in service to 102 communities. 
 But the subsidies have not risen fast enough to cover the jump in jet fuel costs, and passengers have resisted paying higher prices for plane tickets, prompting carriers to pull out of a number of cities, including Hagerstown. 
 Now, some lawmakers are pushing for more money for the air service program as part of a broader funding bill for the Federal Aviation Administration that is before the Senate. The House passed the measure last year.
 Even with the longer runway, and the federal subsidy, Hagerstown has not been able to persuade another carrier to take the place of Air Midwest, which discontinued its two daily flights to Pittsburgh last fall. 
 Ms. Motz says that is now unlikely to happen before the extension expires, given the time an airline needs to start new service. ''With airlines going out of business and capacity being reduced, it is very difficult,'' she said.
 Lacking flights, Hagerstown residents must drive an hour and a half to Baltimore-Washington International Airport, or face even longer trips to Washington's two airports. 
 Without passenger service, the airport's revenue comes primarily from military and private aviation. 
 ''We would love to have service here, especially since there have been millions of dollars in improvements,'' said Lewis Metzner, a city council member.
 Plattsburgh, N.Y., is also hoping to get more flights. And it has more than just a longer runway -- it has a brand new airport, built on a former air force base. 
 The airport offers three flights a day on a nine-seat Cessna to Boston, via Cape Air, as well as three flights a week to North Carolina on Myrtle Beach DirectAir and four weekly flights to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando on Allegiant, a low-fare carrier. 
 Plattsburgh had a daily flight to Albany under CommutAir, a commuter carrier linked to Continental Airlines that operated 19-seat aircraft. But CommutAir discontinued service to Plattsburgh last year, before the airport moved to its new location.
 Now, the town's only current connection to a major airline is through Cape Air, which has partnership arrangements with Continental and JetBlue. 
 Cape Air service is provided under an Essential Air Service contract that gives Cape Air with a subsidy of $650 a flight, or about $73 a passenger for a trip that costs $94 one-way, said Christopher D. Kreig, the airport's manager.
 But the subsidies have not ensured stability. Cape Air is the third airline in a year to hold the contract. After CommutAir pulled out, Big Sky Airlines served Plattsburgh for just seven weeks, leaving in January, when the airline dropped service to East Coast airports.
 However, Myrtle Beach and Allegiant came in without government assistance, attracted in part by the airport's proximity to Canada, which Plattsburgh emphasizes in its marketing campaign. 
 Mr. Kreig acknowledges the service is an odd mix for Plattsburgh's passengers.
 But Mr. Mann, the industry consultant, sees only one way that small cities like Plattsburgh can attract new business -- and it is probably one that passengers will not like. ''You can profitably fly small airplanes only if the people on them pay very high prices,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about cutbacks in airline service to American cities erroneously included a city among those where scheduled service disappeared in the last year. New Haven, Conn., does indeed have regularly scheduled service. (US Airways has flights at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport.) The article also described incorrectly Myrtle Beach DirectAir's thrice-weekly service at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The airline offers service to South Carolina, not North Carolina.

HEADLINE: An Oracle of Oil

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Arjun N. Murti remembers the pain of the oil shocks of the 1970s. But he is bracing for something far worse now: He foresees a ''super spike'' -- a price surge that will soon drive crude oil to $200 a barrel.
 Mr. Murti, who has a bit of a green streak, is not bothered much by the prospect of even higher oil prices, figuring it might finally prompt America to become more energy efficient.
 An analyst at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Murti has become the talk of the oil market by issuing one sensational forecast after another. A few years ago, rivals scoffed when he predicted oil would breach $100 a barrel. Few are laughing now. Oil shattered yet another record on Tuesday, touching $129.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas at $4 a gallon is arriving just in time for those long summer drives.
 Mr. Murti, 39, argues that the world's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil means prices will keep rising from here and stay above $100 into 2011. Others disagree, arguing that prices could abruptly tumble if speculators in the market rush for the exits. But the grim calculus of Mr. Murti's prediction, issued in March and reconfirmed two weeks ago, is enough to give anyone pause: in an America of $200 oil, gasoline could cost more than $6 a gallon. 
 That would be fine with Mr. Murti, who owns not one but two hybrid cars. ''I'm actually fairly anti-oil,'' says Mr. Murti, who grew up in New Jersey. ''One of the biggest challenges our country faces is our addiction to oil.''
 Mr. Murti is hardly alone in predicting higher oil prices. Boone Pickens, the oilman turned corporate raider, said Tuesday that crude would hit $150 this year. But many analysts are no longer so sure where oil is going, at least in the short term. Some say prices will fall as low as $70 a barrel by year-end, according to Thomson Financial.
 Experts disagree over the supply of oil, the demand for it and whether recent speculation in the commodities markets has artificially raised prices. As an energy analyst at Citigroup, Tim Evans, reportedly put it, trading commodities these days is like ''sticking your hand in a blender.''
 Whatever the case, oil analysts like Mr. Murti have suddenly taken on the aura that enveloped technology analysts in the 1990s. 
 ''It's become a very fashionable area to write about,'' said Kevin Norrish, a commodity analyst at Barclays Capital, which began predicting high oil prices around the same time as Goldman. ''And to try to get attention from people, people are coming out with all sorts of numbers.''
 This was not always the case. In the 1990s, oil research was a sleepy area at banks. Many analysts assumed oil prices would hover near $15 to $20 a barrel forever. If prices rose much above those levels, they figured, consumers would start conserving, suppliers would raise production, or both, causing prices to decline. 
 But around the turn of the century, oil company after oil company started missing predicted production. Mr. Murti, who covers oil companies like ConocoPhillips and Valero Energy, decided to study the oil spikes of the 1970s.
 Since starting his career at Petrie Parkman & Company, a Denver-based investment firm acquired by Merrill Lynch in 2006, he had been conservative in his calls on oil. But by 2004, he concluded the world was headed for a long supply shock that would push prices through the roof. That summer, as oil traded for about $40 a barrel, Mr. Murti coined what has become his signature phrase: super spike.
 The following March, he drew attention by predicting prices would soar to $105, sending shock waves through the market. Angry investors questioned whether Goldman's own oil traders benefited from the prediction. At Goldman's annual meeting, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the bank's chief executive and now Treasury secretary, found himself defending Mr. Murti. 
 ''Our traders were as surprised as everyone else was,'' Mr. Paulson reportedly said. ''Our research department is totally independent. Our trading departments have no say about this.''
 Over time, Mr. Murti was proved right again. Oil crossed $100 in February. Mr. Murti's forecasts now feed into many of Goldman's economic and corporate forecasts, affecting research of companies like Ford and Procter & Gamble. His research is distributed widely among investors.
 ''Even if you disagree with their views, the problem is that Goldman does carry so much credibility,'' said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president for global energy futures at Macquarie Futures USA. ''There are a lot of traders who are going to buy based on their reports.''
 His sudden fame unsettles Mr. Murti. He rarely grants interviews, citing concerns about privacy, and he declined to be photographed for this article. He is not the bank's only gas prognosticator: Jeffrey R. Currie predicts oil prices out of London. 
 Mr. Murti, for his part, discounts suggestions that his reports affect market prices. ''Whenever an analyst upgrades a stock or downgrades a stock, sometimes you get a reaction that day, but beyond a day, fundamentals win out,'' he said.
 Mr. Murti falls into the camp of oil analysts who believe that supply is likely to remain tight because of geopolitical factors. These analysts predict higher prices because production is declining in non-OPEC countries like Britain, Norway and Mexico. 
 The analysts who predict lower prices say there are supplies of oil that the bullish analysts are missing. ''This year will be a year in which supply will be put into the market by stealth by OPEC and by countries we call black-hole countries,'' said Edward L. Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers. China is one example, he said.
 But while oil and gas prices have been rising for a while now, Americans have only just begun to reduce gasoline consumption, so their efforts to conserve have not dragged down oil prices.
 ''The fact that the U.S. gasoline demand can be down and that the U.S. gasoline consumer is no longer driving world oil prices is a monumental event,'' Mr. Murti says. He spends most of his time talking to money managers and analysts, many of whom keep asking him if oil prices will stay high if speculators abandon the market, and says he applauds investors for driving up oil prices, since that will spur investment in alternative sources of energy. 
 High prices, he says, ''send a message to consumers that you should try your best to buy fuel-efficient cars or otherwise conserve on energy.'' Washington should create tax incentives to encourage people to buy hybrid cars and develop more nuclear energy, he said. 
 Of course, if lawmakers heed his advice, oil analysts like him might one day be a thing of the past. That's fine with Mr. Murti. 
 ''The greatest thing in the world would be if in 15 years we no longer needed oil analysts,'' he says.

HEADLINE: Buyout of Penn National May Involve Revised Terms

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Another private equity deal is feeling pressure this week, as the firms buying Penn National Gaming for $6.1 billion begin to jostle with the banks over the terms for the leveraged buyout, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. 
 Penn National, which is being acquired by the Fortress Investment Group and Centerbridge Partners, is one of the few remaining deals from the private equity boom that ended last year. 
 The buyers and their lenders, led by Deutsche Bank and Wachovia, are working to negotiate the final terms of the financing commitments, these people said. The banks appear to be balking at the originally agreed-upon lending terms at the same time that the buyers are considering ways to cut the deal's price, these people said.
 Deutsche Bank and Wachovia have a history of trying to renegotiate their financing commitments; both firms were involved in talks that spilled into court over the fate of Clear Channel's $18 billion buyout.
 A spokeswoman for Wachovia said in a statement: ''Wachovia has not asked for any price or any economic concessions. Consistent with all transactions of this nature, we continue to work through the documentation with our client consistent with our commitment letter. We intend to fully honor our commitment on this transaction.'' 
 The negotiations could delay or even imperil the deal, which was to be completed on June 15. Fortress and Centerbridge have slowed their efforts to gain regulatory approval in Indiana, pending the outcome of financing talks, these people said. 
 Still, the two firms were approved by West Virginia's gaming commission last week. Penn National has 19 gambling operations in 15 jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Missouri, but none in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, the country's two largest casino markets.
 Spokesmen for Penn National, the buying group and Deutsche Bank could not be reached.
 The Penn National deal had been identified by some analysts as a potential candidate for renegotiation. Since the deal was announced last June, Penn National's stock price has remained consistently below the deal price of $67 a share. Shares in the company closed on Tuesday at $43.43. The deal includes a $200 million breakup fee if the buyers cannot get regulatory approval or financing.
 Since the collapse of the credit markets, Wall Street banks have found themselves unable to resell those loans and bonds, facing a potential loss of billions of dollars. Many banks have tried to strike new terms, potentially alienating the private equity firms, some of their biggest clients.
 On Friday, the banks backing the $51.8 billion takeover of Bell Canada -- the largest leveraged buyout in history -- began trying to renegotiate their lending terms. That has set the stage for an acrimonious battle.
 Struck during the frothy heights of the buyout boom last June, the Penn National deal was part of a string of takeovers in the gambling sector. Aztar, which owns the Tropicana casino in Atlantic City, was sold to Columbia Sussex after a long and fierce bidding war.
 But the economic slump and the concomitant drop in consumer spending have left many questioning the financial health of casinos. Aztar, now known as Tropicana Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy protection last month after a string of financial and regulatory problems.

HEADLINE: Seizing the Day In Slippery Times

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS

 BODY:
FOR inspiration on getting through an economic slump, Steve Walker, chief executive of Walker Information, goes back to his roots. His grandmother started the market research and consulting firm that he now heads as the Depression was ending in 1939. At the time, his grandfather was working as a teller at a bank that sponsored radio programs. To bring in extra money for the family, his grandmother had the idea of going door to door asking people about their listening habits and sold the survey results to advertising agencies. 
 Nearly 70 years later, Walker Information, based in Indianapolis, has 300 employees, a global practice and revenue last year of $25 million. Now, as new business activity lags and clients delay work or cut back, Mr. Walker recalls his grandmother's philosophy: ''You're 100 percent in charge of your own behavior and 50 percent in charge of all your relationships.'' 
 In hard times, it is tempting for business owners to make wholesale reductions and take a passive approach while waiting for the economy to improve. But that could deepen the pain. For example, they might eliminate buying equipment that could make them more productive or generate work. Afraid of admitting that their business is slow, some owners fall out of touch with people who could send them referrals. 
 Some owners, like Mr. Walker, find that action not only relieves anxiety but can also lessen financial adversity. Here are strategies that he and other business owners are using to cope. 
 CODDLE YOUR BEST CUSTOMERS At Walker Information, 50 clients make up 90 percent of the business, and lately the company is giving them extra attention, Mr. Walker said. For example, if the company learns that a client is going through a merger or lean times, Walker employees might analyze data in their own files that would be useful and send it along without charge. Last month, Walker played host to clients at a two-day forum in the California wine country. While this affair might seem like an obvious place to trim costs, such events are important to maintaining strong relationships, Mr. Walker said. 
 NURTURE VALUABLE EMPLOYEES When things are slow, workers worry about getting laid off and look for other jobs. As a result, you could lose staff members you depend on to keep up the quality of your brand or to generate new business. To avoid a talent drain, Mr. Walker said that his company would continue offering incentive pay for employees who attract new work or handle important accounts.
 When it needed to cut overhead and build cash reserves, Bowen Engineering, a Fishers, Ind., builder of water-treatment plants, decided to rent instead of buy certain heavy equipment. But it has continued its training programs for some of its 350 employees. ''At the end of the day, the biggest asset is our people,'' said Doug Bowen, the company's president.
 STAND OUT FROM THE PACK As customers increasingly seek comparison bids, business owners find themselves submitting more proposals, getting squeezed on prices and closing fewer deals. In this environment, the best defense is to set yourself apart from the competition.
 Aladdin Plumbing in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which competes with six other companies in the area, tries to stand out by being a resource for consumers. Randy and Erik Gitli, who have run the 32-year-old business since their father, Gerald, retired in 2002, estimate that they spend an hour a day educating customers and prospects on everything from new heating systems and plumbing fixtures to energy-saving devices and rebates from government agencies. (Aladdin supplies the necessary forms.) 
 BE FLEXIBLE AND COMPROMISING Whatever preconceived notions you have -- about your potential audience, the kind of services or products you offer and your price structure, for instance -- bending past practices and policies could improve your results. 
 Aladdin Plumbing is offering interest-free monthly payment plans to existing customers who are renovating without a contractor. And while the company has not reduced its quoted prices, it occasionally accepts a smaller profit to avoid losing a job, Randy Gitli said. 
 In the economic downturn, Reis-Nichols, a luxury jeweler in Indianapolis for 35 years, has done something that might seem out of character: it has been buying gold from people walking in off the street and buying back jewelry from customers who are in financial distress. ''They're going to remember who took care of them,'' said B. J. Nichols, the store's president. 
 STAY IN CONTACT Generally, e-mail or regular mail to clients and prospects is less intrusive than a phone call. Either way, it's best to engage customers with a story or offer relevant information, Mr. Nichols said. For instance, Reis-Nichols keeps a database of customers' birthdays and anniversaries. If someone comes in shortly before such an occasion and shows interest in an item but doesn't buy it, the store's sales staff is trained to alert the person's spouse about this possible gift. 
 Hitched, a bridal boutique in the Georgetown section of Washington, collects gowns that bridesmaids do not plan to wear again. It donates the dresses to an organization that distributes them to high school students who can't afford to buy prom clothes. This service raises awareness of the shop, said Carin Levine, a co-owner.
 STAY VISIBLE Even if business is leaving you blue, it's important to network -- with clients, prospects and even competitors, whom some business owners use as a sounding board and source of moral support. 
 Counterintuitive as it may sound, don't reduce advertising simply because sales are slow, Mr. Nichols said. ''You will actually be heard more in a market where you maintain your advertising and competitors have cut back,'' he said. 
 As more people search the Web for products and services, new, less expensive alternatives to print ads have emerged. Last year, Donna M. Dazzo started Designed to Appeal, a New York company that decorates houses going up for sale. This year, she has budgeted $20,000 for print ads in her markets, New York City and the Hamptons. But so far, her pay-per-click ad on Google (she is charged only if a surfer clicks on the ad), which costs her $250 a month, has generated more calls than print ads, she said.
 Aladdin Plumbing, whose responses from a longstanding Yellow Pages ad have declined, received a favorable rating on Angieslist.com, a home-improvement Web site, after several customers posted unsolicited satisfied reviews. Last year, Aladdin spent $2,500 for an ad on Angie's List, which has more than paid for itself with the revenue it has generated, Erik Gitli said. 
 ACCEPT SMALL ACCOUNTS. Big jobs keep money coming in during a downturn, but the refuge is temporary. Meanwhile, you risk growing overly dependent on certain clients, and you lose your motivation to diversify -- the best hedge in tough times, said Mark Elwood, who operates Elwood Staffing, a 12-year-old temporary staffing firm in Columbus, Ind., with 200 employees and offices in seven states. 
 To make up for the loss of large accounts (like 100 workers Elwood placed at an auto parts manufacturer before it shut down), the firm has gone after small accounts in locations where competitors recently pulled up stakes because business had declined. Mr. Elwood considers this an opportunity to widen his net. ''When things rock and roll again, those smaller accounts may start rocking and rolling again, too,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New Trend in Biofuels Carries New Risks

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
In the past year, as the diversion of food crops like corn and palm to make biofuels has helped to drive up food prices, investors and politicians have begun promoting newer, so-called second-generation biofuels as the next wave of green energy. These, made from non-food crops like reeds and wild grasses, would offer fuel without the risk of taking food off the table, they said. 
 But now, biologists and botanists are warning that they, too, may bring serious unintended consequences. Most of these newer crops are what scientists label invasive species -- that is, weeds -- that have an extraordinarily high potential to escape biofuel plantations, overrun adjacent farms and natural land, and create economic and ecological havoc in the process, they now say. 
 At a United Nations meeting in Bonn, Germany, on Tuesday, scientists from the Global Invasive Species Program, the Nature Conservancy and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as other groups, presented a paper with a warning about invasive species.
 ''Some of the most commonly recommended species for biofuels production are also major invasive alien species,'' the paper says, adding that these crops should be studied more thoroughly before being cultivated in new areas. 
 Controlling the spread of such plants could prove difficult, the experts said, producing ''greater financial losses than gains.'' The International Union for Conservation of Nature encapsulated the message like this: ''Don't let invasive biofuel crops attack your country.''
 To reach their conclusions, the scientists compared the list of the most popular second-generation biofuels with the list of invasive species and found an alarming degree of overlap. They said little evaluation of risk had occurred before planting. 
 ''With biofuels, there's always a hurry,'' said Geoffrey Howard, an invasive species expert with the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ''Plantations are started by investors, often from the U.S. or Europe, so they are eager to generate biofuels within a couple of years and also, as you might guess, they don't want a negative assessment.'' 
 The biofuels industry said the risk of those crops morphing into weed problems is overstated, noting that proposed biofuel crops, while they have some potential to become weeds, are not plants that inevitably turn invasive. 
 ''There are very few plants that are 'weeds,' full stop,'' said Willy De Greef, incoming secretary general of EuropaBio, an industry group. ''You have to look at the biology of the plant and the environment where you're introducing it and ask, are there worry points here?'' He said that biofuel farmers would inevitably introduce new crops carefully because they would not want growth they could not control. 
 The European Union and the United States have both instituted biofuel targets as a method to reduce carbon emissions. The European Union's target of 10 percent biofuel use in transportation by 2020 is binding. As such, politicians are anxiously awaiting the commercial perfection of second-generation biofuels. 
 The European Union is funding a project to introduce the ''giant reed, a high-yielding, non-food plant into Europe Union agriculture,'' according to its proposal. The reed is environmentally friendly and a cost-effective crop, poised to become the ''champion of biomass crops,'' the proposal says.
 A proposed Florida biofuel plantation and plant, also using giant reed, has been greeted with enthusiasm by investors, its energy sold even before it is built.
 But the project has been opposed by the Florida Native Plants Society and a number of scientists because of its proximity to the Everglades, where giant reed overgrowth could be dangerous, they said. The giant reed, previously used mostly in decorations and in making musical instruments -- is a fast-growing, thirsty species that has drained wetlands and clogged drainage systems in other places where it has been planted. It is also highly flammable and increases the risk of fires. 
 From a business perspective, the good thing about second-generation biofuel crops is that they are easy to grow and need little attention. But that is also what creates their invasive potential. 
 ''These are tough survivors, which means they're good producers for biofuel because they grow well on marginal land that you wouldn't use for food,'' Dr. Howard said. ''But we've had 100 years of experience with introductions of these crops that turned out to be disastrous for environment, people, health.''
 Stas Burgiel, a scientist at the Nature Conservancy, said the cost of controlling invasive species is immense and generally not paid by those who created the problem.
 But he and other experts emphasized that some of the second-generation biofuel crops could still be safe if introduced into the right places and under the right conditions 
 ''With biofuels we need to do proper assessments and take appropriate measures so they don't get out of the gate, so to speak,'' he said. That assessment, he added, must take a broad geographical perspective since invasive species don't respect borders. 
 The Global Invasive Species Program estimates that the damage from invasive species costs the world more than $1.4 trillion annually -- five percent of the global economy. 
 Jatropha, the darling of the second-generation biofuels community, is now being cultivated widely in East Africa in brand new biofuel plantations. But jatropha has been recently banned by two Australian states as an invasive species. If jatropha, which is poisonous, overgrows farmland or pastures, it could be disastrous for the local food supply in Africa, experts said. 
 But Mr. De Greef said jatropha had little weed potential in most areas, adding: ''Just because a species has caused a problem in one place doesn't make it a weed everywhere.''

HEADLINE: Genre- Bending Hangout Takes Its Final Bows

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI; Arthur Bovino contributed reporting. Some quotations have been condensed for space. On occasion, a proper name has been used in place of a pronoun.

 BODY:
ALMOST 23 years ago a transplanted young Frenchman named Florent Morellet, the youngest son of the conceptual artist Francois Morellet, took over a diner named the R & L on Gansevoort Street. 
 In Paris he had owned a little restaurant, which had lost more than a little money, and he made friends promise not to let him open a restaurant again. They let him down. 
 He didn't do much to the R & L's proudly grungy looks, keeping the long Formica lunch counter on one side. He put his first name -- the restaurant's name -- in pink neon in the front window. He constructed a menu of French stalwarts and American interlopers that were available virtually round the clock: onion soup, mussels, pate, steak frites, hamburgers, cheeseburgers. And he created an institution that became both a timeline and a time capsule of downtown life.
 Nestled among meatpacking plants and hard-core gay bars, Florent was an anomalously egalitarian enclave beloved in equal measure by celebrities on the A list and hedonists on the edge, and a prism through which certain aspects of the city's evolution could be seen with unusual clarity. 
 On June 29 Florent will close. Its rent was to rise to more than $30,000 a month, said Mr. Morellet, now 54. He started out paying $1,350. The neighborhood, the city and the people who felt it belonged to them were different then.
 FLORENT MORELLET: My father had a major show at the Brooklyn Museum, a retrospective, in February of '85, and I organized a huge party for him, which actually to this day is the yardstick of what should never happen again at the Brooklyn Museum. But for that party I put up a major mailing list of 3,000 names. 
 So I had one luxury because of that -- I knew people would follow me wherever I would open a restaurant. I didn't have to open on Main Street. I could open on a back street, which I wanted to do because it's kind of more exciting, and also a lot cheaper.
 I went many nights to the Anvil, the Mine Shaft. At 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning you came out into an explosion of life, of light, of noise, of traffic jams, trucks honking, meatpackers yelling, ''Hey, Tony, move your truck!'' And the transgender hookers: ''Hey, baby, you want to come have fun?'' And showing a lot of their private parts. 
 You'd come out and just go: ''Oh, gosh! I'm so happy to live in New York!''
 Opening night was in late August 1985. We didn't tell anybody for the first week. We just called friends. And it did build up very quickly.
 HAL RUBINSTEIN (former author of a Details magazine food column): I drove by Florent one night, looked, and thought: ''Wow, cool.'' And then I went in a group of 10 friends. It was one of those rare times when you walk in a place and think, ''Gosh, I could come here twice a week. I belong here.'' You got that sense from everybody who walked in there. It was that whole mode in the early '80s when everybody wanted to be downtown and everybody wanted to be out every night and there was still some innocence left.
 The menu was interesting. It had just enough stuff you wanted, and it was good food for the price. He had just enough French touches like mussels or hanger steak, but the rest of the menu was kind of Continental-ized diner food with just enough French bistro chic thrown in.
 Florent came over. He talked about how he wanted to be downtown and the neighborhood reminded him of Les Halles. He said he just wanted it to be for friends. He didn't want it to be for critics. He wanted it to be for truckers when they delivered food in the morning and club kids late at night.
 MR. MORELLET: I didn't want any press. I was so scared because I'd seen so many restaurants opening with a bang, big media, blah-blah-blah. And it's a disaster.
 MR. RUBINSTEIN: I must have gone in there at least a half-dozen times before I wrote about it. Then the review came out, and I remember being home on a Saturday night, and the phone rang at about 8 o'clock, and it was Florent, furious. Furious.
 MR. MORELLET: After he wrote it I called him and yelled at him and I said, ''Listen!'' I put the phone up to the din of the dining room, which was really loud, and hung up.
 MR. RUBINSTEIN: He basically started with a stream of invectives that went on for five minutes. He cursed me out. I'd betrayed him. Destroyed him. He called me every word in the book. He slammed the phone down. The phone rang two minutes later.
 MR. MORELLET: And then I called him back and I said: ''Come over. We have to have dinner.''
 DARINKA CHASE (beehive-coiffed hostess who has worked at the restaurant for more than two decades): In the front hallway there was a cigarette machine and a pay phone. That was the time. There was no Internet. There was a cigarette machine and a pay phone, O.K.?
 CALVIN KLEIN: It was alive with real downtown character types who dressed every which way: from straight, creative types of all ages, young and old, to transvestites, to probably local prostitutes. It was downtown. It was real downtown.
 That's when they were cutting meat all night long. And that was during the Studio 54 days. We were young and we were having a lot of fun and we were out all night. And we'd end up in the meatpacking district, at the clubs. You went to Florent after the clubs.
 SEAN STRUB (founder of Poz magazine, for H.I.V.-positive people): The first time I went to Florent I had been out very late at night with some friends and we were looking for somewhere to go for breakfast at about, you know, 3:30 or 4 o'clock in the morning. We went down there and it was very dark and we came onto Gansevoort Street and the restaurant was lit up and it looked -- it looked almost like a mirage. It felt magical.
 I remember the tables were very, very close together, so you were sort of seated automatically with strangers. There was a sense of discovery.
 I was there with three friends. They are all since deceased. 
 JACKIE HOFFMAN (actress and stand-up comedian): It was kind of like the halfway house of restaurants. If there was a pre-op tranny or someone who just wasn't finished yet, or a burn victim -- anyone could go in there and not be judged. It had a safe haven quality to it.
 MR. KLEIN: I would see Diane von Furstenberg there, even before she moved downtown. There were uptown people who would go downtown, and they were out late and they needed a place to go.
 MR. MORELLET: Some neighbors said, ''Could you do something about the broken streetlights?'' I said, ''Oh, really, we have broken streetlights?'' It didn't bother me. The fact that it bothered certain people, I liked. It was like having a velvet rope and a bouncer. The darkness was the velvet rope.
 It was a battle to keep some people out. When I got the liquor license after nine months I decided not to do mixed drinks. 
 MS. CHASE: We didn't serve vodka because that was the yuppie drink. 
 MR. MORELLET: We decided to serve mixed drinks when we got into the recession. The recession came in '89-'90, and we had to make more money. But by that time, people were trained.
 DOROTHY LICHTENSTEIN (widow of the artist Roy Lichtenstein): Roy found his dream studio on Washington Street and we moved there in 1988. Florent was really the place. It looked so down-and-out as a place, and yet it had this fantastic varied menu. I usually ordered, in cold weather, vegetarian couscous. And Roy really liked the vegetarian couscous. We might have mussels, however they were prepared.
 After a while Roy always got exactly the same seat in the back of the restaurant because he came every day, and he brought all the people who worked for him: the studio assistant, the secretary. We thought, after a while, maybe we don't need a kitchen in our house because Florent served breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight snacks.
 You may or you may not know that Florent himself is an artist: he makes maps as his art. Eventually he put a map of Liechtenstein in that corner.
 By the late 1980s the Anvil and the Mine Shaft had closed. The Vault, an S-and-M club for men and women, endured for a while, and there were dance bars or offbeat clubs like Mars, Mother and Jackie 60, though not for much longer.
 In 1988 Florent Morellet exchanged vows in a civil ceremony with a longtime partner, Daniel Platten. He learned he was H.I.V. positive the year before.
 MR. MORELLET: I had little doubt. People were upset around me. I don't remember being upset. Closest friends and my mother said to me: ''People are very hostile to people that are H.I.V. positive. You have a business. It's a restaurant. Don't tell everybody about it. It could be very costly.''
 The next day I said: ''O.K., I've thought about it. Thank you. Nice advice, but I'm going to talk.''
 It actually became one of my lines. When customers were aggravating, I would say, ''You know I'm not going to lose one T cell because of you.'' Let me tell you, that really shut them up.
 Nineteen eighty-nine was the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Bastille Day. We decided to do period costume to celebrate Bastille Day. I was Marie Antoinette. In '89 I am 36, so that's still, agewise, O.K., because she was chopped down at 36. In subsequent years we are in uncharted territory.
 TOM EUBANKS (a server at Florent from 1989 to 1992 and the copywriter for its posters and postcards): To occupy our time, we'd take the menu boards down and play with them. We'd start creating these offhand lists, irreverent ones. It kind of became my job. I haven't worked there as a waiter since 1991 or 1992, but I continued to do the boards.
 The boards have always had a theme. And one theme was ''verboten.'' This was in 1991, 1992. So we put a list of things that were forbidden, in our own minds. One of them was ''wearing white shoes to the Lure,'' which was the leather bar around the corner.
 A couple of weeks later we got a letter on Vermont government stationery. And it said: ''My wife and I had the pleasure of being in your restaurant. The food was wonderful. The service was incredible. And where else would I learn that I couldn't wear white shoes to the Lure?'' And it was signed, ''Sincerely Yours, Howard Dean, Governor of Vermont.'' 
 Increasingly, the restaurant wasn't merely a scene for revelry. It was part political salon, part community center, with Florent Morellet and his staff raising money and plotting demonstrations for causes: global, national, local. It was the veritable cafeteria for Poz magazine, whose offices were nearby. Poz began publishing in 1994, the year Mr. Morellet's partner, Mr. Platten, died from complications related to AIDS.
 MR. EUBANKS: We would charter buses from the restaurant and drive down to D.C. for marches. We did two gay rights marches. Two Naral marches. We'd have Dee-Lite and Cyndi Lauper and David Byrne joining us. For $25, people got a trip to D.C. and breakfast and wine. We'd all drink wine before we came back, in the parking lot.
 MR. MORELLET: Calvin comes to the restaurant for a cheeseburger, which winds up costing him $10,000. Because I say, ''Oh, Calvin, I would love for you to be on the host committee for Save Gansevoort Market, and could you also sponsor it?'' 
 MR. KLEIN: He would always talk about some cause he was promoting. He got me to sign on to something -- I didn't know what I was signing on to. It turned out it was to protest the Richard Meier buildings that were going up in the neighborhood. And I was already committed to being on three floors of the Meier buildings. And now I was on a list protesting them!
 The Richard Meier buildings, where Perry Street met the West Side Highway, were a sign of how much money was flooding downtown. Closer to Florent, the clothing store Jeffrey opened in late 1999. And a few months after that came the restaurant Pastis.
 MS. CHASE: I had lived in France for a year or so in the late '90s, and when I came back to the restaurant, that's when I started seeing what I called the New People. And those were people in their 20s, so they were not born or not doing much when Florent had opened. And they were never part of an economy that wasn't booming and about money and about ''I want what I want now.''
 ''What do you mean the grilled cheese isn't on the menu right now, I want a grilled cheese! Can I go talk to the chef?'' You know, that kind of attitude.
 It changed after ''Sex and the City.'' I mean, people who were kind of clueless would come to the neighborhood in their stilettos and trip around.
 MR. STRUB: I remember one time going to Florent and the little cluster of people waiting for tables was kind of rude and obnoxious and elbows-out. And I left. It was not the mood I was looking for when I went there. And that was different.
 SPIKE LEE (filmmaker): I've been going to Florent since 1986, whenever I can. But the whole neighborhood changed. Before it used to be transvestites and transsexuals on every corner. Now? Forget about it. Gansevoort Street, that whole area -- it's crazy. It's like everything else in New York. It's like SoHo and everything else that gets ''hot.'' And I put that in quotations. ''Hot.''
 MS. CHASE: For me when the mac 'n' cheese went on the menu, that was when I thought maybe we're living on borrowed time. Because that's got nothing to do with anything except that young people who are out want mac 'n' cheese. I mean, it's the lowest common denominator sort of thing.
 Just east of Florent, SoHo House with its rooftop pool and the Gansevoort Hotel with its rooftop pool opened. Along came massive and massively tricked out restaurants like Spice Market, Vento and Buddakan.
 The arrival of new, trend-seeking customers did not wholly alter Florent's allure for a surprising variety of New Yorkers and visitors. It was a place where Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, might rub shoulders with Bjork. One morning in 2005 the restaurant served as a makeshift studio for Air America, the liberal talk radio network.
 MR. STRUB: We did the 10th anniversary cover of Poz at Florent. I had recently seen a documentary on HBO about Spencer Tunick's work. Spencer Tunick is the artist who gets large groups of people together and takes their clothes off and takes pictures of them.
 I thought, ''God, wouldn't it be cool if we had for the anniversary issue -- if we got a bunch of people with H.I.V. together to have Spencer take a picture of us?'' And immediately I thought that Florent would be a great place to do it.
 We did a number of different photographs and we were all over the floor and on the banquette and at one point I was standing on the counter. We had a pretty diverse group, including a lot of people whose bodies had been really badly altered by the treatments and by the disease, and of course some people who were perfectly buff, and all sorts of shapes and sizes in between.
 MR. EUBANKS: When Air America was broadcast from there, we did a whole postcard on that: it was a red, white and blue postcard, ''Florent Goes Radio-Active.'' It was a picture of him in Marie Antoinette drag with a mushroom-cloud wig. This was around the time the government was claiming that Iraq had nuclear capabilities. You flipped it over and it said, ''Let Them Eat Yellowcake,'' which was for our Bastille Day celebration. We also did a poster version that said, ''Marie Goes Nuke-Ular.''
 The final five weeks of the restaurant's existence, beginning Monday, will be marked with decorations, events and performances that reflect a new theme each week. The themes will be taken from the Kubler-Ross stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, finally, acceptance. Mr. Morellet and many of those around him seem to have already moved to that final stage. They're retrieving and lingering over their favorite snapshots from its past.
 MR. MORELLET: We were fighting my landlord and I was angry and still somewhat in denial until we settled out of court on April 4. When I came to that, when I arrived that day, I wanted to settle.
 It's about moving on. Since that day I've been able to move on and to get my troops at the restaurant to move on. 
 We're going to go out with a big bang. But we're going to go out with an ironic, absurdist, Dada-ist big bang.
 MR. EUBANKS: One of my favorite nights was when Johnny Depp had come early in the shift, and we had seated him at Table 16. This must have been 1991, 1992. It's all such a muddle.
 The other staff and I started doing this thing: ''If Johnny Depp was in a fight with so-and-so, who would win? If Johnny Depp was in a fight with Keanu Reeves, who would win?'' It went on for hours. And then by the end of our shift, around midnight or 12:30 a.m., Keanu Reeves walks in. Johnny Depp was gone.
 Of course we put him at Table 16.
 MR. RUBINSTEIN: Remember, we now look at this kind of French-American bistro as automatic. It's at Balthazar, it's at Cafe Luxembourg -- it's all over the city. It's at Marseille. But Florent kind of did it first.
 MR. KLEIN: I was born in New York, so I'm used to this. I've lived not in every neighborhood but I've lived on the Upper West Side, on the Upper East Side. I've lived down in SoHo, now in the West Village. At different times, in different decades, New York meant different things.
 And I like change. I'm not one of those people who romanticizes things: ''It was better back then.'' But I miss the little shops. There are still some wonderful little shops on Bleecker Street, and you know they will disappear. It's inevitable.
 MR. MORELLET: It was a Saturday night. It was maybe 12:15. The restaurant was packed-packed-packed and Ray Kelly was eating alone at the counter. And suddenly came this loud scream from the kitchen. ''Get your [expletive] hand away from me or I'm going to kill you.'' 
 And then this came louder and louder, repeated something like 15, 16, 17 times. The restaurant had become totally silent. Frozen, fearful silence. A couple of tables were starting to leave the restaurant. And Ray Kelly made a sign toward Josiah, one of our long-term waiters. And Ray Kelly said, ''Do you know who I am?'' 
 And Josiah put his hand on Ray Kelly's arm and said, ''Yes, honey.''
 And Ray Kelly gestured to his belt saying, ''You know I could go into the kitchen, you know, and maybe calm them down.''
 And Josiah said: ''Don't worry, honey, this has happened before. Everything's going to be O.K.''

HEADLINE: On the Road Again? Tricks to Logging On

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
THE Internet may be more accessible than ever, but business travelers often need more than one way to log on to get their e-mail, send and receive files and search the Web for maps, restaurants and other information.
 One increasingly popular solution is the wireless broadband cards that slide into slots on the sides of most laptops, enabling them to gain access to the Internet from most places with cellphone reception. These PC cards, known technically as PCMCIA cards, require software provided by AT& T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless and other carriers that sell the service for about $60 a month for retail customers, who sometimes must sign a two-year contract. 
 Though the cards are convenient, business travelers find that the average speeds -- which are roughly equal to a slow D.S.L. line or a fast dial-up connection -- are not fast enough to handle large documents, video downloads and other data-heavy uses. So they will also often search for a speedier, more reliable WiFi hot spot or use broadband connections in hotel rooms. 
 While many WiFi hot spots are faster, they are often more vulnerable than wireless broadband cards, which have far more secure connections. 
 Because no single connection seems to meet every traveler's needs, businesspeople carry many devices, each with its own cost. Smaller companies like Lee Technologies, in Fairfax, Va., do not have the power of a corporation to negotiate better deals with carriers, said George Newstrom, its president. As a result, he and other employees look for WiFi hot spots rather than using hotel room broadband services, which can cost from $10 to $15 a day.
 ''Many towns have free WiFi, and that's our No. 1 choice,'' he said. ''Free is the best price.''
 ''If you're going to do heavy-duty work, you have to be on a cable connection,'' added Mr. Newstrom, whose employees often send blueprints and other large data files.
 Still, prices for wireless broadband services are slowly dropping, thanks to stiff competition for business customers, who typically spend more than retail customers. Carriers are also cutting prices on their international data plans, which are usually priced on the amount of data sent and received.
 Carriers like Sprint, for instance, have introduced unlimited data and calling plans for cellphones, starting at $99.99, and are subsidizing the cost of PC cards, BlackBerrys and other devices. Some carriers, including AT&T, sell WiFi access plans that can be added to broadband and cellphone plans. The company offers access to 17,000 hot spots in the United States to its WiFi customers.
 ''Carriers recognize that just like with mobile phones, they want to remove the impediments to using their services,'' said Charles S. Golvin, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research. ''And as the carriers see more customers take their service, the cost of the PC cards and other hardware will go down.''
 The most popular PC cards slide into the sides of laptops. But some thinner laptops do not have slots, so Verizon Wireless and other carriers also sell devices that plug into U.S.B. ports.
 About 5 percent of cellphone subscribers also have a wireless broadband plan, industry analysts say.
 That number will grow, the analysts say, as Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers include in their laptops wireless broadband chips that remove the need for separate PC cards. The chips are like those in laptops that search automatically for WiFi connections.
 However, unlike WiFi, which is an open standard, wireless broadband services are unique to each cellphone carrier. That means that, before they buy, laptop users must tell manufacturers which carrier's chip to include.
 Cellphone carriers also constantly upgrade their data networks, which means that the chips installed in laptops may become obsolete.
 The solution may be a new chip, which is being introduced this year by Qualcomm; it supports several wireless broadband standards offered by Verizon Wireless, Sprint and AT&T and carriers overseas. That will give laptop users the flexibility to switch providers without having to upgrade their computers.

HEADLINE: Actuaries Scrutinized On Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
By firing its actuarial consultant last week, the New York State Legislature shone a light on one of the public sector's deepest secrets: All across the country, states and local governments are promising benefits to public workers on the basis of numbers that make little economic sense.
 The numbers are off-base for a variety of reasons. Sometimes there is a glaring conflict of interest, as there was in Albany, where the consultant was being paid by the workers seeking richer benefits. More often, there is subtle pressure on the actuary to come up with projections that make the pension fund look good. 
 Most of all, public pension actuaries use old methods that have fallen far out of sync with the economic mainstream. That does not necessarily mean their figures are wrong, but it does make them vulnerable to distortion, misunderstanding and abuse. 
 ''Financial burdens have been hidden'' as a result, said Jeremy Gold, a New York actuary and economist who was one of the first to call attention to the gap between actuarial figures and economic reality. Many economists now agree with Mr. Gold, saying they believe actuaries are routinely underestimating the cost of providing governmental pensions by as much as a third.
 The difference ''is going to come out of services, and the services are for the working poor,'' Mr. Gold said. 
 In the private sector, pension funds are highly regulated, and actuarial numbers are less of an issue. But in government, actuaries and the consulting firms that employ them are starting to draw lawsuits in places like Alaska, San Diego, Milwaukee County, Wis., and Evanston, Ill. 
 In Texas, the attorney general is calling for actuaries to be registered, so the state can keep them on a shorter leash. Federal regulators are also flexing their muscles, and the actuarial rules-making board is being pushed to change. 
 Two big problems are being laid on actuarial doorsteps: overly aggressive investing and overly rich benefits. Benefits can go off the scale because widely used actuarial methods tend to make them look inexpensive. And this tends to encourage aggressive investing, because the greater the risk in the portfolio, the less costly it can seem to provide the benefits.
 ''Actuarial assumptions based on misinformation are a recipe for disaster,'' said the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott. 
 After the Fort Worth pension fund was found to have a crushing $410 million deficit, Mr. Abbott sent his staff to dig through more than a decade's worth of documents, to find out why. They found that in 1990, an actuary had calculated that the city could put less money into the pension fund and increase workers' benefits simultaneously -- without making a dent in the fund -- if he assumed that the fund would earn 10.23 percent a year on its investments.
 This worked on paper but not in the real world. In reality, Fort Worth actually lost money on its pension investments that year. And the new benefits did, in fact, have a cost. But the city forged ahead, armed with an actuarial opinion letter stating that ''the numbers are correct.'' It generously sweetened public workers' benefits five times in subsequent years. 
 From time to time, the actuary issued muted warnings, but he was ignored. He also began tweaking other numbers in his calculations, which kept the plan looking viable on paper. Meanwhile, the imbalances in the pension fund compounded. 
 ''It went bust,'' said David C. Mattax, the attorney general's chief of financial litigation.
 Fort Worth is now trying to come up with a reform package to bring the city pension fund back into balance. It is struggling, though, because its proposals are expensive, and some have been found unconstitutional.
 Something similar happened in New Jersey. In 1994, the state needed money, and it made actuarial changes that allowed it to avoid putting billions of dollars into its pension fund. The state then spent the money on other things. 
 Members of the pension oversight board resigned in protest, and employee groups sued, but an actuary for the state provided a detailed opinion letter saying the new method ''will securely fund the present benefits'' and even produce a modest surplus. 
 Two years later, a state senate committee called back the actuary, Robert D. Baus, for questioning, to make sure all was well. Senator Peter A. Inverso noted that a $4 billion deficit had appeared in the pension fund. ''That frightens me,'' he said. But Mr. Baus said that while the deficit had grown, ''it does not change the fact that the system is funded.'' He said New Jersey would have to close the shortfall at some point, but in the meantime, ''it does not mean that there is not enough money to cover the liabilities right now. There is more than enough.'' 
 No one asked exactly when the shortfall would have to be closed. Instead, legislators kept withholding pension contributions, even as they increased benefits again and again. Over the years the imbalances in the fund finally snowballed. 
 Now the fund is so deep in the red that Governor Jon S. Corzine's administration cannot find the cash to catch back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.
 Alaska is also struggling with a sick pension fund, and complaining its actuary got it into trouble. In Alaska, the state pension fund pays for retirees' health care as well as pension benefits. The actuarial firm that crunched the numbers for the plan, Mercer, made the assumption that health care inflation would fall to 4.5 percent by 2009. Instead, health care costs have gone up. 
 The difference looks small in percentage terms, but multiplied over many years, and 80,000 workers and retirees, it is enormous. Alaska has sued Mercer for $1.8 billion, arguing that it ''failed to take into account real-world data,'' and, therefore, allowed the state to make unreasonably low contributions. 
 Mercer has said that it did nothing wrong, and that Alaska is trying to blame it for investment losses and other factors beyond its control. 
 Mercer is also being sued by Milwaukee County, where the pension fund has been draining the budget for years. The county accuses Mercer of underestimating the cost of new benefits that were promised in 2001. Mercer says the county caused the problems itself, through its mismanagement. 
 In Evanston, Ill., a former actuary has been accused of using aggressive assumptions about such things as investment returns, after a new actuary discovered a big shortfall. The former actuary has said his assumptions were valid and the plan had weakened because it was highly leveraged.
 San Diego's official numbers produced by an outside actuarial firm were found to be so misleading that the S.E.C. sanctioned the city for securities fraud. The city sued the actuarial firm, which settled. 
 The New York State Legislature has dropped several proposed pension enhancements since lawmakers learned that the actuary, whose opinion was that the cost of the benefits would be zero, was being paid by a labor group. The actuary said his assumptions were within acceptable ranges. But the state's actuarial methods continue to be contentious, showing the pension fund is fully funded even when markets turn down. 
 Actuaries worry their profession cannot withstand too many large lawsuits. The board that writes actuarial standards has been working on revisions in how to make economic assumptions. 
 But change is coming at a creep. There are still a large number of actuaries for public plans who vigorously defend current methods. 
 In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service is seeking to intervene. It is an active regulator of corporate pension funds, but has seldom been involved with public plans until recently. At a recent informational event, I.R.S. officials explained that they wanted to help, and would send out an anonymous questionnaire.
 ''The law in this area is complex, and mistakes do happen,'' said Joyce Kahn of the I.R.S.'s Employee Plans Voluntary Compliance division. ''They happen all the time.'' She said errors cost much less if they are corrected right at the beginning. 
 Many public fund officials, however, have resisted cooperating with the I.R.S., citing states' rights doctrine.

HEADLINE: Germany: Investor Confidence Falls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
German investor confidence declined for a second straight month as rising inflation, the euro's strength and high oil prices curtailed expectations, a closely watched survey showed. The survey, the ZEW institute's monthly index, fell to minus 41.4 points in May, from minus 40.7 points in April and from minus 32 in March. The index measures investors' expectations for the German economy in the next six months. ''On the one hand, economic expectations for the next six months for the United States and consequently also for the German export industry have increased considerably,'' it said. ''On the other hand, inflationary risks remain high. This should negatively affect private consumption in Germany.''

HEADLINE: Good Reading With Mellow Aftertaste

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
GASOLINE? Shooting past $4 a gallon. Airfare? Similar trajectory. The dollar? Stuck at the bottom. Summer? A shady spot in the park and a good book is sounding awfully attractive.
 For wine lovers, a raft of absorbing new books will help ease the economic blues. 
 The season's wine reading cannot get off to a better start than with The Billionaire's Vinegar: The Mystery of the World's Most Expensive Bottle of Wine (Crown, $24.95), by Benjamin Wallace, one of the rare books on wine that transcends the genre. 
 Mr. Wallace, a journalist, traces the murky history of the Jefferson wines, bottles of Bordeaux said to have belonged to Thomas Jefferson that were auctioned off in the 1980s for extraordinary prices. Their provenance, though, is impossible to establish. Are they real? Or part of an elaborate fraud?
 In his deftly told account, Mr. Wallace leads us into the world of the big, swinging collectors, men (invariably) who measure their stature by the size of their cellars and the number of very old wines they've made their own.
 It's peopled with outsized characters, like the eager-to-believe auctioneer and writer Michael Broadbent, whose access to the wines of the superwealthy depends in part on how he assesses their collections; Hardy Rodenstock, a buccaneer with an uncanny ability to turn up precious old bottles; Bill Koch, a billionaire American yachtsman with an urge to litigate; and Lloyd Flatt, an aerospace consultant with an eye patch who, when his collection outgrew his New Orleans town house, simply bought the house next door for his wine.
 Though the story is the collector's world, the subject is also greed and how it can contort reality to fit one's desires. It's been optioned for Hollywood. I hope the movie's as good as the book.
 Clive Coates's monumental new work, The Wines of Burgundy (University of California Press, $60), is not the same sort of page turner, but it's a solid, in-depth reference on Burgundy -- the best, in fact, since Mr. Coates's own ''Cote d'Or'' (University of California Press, 1997). 
 Mr. Coates, a British wine writer who now makes his home in Burgundy, is perfectly placed to navigate the dauntingly complicated curlicues of Burgundian vineyard organization, viticulture, winemaking and producers. Aside from thorough revisions and updates since ''Cote d'Or,'' he has also added chapters on Chablis and the Cote Chalonnaise.
 Writing in short, pungent bites, Mr. Coates comes at Burgundy by looking at the vineyards, the producers and the wines themselves. Those well-versed in Burgundy may disagree with some of his assessments, but for most people ''The Wines of Burgundy'' is an invaluable starting point. 
 The authors of three very personal new wine books share the feeling that the best wines are made as naturally as possible with a sense of place, an approach they believe is threatened by globalization. Yet each makes a point in a way as distinctive as are the wines. 
 Neal I. Rosenthal is a longtime importer and merchant whose first book, Reflections of a Wine Merchant: On a Lifetime in the Vineyards and Cellars of France and Italy (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $24), makes the case in sober and measured prose for the importance of individual, artisanal wines of place. Like ''Adventures on the Wine Route'' (North Point Press, 1988) by the importer and merchant Kermit Lynch, with whom Mr. Rosenthal has a surprisingly rivalrous relationship, ''Reflections'' takes us along for the ride as Mr. Rosenthal samples wines, meets winemakers and finds that trust and honesty can be in short supply.
 Time and again he must negotiate a generational shift among the producers he loves, underlining that while vineyards and terroir may outlive the individual, they also depend on the human element. Like Mr. Rosenthal's wines, ''Reflections'' is subtle, nuanced and rewarding.
 Sergio Esposito is also a wine merchant, an owner of Italian Wine Merchants in New York City. He was born in Naples, where he lived happily until economic circumstances forced young Sergio and his family in 1974 to immigrate to Albany to live with relatives. At first Sergio could not bridge the gap between his life in Italy, filled with the brightness of fresh food, family and wine on the table, and the dour, gray, bland world of Albany. 
 So begins a life of trying to blend the brilliance and authenticity of Italian culture with American energy and vitality.
 Now grown up, Mr. Esposito embarks on a trip through Italy with his wife, two children and his parents, visiting idiosyncratic winemakers like Josko Gravner, Ales Kristancic of Movia, Bartolo and Maria-Theresa Mascarello and Gianfranco Soldera.
 In the resulting book, Passion on the Vine: A Memoir of Food, Wine and Family in the Heart of Italy (Broadway Books, $24.95), Mr. Esposito and his co-writer, Justine Van Der Leun, have constructed a warm, funny and surprising story that brings to life Italy's blend of old and new without sentimental stereotypes.
 Of the three books, The Battle for Wine and Love or How I Saved the World from Parkerization (Harcourt, $23), by Alice Feiring, is more polemic than measured memoir. 
 Ms. Feiring is an uncompromising judge of wine and people who can no more stomach a lover's preference for a wine she abhors than she can the presence of a microwave in her kitchen. ''I have close friends with different politics,'' she writes, ''yet somehow, different palates seemed a greater barrier to overcome.''
 For someone with such definite opinions, Ms. Feiring is both charmingly insecure and, as her title indicates, satirically grandiose. By Parkerization she means the influential effect of the wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr., who for the most part seems to prize the wines that Ms. Feiring most detests. Will the stubborn, idiosyncratic winemakers she loves have no choice but to knuckle under to the Parker influence?
 Nothing is that simple, and Ms. Feiring knows it, but she writes as if she does not want to believe it. ''Those were the pre-Parker years,'' she writes at one point, ''and Burgundy and the wine world were innocent.'' As if!
 If you are not put off by some of her stylistic tics, like assigning nicknames -- Owl Man, Skinny and Mr. Bow Tie among them -- Ms. Feiring is entertaining and passionate. And she knows a great wine when she tastes one.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investors Pull Back, but Not Out of Deals

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
The extraordinarily strong office market in Manhattan in recent years owed its vigor in part to the presence of foreign real estate investors. Now, however, many such investors, even those with deep pockets and a strong currency on their side, are waiting on the sidelines.
 ''Right up until the credit crunch, there was no question that worldwide buyers were flexing their currency muscles and using that as an opportunity to bring in big-ticket trophy properties,'' said Douglas Harmon, a senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, a real estate investment bank based in New York that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo. 
 But Mr. Harmon said that similar concerns were weighing on both foreign and domestic investors now -- namely, the tight credit markets and a weak outlook for the financial industry, which dominates New York's economy. 
 Still, Mr. Harmon contends that many foreign buyers may still be in a strong position once the New York office market heats up again. For one thing, he said, many foreign buyers did not take on as much debt as domestic buyers did during the recent boom times. He said foreign investors also tended to have a longer time horizon than many domestic buyers.
 ''There's a real advantage to having that cultural bias,'' Mr. Harmon said.
 To be sure, foreign investors are still in the market for Manhattan office properties. But they are more circumspect than they were a year ago. They are buying fewer buildings, and often at lower prices. 
 The largest deal involving foreign buyers this winter was the $525 million that Eyal Ofer, an Israeli-born, London-based real estate investor, paid for the Altria Building, a 650,000-square-foot building at 120 Park Avenue, at East 42nd Street.
 But both of the other office buildings that foreigners bought in the first quarter sold for around $150 million. By comparison, foreign investors bought at least 10 office buildings for $500 million or more last year, with five going for well over $1 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real estate research and consulting firm in New York.
 ''There is no question that prices have softened over the last six months,'' said Dan Fasulo, the director for market analysis at Real Capital Analytics.
 Mr. Fasulo said one result of this trend has been a modest rise in the average capitalization rate -- the initial rate of return on a building, expressed as a ratio of the current rents relative to the purchase price.
 In recent years, capitalization rates for Manhattan office towers, sometimes referred to as a building's yield, often fell below 5 percent. That was down sharply from cap rates above 7 percent in the early years of this decade.
 Mr. Fasulo said he could imagine cap rates in the New York office market rising back to the 5 percent to 6 percent range, but he did not expect them to rise beyond that anytime soon.
 The conventional reason buyers accept low initial yields is that they expect to collect higher rents in the near future, as leases come up for renewal. But with companies laying off employees, vacancy rates in office buildings are likely to rise and landlords are expected to be less able to raise rents at will.
 Although Europeans have had a currency advantage against the dollar, Joseph A. Callanan, a senior managing director in the global property advisers group at CB Richard Ellis, said he urges his foreign clients not to focus too much on currency swings.
 ''I always tell my clients if you really want a currency play, you might as well buy currencies and not take the real estate risk,'' he said. ''The currency is just the icing on the cake, but it's not the cake.''
 Middle Eastern buyers, particularly from Israel and the United Arab Emirates, were by far the biggest foreign buyers last year -- snapping up 13 of the 26 office buildings that foreigners bought in Manhattan in 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics. 
 Scott Latham, an executive vice president in the investment sales group at Cushman & Wakefield, said he thought that cash-rich Middle Eastern buyers favored the New York market in part because of the large size of the deals. 
 ''If you have $400 million to spend, you can drop that in one transaction in New York. But if you go to Washington, you might have to do four transactions,'' he said.
 He also said that the shallow pool of credit available now, especially for large trophy office towers, was limiting Middle Eastern investments. 
 ''Like the other players that depend on leverage, they have pulled back their interest'' a bit since the summer, he said. 
 In general, many brokers say, foreign buyers tend to prefer large trophy office buildings, which do not come on the market very often.
 ''Even in an office market as large and liquid as New York's, there are only so many quality properties that become available,'' said R. Stuart Gross, the executive managing director at Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services company in New York.
 Albert Behler, the president and chief executive of the Paramount Group, a company mostly backed by German money and a major owner of office space in New York, said this was certainly his preference. ''We normally prefer trophy properties, which come to market much less frequently,'' he said. ''Once one of these buildings has been sold, it is gone for the next 20 to 30 years.''
 In such buildings, Mr. Behler said, rents tended to be steadier during a recession. He noted that real estate tended to be a lagging indicator, with rents falling only after layoffs have picked up. He added that he expected office rents to come down somewhat in New York in the next two years.
 But Mr. Behler said he was confident the rents would rise in two buildings Paramount recently purchased. He estimated that the average rents in both 440 Ninth Avenue and 31 West 52nd Street were around 40 percent below the current market rents in those neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Nearly Deaf Professor Teaches English Literacy, One Student at a Time

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C. 

 BODY:
After three degrees, after five universities, after 40,000 pupils, and after 84 years, 10 months and 25 days, John Kuhlman has circumnavigated his way back to the essentials of education: a teacher and a student in a room.
 Decades ago, he was a student, the 6-year-old son of a wheat farmer in eastern Washington, going to a school that fit all 12 grades under a single roof. His earliest memory of academic life is of hiding behind the classroom stove lest he be called upon to wash the lunch dishes. 
 Now, or as close to now as Monday afternoon, Mr. Kuhlman is the teacher, sovereign of a single room in the inconspicuous brick headquarters of an adult English-literacy program here. The adult seated just inches from Mr. Kuhlman, Raul Funes, had come after working an overnight shift doing maintenance at an inn and then attending a morning class at a local technical college. He had been awake for nearly 20 straight hours.
 No pedagogical technique explains why Mr. Kuhlman sat so close to Mr. Funes, or why he peered so insistently into his student's face. Forty years ago, while he was a charismatic professor of economics at the University of Missouri, Mr. Kuhlman had begun inexplicably to lose his hearing.
 With a cochlear implant to capture sound and a practiced skill at reading lips, translating the random noise into words, he had since learned to converse face to face, particularly in quiet settings like his tutoring room.
 Disability enabled ability, or at least affinity. For the last four years, Mr. Kuhlman has been teaching immigrants to read and write English, to listen and speak. Like him, his students are awash in a sea of indiscriminate sound, grasping as he does for comprehension and meaning. In 90-minute individual lessons, Mr. Kuhlman currently tutors 17 students in a week, from Mexico, Thailand, Ecuador, China, El Salvador and Ukraine.
 ''If I were religious, I'd say I've been called,'' Mr. Kuhlman, who is an unpaid volunteer, said during a brief lunch break between students. ''I just fell into it. The wheel of fate, I guess.''
 The workings of fate had him retire from Missouri in 1985, move to New Mexico with his wife, lose her to early death, remarry to a home economics teacher and finally, in the last innocent days of early September 2001, move with her to North Carolina to help care for a grandchild with cerebral palsy. Starting anew in his 70s, he no longer went by ''Dr.'' for his Ph.D or ''Professor'' for his rank. He is now just ''John.'' Fate also moved his students here. They were drawn by jobs in the factories and the fields, trading their own sacrifice for their children's American future.
 Those children, by age 4 or 5, often knew more English than their parents did. Only when the grown-ups felt the financial ground secure for their household -- and sometimes that took 10 or 20 years -- would they sign up for lessons at the Literacy Council of Buncombe County.
 A few asked specifically for Mr. Kuhlman, having heard about him from friends. With 215 students and 90 more on a waiting list, most simply took whomever they were assigned. After the fact, some discovered that they were supposed to learn the English language from a man who was functionally deaf.
 It sounded at first like some kind of cosmic bait-and-switch, except that in practice it worked. For the student, there could be no getting away with slurs and slang when speaking to a teacher reading lips. And for the teacher, there was a sense of the shared struggle to apprehend all those elusive words.
 ''A deaf person, a person with damaged hearing, is exactly like a Spanish speaker or a Chinese speaker in a room full of English speakers,'' Mr. Kuhlman put it. ''If I'm in a room for a cocktail party, I can hear everything, but I can't understand a word. So I'm pretty good at understanding their problem. I've got empathy, sympathy, patience.''
 Mr. Kuhlman offers nothing magical by way of curriculum. He uses standard workbooks, with their vocabulary lists, short essays and fill-in-the-blank sentences. His secret ingredient is the personal touch.
 He knows why Mr. Funes fights sleep during their class. He knows that Jose Cordova, a student from Ecuador, just had a daughter graduate from nursing school. He knows that Adriana Gloria, from Mexico, drops her kids off at school right before her lesson.
 Pointing to the photographs of present and former pupils that adorn one wall of his room, Mr. Kuhlman ticks off the personal details -- who runs a hair-braiding salon, who married a man who owns a bed-and-breakfast, who had to quit the lessons because of a 72-hour workweek.
 ''To teach English, you have to talk,'' he explained. ''And so we talk. And out of the talking, I've become a sort of confessor. They leave here feeling better. And when I have a good day, I leave here walking on clouds.''
 In their eloquently imperfect way, his students agree. ''He has more calm, more patience with me,'' said Mrs. Gloria, 41.
 Mr. Cordova, 50, said: ''When not understand, he explain to me. He's nice people.'' 
 ''He have a lot of passion. He like to listen to any question. I have find he's very friendly.'' 
 As for Mr. Funes, he still tends to nod in affirmation at questions and statements he does not understand. Mr. Kuhlman recognizes that gesture as an immigrant's survival device. And in his chats with Mr. Funes, halting as they are, he has learned some more specific reasons. Before immigrating to the United States a decade ago at the age of 17, Mr. Funes never attended school and could not read or write, even in his native language.
 He has been taking lessons from Mr. Kuhlman for three months now, discerning the difference between ''birth'' and ''bird,'' reading little stories with titles like ''Eddy's Night Out.'' As he recited one at his most recent lesson, he touched the tip of his pencil to each word. Mr. Kuhlman, in turn, brought his pencil to the same point, to the piece of language that formed their human bond.

HEADLINE: Bertelsmann Picks a Publishing Industry Outsider to Head Random House

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
On the day that Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, quelled weeks of speculation by announcing that Markus Dohle, head of the company's printing unit, would take over as chief executive of Random House, industry executives were largely reserving judgment on what it would mean to have a relative outsider in charge of the world's largest publisher of consumer books. 
 Mr. Dohle, 39, will succeed Peter W. Olson, Random House's current chief executive, on June 1. Mr. Olson, 58, who led the publishing division for the last decade, is in negotiations for a senior faculty position at Harvard Business School, according to a person knowledgeable about his plans. Mr. Olson declined to comment. 
The appointment of Mr. Dohle, one of the youngest people to lead Random House, is the first significant executive shake-up since Hartmut Ostrowski took over as chief executive of Bertelsmann in January. Mr. Ostrowski previously was chief of Arvato, the company's printing and services division. In Mr. Dohle, head of Arvato's print unit since 2006, Mr. Ostrowski clearly picked his own man.
 Mr. Dohle, who is described as charming by those who know him, speaks fluent English and will move to New York this summer. He takes over a division with an author stable that includes Toni Morrison, Dan Brown, John Grisham and Salman Rushdie. Along with other important players in the industry, Random House has recently suffered a slowdown, despite best sellers like Mr. Grisham's ''Playing for Pizza'' and ''Women and Money'' by Suze Orman. 
 Mr. Ostrowski acknowledged that Mr. Dohle, who has been with Bertelsmann since he graduated with a degree in economics and industrial engineering in 1994, did not have direct experience running a book publisher, although Arvato Print has many publishing clients. 
 Mr. Ostrowski said in an interview Tuesday that he could have appointed a traditional publisher to succeed Mr. Olson, but he said he wanted someone to bring a fresh perspective to the book division, which is steeped in tradition. ''Markus is a proven entrepreneur within the organization,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. He ''has shown he has been able to turn a mature business into a growing business.''
 Separately, Bertelsmann announced that Richard Sarnoff, the president of the company's digital media investments group, had been appointed co-chairman of Bertelsmann Inc., where he would play a critical role in directing strategy in the United States.
 In a memo to staff Tuesday, Mr. Ostrowski said that Mr. Olson was leaving ''of his own initiative.''
 Last fall, Mr. Olson was out of the office for two months with double pneumonia, contracted on a business trip to China. Mr. Ostrowski said that Mr. Olson had approached him about leaving in January. ''From our perspective, it was not the right time to replace him,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But we could accept that he wants to pursue other life plans.'' 
 A senior Bertelsmann executive, however, said the factors behind Mr. Olson's departure were more complex. This executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because it was an internal personnel issue, said that Mr. Olson's split with the German management began last September, when he proposed dismissing Gail Rebuck, the chief executive of the Random House Group in Britain. This was vetoed by Mr. Ostrowski and Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann's chief financial officer. 
 Ms. Rebuck did not return a call seeking comment. Stuart Applebaum, a Random House spokesman, said: ''I wouldn't dignify it with a comment. I would just label it as gossip.'' 
 With pressure mounting, the Bertelsmann executive said, Mr. Olson began to look for an exit strategy. He hired a lawyer to negotiate a severance package. The company agreed to a deal, but it left some hard feelings, according to this person. 
 Mr. Olson, a former banker and lawyer and a voracious reader, also had no direct experience in the publishing industry prior to 1992, when he took over as chief financial officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell Group, a book division owned by Bertelsmann that was merged with Random House in 1998. Mr. Olson took over as chief executive and became the first American to join Bertelsmann's executive board in 2001.
 Although Random House produced more than 4,000 best sellers in 19 countries during Mr. Olson's tenure, he had a mixed reputation because he often showed a zealous focus on the bottom line. Yet last year, sales at Random House fell by 5.6 percent, and operating profits declined 4.9 percent.
 Mr. Ostrowski said that one year's results did not affect his thinking. ''If someone has a proven record and he only misses his numbers once, you don't get fired for that,'' he said.
 In a letter to employees, Mr. Ostrowski wrote, ''Let me state very clearly: we want to see Random House grow.'' He said in the interview that he wanted the entire company to achieve 4 percent organic growth in revenue each year. 
 According to a senior executive at Bertelsmann, the decision to change the leadership of Random House reached the uppermost levels of the company, which is controlled by the family of Reinhard Mohn. Liz Mohn, Mr. Mohn's wife and a powerful influence, was consulted, according to the executive. She had sometimes tense relations with Mr. Olson, this executive said, and was a champion of Mr. Dohle. Gunter Thielen, chairman of Bertelsmann's supervisory board, was also involved, the executive said.
 The publishers and editors of Random House's imprints, rarely shy about expressing their opinions, were uncharacteristically reserved about the appointment of Mr. Dohle. Several said they would take Mr. Ostrowski at face value when he said that Mr. Dohle would continue to give publishers independence. ''There's every indication that Markus Dohle is looking forward to doing that with a lot of energy and business experience,'' said Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group, whose authors include Danielle Steel and Dean Koontz. 
 Some publishers and agents outside Random House said it was not a good sign that someone without intimate knowledge of the book industry was taking over the venerable house. 
 But others said they were open-minded about Mr. Dohle, especially as he was young and might bring new ideas about digital initiatives and other matters. ''I hope that this man will be a very strong competitor,'' said Jane Friedman, chairman and chief executive of HarperCollins. ''Time will tell.''

HEADLINE: Bertelsmann Picks a Publishing Industry Outsider to Head Random House

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
On the day that Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, quelled weeks of speculation by announcing that Markus Dohle, head of the company's printing unit, would take over as chief executive of Random House, industry executives were largely reserving judgment on what it would mean to have a relative outsider in charge of the world's largest publisher of consumer books. 
 Mr. Dohle, 39, will succeed Peter W. Olson, Random House's current chief executive, on June 1. Mr. Olson, 58, who led the publishing division for the last decade, is in negotiations for a senior faculty position at Harvard Business School, according to a person knowledgeable about his plans. Mr. Olson declined to comment. 
 The appointment of Mr. Dohle, one of the youngest people to lead Random House, is the first significant executive shake-up since Hartmut Ostrowski took over as chief executive of Bertelsmann in January. Mr. Ostrowski previously was chief of Arvato, the company's printing and services division. In Mr. Dohle, head of Arvato's print unit since 2006, Mr. Ostrowski clearly picked his own man.
 Mr. Dohle, who is described as charming by those who know him, speaks fluent English and will move to New York this summer. He takes over a division with an author stable that includes Toni Morrison, Dan Brown, John Grisham and Salman Rushdie. Along with other important players in the industry, Random House has recently suffered a slowdown, despite best sellers like Mr. Grisham's ''Playing for Pizza'' and ''Women and Money'' by Suze Orman. 
 Mr. Ostrowski acknowledged that Mr. Dohle, who has been with Bertelsmann since he graduated with a degree in economics and industrial engineering in 1994, did not have direct experience running a book publisher, although Arvato Print has many publishing clients. 
 Mr. Ostrowski said in an interview Tuesday that he could have appointed a traditional publisher to succeed Mr. Olson, but he said he wanted someone to bring a fresh perspective to the book division, which is steeped in tradition. ''Markus is a proven entrepreneur within the organization,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. He ''has shown he has been able to turn a mature business into a growing business.''
 Separately, Bertelsmann announced that Richard Sarnoff, the president of the company's digital media investments group, had been appointed co-chairman of Bertelsmann Inc., where he would play a critical role in directing strategy in the United States.
 In a memo to staff Tuesday, Mr. Ostrowski said that Mr. Olson was leaving ''of his own initiative.''
 Last fall, Mr. Olson was out of the office for two months with double pneumonia, contracted on a business trip to China. Mr. Ostrowski said that Mr. Olson had approached him about leaving in January. ''From our perspective, it was not the right time to replace him,'' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But we could accept that he wants to pursue other life plans.'' 
 A senior Bertelsmann executive, however, said the factors behind Mr. Olson's departure were more complex. This executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because it was an internal personnel issue, said that Mr. Olson's split with the German management began last September, when he proposed dismissing Gail Rebuck, the chief executive of the Random House Group in Britain. This was vetoed by Mr. Ostrowski and Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann's chief financial officer. 
 Ms. Rebuck did not return a call seeking comment. Stuart Applebaum, a Random House spokesman, said: ''I wouldn't dignify it with a comment. I would just label it as gossip.'' 
 With pressure mounting, the Bertelsmann executive said, Mr. Olson began to look for an exit strategy. He hired a lawyer to negotiate a severance package. The company agreed to a deal, but it left some hard feelings, according to this person. 
 Mr. Olson, a former banker and lawyer and a voracious reader, also had no direct experience in the publishing industry prior to 1992, when he took over as chief financial officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell Group, a book division owned by Bertelsmann that was merged with Random House in 1998. Mr. Olson took over as chief executive and became the first American to join Bertelsmann's executive board in 2001.
 Although Random House produced more than 4,000 best sellers in 19 countries during Mr. Olson's tenure, he had a mixed reputation because he often showed a zealous focus on the bottom line. Yet last year, sales at Random House fell by 5.6 percent, and operating profits declined 4.9 percent.
 Mr. Ostrowski said that one year's results did not affect his thinking. ''If someone has a proven record and he only misses his numbers once, you don't get fired for that,'' he said.
 In a letter to employees, Mr. Ostrowski wrote, ''Let me state very clearly: we want to see Random House grow.'' He said in the interview that he wanted the entire company to achieve 4 percent organic growth in revenue each year. 
 According to a senior executive at Bertelsmann, the decision to change the leadership of Random House reached the uppermost levels of the company, which is controlled by the family of Reinhard Mohn. Liz Mohn, Mr. Mohn's wife and a powerful influence, was consulted, according to the executive. She had sometimes tense relations with Mr. Olson, this executive said, and was a champion of Mr. Dohle. Gunter Thielen, chairman of Bertelsmann's supervisory board, was also involved, the executive said.
 The publishers and editors of Random House's imprints, rarely shy about expressing their opinions, were uncharacteristically reserved about the appointment of Mr. Dohle. Several said they would take Mr. Ostrowski at face value when he said that Mr. Dohle would continue to give publishers independence. ''There's every indication that Markus Dohle is looking forward to doing that with a lot of energy and business experience,'' said Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group, whose authors include Danielle Steel and Dean Koontz. 
 Some publishers and agents outside Random House said it was not a good sign that someone without intimate knowledge of the book industry was taking over the venerable house. 
 But others said they were open-minded about Mr. Dohle, especially as he was young and might bring new ideas about digital initiatives and other matters. ''I hope that this man will be a very strong competitor,'' said Jane Friedman, chairman and chief executive of HarperCollins. ''Time will tell.''

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT.

 BODY:
Kanye West's debut album, ''The College Dropout,'' which came out in 2004, was a concept album. The title referred to Mr. West, then 26 years old and already a successful hip-hop producer. The lyrics pointed out that many of his peers who had finished college weren't doing nearly so well.
 In one monologue, he gives his take on the career ladder for college graduates at the Gap: entry-level position, followed by kissing up to the boss, followed by a promotion to secretary's secretary. ''And boy is that great,'' he says. ''You get to take messages for the secretary who never went to college.'' 
 I'll confess that I'm not one of the 2.5 million people who have bought the album. I was introduced to it when I was giving a talk to some college students a couple of years ago, and one of them asked whether Mr. West was right that a college degree had become overrated. 
 After all, even computer programmers fear outsourcing these days, and recent raises for college graduates have been meager. Yet because economists still insist education is the key to prosperity, the discussion often feels like a muddle.
 Fortunately, though, there has been an enormous natural experiment on precisely this subject over the last few decades. In the experiment, one big group of Americans has become vastly more educated, while another group has not. The two have created an excellent case study. 
 For the sake of simplicity, let's refer to the first group as ''women'' and the second as ''men.''
 From the founding of the country's first (all-male) colleges in the 17th century until just a few decades ago, men received far more education than women. But the two sexes have now switched places in a remarkably short time.
 During the late 1960s and early 1970s, about one out of every three young men got a bachelor's degree. In the years that followed, the share fell somewhat, both because Vietnam War draft deferrals were no longer an issue and because college became more expensive. In the 1980s and 1990s, the share rose again.
 But the shifts have been fairly small. For the last four decades, somewhere between 30 and 35 percent of men have graduated from a four-year college by the time they turned 35 years old. 
 The story is quite different for women. In the 1960s, only 25 percent received a college degree. Among today's young women almost 40 percent will end up with one. At one commencement ceremony after another this month -- be it at Boston College, San Francisco State University or Colby College -- women in caps and gowns outnumber men. 
 The relevant question is how much of a return women have gotten on their education. And the answer isn't especially subtle. The return has been enormous. 
 Armed with college degrees, large numbers of women have entered fields once dominated by men. Nearly half of new doctors today are women, up from just 1 of every 10 in the early 1970s. In all, the average inflation-adjusted weekly pay of women has jumped 26 percent since 1980. 
 And men? Their pay has increased about as much as their college graduation rate -- it's up just 1 percent since 1980. 
 Education obviously isn't the only reason. Gender discrimination has become less prevalent in recent decades, and today's female college graduates are less likely than their mothers and grandmothers to choose modest-paying jobs, like teaching. The decline of manufacturing jobs, meanwhile, has disproportionately hurt men. But research by Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn of Cornell suggests that, over the past two decades, education played the biggest role in narrowing the pay gap. 
 There are two statistics that I think do a particularly good job of capturing this point. The first shows that the gap between the pay of men and women with college degrees hasn't budged over the last 15 years. Full-time female workers with a bachelor's degree made 75 percent as much as their male counterparts in 1992 -- and 75 percent as much in 2007.
 Women still face discrimination, after all, and they're still more likely than men to become teachers. More women also choose jobs that trade some pay for flexibility and reasonable hours. (Whether this is a good thing, a bad thing or neither needs to be a subject for another day.)
 Yet even though the pay gap among college graduates hasn't changed, the overall pay gap between men and women has continued to close in the last 15 years. That's because so many more women have become college graduates and earned the pay premium that a degree really does bring. Across the whole work force, full-time women made 79 percent as much as full-time men last year, up from 75 percent in 1992. 
 To put it another way, women would have made almost no progress in narrowing the gender pay gap over this period if they hadn't been so thoroughly trouncing men in the classroom. 
 And it's not as if women's gains have come at the expense of men. By becoming more educated -- and able to do more productive, higher-wage jobs -- women have increased the size of the economic pie. The economic growth in a country like South Korea, which has made much more educational progress than the United States, clearly demonstrates this. ''If you look across countries,'' says Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard, ''education is the strongest predictor for how quickly the pie grows.'' 
 That said, education can't solve the middle-class squeeze all by itself. Health care costs -- which have been holding down the pay gains of everyone, including college graduates -- need to be brought under control, and the tax code can stand to be more progressive. 
 But education is vital. It directly helps those who get it, and it makes it easier for the country to afford programs that help everyone else. Yet for something that just about everyone in Washington claims to favor, education also suffers from a disturbing lack of strategic seriousness. Republicans haven't been willing to spend enough money on preschool, college financial aid and numerous other areas, while Democrats haven't been willing to hold schools and universities accountable for mediocrity. 
 It's almost -- almost -- unfair to pick on Kanye West. He's dead wrong about education, and his enormous teenage audience makes his words matter. But he isn't the main problem.

HEADLINE: While the Economy Struggles, Profits Can Be Made

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS

 BODY:
WHILE the slow economy has left many small businesses scraping to get by, some enterprises are finding opportunity in the carnage. They include an entire industry devoted to distressed companies. When things are booming, this sector is like the lonely Maytag repairman, who doesn't have much work to do. 
 Other businesses are not as clearly countercyclical, but they offer products or services that are increasingly in demand. And those that are really nimble can capitalize on the sudden needs of consumers or fellow businesses. 
 Here are stories of five small businesses that are thriving in hard times. 
 STANDING UP FOR WORKERS Outten & Golden, a New York law firm that exclusively represents employees, will add three lawyers to its staff of 28 professionals this year to accommodate business attributable to the economic downturn. 
 Contributing to the increase is what Wayne Outten, a founding partner, calls transactional work -- helping employees who are moving into and out of jobs to negotiate with their employers. 
 For those who have been laid off, there may be opportunities to enhance severance packages -- for instance, perhaps their employers could be persuaded to keep them on the payroll long enough to qualify for retirement, medical or stock benefits.
 Employees also seek legal help when they voluntarily change jobs, rather than being forced to leave. Not only should they get job details in writing from their new employers, but they must also comply with commitments to the old ones. Potential considerations include agreements with former employers not to compete with their former companies, solicit their customers, clients or vendors or take other staff members with them. 
 Mr. Outten said that mass layoffs accounted for a drastic increase in another part of the firm's practice -- that is, lawsuits under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, a federal law that requires companies to give employees at least 60 days' notice of a plant's closing or reduction in force. The firm is pursuing about a dozen cases against businesses that have not complied with the law. 
 TRACKING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The early stages of a downturn benefit Ontario Systems, which has its headquarters in Muncie, Ind., said Wil Davis, president and co-founder. That is when consumers start to get behind on their bills and businesses seek help with the laborious and time-consuming task of tracking and pursuing their accounts receivable. Among other things, Ontario, a 450-employee company, provides software and technical support for managing extended-payment plans and segmenting accounts when multiple parties share an expense. 
 Hospitals are a growing market for Ontario's products, especially because consumers are shouldering a bigger portion of their own health care costs. Job losses and rising prices for everyday necessities make medical bills a low priority for some patients, and hospitals must try harder to collect. In that niche alone, Ontario had a 30 percent increase in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, Mr. Davis said.
 But he estimated from past experience that in another six months Ontario Systems itself would start to feel the negative effects of a recession because, ultimately, creditors realize that chasing people who do not have the resources to pay them is futile, Mr. Davis said. Once that happens, creditors will not spend much money on bill-collecting systems until the economy picks up. 
 HELPING COMMERCIAL BORROWERS When Ann Hambly started 1st Service Solutions in Grapevine, Tex., in January 2006, she planned to help buyers of commercial real estate -- multifamily apartments, office buildings and shopping centers -- who wanted to take over the sellers' mortgages, rather than get new loans. 
 Little did she realize her good timing. With the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit tightening during the last nine months, buyers may now have no other financing choice than to assume or take over the sellers' mortgages. Increasingly, borrowers also seek her aid in modifying loan terms (for example, decreasing the principal payments and extending the maturity date) to cope with setbacks. 
 Ms. Hambly, who started the business on her own, has expanded her staff to eight and added a partner two months ago. Profits at 1st Service rose to $1 million in 2007 from $250,000 in 2006, its first year of operation. ''I would like to think we would have had a thriving business either way,'' Ms. Hambly said. ''But I definitely had a big gust of wind go in the sail.''
 LIQUIDATING MACHINERY AND INVENTORY Paul Lerman, chief executive of Atec in St. Louis, did not need the economic pundits to tell him that a recession was coming. He saw signs at the end of 2006, when he began getting calls from banks who were dealing with troubled companies. Some wanted to liquidate business property that had been acquired through foreclosures. Others wanted to monitor the declining asset values of companies that had pledged their inventories and accounts receivable as security for loans. 
 Having been through other recessions since he started Atec in 1983, Mr. Lerman expected a corresponding dip in the demand for another service that his company offers: making preloan appraisals of the same assets for banks. Still, the countercyclical part of Atec's business has more than compensated for that decline, enough so that profits for the first quarter are up by more than two digits over the same period last year, he said.
 Often, Atec benefits from the ripple effect of a slowdown. For example, it liquidated trucking companies hurt by rising fuel costs and a contractor that cleaned new homes after construction (a casualty of the drop in housing starts). Atec, which has 19 employees, including three full-time auctioneers who travel the country, gets a 12 percent commission for selling off business assets. Even in a soft market, there is always a buyer, Mr. Lerman said.
 ADVISING TROUBLED COMPANIES Boom times at Gordian Group, New York-based restructuring advisers, are directly countercyclical to the American economy. After a three-year lull, business picked up in January, with larger, more complex assignments from troubled companies, said Henry F. Owsley, a partner at the 20-year-old firm. 
 Gordian's clients arrive in various degrees of financial distress, both before and after bankruptcy, he said. They may be having liquidity problems, with expenses outpacing revenues; they may be exhausting credit at financial institutions; or their creditors, who may have once been lenient in a tight cycle, may now be demanding payment. Since Gordian's business model combines monthly payments with a success fee for finding a buyer or getting a loan, the 20-employee firm has yet to realize its biggest potential revenue from the current downturn, Mr. Owsley said. Meanwhile, it continues to nurture two auxiliary businesses started during its slack periods. One involves serving as expert witnesses in, for example, bankruptcy-related lawsuits. The other, started last year, is Bacchus Capital Management, which makes loans to wineries. 
 As a small-business owner who has worked with troubled companies, Mr. Owsley can offer a survival tip to other companies. For those whose work is not countercyclical, the greatest pain may be ahead, he said, adding, ''Maintaining liquidity is probably the most important thing you can do.''

HEADLINE: Imbalances of Power

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There has been much debate in this campaign about which of our enemies the next U.S. president should deign to talk to. The real story, the next president may discover, though, is how few countries are waiting around for us to call. It is hard to remember a time when more shifts in the global balance of power are happening at once -- with so few in America's favor. 
 Let's start with the most profound one: More and more, I am convinced that the big foreign policy failure that will be pinned on this administration is not the failure to make Iraq work, as devastating as that has been. It will be one with much broader balance-of-power implications -- the failure after 9/11 to put in place an effective energy policy. 
 It baffles me that President Bush would rather go to Saudi Arabia twice in four months and beg the Saudi king for an oil price break than ask the American people to drive 55 miles an hour, buy more fuel-efficient cars or accept a carbon tax or gasoline tax that might actually help free us from what he called our ''addiction to oil.''
 The failure of Mr. Bush to fully mobilize the most powerful innovation engine in the world -- the U.S. economy -- to produce a scalable alternative to oil has helped to fuel the rise of a collection of petro-authoritarian states -- from Russia to Venezuela to Iran -- that are reshaping global politics in their own image. 
 If this huge transfer of wealth to the petro-authoritarians continues, power will follow. According to Congressional testimony Wednesday by the energy expert Gal Luft, with oil at $200 a barrel, OPEC could ''potentially buy Bank of America in one month worth of production, Apple computers in a week and General Motors in just three days.''
 But that's not all. Two compelling new books have just been published that describe two other big power shifts: ''The Post-American World,'' by Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International, and ''Superclass'' by David Rothkopf, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment.
 Mr. Zakaria's central thesis is that while the U.S. still has many unique assets, ''the rise of the rest'' -- the Chinas, the Indias, the Brazils and even smaller nonstate actors -- is creating a world where many other countries are slowly moving up to America's level of economic clout and self-assertion, in every realm. ''Today, India has 18 all-news channels of its own,'' notes Zakaria. ''And the perspectives they provide are very different from those you will get in the Western media. The rest now has the confidence to present its own narrative, where it is at the center.''
 For too long, argues Zakaria, America has taken its many natural assets -- its research universities, free markets and diversity of human talent -- and assumed that they will always compensate for our low savings rate or absence of a health care system or any strategic plan to improve our competitiveness. 
 ''That was fine in a world when a lot of other countries were not performing,'' argues Zakaria, but now the best of the rest are running fast, working hard, saving well and thinking long term. ''They have adopted our lessons and are playing our game,'' he said. If we don't fix our political system and start thinking strategically about how to improve our competitiveness, he added, ''the U.S. risks having its unique and advantageous position in the world erode as other countries rise.'' 
 Mr. Rothkopf's book argues that on many of the most critical issues of our time, the influence of all nation-states is waning, the system for addressing global issues among nation-states is more ineffective than ever, and therefore a power void is being created. This void is often being filled by a small group of players -- ''the superclass'' -- a new global elite, who are much better suited to operating on the global stage and influencing global outcomes than the vast majority of national political leaders.
 Some of this new elite ''are from business and finance,'' says Rothkopf. ''Some are members of a kind of shadow elite -- criminals and terrorists. Some are masters of new or traditional media; some are religious leaders, and a few are top officials of those governments that do have the ability to project their influence globally.''
 The next president will have to manage these new rising states and these new rising individuals and networks, while wearing the straightjacket left in the Oval Office by Mr. Bush.
 ''Call it the triple deficit,'' said Mr. Rothkopf. ''A fiscal deficit that will soon have us choosing between rationed health care, sufficient education, adequate infrastructure and traditional levels of defense spending, a trade deficit that has us borrowing from our rivals to the point of real vulnerability, and a geopolitical deficit that is a legacy of Iraq, which may result in hesitancy to take strong stands where we must.''
 The first rule of holes is when you're in one, stop digging. When you're in three, bring a lot of shovels.

HEADLINE: An Iraqi Success, So Far Taking of Sadr City Bolsters Government, But Questions Linger Over Militias' Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ALISSA J. RUBIN

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Iraqi forces rolled unopposed through the huge Shiite enclave of Sadr City on Tuesday, a dramatic turnaround from the bitter fighting that has plagued the Baghdad neighborhood for two months, and a qualified success for Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. 
 As it did in the southern city of Basra last month, the Iraqi government advanced its goal of establishing sovereignty and curtailing the powers of the militias.
 This was a hopeful accomplishment, but one that came with caveats: In both cities, the militias eventually melted away in the face of Iraqi troops backed by American firepower. Thus nobody can say just where the militias might re-emerge or when Iraqi and American forces might need to fight them again. 
 By late Tuesday, Iraqi troops had pushed deep into the district and set up positions around hospitals and police stations, which the Iraqi government was seeking to bring under its control. 
 The main military question now is whether Iraqi soldiers can solidify their hold over Sadr City in the coming days. And the main political one is whether the Maliki government will cement its gains by carrying out its long-promised, multimillion-dollar program of economic assistance and job creation to win over a still wary population and erode the militias' base of support.
 Sadr City has long been a simmering trouble spot, a haven for Shiite militias and a conduit for what American commanders say are Iranian-supplied arms, including explosively formed penetrators, a particularly lethal type of roadside bomb. 
 In the past two months, it has also become a test of the government's ability to find its footing in the slippery terrain of Middle Eastern Shiite politics and internal divisions among Iraq's governing Shiite parties. 
 The recent fighting flared up in late March after Mr. Maliki sent troops to gain control of the port city of Basra. Shiite militants responded by taking over Iraqi Army checkpoints on the outskirts of Sadr City and using the neighborhood as a launching pad to fire rockets at the Green Zone, the seat of the Iraqi government and site of the United States Embassy. 
 American and Iraqi forces had little choice but to fight their way in to suppress the rocket fire. They pushed their way to Al Quds Street, which gave them a measure of control over the southern quarter of Sadr City. A massive concrete wall was erected along the thoroughfare to try to keep the militants out. 
 But that still left most of Sadr City in the hands of Shiite militias, which continued to lob rockets at the Green Zone and attack the Iraqi and American troops in the neighborhood's southern tier. 
 Mr. Maliki had responded to a challenge from Shiite militias in Basra by mounting a hasty operation. The military campaign caught American officials by surprise and appeared to sputter at the start as the Iraqi forces faced logistical problems and more than 1,000 desertions. 
 But as the Basra operation proceeded and Iraqi troops began to pour into the city, militia commanders drifted away. Mr. Maliki was strengthened politically in his drive to shape an image as a strong and decisive leader, the kind of leader many Iraqis, Sunni and Shiite, think is needed to control the country. 
 Emboldened by the outcome in Basra, the prime minister wanted to act quickly against the militias in Sadr City as well, according to American and Iraqi officials. He was inclined to see the struggle as a test of wills, which he could win by striking a decisive blow, the officials said.
 Iraqi and Americans commanders, chastened by the stumbling first week of the Basra operation, favored a more deliberate approach. Sadr City is densely populated, with more than two million people, a bastion of support for Moktada al-Sadr, the radical cleric, and a neighborhood with a resilient collection of militia cells adept at hiding among the populace. With operations in Basra, Mosul and other parts of Iraq, the Iraqi military was stretched. 
 Additional forces were brought in, including the Third Brigade of the First Iraqi Army Division, a quick reaction force from Anbar Province. Lt. Gen. Abud Qanbar, the commander of Iraqi forces in Baghdad, developed a plan to advance north into the heart of Sadr City. 
 The military preparations appeared to be serious, a fact that loomed large for leaders of Mr. Sadr's militia, the Mahdi Army, who told one reporter last week that the militia was convinced that military operations were imminent. 
 Maj. Gen. Mizher al-Azawi, the commander of the 11th Iraqi Army Division, said that the operation would be carried out by Iraqi ground forces with the support of American airpower. 
 But for all the talk by Iraqi government officials about breaking the back of the militias, and the militants' bluster about defending their turf, it was clear that the two sides had much to lose if they were unable to reach an accommodation, however temporary or expedient. 
 Had it come to an urban battle in the Shiite enclave, the Iraqi government, backed by American force, would probably have prevailed. But Iraqi troops would have suffered casualties. Shiite civilians would have been caught in the cross-fire and further alienated from the government. And eventually the Shiite militias, which had already suffered considerable losses, would have been further depleted. 
 Certainly, a military offensive would not have been a simple operation. The militias had been significantly weakened over the previous two months of fighting. Col. John Hort, the commander of the Third Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division, estimated that some 700 militia fighters had been killed by air and ground fire since fighting erupted in late March. 
 ''It is pretty safe to say that we have killed the equivalent of a U.S. battalion,'' he said in a recent interview. 
 Some Mahdi Army leaders put the death toll slightly higher. When a truce was first announced, they threatened to refuse Mr. Sadr's order to stand down. ''What about the martyrs?'' a Mahdi battalion leader recently told a reporter. ''A thousand martyrs, what did they die for?'' 
 Still, the area directly north of Al Quds Street was believed to have had a heavy concentration of roadside bombs, presenting a substantial challenge for an Iraqi force. Combat engineers and explosive ordnance disposal teams are in short supply in the Iraqi military, which relies heavily on using sappers to cut the wires rigged to explosives. 
 A Sadr City battle would also have sent Iraqi forces into one of the most heavily populated sections of Baghdad, where there were ample opportunities for ambushes. Militia snipers have already taken a toll on Iraqi troops with powerful .50-caliber rifles. 
 There were other threats, as well. In one instance not previously disclosed, an American M1 tank was damaged by an RPG-29, an advanced anti-tank weapon. Even less powerful types of rocket-propelled grenades could pose a threat to some Iraqi vehicles, which are generally less heavily armored than those employed by the Americans. 
 While the planning continued, American military officials cited reports that Mahdi Army and Iranian-backed commanders were sneaking out of Sadr City and perhaps even Iraq. People close to Mahdi leaders in Sadr City said they knew some who were leaving for Lebanon by way of Iran. 
 ''We have seen a lot of indications that some of the senior leaders within JAM and the special groups are preparing to leave or have already left Sadr City,'' Colonel Hort said last week, referring to Jaysh al Mahdi, as the Mahdi Army is known, and the Iranian-backed militias the military refers to as special groups. 
 Iran, according to some Western analysts, was also focusing on developments in Lebanon, where it has been supporting the militant group Hezbollah, and seemed interested in an arrangement in which the groups it backed in Sadr City would withdraw to fight another day. 
 With the emergence of a political accord, the Iraqi military began to develop a new plan, which American officers learned about late last week. It assumed that Iraqi troops would be welcomed, or at least tolerated, by the residents. Instead of an assault through the roadside bombs, six battalions would drive in on parallel streets and set up checkpoints and search for weapons. 
 That plan was carried out on Tuesday and was uncontested. 
 So far, the Iraqi Army has been a winner. Iraqi commanders received, and sometimes rejected, advice from the American military. But in the end they were able to execute a plan that was very much their own. 
 Only two dozen or so roadside bombs were reported found, however, raising a question of whether others had been hidden by the militias for another day. Nor is it clear how energetic Iraqi soldiers will be in carrying out searches in a Mahdi Army stronghold.
 Brig. Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, the chief of staff for the Multinational Corps in Iraq, said the Iraqi government had considered various factors. 
 ''When you exert lethal actions against Sadr City, you are de facto going against a fairly poor sector of the Shia populace,'' he said. ''So that is a dynamic that the government of Iraq has to keep in their analysis about what is the right way to deal with this, and we believe a measured approach is appropriate.''

HEADLINE: The Risks Of Rescuing Borrowers

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
When the Senate Banking Committee approved on Tuesday legislation to help suffering homeowners refinance costly loans, lawmakers said they had found a way to rescue the housing market without requiring taxpayers to foot the bill.
 By forcing the nation's two largest buyers of home loans -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars each year, lawmakers said they were creating a fund that the government could tap to refinance as much as $85 billion in troubled home loans. 
 Senators said the plan, which empowers the Federal Housing Administration, or F.H.A., to insure risky loans, would most likely help hundreds of thousands of homeowners avoid foreclosure and stabilize the housing market. 
 But some say that the government's housing plan is riskier than disclosed and that if home prices continue to decline for years, taxpayers could be on the hook for billions. 
 Others complain that the plan creates worrisome pressures for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a time when both companies are struggling with enormous losses and thin financial safety nets. The companies are essential lubricants in today's housing finance market, and if either stumbled, it could set off a worldwide economic slowdown.
 ''There's real concerns about the degree of risk that F.H.A. is taking on,'' said Howard Glaser, a mortgage industry consultant who served at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration. ''And everyone is calling on Fannie and Freddie to do more to stabilize the mortgage marketplace, but at what point does imposing new costs on those companies undermine their financial safety?''
 Lawmakers of both parties say such concerns are baseless. Congressional aides say that the housing plan's estimated $1 billion cost will be more than offset by the $700 million a year that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will hand over and by the billions of dollars in new fees the F.H.A. will charge borrowers and lenders.
 ''We believe we've identified more than twice the funding that this program needs,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. ''We have to provide relief to people who are at risk of losing their homes, and this is a good start.''
 The Banking Committee approved the foreclosure rescue plan by a vote of 19 to 2, with 8 Republicans joining all 11 Democrats on the committee in favor of it. Republican Senators Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming were the two no votes.
 The broad consensus on the bill was a stark turnabout after years of partisan debate over how to tighten regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and more recent disagreement over whether the government should help troubled homeowners and lenders who might have acted irresponsibly.
 The Senate agreement underscores the view in both parties that addressing problems in the housing market is a political necessity in a high-stakes election year. Republicans who initially opposed helping struggling borrowers agreed to extend a hand, but only after Democrats agreed to tap Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, instead of taxpayers, to cover the cost.
 Even the White House, which expressed staunch opposition and threatened a veto when the House passed a similar measure earlier this month, seems to have changed its tune. While the White House said it needed to review the specific language of the bill, President Bush suggested he was willing to support it, especially because it contains the tighter regulation of the mortgage finance companies that he has sought for years.
 Mr. Shelby said that, while the measure leans on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for financing the rescue plan, it also ensures their financial health by creating a more powerful regulator to oversee the companies. 
 For decades, Fannie and Freddie have been overseen by multiple regulators, each with limited powers. Consolidating oversight into one agency with broad authority has long been a priority for lawmakers who feel the companies take too many risks. 
 But critics worry that such protections may not be enough. They note that the government's estimates of the housing plan's cost make relatively conservative assumptions about default rates and housing price declines. Moreover, they note that the housing plan that passed the House has earmarked some of the same Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac funds to pay for rebuilding New Orleans and other areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Now Congress will have to choose between conflicting plans.
 ''There's other money in the Senate bill that will pay for the housing plan without dipping into money for affordable housing,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''I am very insistent that we don't abandon the people in the Gulf.''
 There also are lingering questions about how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will operate once a new regulator is in place, and after the companies begin handing over hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Although the funds the companies will hand over are comparatively small -- only about 5 cents for each dollar in mortgages the companies buy -- they may have significant ramifications for shareholders.
 The stock prices of both companies have been battered in recent months as they have announced billions in losses. Both companies have been criticized for holding too little capital in reserve and have recently asked investors for fresh capital infusions. Their new regulator, whom the president would appoint, may require them to do business by standards that could sharply affect the companies' bottom lines.
 Those concerns were reflected by executives at the companies themselves, who released statements on Tuesday warning about the adverse effects of overregulation, and by shareholders, who slightly pushed down the price of both companies' stocks.
 Ultimately, analysts say, it is likely that both companies will need to raise more capital this year. And it is unclear how investors will judge the housing plan, which in effect has drafted the companies to bail out hurting homeowners.
 ''The F.H.A. bailout program isn't designed to help Fannie or Freddie, so why are they paying for it?'' asked Tom Lawler, an economist who worked at Fannie Mae for over two decades before leaving in 2006 to become a consultant. ''You could charge the banking system, Wall Street, home builders -- there are lots of companies that will actually benefit from this bailout who could have paid for it. But they will get the benefit without having to pay.''
 Democratic aides said they expected the bill to be brought to the Senate floor in early June, after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Faces Brain Tumor, a Malignancy

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK and CARL HULSE; Pam Belluck reported from Boston and Carl Hulse from Washington. Katie Zezima contributed reporting from Boston.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the longtime Massachusetts Democrat and patriarch of the Kennedy family, has a malignant brain tumor, his doctors said on Tuesday.
 Doctors here at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were investigating the cause of a seizure that Mr. Kennedy, 76, suffered at his Cape Cod compound on Saturday, said preliminary results from a biopsy of the brain had revealed that he has a malignant glioma in the left parietal lobe, the upper left part of his brain.
 Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, the hospital's vice chairman of neurology, and Dr. Larry Ronan, Mr. Kennedy's primary care physician at the hospital, said in a statement that ''the usual course of treatment includes combinations of various forms of radiation and chemotherapy'' and that ''decisions regarding the best course of treatment for Senator Kennedy will be determined after further testing and analysis.''
 News of the brain tumor jolted people in Washington, Massachusetts and beyond, generating reaction from around the world, where Mr. Kennedy's legendary family legacy and his 46 years in the Senate have made him a well-known figure. 
 Aside from an unsuccessful run for president in 1980, Mr. Kennedy has focused his energy on issues including health care, education and civil rights. Despite his liberal ideology and occasional loud clashes on the Senate floor, Mr. Kennedy is held in high esteem by the opposition for his determination, understanding of the issues and a willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion on subjects like education, health care and immigration.
 ''Senator Kennedy enjoys great respect and admiration on this side of the aisle,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''He is indeed one of the most important figures to ever serve in this body in our history.''
 In a statement, President Bush said, ''Ted Kennedy is a man of tremendous courage, remarkable strength, and powerful spirit.'' Mr. Bush said he and his wife, Laura, ''join our fellow Americans in praying for his full recovery.''
 Senator John McCain echoed that sentiment, and both Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton invoked Mr. Kennedy at length on Tuesday night in their speeches declaring victory in the Oregon and Kentucky primaries, respectively. 
 Doctors and people close to Senator Kennedy said that he would remain in the hospital for the next couple of days. The doctors said he was ''in overall good condition'' and ''remains in good spirits and full of energy.'' He has not had another seizure since he was hospitalized, they said.
 ''Right now, he's his normal self, except for the news that he's dealing with,'' said a close friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''I bet he'll be back at the Cape sailing this weekend. I expect he'll go back to work'' after the Memorial Day recess.
 Senate Democrats and Republicans learned of Mr. Kennedy's condition as they were gathered for their weekly closed-door party luncheons, and members of both parties were visibly shaken by the news.
 As he opened debate on the Iraq spending bill, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, at 90 the only current senator to serve longer than Mr. Kennedy, was distraught. ''Ted, Ted, my dear friend, I love you and miss you,'' Mr. Byrd said in halting remarks on the floor.
 Malignant glioma is the most common form of brain cancer, accounting for about 9,000 cases diagnosed each year in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. They are more common in older people, especially those between the ages of 75 and 84, according to the American Cancer Society.
 The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the tumor, and the patient's age. The American Cancer Society said that survival rates drop with increasing age.
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said on Tuesday in Washington that he had visited Mr. Kennedy over the weekend.
 ''He's in a fighting mood,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''He is asking questions about what the choices are for him. He's deeply involved in making all the kinds of personal decisions that any of you would.''
 Mr. Kerry added: ''He would call you and help arrange a discussion with a bunch of doctors to talk about a wife who was sick or a child or any number of things -- now everybody needs to do that on behalf of Ted. Everybody needs to pull for him and his family and remember that this guy is one unbelievable fighter.''
 In Massachusetts, the impact of Mr. Kennedy's persona and political legacy is hard to overestimate.
 ''There'll never be another Ted Kennedy,'' said Paul S. Grogan, president and chief executive of the Boston Foundation, which finances nonprofits involved in economic development and other state issues. ''He's sort of Horatio at the bridge. He's been such an outsized figure, so influential, so effective.''
 Mr. Grogan said that Mr. Kennedy had given Massachusetts a level of political prominence beyond what would normally be accorded a state of its size, and that he had helped engineer policies and financing mechanisms that benefited important sectors of the state, including universities and medical centers.
 ''He's single-handedly postponed the onset of Massachusetts's political decline,'' Mr. Grogan said. ''His vigor, his vitality and his longevity has kind of encouraged us all to believe that he's immortal, and we've gotten used to the idea that he's going to be around forever. But this is a reminder that he's not.''
 Cameron Kerry, a lawyer who is the brother of Senator Kerry, said the news of the brain tumor was ''like an earthquake,'' adding, ''He's just such a colossus that this kind of shakes the ground underneath everything.''
 Mr. Kerry said that ''on a political level, he's just been so good to my brother and to the whole family. He really is like family.''
 Jack Connors, a businessman who is active in Democratic causes, said: ''Ted Kennedy raised public service to an art form. Ted Kennedy has really been a hero for people who don't really have much of a voice.''
 Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, called him ''clearly the most influential senator in U.S. history.'' Mr. Frank added: ''His personality, his understanding of the legislative process, his dedication. He has a good sense of other people, a lot of empathy. And he hires first-rate people and knows how to benefit from them.''
 Legislators close to Mr. Kennedy, like Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said on Tuesday that they were certain Mr. Kennedy would return to work and would battle the tumor with his characteristic tenacity and energy.
 ''He's a fighter,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, ''and he's definitely ready for this fight.''

HEADLINE: Imbalances of Power

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There has been much debate in this campaign about which of our enemies the next U.S. president should deign to talk to. The real story, the next president may discover, though, is how few countries are waiting around for us to call. It is hard to remember a time when more shifts in the global balance of power are happening at once -- with so few in America's favor. 
 Let's start with the most profound one: More and more, I am convinced that the big foreign policy failure that will be pinned on this administration is not the failure to make Iraq work, as devastating as that has been. It will be one with much broader balance-of-power implications -- the failure after 9/11 to put in place an effective energy policy. 
 It baffles me that President Bush would rather go to Saudi Arabia twice in four months and beg the Saudi king for an oil price break than ask the American people to drive 55 miles an hour, buy more fuel-efficient cars or accept a carbon tax or gasoline tax that might actually help free us from what he called our ''addiction to oil.''
 The failure of Mr. Bush to fully mobilize the most powerful innovation engine in the world -- the U.S. economy -- to produce a scalable alternative to oil has helped to fuel the rise of a collection of petro-authoritarian states -- from Russia to Venezuela to Iran -- that are reshaping global politics in their own image. 
 If this huge transfer of wealth to the petro-authoritarians continues, power will follow. According to Congressional testimony Wednesday by the energy expert Gal Luft, with oil at $200 a barrel, OPEC could ''potentially buy Bank of America in one month worth of production, Apple computers in a week and General Motors in just three days.''
 But that's not all. Two compelling new books have just been published that describe two other big power shifts: ''The Post-American World,'' by Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International, and ''Superclass'' by David Rothkopf, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment.
 Mr. Zakaria's central thesis is that while the U.S. still has many unique assets, ''the rise of the rest'' -- the Chinas, the Indias, the Brazils and even smaller nonstate actors -- is creating a world where many other countries are slowly moving up to America's level of economic clout and self-assertion, in every realm. ''Today, India has 18 all-news channels of its own,'' notes Zakaria. ''And the perspectives they provide are very different from those you will get in the Western media. The rest now has the confidence to present its own narrative, where it is at the center.''
 For too long, argues Zakaria, America has taken its many natural assets -- its research universities, free markets and diversity of human talent -- and assumed that they will always compensate for our low savings rate or absence of a health care system or any strategic plan to improve our competitiveness. 
 ''That was fine in a world when a lot of other countries were not performing,'' argues Zakaria, but now the best of the rest are running fast, working hard, saving well and thinking long term. ''They have adopted our lessons and are playing our game,'' he said. If we don't fix our political system and start thinking strategically about how to improve our competitiveness, he added, ''the U.S. risks having its unique and advantageous position in the world erode as other countries rise.'' 
 Mr. Rothkopf's book argues that on many of the most critical issues of our time, the influence of all nation-states is waning, the system for addressing global issues among nation-states is more ineffective than ever, and therefore a power void is being created. This void is often being filled by a small group of players -- ''the superclass'' -- a new global elite, who are much better suited to operating on the global stage and influencing global outcomes than the vast majority of national political leaders.
 Some of this new elite ''are from business and finance,'' says Rothkopf. ''Some are members of a kind of shadow elite -- criminals and terrorists. Some are masters of new or traditional media; some are religious leaders, and a few are top officials of those governments that do have the ability to project their influence globally.''
 The next president will have to manage these new rising states and these new rising individuals and networks, while wearing the straightjacket left in the Oval Office by Mr. Bush.
 ''Call it the triple deficit,'' said Mr. Rothkopf. ''A fiscal deficit that will soon have us choosing between rationed health care, sufficient education, adequate infrastructure and traditional levels of defense spending, a trade deficit that has us borrowing from our rivals to the point of real vulnerability, and a geopolitical deficit that is a legacy of Iraq, which may result in hesitancy to take strong stands where we must.''
 The first rule of holes is when you're in one, stop digging. When you're in three, bring a lot of shovels.

HEADLINE: An Iraqi Success, So Far Taking of Sadr City Bolsters Government, But Questions Linger Over Militias' Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ALISSA J. RUBIN

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Iraqi forces rolled unopposed through the huge Shiite enclave of Sadr City on Tuesday, a dramatic turnaround from the bitter fighting that has plagued the Baghdad neighborhood for two months, and a qualified success for Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. 
 As it did in the southern city of Basra last month, the Iraqi government advanced its goal of establishing sovereignty and curtailing the powers of the militias.
 This was a hopeful accomplishment, but one that came with caveats: In both cities, the militias eventually melted away in the face of Iraqi troops backed by American firepower. Thus nobody can say just where the militias might re-emerge or when Iraqi and American forces might need to fight them again. 
 By late Tuesday, Iraqi troops had pushed deep into the district and set up positions around hospitals and police stations, which the Iraqi government was seeking to bring under its control. 
 The main military question now is whether Iraqi soldiers can solidify their hold over Sadr City in the coming days. And the main political one is whether the Maliki government will cement its gains by carrying out its long-promised, multimillion-dollar program of economic assistance and job creation to win over a still wary population and erode the militias' base of support.
 Sadr City has long been a simmering trouble spot, a haven for Shiite militias and a conduit for what American commanders say are Iranian-supplied arms, including explosively formed penetrators, a particularly lethal type of roadside bomb. 
 In the past two months, it has also become a test of the government's ability to find its footing in the slippery terrain of Middle Eastern Shiite politics and internal divisions among Iraq's governing Shiite parties. 
 The recent fighting flared up in late March after Mr. Maliki sent troops to gain control of the port city of Basra. Shiite militants responded by taking over Iraqi Army checkpoints on the outskirts of Sadr City and using the neighborhood as a launching pad to fire rockets at the Green Zone, the seat of the Iraqi government and site of the United States Embassy. 
 American and Iraqi forces had little choice but to fight their way in to suppress the rocket fire. They pushed their way to Al Quds Street, which gave them a measure of control over the southern quarter of Sadr City. A massive concrete wall was erected along the thoroughfare to try to keep the militants out. 
 But that still left most of Sadr City in the hands of Shiite militias, which continued to lob rockets at the Green Zone and attack the Iraqi and American troops in the neighborhood's southern tier. 
 Mr. Maliki had responded to a challenge from Shiite militias in Basra by mounting a hasty operation. The military campaign caught American officials by surprise and appeared to sputter at the start as the Iraqi forces faced logistical problems and more than 1,000 desertions. 
 But as the Basra operation proceeded and Iraqi troops began to pour into the city, militia commanders drifted away. Mr. Maliki was strengthened politically in his drive to shape an image as a strong and decisive leader, the kind of leader many Iraqis, Sunni and Shiite, think is needed to control the country. 
 Emboldened by the outcome in Basra, the prime minister wanted to act quickly against the militias in Sadr City as well, according to American and Iraqi officials. He was inclined to see the struggle as a test of wills, which he could win by striking a decisive blow, the officials said.
 Iraqi and Americans commanders, chastened by the stumbling first week of the Basra operation, favored a more deliberate approach. Sadr City is densely populated, with more than two million people, a bastion of support for Moktada al-Sadr, the radical cleric, and a neighborhood with a resilient collection of militia cells adept at hiding among the populace. With operations in Basra, Mosul and other parts of Iraq, the Iraqi military was stretched. 
 Additional forces were brought in, including the Third Brigade of the First Iraqi Army Division, a quick reaction force from Anbar Province. Lt. Gen. Abud Qanbar, the commander of Iraqi forces in Baghdad, developed a plan to advance north into the heart of Sadr City. 
 The military preparations appeared to be serious, a fact that loomed large for leaders of Mr. Sadr's militia, the Mahdi Army, who told one reporter last week that the militia was convinced that military operations were imminent. 
 Maj. Gen. Mizher al-Azawi, the commander of the 11th Iraqi Army Division, said that the operation would be carried out by Iraqi ground forces with the support of American airpower. 
 But for all the talk by Iraqi government officials about breaking the back of the militias, and the militants' bluster about defending their turf, it was clear that the two sides had much to lose if they were unable to reach an accommodation, however temporary or expedient. 
 Had it come to an urban battle in the Shiite enclave, the Iraqi government, backed by American force, would probably have prevailed. But Iraqi troops would have suffered casualties. Shiite civilians would have been caught in the cross-fire and further alienated from the government. And eventually the Shiite militias, which had already suffered considerable losses, would have been further depleted. 
 Certainly, a military offensive would not have been a simple operation. The militias had been significantly weakened over the previous two months of fighting. Col. John Hort, the commander of the Third Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division, estimated that some 700 militia fighters had been killed by air and ground fire since fighting erupted in late March. 
 ''It is pretty safe to say that we have killed the equivalent of a U.S. battalion,'' he said in a recent interview. 
 Some Mahdi Army leaders put the death toll slightly higher. When a truce was first announced, they threatened to refuse Mr. Sadr's order to stand down. ''What about the martyrs?'' a Mahdi battalion leader recently told a reporter. ''A thousand martyrs, what did they die for?'' 
 Still, the area directly north of Al Quds Street was believed to have had a heavy concentration of roadside bombs, presenting a substantial challenge for an Iraqi force. Combat engineers and explosive ordnance disposal teams are in short supply in the Iraqi military, which relies heavily on using sappers to cut the wires rigged to explosives. 
 A Sadr City battle would also have sent Iraqi forces into one of the most heavily populated sections of Baghdad, where there were ample opportunities for ambushes. Militia snipers have already taken a toll on Iraqi troops with powerful .50-caliber rifles. 
 There were other threats, as well. In one instance not previously disclosed, an American M1 tank was damaged by an RPG-29, an advanced anti-tank weapon. Even less powerful types of rocket-propelled grenades could pose a threat to some Iraqi vehicles, which are generally less heavily armored than those employed by the Americans. 
 While the planning continued, American military officials cited reports that Mahdi Army and Iranian-backed commanders were sneaking out of Sadr City and perhaps even Iraq. People close to Mahdi leaders in Sadr City said they knew some who were leaving for Lebanon by way of Iran. 
 ''We have seen a lot of indications that some of the senior leaders within JAM and the special groups are preparing to leave or have already left Sadr City,'' Colonel Hort said last week, referring to Jaysh al Mahdi, as the Mahdi Army is known, and the Iranian-backed militias the military refers to as special groups. 
 Iran, according to some Western analysts, was also focusing on developments in Lebanon, where it has been supporting the militant group Hezbollah, and seemed interested in an arrangement in which the groups it backed in Sadr City would withdraw to fight another day. 
 With the emergence of a political accord, the Iraqi military began to develop a new plan, which American officers learned about late last week. It assumed that Iraqi troops would be welcomed, or at least tolerated, by the residents. Instead of an assault through the roadside bombs, six battalions would drive in on parallel streets and set up checkpoints and search for weapons. 
 That plan was carried out on Tuesday and was uncontested. 
 So far, the Iraqi Army has been a winner. Iraqi commanders received, and sometimes rejected, advice from the American military. But in the end they were able to execute a plan that was very much their own. 
 Only two dozen or so roadside bombs were reported found, however, raising a question of whether others had been hidden by the militias for another day. Nor is it clear how energetic Iraqi soldiers will be in carrying out searches in a Mahdi Army stronghold.
 Brig. Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, the chief of staff for the Multinational Corps in Iraq, said the Iraqi government had considered various factors. 
 ''When you exert lethal actions against Sadr City, you are de facto going against a fairly poor sector of the Shia populace,'' he said. ''So that is a dynamic that the government of Iraq has to keep in their analysis about what is the right way to deal with this, and we believe a measured approach is appropriate.''

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Bolsters H.P. Global Sales In Quarter

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The weak dollar has its detractors, but it is working out just fine for Hewlett-Packard. 
 In an earnings report on Tuesday, H.P. said it did 70 percent of its sales overseas in the last quarter, benefiting from the relative strength of foreign currencies. That helped insulate it from an apparent stagnation in domestic sales amid a weak economy. 
 Some Wall Street analysts said the report indicated United States sales had actually shrunk. 
 Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive, said he remained cautious about the company's near-term prospects at home.
 ''The U.S., to be specific, was spotty,'' Mr. Hurd said in a conference call with investors. ''I wouldn't describe it as all good, but I wouldn't describe it as all bad either.'' 
 The report added some details to the highlights H.P. released last week, when it disclosed its plans to spend $14 billion to buy Electronic Data Systems, the services company.
 H.P. said its profits for the second quarter, which ended April 30, were $2.1 billion, up 16 percent from a year ago. Operating profits for the quarter were $2.6 billion, or 80 cents a share. The company reported sales of $28.3 billion, an increase of 11 percent from the period a year ago. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, the growth rate was 5 percent.
 Sales in the Americas, including the United States, were up 4 percent from a year ago, to $11.1 billion. But the increase was just 2 percent when currency changes are taken into account. 
 In his conference call with investors, Mr. Hurd shed little new light on the E.D.S. deal or its timing. He declined to say when the deal could close, something investors have been eager to know.
 Hewlett-Packard's stated rationale for buying E.D.S. is to become more competitive in the services business, which entails providing technical and infrastructure support to corporations. The leader in the field is I.B.M., which has some $54 billion in annual sales. E.D.S. has $22 billion in sales at its services business and H.P. $16.6 billion; the combination would create the second-biggest player in what Gartner Group, a market research firm, estimates is a $748 billion global market.
 Analysts said the E.D.S. business has margins of around 6 percent, compared with the services businesses at H.P. and I.B.M., which have margins of around 10 or 11 percent.
 ''Make no mistake, we will get the cost out and we will create value for shareholders,'' Mr. Hurd told investors. 
 Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research, said he had been getting questions from institutional investors about whether and how H.P. could smoothly integrate the companies in a way that justified the price. ''That's the question I'm getting.''
 Shares of H.P. fell 25 cents, to $46.46 in regular trading and an additional 30 cents in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: The Risks Of Rescuing Borrowers

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
When the Senate Banking Committee approved on Tuesday legislation to help suffering homeowners refinance costly loans, lawmakers said they had found a way to rescue the housing market without requiring taxpayers to foot the bill.
 By forcing the nation's two largest buyers of home loans -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars each year, lawmakers said they were creating a fund that the government could tap to refinance as much as $85 billion in troubled home loans. 
 Senators said the plan, which empowers the Federal Housing Administration, or F.H.A., to insure risky loans, would most likely help hundreds of thousands of homeowners avoid foreclosure and stabilize the housing market. 
 But some say that the government's housing plan is riskier than disclosed and that if home prices continue to decline for years, taxpayers could be on the hook for billions. 
 Others complain that the plan creates worrisome pressures for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a time when both companies are struggling with enormous losses and thin financial safety nets. The companies are essential lubricants in today's housing finance market, and if either stumbled, it could set off a worldwide economic slowdown.
 ''There's real concerns about the degree of risk that F.H.A. is taking on,'' said Howard Glaser, a mortgage industry consultant who served at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration. ''And everyone is calling on Fannie and Freddie to do more to stabilize the mortgage marketplace, but at what point does imposing new costs on those companies undermine their financial safety?''
 Lawmakers of both parties say such concerns are baseless. Congressional aides say that the housing plan's estimated $1 billion cost will be more than offset by the $700 million a year that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will hand over and by the billions of dollars in new fees the F.H.A. will charge borrowers and lenders.
 ''We believe we've identified more than twice the funding that this program needs,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. ''We have to provide relief to people who are at risk of losing their homes, and this is a good start.''
 The Banking Committee approved the foreclosure rescue plan by a vote of 19 to 2, with 8 Republicans joining all 11 Democrats on the committee in favor of it. Republican Senators Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming were the two no votes.
 The broad consensus on the bill was a stark turnabout after years of partisan debate over how to tighten regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and more recent disagreement over whether the government should help troubled homeowners and lenders who might have acted irresponsibly.
 The Senate agreement underscores the view in both parties that addressing problems in the housing market is a political necessity in a high-stakes election year. Republicans who initially opposed helping struggling borrowers agreed to extend a hand, but only after Democrats agreed to tap Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, instead of taxpayers, to cover the cost.
 Even the White House, which expressed staunch opposition and threatened a veto when the House passed a similar measure earlier this month, seems to have changed its tune. While the White House said it needed to review the specific language of the bill, President Bush suggested he was willing to support it, especially because it contains the tighter regulation of the mortgage finance companies that he has sought for years.
 Mr. Shelby said that, while the measure leans on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for financing the rescue plan, it also ensures their financial health by creating a more powerful regulator to oversee the companies. 
 For decades, Fannie and Freddie have been overseen by multiple regulators, each with limited powers. Consolidating oversight into one agency with broad authority has long been a priority for lawmakers who feel the companies take too many risks. 
 But critics worry that such protections may not be enough. They note that the government's estimates of the housing plan's cost make relatively conservative assumptions about default rates and housing price declines. Moreover, they note that the housing plan that passed the House has earmarked some of the same Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac funds to pay for rebuilding New Orleans and other areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Now Congress will have to choose between conflicting plans.
 ''There's other money in the Senate bill that will pay for the housing plan without dipping into money for affordable housing,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''I am very insistent that we don't abandon the people in the Gulf.''
 There also are lingering questions about how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will operate once a new regulator is in place, and after the companies begin handing over hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Although the funds the companies will hand over are comparatively small -- only about 5 cents for each dollar in mortgages the companies buy -- they may have significant ramifications for shareholders.
 The stock prices of both companies have been battered in recent months as they have announced billions in losses. Both companies have been criticized for holding too little capital in reserve and have recently asked investors for fresh capital infusions. Their new regulator, whom the president would appoint, may require them to do business by standards that could sharply affect the companies' bottom lines.
 Those concerns were reflected by executives at the companies themselves, who released statements on Tuesday warning about the adverse effects of overregulation, and by shareholders, who slightly pushed down the price of both companies' stocks.
 Ultimately, analysts say, it is likely that both companies will need to raise more capital this year. And it is unclear how investors will judge the housing plan, which in effect has drafted the companies to bail out hurting homeowners.
 ''The F.H.A. bailout program isn't designed to help Fannie or Freddie, so why are they paying for it?'' asked Tom Lawler, an economist who worked at Fannie Mae for over two decades before leaving in 2006 to become a consultant. ''You could charge the banking system, Wall Street, home builders -- there are lots of companies that will actually benefit from this bailout who could have paid for it. But they will get the benefit without having to pay.''
 Democratic aides said they expected the bill to be brought to the Senate floor in early June, after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess.

HEADLINE: Limits Weighed for Commodities Investors

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The chairman of a Senate oversight committee said Tuesday that he was considering legislation limiting large institutional investors in commodities markets.
 The legislation would be aimed at speculators and other investors who use commodities like oil as a way to hedge against swings in other investment instruments, like stocks and the American dollar, Joseph I. Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, said at a hearing. 
 Crude oil, which settled at a record $129.07 a barrel on Tuesday, has doubled in the last 12 months. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities including coffee and corn has surged 31 percent in the 12 months that ended April 30.
 ''We may need to limit the opportunity people have to maximize their profits because a lot of the rest of us are paying through the nose, including some who can't afford it,'' said Mr. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut.
 The plunging value of the dollar, the American housing crisis and widespread problems in the banking sector have led investors away from traditional instruments and toward commodities, witnesses said.
 Jeffrey H. Harris, the chief economist for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said it was clear that there were more institutional investors in commodities, but he said they had not systematically driven up prices.
 Prices ''are being driven by powerful fundamental market forces and the laws of supply and demand,'' Mr. Harris said in testimony.
 Michael W. Masters, portfolio manager for Masters Capital Management, told the committee that investors were buying up commodities and holding their positions, creating an artificial premium. Assets allocated to commodity index trading strategies had risen to $260 billion as of March, from $13 billion at the end of 2003, he said.

PERSON: Barbara Sears Rockefeller 

HEADLINE: Barbara Sears Rockefeller, 91, Actress With a Famous Divorce Settlement

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Barbara Sears Rockefeller, a Pennsylvania coal miner's daughter who married one of the richest men in America and, after their divorce six years later, won a settlement regarded as a record in its day, died on Monday at her home in Little Rock, Ark. She was 91 and had lived in Arkansas for the last few years.
 The Ruebel Funeral Home in Little Rock confirmed the death, saying that Mrs. Rockefeller died of natural causes. 
 Familiarly known as Bobo, Mrs. Rockefeller was the former wife of a governor of Arkansas and the mother of a lieutenant governor. From 1948 to 1954, she had a highly public marriage to Winthrop Rockefeller, who went on to serve two terms as governor, from 1967 to 1971. He was a grandson of John D. Rockefeller, a founder of Standard Oil.
 The couple's only child, Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, was lieutenant governor of Arkansas from 1996 until his death from a blood disorder in 2006. Mrs. Rockefeller is survived by eight grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
 The daughter of Lithuanian immigrants, Mrs. Rockefeller was born Jievute Paulekiute near Noblestown, Pa., in September 1916. (Jievute is a Lithuanian diminutive of Eva.) 
 Her father was a coal miner and a railroad worker. Jievute's parents divorced when she was a child, and she spent her later girlhood with her mother and stepfather in the stockyard district of Chicago. The family later moved to Indiana.
 Considered a beauty, Jievute was named Miss Lithuania at 17 in a pageant sponsored by The Lithuanian Daily News. She studied briefly at Northwestern University before becoming a model and actress.
 Under her first stage name, Eva Paul, she appeared in a production of ''Tobacco Road'' in Boston. There, she met Richard Sears Jr., the son of a prominent Boston family. They were married in 1941, and afterward she changed her name to Barbara Paul Sears. As Barbara Sears, she had small roles in a few Hollywood films, including ''That Night With You'' (1945), starring Franchot Tone.
 After World War II, Mr. Sears was named third secretary at the American embassy in Paris, and the couple became fixtures in the Parisian social whirl. They divorced in 1947.
 Mrs. Sears met Winthrop Rockefeller at a dinner party in 1946. At the time, she was living in Manhattan with her sister in a fourth-floor walkup hard by the Third Avenue El. Mr. Rockefeller, who had never married, was considered the most eligible bachelor in the country. He soon gave her a square-cut diamond set in platinum. She later pawned the ring, said to be worth $30,000, and lived on the proceeds for five years while waiting for her divorce settlement to come through, The Associated Press reported in 1966.
 Mr. Rockefeller and Mrs. Sears planned to marry, perhaps inauspiciously, on Friday the 13th of February, 1948. 
 But because of the 72-hour waiting period then imposed by Florida law, the wedding, at the Palm Beach estate of the sportsman Winston Guest, took place just after midnight on Valentine's Day. The guests at the reception included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
 The union of the miner's daughter and the billionaire's grandson was described widely in the news as a fairy tale straight from the pages of ''Cinderella.'' As Time magazine's account said, ''Bobo's mother and stepfather, who were unable to attend the ceremony because they were making a batch of Lithuanian cheese on their Indiana farm, both announced that they were happy.''
 But for Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller, there was no happily ever after, or even much of an ''after.'' They separated less than two years into their marriage.
 Very public divorce proceedings ensued. Mr. Rockefeller offered his wife a settlement of $5.5 million. Mrs. Rockefeller requested $10 million instead. After all, she pointed out to Time magazine in 1954, a man had just tried to repossess her vacuum cleaner. She eventually took the $5.5 million.
 For many years after her divorce, Mrs. Rockefeller lived on the Upper East Side in a six-story neoclassical townhouse that included a full-size, wood-lined squash court with an 18-foot ceiling. She also kept a home in Paris.
 Mrs. Rockefeller, who did not marry again, learned early to economize, at least in the relative sense of the term. As The Associated Press reported in 1952, when she was already separated from her husband, Mrs. Rockefeller had a fail-safe tactic for striking a good bargain.
 When a merchant demanded a price she considered too high, she would simply respond, ''Who do you think I am, a Rockefeller?''

HEADLINE: Despite Growing Opposition, Homeland Security Stands by Its Fence

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and JULIA PRESTON; Randal C. Archibold reported from Naco, Ariz., and Julia Preston from New York.

DATELINE: NACO, Ariz. 

 BODY:
As the Department of Homeland Security pushes to complete 670 miles of fencing along the Mexican border by the end of this year, it is confronting the sharpest resistance yet while conceding that physical barriers alone do not stop illegal crossings. 
 In the latest challenge, the Texas Border Coalition, an organization of mayors, county commissioners and economists opposed to the fence, filed a federal lawsuit on Friday. It says that the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, failed to conduct required negotiations with property owners and local authorities when he ordered that the barrier be built in Texas. The group wants the construction halted.
 The protests come as known efforts at illegal crossings -- measured by the number of people detained at the border -- have fallen 17 percent this year, after declining 20 percent in 2007, figures that Chief David V. Aguilar of the Border Patrol points to as proof that the overall approach to border enforcement is working. 
 Still, Mr. Aguilar and other officials acknowledge, the new fencing has mainly proved useful when it has been backed up with other enforcement methods, like electronic surveillance and aggressive prosecution of illegal immigrants caught by the Border Patrol. 
 Since last year, the steepest drops in illegal crossings along the 2,000-mile border were recorded here in eastern Arizona and in places in Texas where those combined tactics were applied, official figures show.
 Technical glitches have plagued plans to expand and enhance the electronic surveillance into a virtual fence, and it remains uncertain when it will be in broader use. 
 After months of delays, the Border Patrol approved a pilot system in February from its contractor, Boeing, which now says that most of a prototype tested along 28 miles of border will be replaced. The company will also build a virtual fence on another 30-mile stretch of southern Arizona and test similar technology on the Canadian border near Detroit this year.
 Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in an interview that constructing physical barriers -- as of last month, about 309 miles of fence had been built -- is not the key to stopping illegal immigration, but he defended the fence's usefulness.
 ''I don't believe the fence is a cure-all,'' Mr. Chertoff said. ''Nor do I believe it is a waste. Yes, you can get over it; yes, you can get under it. But it is a useful tool that makes it more difficult for people to cross. It is one of a number of tools we have, and you've got to use all of the tools.''
 As many as 2,000 immigrants a day still cross the Southwest border illegally, according to estimates by scholars well versed on the border. Continuing a decades-old cat-and-mouse game, the crossers move away from areas where the Border Patrol establishes control to more vulnerable points, most recently near San Diego.
 In addition to the border enforcement, immigrant traffic is influenced by a variety of social, political and economic factors; the recent drop in known crossings, for example, occurred as the economy began to sputter, drying up construction jobs and others that lure immigrants.
 Trinidad Alamea, who operates a small shelter across the border from Naco, said several nights had passed recently without a single immigrant seeking help. But, Mr. Alamea said, such fluctuations have occurred before, only for immigrant traffic to return when smugglers adjust to whatever new tactic or conditions confront them on the American side.
 ''The people are going to cross, wall or no wall,'' he said. 
 Opposition to the fence intensified last month after Mr. Chertoff used authority provided by Congress to waive more than two dozen environmental laws and others to push ahead with construction. Mr. Chertoff said his department needed to bypass the laws if it was to meet the goal set by Congress two years ago of completing at least 670 miles of fence by the end of this year.
 Fourteen United States representatives, all Democrats, including Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, have said they support a lawsuit filed in April by two environmental groups -- the Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife -- that challenges Mr. Chertoff's waiver. 
 Meanwhile, officials in border cities, Indian groups and educational institutions have stepped up their criticism of the fence. The broad array of dissenters are protesting what they say are the economic and environmental impacts of the fence for border cities, ranches and natural areas, and questioning whether the estimated $2.1 billion for its construction is the best use of border security money.
 ''No thought was given methodically to this idea of the fence,'' Patricio M. Ahumada Jr., the mayor of Brownsville, Tex., said on Friday in Washington, where the Texas Border Coalition filed its lawsuit. ''Homeland Security is using it to give a false sense of security to middle America that it will keep illegal immigrants and terrorists out, but it just isn't true.'' 
 At a Congressional hearing this month in Brownsville, the president of the University of Texas campus there, Juliet V. Garcia, testified that she had not been consulted before Homeland Security officials announced plans to build an 18-foot-high barrier that she said would leave the campus's technology center and golf course ''on the Mexican side of the fence.''
 Ms. Garcia said she believed that the fence would pose ''serious harm to the university on many fronts,'' including risks to students' safety, to its property investments and to its educational mission.
 In Naco, historically one of the more troublesome spots for the agency in its campaign to curb illegal crossings, construction workers have clawed a trench and fired up blowtorches as they maneuvered giant grates of mesh into place for a second row of fencing. A hodgepodge of steel plating, heavy-duty mesh and towering metallic slats now extends for miles, replacing ragged, five-strand barbed wire fencing that for decades marked the Mexican border.
 Arrests of illegal immigrants are down. And this village's larger twin in Mexico has seen its economy, dependent largely on smuggling, plummet.
 Border Patrol officials interpret both developments as signs of success. Michael Hyatt, a Border Patrol field supervisor, noted that a number of steps had been taken in this area, aside from the fence, to frustrate smugglers and repeat crossers, an acute problem here.
 Although Mr. Hyatt would not disclose how many agents work there, a station built for 26 agents will be replaced next year by new quarters housing 450. Altogether, he said, word is spreading that Naco is not as easy as smugglers make it out to be.
 ''They see some of the infrastructure we're putting out there,'' he said.
 But Mr. Hyatt is not raising a toast yet. The fence, he said, ''is not going to stop people from coming across.''
 ''It is going to deter some from crossing,'' he said. ''It's going to relocate some to other areas to cross where there isn't a fence.''
 Officials of the Homeland Security Department give a broad estimate of $3 million per mile to build the fence, or about $2.1 billion to reach the goal this year, out of $5.2 billion for the Border Patrol this year. The officials have declined to provide Congress with a more exact price tag, saying costs vary depending on the difficulty of the terrain.
 Under perhaps the most effective program, which is used in limited areas of Arizona and Texas, federal prosecutors press criminal misdemeanor charges against immigrants caught by the Border Patrol, putting them in detention for up to two months, well beyond the several hours they normally would be held before being returned to Mexico.
 The Justice Department is adding 64 federal prosecutors along the border to support these criminal cases. But the authorities cannot expand the program much further because of lack of detention space. 
 In the Border Patrol sector around Yuma, Ariz., apprehensions dropped 69 percent since the program was begun last year, official figures show. The agency uses its apprehension figures as an approximate gauge of illegal crossings, assuming that agents make fewer arrests when fewer immigrants try to cross. In March 2007, agents caught 5,571 in the Yuma sector; this March, they caught 751.
 In a new survey of immigrants from the south-central Mexico farming state of Oaxaca, Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego, found that they believed the border had become much more dangerous to cross illegally. The percentage of those caught at least once by the Border Patrol had doubled since 2005, to 48 percent from 24 percent, according to the survey, which was conducted among 821 immigrants from December 2007 to February.
 But 97 percent of the immigrants who set out to cross the border illegally said they had succeeded eventually, Mr. Cornelius found, a figure that has not decreased since 2005. In the survey, 82 percent of the immigrants who succeeded in crossing said they came through San Diego. In fact, overall apprehensions in San Diego -- where fences have been in place since 1993 -- defied the downward trend, jumping by 20 percent in 2007, Border Patrol figures show. 
 Meanwhile, groups opposing illegal immigration are also protesting the fence construction -- in their case, because of unhappiness with its slow progress. A new group in Tucson called Techno Patriots has set up several thermal imaging cameras at the border to watch for illegal crossers by laptop computer from their homes.
 The Cochise County Militia in Naco, one of several civilian patrol groups along the border, is making plans to bring in dozens of volunteers in the coming months to help apprehend illegal immigrants who the group says still manage to get in despite the new fencing.
 Bill Davis, the group's leader, called the barriers ''a joke.''
 ''This is still the worst 90 miles of border,'' Mr. Davis said.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Faces Brain Tumor, a Malignancy

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK and CARL HULSE; Pam Belluck reported from Boston and Carl Hulse from Washington. Katie Zezima contributed reporting from Boston.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the longtime Massachusetts Democrat and patriarch of the Kennedy family, has a malignant brain tumor, his doctors said on Tuesday.
 Doctors here at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were investigating the cause of a seizure that Mr. Kennedy, 76, suffered at his Cape Cod compound on Saturday, said preliminary results from a biopsy of the brain had revealed that he has a malignant glioma in the left parietal lobe, the upper left part of his brain.
 Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, the hospital's vice chairman of neurology, and Dr. Larry Ronan, Mr. Kennedy's primary care physician at the hospital, said in a statement that ''the usual course of treatment includes combinations of various forms of radiation and chemotherapy'' and that ''decisions regarding the best course of treatment for Senator Kennedy will be determined after further testing and analysis.''
 News of the brain tumor jolted people in Washington, Massachusetts and beyond, generating reaction from around the world, where Mr. Kennedy's legendary family legacy and his 46 years in the Senate have made him a well-known figure. 
 Aside from an unsuccessful run for president in 1980, Mr. Kennedy has focused his energy on issues including health care, education and civil rights. Despite his liberal ideology and occasional loud clashes on the Senate floor, Mr. Kennedy is held in high esteem by the opposition for his determination, understanding of the issues and a willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion on subjects like education, health care and immigration.
 ''Senator Kennedy enjoys great respect and admiration on this side of the aisle,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''He is indeed one of the most important figures to ever serve in this body in our history.''
 In a statement, President Bush said, ''Ted Kennedy is a man of tremendous courage, remarkable strength, and powerful spirit.'' Mr. Bush said he and his wife, Laura, ''join our fellow Americans in praying for his full recovery.''
 Senator John McCain echoed that sentiment, and both Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton invoked Mr. Kennedy at length on Tuesday night in their speeches declaring victory in the Oregon and Kentucky primaries, respectively. 
 Doctors and people close to Senator Kennedy said that he would remain in the hospital for the next couple of days. The doctors said he was ''in overall good condition'' and ''remains in good spirits and full of energy.'' He has not had another seizure since he was hospitalized, they said.
 ''Right now, he's his normal self, except for the news that he's dealing with,'' said a close friend who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''I bet he'll be back at the Cape sailing this weekend. I expect he'll go back to work'' after the Memorial Day recess.
 Senate Democrats and Republicans learned of Mr. Kennedy's condition as they were gathered for their weekly closed-door party luncheons, and members of both parties were visibly shaken by the news.
 As he opened debate on the Iraq spending bill, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, at 90 the only current senator to serve longer than Mr. Kennedy, was distraught. ''Ted, Ted, my dear friend, I love you and miss you,'' Mr. Byrd said in halting remarks on the floor.
 Malignant glioma is the most common form of brain cancer, accounting for about 9,000 cases diagnosed each year in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. They are more common in older people, especially those between the ages of 75 and 84, according to the American Cancer Society.
 The prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of the tumor, and the patient's age. The American Cancer Society said that survival rates drop with increasing age.
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said on Tuesday in Washington that he had visited Mr. Kennedy over the weekend.
 ''He's in a fighting mood,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''He is asking questions about what the choices are for him. He's deeply involved in making all the kinds of personal decisions that any of you would.''
 Mr. Kerry added: ''He would call you and help arrange a discussion with a bunch of doctors to talk about a wife who was sick or a child or any number of things -- now everybody needs to do that on behalf of Ted. Everybody needs to pull for him and his family and remember that this guy is one unbelievable fighter.''
 In Massachusetts, the impact of Mr. Kennedy's persona and political legacy is hard to overestimate.
 ''There'll never be another Ted Kennedy,'' said Paul S. Grogan, president and chief executive of the Boston Foundation, which finances nonprofits involved in economic development and other state issues. ''He's sort of Horatio at the bridge. He's been such an outsized figure, so influential, so effective.''
 Mr. Grogan said that Mr. Kennedy had given Massachusetts a level of political prominence beyond what would normally be accorded a state of its size, and that he had helped engineer policies and financing mechanisms that benefited important sectors of the state, including universities and medical centers.
 ''He's single-handedly postponed the onset of Massachusetts's political decline,'' Mr. Grogan said. ''His vigor, his vitality and his longevity has kind of encouraged us all to believe that he's immortal, and we've gotten used to the idea that he's going to be around forever. But this is a reminder that he's not.''
 Cameron Kerry, a lawyer who is the brother of Senator Kerry, said the news of the brain tumor was ''like an earthquake,'' adding, ''He's just such a colossus that this kind of shakes the ground underneath everything.''
 Mr. Kerry said that ''on a political level, he's just been so good to my brother and to the whole family. He really is like family.''
 Jack Connors, a businessman who is active in Democratic causes, said: ''Ted Kennedy raised public service to an art form. Ted Kennedy has really been a hero for people who don't really have much of a voice.''
 Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, called him ''clearly the most influential senator in U.S. history.'' Mr. Frank added: ''His personality, his understanding of the legislative process, his dedication. He has a good sense of other people, a lot of empathy. And he hires first-rate people and knows how to benefit from them.''
 Legislators close to Mr. Kennedy, like Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said on Tuesday that they were certain Mr. Kennedy would return to work and would battle the tumor with his characteristic tenacity and energy.
 ''He's a fighter,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, ''and he's definitely ready for this fight.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Prohibit Beef From Sick or Injured Cows

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
The Agriculture Department proposed on Tuesday banning from the food supply all cows that are too sick or injured to walk, a long-sought victory for advocates of animal welfare.
 The proposed regulation would end an exemption that allowed the animals, known as downer cows, into the food supply if a government veterinarian inspected the animal and deemed it fit for slaughter.
 Agriculture Secretary Edward T. Schafer said that while the exemption was rarely granted -- it applied to fewer than 1,000 of the 34 million cattle that were slaughtered last year -- it had nonetheless created confusion among consumers. 
 The exemption was criticized after the Agriculture Department announced in February that 143 million pounds of beef would be recalled. Westland/Hallmark Meat, of Chino, Calif., had supplied the meat to retailers and school lunch programs. It was the largest beef recall in United States history.
 The recall was prompted by an undercover videotape shot by the Humane Society of the United States last fall that showed Westland/Hallmark employees using forklifts, water hoses and electric prods to force sickly cows to their feet. Some of those cows ended up in the food supply.
 The animals had fallen after passing an initial inspection by government inspectors. Under the downer exemption, a veterinarian could have been called to reinspect the animals and perhaps deem them healthy enough to slaughter. But the exemption apparently encouraged laxity; in some instances at Westland/Hallmark, downer cows were sent to slaughter without the reinspection.
 ''Rules have a purpose, and when you violate them, there are consequences,'' Mr. Schafer said in a statement. Downer cows are restricted because they are more likely to carry illnesses, including mad cow disease.
 No people were reported to be ill from the Westland/Hallmark meat, and agriculture officials maintained that the chances of illness were remote.
 The Agriculture Department said eliminating the exemption for downer cows would make inspection procedures more efficient and reduce the incentive for meat companies to send sickly cows to market. The department will seek public comment before completing the rule.
 ''Cattle producers, transporters and slaughter establishments alike will be encouraged to enhance humane handling practices, as there will no longer be any market for cattle that are too weak to rise or walk on their own,'' Mr. Schafer said.
 The decision was hailed by animal welfare groups and members of Congress who had pushed to eliminate the exemption.
 ''It is a moral and economic imperative to establish a bright-line, no-downer policy, and we welcome the news,'' said Wayne Pacelle, chief executive and president of the Humane Society of the United States. ''We've always felt it was a small percentage, but a small percentage of 34 million is a lot of animals and a lot of suffering.'' 
 Mr. Pacelle said his organization would push for more stringent oversight of the slaughter process, including installing cameras so that cattle could be monitored while they are waiting to be slaughtered.
 ''What Hallmark showed us is that the workers put on a different show when inspectors are present,'' he said.
 The proposal was also hailed by the meat industry, which threw its support behind the change in April. Industry leaders once favored the exemption, but came around to the view that it was undermining the confidence of consumers and foreign customers.
 ''A strictly enforceable downer ban will eliminate confusion and move the ball forward on food safety and humane standards, while restoring consumer faith in a vital American sector,'' Senator Herbert H. Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Nomination 'Within Reach'

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY. 
Adam Nagourney reported from New York, and Jeff Zeleny from Des Moines. Megan Thee and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Senator Barack Obama took a big step toward becoming the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday, amassing enough additional delegates to claim an all but insurmountable advantage in his race against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Mr. Obama won the Oregon primary on Tuesday night, although he lost Kentucky to Mrs. Clinton.
 While Mrs. Clinton's campaign continued to make a case that she could prevail, Mr. Obama used the Kentucky and Oregon results to move into a new phase of the campaign in which he will face different challenges. Those include bringing Mrs. Clinton's supporters into his camp; winning over elements of the Democratic coalition like working-class whites, Hispanics and Jews; and fending off attacks from Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, especially on national security.
 Mr. Obama's obstacles were underlined by the lopsided defeat in Kentucky, where just half of the Democratic voters said in exit polls that they would back him in the general election this fall. 
 Under the rules used by Democrats, Mr. Obama's showing in Kentucky and his victory in Oregon appear to be enough to allow him to secure a majority of the delegates up for grabs in primaries and caucuses. He has portrayed that threshhold as a yardstick for judging the will of Democratic voters. 
 ''We have returned to Iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the American people, and you have put us within reach of the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in America,'' Mr. Obama said, standing in front of a moonlit Capitol in Des Moines.
 But even as Mr. Obama moved closer to making history as the first black presidential nominee, he stopped short of declaring victory in the Democratic race, part of a calibrated effort in the remaining weeks of the contest to avoid appearing disrespectful to Mrs. Clinton and alienating her supporters. Instead, he offered her lavish praise.
 ''Senator Clinton has shattered myths and broken barriers and changed the America in which my daughters and your daughters will come of age, and for that we are grateful to her,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 Mrs. Clinton, declaring victory in Kentucky, made clear that she had no intention of stepping aside before the Democratic voting ends on June 3. ''This is one of the closest races for a party's nomination in modern history,'' she said. ''We are winning the popular vote, and I am more determined than ever to see that every vote is cast and every ballot is counted.''
 Going into Tuesday, Mr. Obama had 1,915 of the 2,026 pledged delegates and superdelegates needed to claim the nomination, according to a count and projection by The New York Times. His campaign estimated that if he simply held his own in the remaining contests, he would need only 25 more votes from superdelegates, the elected Democrats and party leaders who are delegates without having to be selected in a primary. There are 221 undeclared superdelegates left; Mr. Obama has been rolling out endorsements on a daily basis.
 Mr. Obama marked the moment with a highly symbolic return to Iowa, the state that launched his campaign with a big win on Jan. 3. Mr. Obama's aides said they were increasingly concerned that the long fight with Mrs. Clinton had given Mr. McCain a free ride in critical general election states. 
 His appearance in Iowa, which looms as a battleground state in the fall election, also suggested a new focus on the coming fight against Mr. McCain, with Mr. Obama portraying Mr. McCain as a third term for President Bush. 
 The Republican primary campaign, Mr. Obama said, ''was a contest to see which candidate could out-Bush the other, and that is the contest John McCain won.''
 Mr. Obama is scheduled to spend Wednesday through Friday in Florida, an important general election state. In the next month, Mr. Obama will head to Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio, even as he continues to spend time where the remaining three Democratic contests will be held.
 But even as he moved closer to winning the intensely fought nominating contest with Mrs. Clinton -- a battle suffused with history and the tension inherent in a campaign defined in part by race and gender -- Mr. Obama was preparing to deal with a series of challenges in the weeks ahead. 
 A rally in downtown Des Moines on Tuesday evening, where thousands gathered against the backdrop of the State Capitol building, offered evidence of steps Mr. Obama was taking to try to unite the party. Thousands of telephone and e-mail invitations went out across Iowa, where Mr. McCain is already running television commercials. Those targeted were not only existing supporters of Mr. Obama, but also voters who backed other candidates earlier this year and will soon be asked to join the fight against Mr. McCain.
 Beyond that, the results in Kentucky again suggested Mr. Obama's general weakness with white blue-collar voters. 
 Mr. Obama's aides disputed the significance of the findings, pointing to national polls that show him running strongly against Mr. McCain with those voters and arguing that Democrats would return to the fold as the contest between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain took shape.
 ''There's enough evidence now in public polls that in a general election against McCain, in the states that will determine the presidency, her supporters are coming our way,'' said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager. 
 Since 1972, when exit polls first began, no Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority of white voters. The closest division was in 1992, a three-way contest when 39 percent of whites voted for Bill Clinton and 40 percent voted for the first President Bush. In 2004, President Bush defeated John Kerry among whites by 58 percent to 41 percent. 
 David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama, said he was not worried about the significant share of Clinton supporters who said they would be disappointed if Mr. Obama became the nominee. He predicted a ''natural coalescence'' among Democrats after the nominating battle concluded because of a concern over the war, the economy and the direction of the country.
 Mr. Obama's strengths in the race were underlined Tuesday night when his campaign reported that he had raised $31.3 million in April, compared with $22 million raised by Mrs. Clinton and $18.5 million raised by Mr. McCain. Mr. Obama, who continued to take in most of his money in small donations, also ended the month with more cash on hand than either of his rivals. Over all, he has taken in more than $158 million this year.
 Mr. Obama's advisers acknowledged that the campaign would need to deal with a perception of weakness, at least among critical party members. In particular, contributors and supporters of Mrs. Clinton worried that Mr. Obama was suffering because of attacks on his relationship with his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., as well as on his patriotism.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Nomination 'Within Reach'

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY. 
Adam Nagourney reported from New York, and Jeff Zeleny from Des Moines. Megan Thee and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Senator Barack Obama took a big step toward becoming the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday, amassing enough additional delegates to claim an all but insurmountable advantage in his race against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Mr. Obama won the Oregon primary on Tuesday night, although he lost Kentucky to Mrs. Clinton.
 While Mrs. Clinton's campaign continued to make a case that she could prevail, Mr. Obama used the Kentucky and Oregon results to move into a new phase of the campaign in which he will face different challenges. Those include bringing Mrs. Clinton's supporters into his camp; winning over elements of the Democratic coalition like working-class whites, Hispanics and Jews; and fending off attacks from Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, especially on national security.
 Mr. Obama's obstacles were underlined by the lopsided defeat in Kentucky, where just half of the Democratic voters said in exit polls that they would back him in the general election this fall. 
 Under the rules used by Democrats, Mr. Obama's showing in Kentucky and his victory in Oregon appear to be enough to allow him to secure a majority of the delegates up for grabs in primaries and caucuses. He has portrayed that threshhold as a yardstick for judging the will of Democratic voters. 
 ''We have returned to Iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the American people, and you have put us within reach of the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in America,'' Mr. Obama said, standing in front of a moonlit Capitol in Des Moines.
 But even as Mr. Obama moved closer to making history as the first black presidential nominee, he stopped short of declaring victory in the Democratic race, part of a calibrated effort in the remaining weeks of the contest to avoid appearing disrespectful to Mrs. Clinton and alienating her supporters. Instead, he offered her lavish praise.
 ''Senator Clinton has shattered myths and broken barriers and changed the America in which my daughters and your daughters will come of age, and for that we are grateful to her,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 Mrs. Clinton, declaring victory in Kentucky, made clear that she had no intention of stepping aside before the Democratic voting ends on June 3. ''This is one of the closest races for a party's nomination in modern history,'' she said. ''We are winning the popular vote, and I am more determined than ever to see that every vote is cast and every ballot is counted.''
 Going into Tuesday, Mr. Obama had 1,915 of the 2,026 pledged delegates and superdelegates needed to claim the nomination, according to a count and projection by The New York Times. His campaign estimated that if he simply held his own in the remaining contests, he would need only 25 more votes from superdelegates, the elected Democrats and party leaders who are delegates without having to be selected in a primary. There are 221 undeclared superdelegates left; Mr. Obama has been rolling out endorsements on a daily basis.
 Mr. Obama marked the moment with a highly symbolic return to Iowa, the state that launched his campaign with a big win on Jan. 3. Mr. Obama's aides said they were increasingly concerned that the long fight with Mrs. Clinton had given Mr. McCain a free ride in critical general election states. 
 His appearance in Iowa, which looms as a battleground state in the fall election, also suggested a new focus on the coming fight against Mr. McCain, with Mr. Obama portraying Mr. McCain as a third term for President Bush. 
 The Republican primary campaign, Mr. Obama said, ''was a contest to see which candidate could out-Bush the other, and that is the contest John McCain won.''
 Mr. Obama is scheduled to spend Wednesday through Friday in Florida, an important general election state. In the next month, Mr. Obama will head to Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio, even as he continues to spend time where the remaining three Democratic contests will be held.
 But even as he moved closer to winning the intensely fought nominating contest with Mrs. Clinton -- a battle suffused with history and the tension inherent in a campaign defined in part by race and gender -- Mr. Obama was preparing to deal with a series of challenges in the weeks ahead. 
 A rally in downtown Des Moines on Tuesday evening, where thousands gathered against the backdrop of the State Capitol building, offered evidence of steps Mr. Obama was taking to try to unite the party. Thousands of telephone and e-mail invitations went out across Iowa, where Mr. McCain is already running television commercials. Those targeted were not only existing supporters of Mr. Obama, but also voters who backed other candidates earlier this year and will soon be asked to join the fight against Mr. McCain.
 Beyond that, the results in Kentucky again suggested Mr. Obama's general weakness with white blue-collar voters.

HEADLINE: Problems in School May Come From Outside

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Hard Roads Ahead,'' by Bob Herbert (column, May 17):
 I am a seasoned high school history teacher who has long wondered why some students from similar backgrounds and incomes succeed in school and others drop out. I have concluded that it is innate motivation that is the causative factor. 
 We are asking the wrong questions in education today. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with our schools, we need to do research on what motivates children to value education. 
 Yes, smaller classes and energetic teachers would help, but we need to determine how to reach students who have no role models or mentors to inspire them to study. Many of my students have reached high school without any idea of how to study, how to sit still in a quiet room without electronics blaring, and no realistic picture of the future that awaits them without a college degree.
 That's where the money should be spent, not in just adding computers to classrooms.
 Joyce Prenner Jericho, N.Y., May 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert is right to place such great importance on high school education. But our high schools are not the primary place where we need to re-envision our responsibilities to the next generation. 
 Numerous studies and my own experience as a teacher have demonstrated that for our children to be truly successful in high school, they need to have been well fed, safe, secure and loved for the 14 years before they get to high school.
 We will not cut the dropout rate by restructuring our schools but by restructuring our economy so that it provides for our ever-growing population of children born into poverty.
 Chris Johnson Austin, Tex., May 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The key for substantially raising the educational level of children in this country is to make the school environment replicate the kind of nurturing, enriched home environment that successful students come from. 
 This means plenty of books and other reading materials in every part of the school. It means money spent on the arts, and on low student-teacher ratios. It means sufficient financing for support services for children from unhappy or turbulent homes. It means paying and valuing adults who work with children as much as we pay and value other professionals. The price for doing this is high, but as Bob Herbert points out, the price for not doing it is even higher.

HEADLINE: OBAMA DECLARES BID 'WITHIN REACH' AFTER 2 PRIMARIES

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY; Adam Nagourney reported from New York, and Jeff Zeleny from Des Moines. Megan Thee and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama took a big step toward becoming the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday, amassing enough additional delegates to claim an all but insurmountable advantage in his race against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 While Mrs. Clinton's campaign continued to make a case that she could prevail, Mr. Obama seized on the results from Democratic contests in Kentucky and Oregon to move into a new phase of the campaign in which he will face different challenges. Those include bringing disaffected Clinton supporters into his camp; winning over elements of the Democratic coalition like working-class whites, Hispanics and Jews; and fending off attacks from Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, especially on national security.
 Mr. Obama won easily in Oregon. But his obstacles were underlined by a lopsided defeat in Kentucky, where just half of the Democratic voters said in exit polls that they would back him in the general election this fall. 
 Under the rules used by Democrats, the split decision was enough for Mr. Obama to secure a majority of the delegates up for grabs in primaries and caucuses. His campaign has portrayed success in winning those pledged delegates as the most important yardstick for judging the will of Democratic voters, and has encouraged superdelegates -- elected officials and party leaders who have an automatic vote at the convention -- to fall in line accordingly. 
 ''We have returned to Iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the American people, and you have put us within reach of the Democratic nomination for president of the United States of America,'' Mr. Obama said in an address on Tuesday night, standing in front of a moonlit Capitol in Des Moines.
 Even as Mr. Obama moved closer to making history as the first black presidential nominee, he stopped short of declaring victory in the Democratic race, part of a carefully calibrated effort in the remaining weeks of the contest to avoid appearing disrespectful to Mrs. Clinton and alienating her supporters. Instead, he offered lavish praise for his rival over 16 months.
 ''Senator Clinton has shattered myths and broken barriers and changed the America in which my daughters and your daughters will come of age, and for that we are grateful to her,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 Mrs. Clinton, declaring victory in Kentucky, made clear that she had no intention of stepping aside before the Democratic voting ends on June 3. ''This is one of the closest races for a party's nomination in modern history,'' she said. ''We are winning the popular vote, and I am more determined than ever to see that every vote is cast and every ballot is counted.''
 Going into Tuesday, Mr. Obama had 1,915 of the 2,026 pledged delegates and superdelegates needed to claim the nomination, according to a count and projection by The New York Times. His campaign estimated that if he simply held his own in the remaining contests, he would need only 25 more votes from superdelegates. There are 221 undeclared superdelegates left; Mr. Obama has been rolling out endorsements on a daily basis.
 But even as he moved closer to winning the intensely fought nominating contest with Mrs. Clinton -- a battle suffused with history and the tension inherent in a campaign defined in part by race and gender -- Mr. Obama was preparing to deal with a series of challenges in the weeks ahead. 
 He was planning a vigorous schedule of travel to general election states and a voter registration drive focusing on black voters to offset any losses among whites. Aides said he was considering delivering another speech to deal with damage in the primary because of attacks on his relationship with his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., as well as on his patriotism. 
 ''We know we have our work cut out for us,'' said Steve Hildebrand, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama. ''But we are up to the task.''
 At the same time, Mr. Obama's aides said they were not concerned with exit polls showing that he had hemorrhaged white working-class voters to Mrs. Clinton in Kentucky, mirroring similar findings in Indiana, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Many Clinton voters in Kentucky said they would stay home or vote for Mr. McCain in the fall. Two in 10 Democratic voters in Kentucky said race was a factor in their choice, and they overwhelmingly voted for Mrs. Clinton.
 ''You can't look at it that way,'' said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager. ''There's enough evidence now in public polls that in a general election against McCain, in the states that will determine the presidency, her supporters are coming our way. I think this is an issue that in 30 or 60 days we will not be talking about.''
 Mr. Obama marked this moment with a return to Iowa, the state that kicked off his campaign with a big win on Jan. 3, He used his stage to portray Mr. McCain as running for a third term for President Bush, an argument that Mr. Obama's aides said would be a central point of attack as he sought to move from the primary into the general election.
 The Republican primary campaign, Mr. Obama said, ''was a contest to see which candidate could out-Bush the other, and that is the contest John McCain won.''
 Mr. Obama's aides said they were increasingly concerned that the long fight with Mrs. Clinton had given Mr. McCain a free ride in critical general election states like Iowa.
 Mr. Obama is scheduled to spend Wednesday through Friday in Florida, focusing on the corridor between Tampa and Orlando, a region bustling with swing voters. The trip starts an effort to repair wounds caused by the deadlock over recognizing the Florida primary and seating the state's delegates. 
 Next week, Mr. Obama heads to Colorado, a state he believes Democrats can win, and other Western states. 
 Over the next month, he plans trips to the traditional general election battlegrounds of Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio, even as he continues to compete in the three remaining Democratic contests in Puerto Rico, Montana and South Dakota.
 The rally in downtown Des Moines offered evidence of steps Mr. Obama was taking to try to unite the party. Thousands of telephone and e-mail invitations went out across Iowa -- where Mr. McCain is already running television commercials -- to party activists and independent voters, including many who backed other candidates this year.
 David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama, said he was not worried about the significant share of Clinton supporters who said they would be disappointed if Mr. Obama became the nominee. He predicted a ''natural coalescence'' among Democrats after the nominating battle concluded because of a concern over the war, the economy and the direction of the country.
 ''We're going to reach out and try to unify this party,'' Mr. Axelrod said in an interview on Tuesday. ''It will happen naturally based on a commonality of interests.''
 Since 1972, when modern exit polls first began, no Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority of white voters. The closest division was in 1992, a three-way contest when 39 percent of whites voted for Bill Clinton and 40 percent voted for the first President Bush. In 2004, President Bush defeated John Kerry among whites by 58 percent to 41 percent. 
 While Mr. Obama has struggled with Mrs. Clinton to win the support of Hispanic voters -- something Mr. McCain's campaign has taken note of in focusing on states like Colorado and New Mexico -- a Gallup tracking poll released on Tuesday, taken Friday to Sunday, showed Mr. Obama leading Mrs. Clinton 55 percent to 39 percent among all Democratic voters. Among Hispanic voters, the race is tighter, with Mr. Obama receiving 51 percent to Mrs. Clinton's 44 percent.
 Even as Mr. Obama's aides disputed the notion that the exit polls raised red flags about his merits as a general election candidate, they acknowledged they would have to deal with that perception among critical party leaders who might be worried about the fall -- in particular, contributors and supporters of Mrs. Clinton. To offset the voters who may rule out supporting Mr. Obama, because of his race or other reasons, the campaign is working to register new voters. In Georgia, for example, 600,000 black residents are eligible to vote but are not registered. In Virginia, there are 200,000 black residents not registered to vote.
 But most immediately, Mr. Obama faces the task of bringing the party back together, and finding the right tone to strike in being deferential to Mrs. Clinton -- making concessions that might make his opponent and her supporters happy in the end -- without appearing to be ceding authority to his rival. 
 Several Democrats said the model he needed to avoid was the 1980 primary fight between President Jimmy Carter and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, with its awkward spectacle at the nominating convention that made the party look divided and Mr. Carter seem suppliant.

HEADLINE: Raiding the Pantry to Add Sparkle and Shine

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
''MICHELLE, would you like to head up the creamy soft-scrub team?''
 With that call to arms, the women in Laura Gosa's kitchen in Jersey City fell to, blending the ingredients spread out on her counters like so many blasts from Grandma's preindustrial past: baking soda, borax, Castile soap, lemon oil, vinegar, glycerin and other staples of the all-natural armamentarium.
 These women weren't interested in buying green products; this was strictly a make-your-own approach. It was one of more than 100 such parties held since late March in various parts of the country by Women's Voices for the Earth, an environmental group based in Missoula, Mont., that just began the program and has another 100 parties planned. The group made headlines last year with a report that common household cleaners contained obscure chemicals -- mostly in small amounts as fragrances or surfactants -- that it considered unsafe. 
 While it is deeply serious about persuading people to consider alternatives to chemical-laden cleaning products, the parties are not merely dutiful. At another recent one in the Wall Street conference room of Divine Capital Markets, a brokerage firm, the firm's founder, Danielle F. Hughes, served ''Windex martinis,'' mixed from Ketel One vodka and blue Gatorade. 
 Ms. Hughes said she is wary of detergents and cleaning products because she thinks they triggered her past attacks of asthma and eczema. But she is hardly suspicious of everything made by conglomerates. 
 ''Heck, I'm in the stock market, I don't want everybody to stop buying everything,'' she said. ''But we need to lobby companies to say, Hey, tell us what's in it.''
 As fear of global warming has given new clout to a tattered environmental movement, and as companies like Clorox have responded by bringing out ''green'' product lines, groups like Women's Voices have responded by saying there's no need to pay $4.99 for a bottle of cleaner with ingredients the company won't name when you can make your own with well-known ingredients for pennies.
 The organization sends out packets to help get the party started, including recipe cards and a DVD describing its findings. Ms. Hughes signed up because her roommate at the University of Massachusetts, Dori Gilels, is now the executive director of Women's Voices. Ms. Gosa, a fund-raiser for a human rights group, the National Economic and Social Rights Initiative, has been making her own cleaning products for years, saying she prefers ingredients she knows to the unpronounceable chemicals in commercial cleaners. 
 At the party in Ms. Gosa's apartment, Michelle Williams-Burrows, a skin-care therapist, said she had mixed many of the same ingredients into her lotions, but had never thought of cleaning her bathroom with them.
 ''My kids come in and see me making skin-care products, and they say, 'Is that something to eat? Or are we going to have to wear it?' I tell them, 'You can do both!' ''
 Recipes for homemade cleaning products have been available in books and magazines for years, but they suddenly seem to be everywhere. 
 They're even becoming the stuff of entertainment. The BBC America show, ''How Clean Is Your House,'' shown on cable and YouTube, features ''dirt detectives'' Aggie MacKenzie and Kim Woodburn, who clean up the nauseatingly filthy houses of people who have volunteered to air their dirty linen on air. The appeal of the show, besides the pleasure of realizing that your bathroom is spotless compared to some, is that the duo recall Patsy and Eddy of ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' but with sponges instead of flutes of Bolly, brushing aside cobwebs and owners' explanations of why they haven't tidied up for 11 years or how they hadn't noticed their seven cockatoos' guano piles.
 In line with today's focus on natural, Aggie and Kim patiently teach tricks like de-blackening a window of a wood-burning stove with a mix of fire ash and water, or scrubbing a filthy tub with half a grapefruit heaped with salt.
 Fashions evolve in cleaners just as in hemlines, albeit more slowly. In the early 20th century, convenience and quality assurance ruled: buying soap flakes was easier than boiling your own beef fat and ashes, and Ivory Snow was 99 and 44/100 percent pure.
 Subsequent attraction to plastic bottles, aerosol sprays, pumps, foams, bleaches and enzymes brought buyers into the late 20th century, when baby boomers turned to germ-killing products. Those products have lost some allure as questions arose: whether they promote antibiotic resistance, whether their antibiotics can combine with chlorinated water to make carcinogens, whether soap and water works just as well -- and whether some germs are good, since research suggests that farm children who roll in pig manure may be less likely to develop allergies than Boerum Hill Bugaboo jockeys whose fingers are Purelled hourly.
 Experts in cleaning and toxicology say some safety principles cannot be forgotten.
 The first is that whatever health risk a child may face from fumes pales in comparison to the danger of poisoning. Many cleaning chemicals can kill or destroy tissues if swallowed; even mild soaps cause diarrhea.
 It is crucial to keep cleaning products in cabinets with childproof latches or out of reach on high shelves, and never to make a product that resembles juice or soda. (Or anything else edible: more than one Web site commented on the unfortunate resemblance between green canisters of Kraft Parmesan cheese and Comet cleanser.)
 The second principle is to remember that plenty of the things Grandma cleaned with were and are dangerous.
 Lye cleans ovens and acid opens drains; both can blind if splashed in the eyes. Bleach and ammonia can damage lungs. Solvents can explode. Rust removers can remove flesh. Avoid them, or use gloves and protect your eyes.
 Careless mixing can also be hazardous. For example, bleach mixed with ammonia produces dangerous chloramine gas. Bleach mixed with acids (including mere vinegar, which contains acetic acid) can produce chlorine gas, used in the trenches in World War I.
 It's not always obvious what a product contains. Some scouring powders contain bleach.
 Acids are in some toilet cleaners and rust removers.
 Ammonia is often in glass cleaners, but it's also in cat boxes or diaper pails in the form of dried urine.
 Beyond those sorts of chemicals begins the gray zone that Women's Voices is addressing.
 Makers of cleaning products are required to put words like Danger or Poison on labels if they contain obviously dangerous ingredients. But they are not required to list all ingredients and usually do not. On material safety data sheets filed with the federal government they may use vague terms like ''fragrance,'' ''surfactant'' or ''disinfectant.''
 Women's Voices wrote to many manufacturers, asking them to specify which chemicals were in their products.
 Most declined, saying their formulas were secret, although all said their products were safe. Women's Voices argues that some chemicals, particularly those found in air fresheners and fabric softeners, such as phthalates, monoethanolamine and quaternary ammonium compounds, have been linked to low sperm counts, birth weights and other problems when large doses are fed to laboratory animals, and that janitors and others exposed through constant use at industrial-strength applications have higher rates of asthma.
 However, there is no scientific proof that the typical home exposure from off-the-shelf cleaning is risky.
 ''We'd love to have that data, but that kind of research just hasn't been done,'' said Alexandra Gorman Scranton, science director for Women's Voices. ''That's where our concerns come in. We don't know the effects they could have over a lifetime.''
 Urvashi Rangan, a Consumers Union toxicologist, is not as mistrustful of detergent makers as Women's Voice is, but agreed that more research was needed.
 ''The way the message is sometimes construed -- Danger! Danger! -- I don't think we can raise the red flags that high,'' she said. ''But a lot of these chemicals have never been fully tested for safety.''
 ''If you're doing a lot of work, and you're not in a well-ventilated area -- we don't know what the combinations of all these in a day can do,'' she added. ''Certainly some can be respiratory irritants or cause eye sensitivity, especially if someone is sensitive.''
 In any case, the most sensible protection is the obvious one: open the window.

HEADLINE: The Blind Welcome a Court Ruling That May Help Them Count Their Paper Money

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY; David Giambusso and Brenda Goodman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Harold Wenning, 69, remembers what he called ''the one-for-five trick'' from his days running a news kiosk in Midtown Manhattan. 
 ''They'll say it's a five and give you a one,'' he said. ''I had a guy say it was a 20 once and he gave me a one. I had a guy buy a roll of quarters from me and he gave me a dollar. That happens.''
 It happens for two reasons. All the bills have the same size and feel, and Mr. Wenning has been totally blind for 30 years. 
 On Tuesday, a federal appeals court panel in Washington upheld a lower court ruling that said the government discriminated against the blind or partly blind by making its paper money all the same size and texture. Under the ruling, which may be appealed, the Treasury Department may need to redesign its bills, and vending machines may need to be refitted to accommodate new currency.
 About 16.5 million Americans are blind or partly blind, a number that is expected to double by 2030 because of an aging population and the prevalence of diabetes, said Tara A. Cortes, president of Lighthouse International, a nonprofit organization based in New York that addresses the problems caused by loss of vision. 
 People with impaired vision and the agencies that work with them welcomed the court's decision on Wednesday. 
 Dushun Dotson, 19, a trainee at Visions/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired on West 23rd Street and the cashier at the snack bar there, said she was overjoyed when she heard about the ruling. 
 ''I said, 'Oh, my God, Mom!' I was so happy,'' said Ms. Dotson, who lost her vision after a cerebral aneurysm at 13. The center teaches blind people to identify bills by a special folding method -- leave singles flat, fold $5 bills like a book, fold $10 bills lengthwise, and fold $20 bills in quarters. 
 Of course, the hard part is getting accurate information about which bill is which.
 James A. Kutsch, the president of the Seeing Eye Inc. of Morristown, N.J., a nonprofit guide dog school, said the court decision would mean greater independence for people with vision loss. 
 ''Currently, identifying money requires either the assistance of another person or use of technology,'' he said, referring to portable or computer-based scanners that read aloud the denominations of paper money but can cost more than $250. 
 ''Both have limitations,'' Mr. Kutsch said. ''Not everyone's a techie -- not everyone wants to use or can afford to use this technology. And with the low-tech option of asking someone else, you have to rely on the integrity of the person you ask, and the availability.''
 In Atlanta, Annie Maxwell, 61, who has been blind since birth, said, ''Sometimes when you're in the store and you don't have time to fold it and organize it right quick, and then you go into another store and pull it all out and ask, 'What is this? What is this?' it's ridiculous.'' 
 She added, ''If the money was sized differently I could say, 'This is a 10,' and that would be so empowering.''
 There was some criticism of the court decision, however. ''We hope that this ruling will not have the unintended consequence of reinforcing society's misconception that blind people are unable to function in the world as it currently is,'' Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind, said in a statement. 
 ''If America really wants to improve opportunities for education and employment of the blind, then it should focus on providing Braille instruction to the 90 percent of blind children who are not getting it, effective training for the 70 percent of blind adults who are unemployed,'' and Congressional cuts affecting the Library of Congress's Talking Books program. 
 Melanie Brunson, the executive director of the American Council of the Blind, which brought the lawsuit in 2002, said new paper currency could help address the unemployment rate among the blind, opening up many entry-level jobs in fast food or retail. 
 She said adding tactile features to bills, as Canada has done, could be a good solution. 
 ''We've seen some fairly old Canadian bills, and the dots hold up pretty well as far as I know,'' she said. And because many vending machines take only $1 bills, not all machines would have to be refitted, especially if the $1 bill was left in its current form, she said.
 Ms. Brunson said she wished that credit card transactions could be made more accessible. 
 ''You have no way of knowing, when you sign the receipt, what they have charged on the credit card,'' said Ms. Brunson, who has been blind since birth. She said her credit card information was stolen once -- she suspects by a sales clerk -- leaving her with half a dozen charges she had to challenge. 
 Other aspects of modern life present problems for blind people, including the growing popularity of quiet cars. 
 ''There are a number of people I know who have had very close encounters with hybrid vehicles in particular,'' Ms. Brunson said. ''People who are blind rely on their hearing to determine what traffic is doing, and thereby make a decision about when it is wise to cross a street.'' She said advocates for the blind were working with the auto industry to find a solution.
 Mr. Wenning, who now oversees vending machine operations at a United States Postal Service distribution center in Midtown, looks forward to the day when blind people will not have to rely on the varying kindness of strangers. 
 ''A guy came up to me one day and he gave me a $5 bill,'' Mr. Wenning recalled. ''He says, 'This is a $5 bill I owe you for something I did to you.' I guess he had a guilty conscience.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 7, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 22 about reactions among blind people to a ruling that the government discriminates against them by making paper money all the same size and texture included an erroneous statistic from an advocacy organization. According to Lighthouse International, 16.5 million Americans -- many of whom could be affected by the ruling -- report that they have vision impairment even when wearing glasses or contacts. That number does not, however, include the legally blind population, which the American Foundation for the Blind puts at 1.3 million. 
 And a chart in some editions reversed instructions from the foundation for folding paper bills to help the blind identify them. The $5 bill should be folded widthwise and the $10 bill lengthwise, not vice versa.

HEADLINE: Pakistan and Taliban Agree To Army's Gradual Pullback

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: PESHAWAR, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The government signed a deal with Taliban militants on Wednesday that calls for the Pakistani Army to withdraw gradually from Swat, a once popular resort area in North-West Frontier Province that has become a battleground. 
 The peace accord, one of a series being secured by the new government, calls for the enforcement of Shariah, or Islamic law, in Swat but allows for the operation of schools for girls that had been closed down. 
 The authorities in the province, who are allies of the newly elected federal government, said they would allow the local branch of the umbrella Taliban group, Tehrik-e-Taliban, to help maintain law and order in Swat. 
 The senior minister of the province, Basher Ahmad Bilour, said that under the terms of the accord, the branch, called the Taliban in Swat, pledged not to attack the security forces. 
 But it was not clear from the announcement how the deal would be enforced. Nor was it clear what success the authorities would have in separating out what they called hard-line jihadists from other areas. 
 The announcement on Wednesday came as the federal government was completing a controversial deal in South Waziristan, a part of Pakistan's tribal area near Afghanistan and controlled by the leader of Tehrik-e-Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud. 
 As part of the Waziristan deal, the Pakistani Army and the Taliban exchanged prisoners last week. The army, unused to counterinsurgency warfare and weary of casualties, has also pulled back from checkpoints around Mr. Mehsud's territory. 
 The new government's peace accords have come under increasing fire in Washington.
 Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that the Bush administration was concerned the negotiations would give the Taliban and Al Qaeda the latitude to carry out attacks against American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. 
 The Taliban pledged, according to the agreement, to allow polio vaccinations. Unicef had canceled its anti-polio campaign in Swat after violent protests by the militants last year.
 A lawyer in Swat, Sher Muhammad, said in a telephone interview that the enforcement of Shariah as described in the accord appeared to echo a 1999 law that called for Shariah in a manner that was not very severe.
 He added, though, that local people felt caught between the insurgents and the army, with their needs being ignored. 
 ''Ninety-nine percent of the people who did not take up arms, who are law-abiding citizens, their grievances are not looked after,'' he said. ''Unemployment, illiteracy, lack of health, the law and order situation, this is what matters. The state organs are completely crippled.''

HEADLINE: It's Still a Big City, Just Not Quite So Big

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; C.J. Hughes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Somehow, Michael S. Miller resisted the temptation when he got home not long ago. 
 ''Honey,'' he would have been completely justified in proclaiming to his wife, ''I shrank the city.''
 Mr. Miller, a geographer for the Department of City Planning, has calculated that New York City is 17 square miles smaller than it was long thought to be. 
 For two decades, the city's official directory, the Green Book, has stated definitively that the five boroughs encompass nearly 322 square miles of land. 
 Not so, Mr. Miller and his staff recently discovered: New York's land area actually totals 304.8 square miles. 
 The shrinkage generally is not the result of rising sea levels from global warming or beach erosion or any other act of nature. It is largely the work of man, mainly Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose yen to precisely measure everything from poverty to traffic congestion led the planning department to recalculate the city's land mass. 
 Acting on the mayor's mandate, Mr. Miller and his team spent months analyzing thousands of digitized, high-resolution aerial photographs of the squiggling shoreline and other geographic features to calculate the city's size anew.
 ''This is not a reflection of a change in the physical area, but a refinement of the measurement,'' Mr. Miller said.
 Seventeen square miles may not seem like much. But consider: 
 17 square miles could accommodate 13 more Central Parks, nearly a third of Washington, D.C., about three dozen versions of Vatican City and nearly two dozen replicas of Monaco. 
 If 17 square miles were populated at Manhattan's density, New York might be home to as many as 1.1 million more people. 
 At the price of an acre in Midtown, as recently computed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 17 square miles could be worth $1 trillion.
 Mr. Miller said the recalculation probably would have little practical effect, other than revising the land area chart in the 2008 Green Book and amending other official records, textbooks and statistical abstracts. Its psychological impact might be significant, however, coming as it does at a time of political and economic uncertainty. With Wall Street firms shrinking, how will people respond to the news that Brooklyn is, too?
 ''All everybody else can talk about is how much bigger China and India are getting,'' said Sylvie Smoke, 59, a retiree from the Upper West Side. ''And we are losing it.''
 On the other hand, given the effect of the credit crisis on real estate prices, some property owners might be pleased. If there is less land, maybe it will be worth more.
 ''I guess,'' said Mike Slattery, senior vice president for research of the Real Estate Board of New York, ''it's good news for those who still have it.''
 Planning department officials stress that their new measurement is only an estimate, an approximation subject to the vagaries of time. Over the course of four centuries, they note, the city's land area has actually grown because adjacent waterways were reclaimed for development in Lower Manhattan and in Queens to extend the runways at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports. 
 The new estimate, which will appear in the 2008 Green Book, to be released next month, reduces New York's official size by about 5 percent. 
 But even in its supposedly diminished form, New York still ranks 14th in land area among cities with more than 100,000 people, according to the United States Census Bureau. (Anchorage covers nearly 1,700 square miles; Jacksonville, Fla., 758.) The new calculation also conforms more closely to census estimates. 
 Mr. Miller, 52, the planning department's deputy director of information technology, said the apparent loss in land mass was distributed throughout the city. 
 ''There's no neighborhood that's vanished,'' he said.
 That said, about seven square miles of the difference could be accounted for by better measurements of the islands and peninsulas in Jamaica Bay. And it appears that Brooklyn shrank the most, by about 12 percent, to 72 square miles from 82. 
 ''So Brooklyn is a little more svelte than we knew,'' said Marty Markowitz, the borough president, who is not. 
 The Department of City Planning first calculated the land area of each of the city's 59 community board districts two decades ago to help assess and compare each district's needs and the resources they were receiving. 
 Last year, planning officials realized that they had the capacity to refine the earlier estimates by using aerial photographs and advanced technology, including software that that enabled geographers to compensate for inaccuracies created by the pitch and yaw of camera-equipped planes. When they added up the new figures from all 59 boards, they discovered that the city had shrunk. 
 ''There was no panic,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 But, while the tools become more sophisticated, measuring land area can be subject to many variables. 
 When do you measure, at high tide, when there is likely to be more water? Or at low tide, when you can see more land? (The thousands of aerial photographs were not taken at the very same moment, and the time of high tide varies anyway.)
 Are piers included as land when they extend beyond the bulkhead line? (Yes.)
 How are bodies of water counted? (The new calculation of 304.8 square miles does not include major waterways more than 50 feet wide, like the Bronx River or the Gowanus Canal; it does include smaller bodies of water, including the reservoirs in Central Park and Jerome Park, Prospect Lake in Brooklyn and Meadow and Willow Lakes in Queens, which together cover 347 acres or about half a square mile.)
 Those variables account, in part, for conflicting estimates of New York's land area since the city was consolidated in 1898. At that time, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island joined Manhattan and the Bronx to form Greater New York, and the city ballooned to a trumpeted 360 square miles from 60 or so. 
 Since then, the city has both fattened up and trimmed down. The new estimate reduces New York's official size by about 5 percent. In 1998, it actually lost territory when the United States Supreme Court awarded New Jersey sovereignty over most of Ellis Island's 27.5 acres.
 But over several centuries, Manhattan may have also grown by about 1,600 acres, or two and a half square miles, because of landfill placed first by the Dutch and later by successive government entities and private developers at its southern tip, estimates Eric W. Sanderson, an ecologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society who is studying the island's geography.
 Mr. Markowitz suggested that the new calculations should spur action by Brooklyn, the biggest loser. 
 ''Now is clearly the time to annex Governors Island,'' he said. ''In the meantime, maybe I should get one of these sophisticated measuring devices to use as my scale at home -- I might find out I've lost more weight than I thought.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY GOOGLE EARTH) CHARTS: WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN: The Department of City Planning has discovered that New York's size has been exaggerated by 17 square miles. That may not seem like a lot in the context of a municipality of more than 300 square miles. But here are some estimates of what that amount of land could have provided to a city of outsized demands, if only it had existed. (Sources: Woodlawn Cemetery

 Talks for Abkhazia Tensions
 The long military standoff in Abkhazia has entered a phase of quiet diplomacy intended to ease tensions and push for negotiations, officials on each side of the conflict said. An act of significant violence or other provocation could still lead to war, leaders cautioned, but an American and a Georgian delegation traveled separately to the Abkhaz capital to discuss the possibility of talks.

 PEACE DEAL WITH TALIBAN
 Pakistan signed a peace deal with Taliban militants that calls for the army to withdraw gradually from Swat, a once popular tourist resort area that had become a battleground. It calls for the enforcement of Shariah law but allows for the reopening of schools for girls. The senior minister of the province said that the Taliban in Swat renounced militancy. PAGE A18

 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi outlined forceful measures to solve Italy's problems, including an anticrime package that would make illegal immigration punishable by prison terms. It would also use the military to provide security for new garbage dumps and incinerators to address the longstanding garbage crisis in Naples, which has undermined confidence in government and tarnished Italy's image abroad.

 Poses Conundrum for Bush
 Bipartisan legislation that would significantly expand educational benefits for veterans has created a political conundrum for President Bush. There is concern the bill would speed an exodus from the ranks; so Mr. Bush, who often goes to great lengths to show his support for the troops,with two wars still requiring people to fight them, has threatened to veto it.

 STABILITY PERSONIFIED
 Why has the prospect of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's absence from the Capitol so disturbed people, regardless of party? It could be because of one fundamental truth, Carl Hulse writes: ''Mr. Kennedy, love him or loathe him, personifies stability and continuity. He somehow provides a sense of reassurance that political tumult is transitory while serious achievement is not.'' PAGE A25

 In State-Imposed Spending Rules
 Some of New York City's highest-performing schools could suffer ''painful'' budget cuts as high as 6 percent next year, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said, blaming state rules for spending that he called on Albany to change. But state lawmakers attacked the chancellor's proposal, saying the restrictions were intended to ensure that schools labeled by the state as failing or with high student poverty rates received more state money.

 A WELCOME DECISION ON MONEY
 A federal appeals court's agreement that one-size paper money discriminates against the blind and partially blind was welcomed by those who have been victims of tricks. Harold Wenning, for one, remembers the cheats from his days running a news kiosk in Midtown Manhattan. ''They'll say it's a five and give you a one,'' he said. ''I had a guy say it was a 20 once and he gave me a one. I had a guy buy a roll of quarters from me and he gave me a dollar.'' PAGE B3 
 TENSIONS FLARE IN CROWN HEIGHTS
 The streets of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, resembled an armed camp, because tensions between blacks and Hasidic Jews have flared as they have every so often since 1991, when a 7-year-old black boy was fatally struck by a Hasidic driver. Though violent crime in the 71st precinct is falling this year, bias crimes are up. Tempers are short, people are confused, and there seems to be no consensus on what to do. PAGE B2

 After decades of steady decline, Japan's coal industry is experiencing a Lazarus-like return. While that might be an exaggeration, as no one is expecting self-sufficiency in coal anytime soon, production has been infused with new life. Prices have hit record highs, making the high-cost mines competitive again. Communities like Bibai have started scouting for second mine locations, and have had to turn down large customers after years of struggle. Page C1
 SENATORS CHALLENGE OIL EXECUTIVES
 Oil executives of the five largest companies faced a verbal firing squad on Capitol Hill, as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee vented fury over gasoline prices.

Executives tried to push back, suggesting the fault lay with lack of support for increased domestic concerns, but met hostility on every front. Page C1

He said the questions about the firm's ratings would not permanently damage it. Page C8

 AT HOME WITH THE ELDERLY, 
 But From Disparate Views
 Two new books take readers into the world of retirement homes for the elderly. There the similarities end, Janet Maslin suggests in her review, because the authors appear to have had very different motivations. One ''cared deeply about his mother and wanted to understand the last years of her life,'' she writes. The other ''apparently liked the prospect of shooting geriatric fish in a barrel.'' PAGE E9 
 AN ARTIST LAYS HIMSELF TO REST
 Back in 1972 the artist Brian O'Doherty, in his own personal protest against the killing of 14 unarmed Irish civilians by British soldiers in Northern Ireland, swore to sign all his artworks ''Patrick Ireland'' until ''the British military presence is removed and all citizens granted their civil rights.'' At a ceremony on Tuesday in Dublin, he laid that alias -- not his only one -- to rest. PAGE E1

 ''Johnny Mad Dog,'' a movie about child soldiers in Liberia roaming the wastelands of their country and spreading terror and death, ''left me wrung out -- furious, confused, deep in thought,'' Manohla Dargis writes in her review from Cannes.

But that doesn't mean he doesn't like it. PAGE E3 
 THIS IS NOT SPINAL TAP
 The title, ''Heavy Metal in Baghdad,'' seems to invite interpretation. Tanks? Large statues of a deposed leader? No. It is a documentary about a group of Iraqi school friends weaned on bootleg Metallica and Slayer tapes who formed their own metal band in 2000, when their kind of music was basically forbidden in the country. Much has happened on the homefront since then, and the film follows their efforts to stay together as the city falls apart . PAGE E1

 DEVIL-MAY-CARE NAILS
 There was a time when chipped nail polish signaled an urgent need to get to a manicurist. (At least, for some people.) These days the chipped look might be just fine; might, in fact, be a way to send the signal that you are so together you don't have to be too perfect.

HEADLINE: House Approves a $54 Billion Tax Package

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House passed a $54 billion tax package Wednesday that Democratic backers said would help relieve dependence on imported oil while easing the economic strain on parents, homeowners and businesses. 
 The wide-ranging legislation, which passed 263 to 160, now goes to the Senate and an uncertain future. Most Republicans opposed the bill because it would require some corporations with offshore offices to pay more taxes and does not address shielding taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. The White House, citing those factors, threatened a presidential veto.
 The measure renews dozens of selective tax breaks that have expired or will expire soon and provides new tax relief by expanding for a year the refundable child tax credit available to lower-income families. It also allows, for one year, a new deduction of property taxes for those who do not itemize, worth up to $700 for a couple.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, said that 30 million homeowners would benefit from the property tax credit. She said that the refundable tax credit would help the parents of 13 million children and that renewal of a deduction for tuition and other education costs would benefit 4.5 million families. An additional 11 million would be affected by extending current deductions for state and local sales taxes, she said.
 The measure would provide some $17 billion in tax incentives for renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, carbon capture and sequestration projects, plug-in cars and technology for green buildings. It would also create a new category of tax credit bonds to finance state and local government initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 The main Republican protests were over the $54 billion in so-called offsets, new sources of money to pay for the legislation. One would close a loophole allowing hedge fund managers and others working for offshore corporations to defer tax on their compensation; another would delay the effective date of a tax break for multinational corporations operating overseas.

HEADLINE: At West Bank Conference, Dreams of Investment and Peace Through Economics

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, West Bank 

 BODY:
Hundreds of potential investors and dignitaries from the Middle East and beyond gathered here on Wednesday for the start of a vaunted conference under the slogan, ''Palestine is open for business.'' 
 The Palestine Investment Conference, scheduled to last three days, is perhaps the most upbeat happening in Bethlehem since crowds packed Manger Square to see 2,000 doves of peace released at millennium celebrations at the end of 1999. Months later, the second intifada broke out, sending the Palestinian national enterprise into a tailspin of violence and chaos. 
 Now, with the renewal of Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts at the American-sponsored conference last fall in Annapolis, Md., and the international community trying to bolster the Western-leaning Palestinian leadership that holds sway in the West Bank, the business convention -- a partnership of the Palestinian Authority and private business -- is meant to project a climate of opportunity and change. 
 Yet the gathering had a contrary air about it, as if Alice had stepped through the looking-glass and found herself here. 
 Projects worth a total of $2 billion are to be presented, almost half for housing and other infrastructure projects, most of the rest for ideas in agriculture, finance, tourism and information technology. But even among the organizers, expectations for significant investment appeared low. Hasan Abu Libdeh, the chief executive of the conference, told reporters that the meeting was more for ''networking, and maybe to strike some deals.'' 
 The overall picture was ''contradictory,'' said Mohammad Shtayyeh, president of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, a Palestinian Authority agency. ''Capital is a coward,'' he said. ''It needs encouragement. The environment in Palestine is not very encouraging.'' 
 Indeed, the hundreds of Israeli Army checkpoints and roadblocks that dot the West Bank, and that Israel insists are necessary for its security, choke the local economy. (Gaza, which was taken over by the militant Islamic group Hamas last June, remains under a tight blockade, its own economy crushed.)
 And Palestinian officials have recently offered bleak assessments of the prospects of imminent success for a political solution to bring the Israeli occupation of the West Bank to an end. 
 ''Without a political solution any chance of improvement will evaporate,'' said Mr. Shtayyeh, who was scheduled to speak at the conference on Thursday. ''Nobody will invest.'' 
 Even the venue for the opening of the conference, the Jacir Palace Intercontinental hotel, serves as a cautionary tale.
 Built around a magnificently renovated mansion, it was designed ''for V.I.P.'s coming for conventions and conferences,'' said Kareem Abdul Hadi, manager of the Palestine Tourism Investment Company, a subsidiary of Padico, the Palestinian offshore holding company that invested $50 million in the project.
 But the hotel opened its doors just before the intifada in 2000, turned into a battle zone and closed down for five years. The investors lost $25 million. 
 Today there is a broad interest in improving the West Bank's economy. Israel issued nearly 500 special two-week entry permits and visas for participants from abroad, many of them Palestinian expatriates from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Over 100 businessmen from Gaza were issued travel permits for Bethlehem. 
 Attendance was also arranged for a handful of Israeli industrialists, despite some Palestinian qualms about normalizing relations and an Israeli military order that bars Israeli civilians from entering the Palestinian cities of the West Bank. 
 Official delegations are being headed by, among others, the American deputy Treasury secretary, Robert M. Kimmitt; the British secretary of state for international development, Douglas Alexander; and a member of the ruling family of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed Hamdan bin Zayid al-Nahyan. 
 At a news conference in Ramallah on Tuesday, Mr. Abu Libdeh noted that the ''very special'' arrangements made for the conference were far from the norm and urged Israel to guarantee future access.
 Sam Bahour, an American-born Palestinian who has invested heavily in the local economy, has been campaigning for better access for two years. For the past 14 years, Mr. Bahour, who built Ramallah's Plaza shopping mall, has been living in the city on a tourist visa that has to be renewed every three months. Mr. Bahour, who is married to a Palestinian, applied for permanent residency in 1994. The Israelis, who control the population registry in the Palestinian territory, have not yet responded, he said. 
 He estimates that 50,000 Palestinian expatriates and non-Palestinians from all walks of life have been denied access to the Palestinian territories since early 2006. 
 Still, many, including Mr. Bahour, insist that even under the current circumstances there is money to be made. 
 The Palestinian Securities Exchange, the small 11-year-old, 36-company stock exchange based in Nablus, is having a banner year. It has grown by 35.9 percent since Jan. 1, more than any other exchange in the Arab world.
 Matthew Eyre, who works at Blakeney Management in London, said his investment firm had put money in Padico since the end of 2007 and had seen very strong profits. ''When we started, we weren't making a political call,'' he said. ''We were simply convinced that the valuations here had become absurdly low. If these companies can grow by 30 percent in such difficult times, what sort of growth will we get in normal times?''

HEADLINE: Diplomatic Effort Seeks to Ease Tensions and Lead to Talks in Georgian Enclave

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: SUKHUMI, Georgia 

 BODY:
The long military standoff in Abkhazia, where a separatist dispute has threatened to escalate this year into a renewed war, has entered a phase of quiet diplomacy aimed at easing tensions and urging negotiations, officials on each side of the conflict said.
 No agreement to negotiate has been reached, and the differences between the Abkhaz and Georgian governments remain vast. Each side cautions that an act of significant violence or other provocation could lead to war. 
 But this month, after Russia sent paratroopers and artillery across its borders to reinforce its peacekeeping contingent in the enclave, and as Georgian remotely piloted planes flew reconnaissance missions overhead, an American and a Georgian delegation traveled separately here to the Abkhaz capital to discuss the possibility of talks.
 The dialogue appeared to reduce for the moment the risk of large-scale fighting and to create a chance to discuss confidence-building measures -- even as military incidents continued along the contested zone. 
 On Wednesday, for example, as parliamentary elections were being held in Georgia, a firefight in the village of Kurcha destroyed two buses and wounded at least two civilians, Georgian officials said.
 The diplomatic push seems also to have shifted some attention from tit-for-tat diplomatic and military escalations toward a recognition of the consequences of renewed war in the Caucasus, where two wars between Russian forces and Chechen separatists raged for most of a decade before subsiding in 2005. 
 Russia plans to host the Winter Olympics in 2014 in Sochi, about 15 miles from Abkhazia. A war near the city's limits, which would almost certainly involve Russia, could threaten the Games on political and security grounds. And any sustained war could devastate Georgia, which is recovering from post-Soviet disorder but lacks the resources or military capacity to withstand a determined Russian attack.
 The first delegation to Abkhazia, on May 10, was led by Matthew J. Bryza, an American deputy assistant secretary of state. The second, on May 11, was led by Irakli Alasania, Georgia's representative to the United Nations. 
 Abkhaz officials have said the core of the dispute -- Abkhazia's insistence on independence -- is not negotiable. But they hinted at possible economic cooperation and an agreement on the non-resumption of force. ''The situation has come, I would say, to a red line,'' said Sergei Shamba, Abkhazia's foreign minister. ''But our conversation with the Georgian representative, which I regard as private, reduced tensions.''
 Abkhazia, a ribbon of sub-tropical and alpine territory on the Black Sea that once was a cherished vacation spot for the Soviet elite, lies within Georgia. It achieved de facto independence, and withering economic isolation, in a brief but ferocious war after Georgia's effort to subdue the region by force in 1992.
 The Abkhaz are a tiny ethnic group. They were initially routed by Georgian forces and subjected to what they call war crimes, including mass looting and the destruction of their homes. A special prosecutor's office in Sukhumi says it has evidence of the killings of hundreds of civilians and dozens of rapes. 
 With help from Russia's military and a confederation of fighters from the Caucasus who were sponsored by Russian intelligence agencies, the Abkhaz repelled Georgian troops in 1993. 
 Georgia contends that a retaliatory pogrom followed its army's defeat, with hundreds of thousands of Georgians being chased from their homes in Abkhazia. Last week, the United Nations labeled the Abkhaz actions against Georgians a campaign of ethnic cleansing. 
 Since 1993, the conflict has devolved into a stalemate punctuated by occasional violence. 
 The tensions increased sharply in 2004, when President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia came to power. Mr. Saakashvili made national unification a centerpiece of his agenda, a position Abkhazia considers a prelude to war.
 Tensions escalated further this year after Kosovo declared independence in February and was recognized by several Western nations. The Kremlin, which opposed an independent Kosovo, reacted by saying it would increase cooperation with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another breakaway enclave in Georgia.
 A season of brinkmanship has ensued, with each side accusing the other of massing forces, and Georgian drones on reconnaissance drawing fire from both the ground and from what Georgia said was a Russian fighter jet. 
 Russia has reinforced its peacekeepers, although their number and role remain in dispute. Russia and Abkhazia say that 2,500 Russian soldiers are in Abkhazia -- well within the Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeeping mandate of up to 3,000 troops.
 Georgian officials say that at least 3,500 Russians are in the conflict zone, as well as advisers who are surreptitiously training and leading Abkhaz units. Independent verification of these claims is not readily possible.
 Each side insists that its troop movements have assured peace, and that the other's have increased the risk of war. ''We often hear that Russia's actions destabilize the situation,'' Mr. Shamba said. ''This is not an objective assessment. We can say clearly that Russia's tough actions stopped Georgia's aggression.''
 Abkhazia has also offered to allow Russia to station permanent forces at an Abkhaz air base in exchange for guarantees of protection. ''Of course we dream of being a neutral state,'' Mr. Shamba said. ''Unfortunately we live in such a region where that is impossible.''
 Georgia has been unwavering in its position that Abkhazia will be returned to Georgian control. 
 During Mr. Saakashvili's presidency, Georgia has upgraded military equipment and intensified military training. It says it has 28,000 regular troops, including units that were trained by American marines and that have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also has private Israeli advisers. 
 Moreover, Mr. Saakashvili, who needs little urging to speak in populist tones, is ringed by young advisers, many of whom have taken a hard line. Although they say they do not want to resume fighting, they invariably add that Abkhazia must reintegrate with Georgia, or fighting might be inevitable.
 At the center of the talks this month was a list of proposals by Mr. Saakashvili that would grant broad autonomy to Abkhazia in exchange for recognizing Georgian rule. These included constitutional changes and security guarantees that Georgia says would protect Abkhaz power, interests, language and culture.
 Among them would be the creation of a Georgian vice presidency to be granted to an Abkhaz official, power-sharing arrangements to award Abkhazia control of some Georgian ministries and the merger of the Abkhaz and Georgian police and customs services. Abkhazia previously rejected the proposal. But Mr. Alasania said he focused on smaller steps that require no ideological concessions. 
 Daniel Fried, the United States assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said in a telephone interview that after Mr. Alasania's visit there appeared to be a chance to move beyond ''the frankly moribund diplomatic process that we had been in for some time.''

HEADLINE: Senators Sharply Question Oil Officials

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee vented their fury over high gasoline prices at executives of the nation's five largest oil companies on Wednesday, grilling the oilmen over their multimillion-dollar pay packages and warning them that Congress was intent on taking action that could include a new tax on so-called windfall profits. 
 Such showdowns between lawmakers and oil titans have become a familiar routine on Capitol Hill. But with gas prices nearing $4 a gallon, and lawmakers headed home for a weeklong Memorial Day recess where they expect to get an earful from angry constituents, there is added urgency for Congress to appear active. 
 But while momentum is building for several measures, including a bill that would allow the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to be sued in American courts under antitrust laws, there is little sign that any of the proposals would do much, if anything, to lower prices quickly. 
 And the oil executives warned that government intervention might only make things worse. Instead, they called on Congress to allow more drilling and exploration for domestic oil, both in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and offshore in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
 The increasing urgency to seem aggressive about gasoline prices was apparent on Tuesday when the House voted by an overwhelming 324 to 84 to approve the bill, commonly referred to as Nopec, which classifies OPEC as a monopoly in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 
 Senate Democrats have included that measure as part of a package of legislation intended to address the high price of gasoline, along with the tax on windfall profits and a measure to tamp down speculation in the oil futures market that many lawmakers think is contributing to the run-up in prices. 
 On Monday, President Bush signed a bill temporarily suspending the purchase of crude oil for the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. Bush had initially opposed such action but relented after the House and Senate approved the bill by wide margins. 
 Oil prices, meanwhile, climbed to yet another record high on Wednesday, settling at $133.17 a barrel. 
 At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Democratic senators struggled to have the executives explain how oil prices had risen so high. The senators expressed doubt that basic laws of supply and demand were at work and suggested instead a more sinister combination of monopolistic behavior by oil-producing countries, speculation in the futures markets and sheer corporate greed. 
 Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a strong supporter of Senator Barack Obama's presidential bid, made a particularly pointed attack, in which he seemed to warn the oil executives that they would soon no longer have such a good friend in the White House. 
 He also suggested that Mr. Bush should be doing more to press the oil companies to help lower prices at the pump, while acknowledging that it would be difficult to pass a windfall profits tax while Mr. Bush was still in office.
 ''It strikes me that this is the right situation for a president to step in, for a president of the United States to step in,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''I think the president should be calling you all before his little meeting place, the White House, and talking about what you are doing to the American economy.'' 
 Mr. Durbin added: ''Does it trouble any of you when you see what you are doing to us, the profits that you are taking, the costs that you are imposing on working families, small businesses, truckers, farmers?'' 
 The executives pushed back, suggesting that Democrats in Congress were at fault for not allowing more drilling and exploration for domestic oil and insisting that global economic conditions outside their control were mostly responsible for the high prices. 
 ''As repetitive and uninteresting as it may sound, the fundamental laws of supply and demand are at work,'' said John Hofmeister, the president of Shell Oil Company. ''Oil exporting nations, as has been said, are managing their natural resource development and production to supply their local and global markets in their own self-interest.'' 
 At every turn, though, they encountered hostile Democratic interrogators. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, demanded that the executives tell him the amount of their pay packages and then ridiculed those who said they did not know exactly how much they earned. 
 ''I wish I made enough money that I didn't even have to know how much I make,'' Mr. Leahy told John E. Lowe, the executive vice president of ConocoPhillips. 
 Two of the five executives -- Mr. Hofmeister of Shell and Robert A. Malone, the chairman and president of BP America -- noted that their pay was not a matter of public record because they were not among the five highest-paid employees at their companies. Still, they volunteered that they had earned in excess of $2 million last year. 
 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, derisively accused the executives of trying to portray themselves and their companies as victims.
 ''To me it was just a litany of complaints that you are all just hapless victims of a system, you blame one thing or another, which most people would say is just simply the cost of doing business,'' Ms. Feinstein said. ''Yet you rack up record profits, record profits, quarter after quarter after quarter, and apparently have no ethical compass about the price of gasoline.''
 Peter J. Robertson, the vice chairman of Chevron, replied: ''I don't feel like a victim at all.''
 ''I feel very proud of the fact that we are investing all of our earnings,'' he said. ''We invest in future supplies for the world, so I am very proud of that.'' 
 In the House, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, released a scathing report on Wednesday about how oil companies had used record profits in recent years to increase executive pay and buy back their own shares.

HEADLINE: France Says Weak Dollar May Fuel Protections

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD and STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
France's finance minister on Wednesday urged central bankers to reduce the ''misalignment'' in the world's major currencies, warning that a low American dollar was feeding an increasing trend toward protectionism in the United States and elsewhere. 
 The minister, Christine Lagarde, said the dollar's decline was a central cause for the rising cost of oil, which is priced in American dollars. On Wednesday, the price of a barrel of crude oil settled at another record, $133.17. 
 Anxiety about high energy costs, unbalanced currencies and slowing growth causes politicians to re-examine their domestic economies, Ms. Lagarde said. ''Protectionism is trendy at the moment,'' she said in an interview. ''We need to turn that risk of extreme protectionism into something positive, and I think regulators, governments and international organizations have a responsibility to offer an alternative path that includes more regulation and policy coordination.'' 
 Ms. Lagarde's comments echoed remarks last week by Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, who urged America's presidential candidates to stay committed to free trade. Both contenders for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, have vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Ms. Lagarde said the euro's surge against the dollar and the Chinese yuan was ''not helpful -- it's a major misalignment.''
 ''A rebalancing of currencies would be good for all economies,'' she added. 
 That view is increasingly shared by countries in the Group of 7, she said. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the United States Treasury secretary, ''is sincere when he says he wants a strong dollar'' and has been taking actions quietly in the mortgage markets to reduce the impact of the subprime crisis, she said. 
 France has lobbied for lower interest rates among countries using the euro and has suggested that the European Central Bank broaden its mandate to include bolstering economic growth, beyond its goal of controlling inflation. While Ms. Lagarde said that the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was right to be concerned about inflation, she said he was ''overly focused'' on it. 
 The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has not yet discussed his specific objectives when France assumes the presidency of the European Union on July 1. Ms. Lagarde declined to give details about her aims. But she said she hoped to forge a consensus on a stricter rule book in the banking and insurance sector, including ''coordinated supervision'' across the 27-member bloc. 
 Like Mr. Sarkozy and the French prime minister, Francois Fillon, Ms. Lagarde said the government would ''stay the course'' on its policy of change despite a series of strikes organized by the unions.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico's Moment in the Sun

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANEWAY. 
Michael Janeway, a former editor of The Boston Globe and a professor of journalism and arts at Columbia, is writing a history of the United States and Puerto Rico in the 20th century.

 BODY:
PUERTO RICO, an afterthought trophy for the United States 110 years ago at the end of the Spanish-American War and an island in limbo since, has become an improbable player in the contest between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Its primary on June 1 could bolster Mrs. Clinton's claim to a majority of the popular vote -- the combined tally for all the Democratic primaries and caucuses held across the country over the past six months. 
 Puerto Rico's formal role in the process is indeed weighty. Its 63 voting delegates -- 55 elected ones and eight superdelegates -- at the Democratic National Convention in Denver this summer will outnumber delegations from more than half the states (including Kentucky and Oregon) and the District of Columbia. Yet Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the Electoral College, nor will its 2.5 million registered voters cast ballots for president in November. 
 How in the world did this happen? From the beginning, the question of Puerto Rico has perplexed the United States. The island was essential to the defense of the Panama Canal, so we did not make it independent, in contrast to two other Spanish possessions we gained in the war, Cuba (which become independent in 1902) and the Philippines (1946). And we judged it foreign in language and culture -- and worse, overpopulated -- so New Mexico-style Americanization leading to statehood was out of the question. 
 Similarly, Puerto Ricans have never resolved their relationship with the United States. For almost 50 years after the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rican sentiment was divided between dreams of statehood and of independence. This ambivalence deterred the island from ever petitioning Congress for one or the other. And until mid-century, sporadic outbursts of violent nationalism haunted the scene. 
 Partly to put such extremism out of business, Congress in 1948 allowed Puerto Rico to elect its own governor and then in 1950 gave it an intricately designed, semi-autonomous ''commonwealth'' status short of statehood. Two years later, the island adopted its own Constitution, and Congress quickly ratified it. 
 Puerto Ricans elect their own Legislature, along with the governor. They enjoy entitlements like Social Security, but they do not pay federal income taxes. They retain their own cultural identity (Spanish is the prevailing tongue) but live under the umbrella of the American trade system and the American military. They have been citizens since 1917, but they have no vote in Congress or for the presidency.
 The man who brought forth this unique arrangement, which has come to seem permanent, was Luis Munoz Marin, who dominated Puerto Rico's politics beginning in 1940. In 1948 he became the island's first elected governor. He won three more terms and could easily have been ''president for life.'' A stretch of 116th Street in Manhattan's Spanish Harlem is named Luis Munoz Marin Boulevard in his honor.
 Munoz was an eloquent advocate of independence until, faced with daunting statistics at the end of World War II, he concluded that Puerto Rico's impoverished economy could not support nationhood. So he began packaging his third-way brainchild. 
 When pitching commonwealth on the mainland, Munoz -- an artist of words and imagery who also enjoyed a drink or two -- would observe that Puerto Rico is the olive in the American martini. The phrase went down well in Washington, but Munoz used different language at home. Neither Congress nor the American courts have ever embraced Munoz's Spanish-language phrase for ''commonwealth,'' universally recognized in Puerto Rico: ''estado libre asociado,'' or free associated state. Those three words suggested an autonomy (or even statehood or independence) beyond what came to pass. But Munoz was too popular on the island for that to cause him trouble.
 Still, Munoz always intended to bring ''enhanced autonomy'' in trade, self-governance, taxation and entitlements to Puerto Rico. But Fidel Castro's seizure of power in Cuba in 1959 moved Washington's attention away from the commonwealth. 
 Munoz left office in 1965. His dreams faded. The economy he jump-started went flat. Today, the government accounts for 30 percent of Puerto Rico's work force (compared with 16 percent on the mainland).
 Then in 1974, the Democratic National Committee and some shrewd local political strategists came up with an idea for how to play to lingering discontent over the island's status: Why not make nice with Puerto Rico (and, as important, with the Puerto Rican vote in American cities) by awarding it the number of delegates to the Democratic presidential nominating convention that its population would yield as a state? But not until this year has a presidential race been close enough, long enough, to yield Puerto Rico a role in the endgame. 
 On the island, politics is focused on the longstanding deadlock between the two dominant parties, whose identities -- one is for statehood and one is for enhanced autonomy -- today bear no relation to those of the Republicans and Democrats in the 50 states. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are, gingerly, bidding for support from both of them. 
 But the mainland population of Puerto Ricans (like the island's, almost four million) is watching, too. That fully enfranchised constituency is up for grabs in November. Republicans have fished in these waters, too. 
 Presidential candidates usually offer Puerto Ricans hazy promises that are sure to be unfulfilled. First on the list: We'll do whatever you want about the island's status if you deliver us an overwhelming majority for one or another option. That's not going to happen.
 Since 1967, public support on the island has seesawed inconclusively between statehood and enhanced autonomy -- a better version of the deal they already have. Munoz's commonwealth helped eclipse independence; that course enjoys only limited support today. An overwhelming majority of Puerto Ricans wants, one way or another, to be American.
 The next president could just appoint another commission, more high-level and forceful than past ones, to reopen the dormant question of Puerto Rico's status. But there is an additional option. 
 Fidel Castro is gone from office, Hugo Chavez's influence is growing, Brazil is becoming an oil power, and the United States has no Latin American policy to speak of. John F. Kennedy wisely turned to Puerto Rican leaders to help him frame a new policy for the region in 1961. Similarly, the next president could ask Puerto Rico, with its democratic tradition and its past success with economic development, to help us plan for the post-Castro Caribbean.
 The United States is overdue in re-engaging with this special place, which landed in our lap as a stepchild of imperialism in 1898, and which we have never seen clearly.

HEADLINE: U.N. Leader Aims to Get More Aid In Myanmar

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, flew on Thursday to Myanmar, where he hoped to pry open the door to more international aid at what he called a ''critical moment'' in the country's slow recovery from the cyclone that left at least 100,000 people dead or missing.
 ''Aid in Myanmar should not be politicized,'' said Mr. Ban, as he stopped in Bangkok on Wednesday. ''Our focus now is on saving lives.'' 
 But the opening offered by Myanmar appeared to be a narrow one. Some analysts said the ruling generals were conceding only enough to defuse international pressure in the wake of the May 3 cyclone.
 Suspicious of foreigners bearing relief supplies, the government has so far barred any major flow of aid from the United Nations and Western donors.
 On Wednesday it said it would not allow delivery of aid from United States Navy vessels waiting offshore.
 Mr. Ban is scheduled to meet the leader of the military junta, Senior Gen. Than Shwe. General Shwe had previously not responded to Mr. Ban's messages or taken his telephone calls.
 Mr. Ban was also scheduled to attend a meeting on Sunday of international donors in Yangon, where he hoped to help coordinate aid, along with Myanmar's neighbors in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
 Myanmar agreed this week to let Asean to coordinate a relief program and send in medical workers.
 That opening falls far short of the huge relief operation that the United Nations says is needed to help an estimated 2.5 million victims who face shortages of food and water and a growing threat of disease.
 The official government newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, said Wednesday that the country would not accept relief supplies carried by the American vessels that are waiting, along with French and British vessels, outside its territorial waters.
 ''The strings attached to the relief supplies carried by warships and military helicopters are not acceptable to the Myanmarese people,'' it said. ''We can manage by ourselves. Myanmar has many good neighborly countries.''
 The United States has insisted that it has no ulterior motive in offering disaster relief and has promised to withdraw its helicopters and personnel after deliveries have been made.
 ''They are really fearful that the United States is involved in regime change as it has said from 1990 on,'' David Steinberg, an expert on Myanmar at George Washington University in Washington, said of the junta. ''As a member of Asean, they feel they can control the situation.''
 He said the motives and methods of the junta have not changed over the years. When it is under pressure, the junta offers promises and calibrated concessions, but holds its ground.
 ''The overwhelming motive is to keep power,'' Mr. Steinberg said, ''and in order to do that you take off bits and pieces of pressure as you see the need. But you don't help people if you are going to jeopardize your superior role.''
 A Burmese exile magazine, The Irrawaddy, which is based in Thailand, took the analysis a step further on Tuesday, saying: ''The Burmese junta is still in the driver's seat. Asean, the U.N. and the rest of the world are -- again -- being manipulated by the oppressive generals.''
 In Washington, the United States ambassador to Asean, Scot Marciel, said at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday that ''the door must be opened far wider and rapidly to prevent a second catastrophe'' of further death.
 Myanmar has set the death toll in Cyclone Nargis at about 78,000, with nearly 56,000 missing, but the United Nations and relief donors believe that at least 100,000 have died. 
 ''Without an adequate and independent assessment of the situation and current needs, as well as a commitment by the regime to provide the necessary access, a pledging conference is unlikely to produce the results we seek,'' Mr. Marciel said.
 Speaking in New York before his departure, Mr. Ban said that he hoped to set up a ''logistics hub'' in Myanmar or nearby, and that the United Nations and Asean could join in coordinating relief efforts.
 He said the government had given permission for nine helicopters from the World Food Program to ferry aid to survivors, a significant softening of its blanket rejection of United Nations aid workers.
 ''Further similar moves will follow -- including expediting the visas of relief workers seeking to enter the country,'' Mr. Ban said. ''I am confident that emergency relief efforts can be scaled up quickly.''
 He said a major increase in aid was urgent. ''This is a critical moment for Myanmar,'' he said. ''We have a functioning relief program in place, but so far we have been able to reach only about 25 percent of Myanmar's people in need.''
 In its commentary rejecting American aid, The New Light of Myanmar vented its concerns about foreign donors, saying they were a greater threat than the cyclone.
 ''Our country is going through a variety of stormlike plots and intrigues that are much severer than Nargis, and they are endless,'' it said.
 ''They are none other than envy storms, criticism storms and rumor storms created by certain Western countries and national traitors at home and abroad who are showing negative attitudes toward our nation and our people.''

HEADLINE: Florida Pension Fund Is Suing A.I.G.

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
In another blow to the embattled American International Group, a Florida pension fund accused the insurance giant and a number of its top executives on Wednesday of understating the company's exposure to the subprime mortgage crisis in order to inflate its stock price artificially. 
 The Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund leveled the charge in a lawsuit filed in federal district court in Lower Manhattan, the first class action suit against A.I.G. since the company disclosed a staggering first-quarter loss of $7.8 billion. 
 That loss, caused by complex financial instruments known as credit default swaps, shocked many investors because A.I.G. had assured them that any losses on such credit insurance would be limited, the suit said. 
 ''These folks that have manipulated the market by making false statements have caused severe economic loss to the underlying trust fund which thousands of our members rely on,'' said John Keane, executive director of the Jacksonville fund. 
 The case comes at a challenging moment for A.I.G. and its chief executive, Martin J. Sullivan. The company has lost about half its value in the stock market in the last year, and its credibility with many investors has disintegrated after a string of unpleasant and surprising corporate announcements. 
 Mr. Sullivan took the helm in 2005 after Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s founder and combative chief executive, was forced out amid allegations of accounting improprieties. 
 Under Mr. Sullivan, the once-proud A.I.G. has been beset by slower growth, and its critics have said he is not the right leader. His supporters say he inherited many of the company's problems.
 A spokesman for A.I.G. said the company does not comment on litigation. 
 The lawsuit centers on comments made to investors by several A.I.G. senior executives, who assured the investors that the company would weather the subprime crisis better than many of its peers because of its conservative and sophisticated risk management. Last Nov. 8, for example, Mr. Sullivan said on a conference call that ''A.I.G. does not expect to pay any losses on this carefully structured and well-managed portfolio,'' referring to the credit default swap portfolio, according to the lawsuit. 
 But investors received a shock in February, when A.I.G. disclosed that PricewaterhouseCoopers had discovered problems in the company's financial reporting and oversight, requiring A.I.G. to revalue its credit swaps portfolio. As a result, A.I.G.'s losses on the instruments skyrocketed to more than $11 billion, and the company later declared a $7.8 billion first-quarter loss. A.I.G. was subsequently forced to raise $20 billion in new debt and equity -- after telling investors it would have to raise only $12.5 billion. 
 ''Senior management deprived A.I.G. investors of fundamental information demonstrating that, contrary to A.I.G.'s repeated statements that the company was well-positioned to weather the subprime storm, it was really a ticking time bomb waiting to explode because of billions of dollars in subprime-related losses,'' said Gerald H. Silk, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger and Grossman, the law firm that filed the suit for the pension fund. 
 The suit cites a number of instances in which company officials assigned little or no risk to A.I.G.'s credit default swap portfolio. In an August 2007 conference call, for example, Joseph Cassano, the former head of A.I.G.'s derivatives unit, said it was difficult ''to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing $1 in any of those transactions.'' 
 Mr. Cassano declined to comment Wednesday. 
 Last December, the suit says, Mr. Sullivan said the likelihood that the swaps portfolio would sustain actual losses was ''close to zero.'' 
 The suit charges that A.I.G.'s management knew about the problems with the swaps but hid them from investors. The company's stock, which hit a high of $72.65 last June, fell to $36.75 after the first-quarter results.
 The performance drew heavy criticism, including from Mr. Greenberg, now 83. Mr. Greenberg, who was forced out of the company in 2005 amid allegations that he had played a pivotal role in improperly inflating A.I.G.'s reserves through a sham reinsurance transaction with General Re, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote a letter on May 11 saying, ''Several top shareholders of A.I.G. have called me expressing deep concern about the persistent and seemingly endless destruction of value at A.I.G.'' He said the company was in ''crisis.'' 
 Mr. Greenberg is not an uninterested party; he controls more than 10 percent of A.I.G.'s stock through various entities set up decades ago. In early May, the Starr Foundation, where he is chairman, sued A.I.G. over the credit default swap portfolio, adding to the laundry list of suits and countersuits between Mr. Greenberg and the company he built.
 Mr. Greenberg is not out of the legal woods himself. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued him a Wells notice last week, which means the agency's staff might seek approval from the commissioners for an enforcement action. The Wells notice allows Mr. Greenberg to argue why such action should not be taken. 
 According to Mr. Greenberg's lawyer, Robert Morvillo, the Wells notice is one step in a long process. ''The issues have been narrowed down to a small number of issues,'' Mr. Morvillo said in a statement. ''We remain confident of our position on the merits, and we believe that none of the remaining issues are material to A.I.G.'s financial statements. When the commission has had the opportunity to consider all the facts, we believe that they will agree.'' 
 In 2006, A.I.G. agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle allegations of improper accounting. 
 This year, a Hartford jury convicted four executives from General Re and one from A.I.G. of fraudulent transactions that allowed A.I.G. to improperly inflate its reserves, a crucial measure of the health of an insurance company, in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Greenberg was not a defendant in that case.

HEADLINE: Bush to Let Americans Send Cellphones to Cuban Relatives to Force Leader's Hand

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush announced Wednesday that Americans would soon be allowed to send cellphones to relatives in Cuba, a policy shift he said was intended to force the country's new leader, Raul Castro, to make good on promised reforms by giving his people the freedom to communicate.
 ''If the Cuban regime is serious about improving life for the Cuban people, it will take steps necessary to make these changes meaningful,'' Mr. Bush said during a White House ceremony attended by dozens of Cuban-Americans, including the families of imprisoned dissidents. ''If the Cuban people can be trusted with mobile phones they should be trusted to speak freely in public.'' 
 The White House said the announcement did not represent a softening of the American embargo on trade with Cuba, enacted in the 1960s in an attempt to force a change of government by choking the Cuban economy. 
 Mr. Bush will propose a regulation under existing policy, which permits Americans to send gift parcels to relatives in Cuba, said Dan Fisk, the senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the White House National Security Council.
 Since succeeding his ailing 81-year-old brother, Fidel, in February, Mr. Castro, 76, has made a series of changes, opening access to cellphones, computers and DVD players. But the price of such luxuries is prohibitive for most Cubans and, so far, Mr. Bush said, the changes have been ''nothing more than a cruel joke perpetuated on a long-suffering people.'' 
 Whether the Cuban government will allow phones sent from the United States to be distributed and used is unclear. At least one Cuban-American, Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida, had doubts. ''I don't think so,'' Mr. Martinez said after the White House ceremony. ''I don't think they're sincere; I hope they prove me wrong.''
 Mr. Martinez described Mr. Bush's initiative as ''incremental,'' though he added that if it worked, it could signal a tipping point toward greater freedom. ''This is what Cuba is waiting for,'' the senator said, ''that moment, that spark, that one thing that creates a moment of change.''
 Under Mr. Bush's initiative, Mr. Fisk said, Americans will be allowed to buy cellphones in the United States, activate them here and pay bills for their relatives. Mr. Bush also used his speech on Wednesday to reiterate an offer to allow nongovernmental organizations to send computers to Cuba, if the Castro government allows Internet access. 
 ''The regime has done a very good job of isolating Cubans and Cuban civil society on the island,'' Mr. Fisk said, ''If you give them more means of communication, we think that is something that helps them and empowers them.''
 Mr. Bush announced the policy change a day after Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, used an address in Miami to attack the leading Democratic presidential contender, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, over Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. Mr. McCain argued that Mr. Obama was too willing to talk to America's enemies.
 But the White House, fresh from a similar clash with Mr. Obama after a speech Mr. Bush gave to the Israeli Parliament last week, said Wednesday's address was not political, and indeed the president steered clear of the question of whether or how to engage with Cuba.
 ''This is not about the campaign,'' Mr. Fisk said. ''This is about this period in Cuban history.''

HEADLINE: New Florida Law Allows Low-Cost Health Policies

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
With considerable fanfare, Gov. Charlie Crist traveled the length of his state on Wednesday to sign a bill aimed at providing low-cost health coverage to the uninsured by allowing the sale of stripped-down insurance policies.
 There is disagreement about whether the new law will make much of a dent in Florida's growing rate of uninsured residents, which at 21 percent is the fourth highest in the country. 
 But the best part, as Mr. Crist, a Republican, explained at news conferences in Miami, Tampa and Tallahassee, is that the law ''doesn't cost taxpayers a dime.'' 
 That is a common thread in state capitals this spring, as governors and lawmakers struggle to respond to broad anxiety about health care within the limitations of deeply strained budgets. The bold ideas of recent years have been swept away by a worrisome economy, leaving incrementalism and caution in their stead. 
 In some statehouses, the focus is shifting from covering the uninsured to lowering the cost of health care. 
 It seems like far more than 16 months ago that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, another Republican, captivated the health policy world by proposing a $14 billion plan for universal coverage there. The plan, which resembled the Massachusetts universal plan enacted in 2006, died in the Legislature in January, largely because of fiscal concerns. Mr. Schwarzenegger is now proposing heavy cuts in health spending to close a $17 billion budget gap.
 In Minnesota this month, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, also a Republican, vetoed a bill that would have given the working poor far more access to public insurance. Mr. Pawlenty said in his veto message that the subsidy level in the bill was ''excessive and irresponsible.''
 He plans to sign a less ambitious bill that the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed on Saturday.
 ''The system is busted, and you can't take a system that is growing at several times the rate of inflation and subsidize your way to a solution,'' Mr. Pawlenty said in an interview. 
 Some states have moved to make more people with low and middle incomes eligible for public insurance programs, like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Others have chosen to cut such subsidies to balance budgets, and most new initiatives have been notable for small investments of public dollars.
 Michigan is considering shortening the waiting period that insurers can impose on patients with pre-existing medical conditions. In Virginia, a foundation was left to go it alone after the General Assembly opted not to match its $1 million contribution to reducing insurance costs for workers in small businesses. 
 ''To create successful coverage strategies, historically states have had to ante up,'' said Laura Tobler, a health policy analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''But more than half of states are reporting shortfalls. So there hasn't been as much activity this year as the last two, and the activity we have seen has been of the regulatory nature, which costs less money.''
 That is a point that Mr. Crist made repeatedly on Wednesday, noting that the Florida budget dropped, to $66 billion this year from $72 billion last year.
 ''The economy is in a different place right now,'' the governor, the son of a physician, said while traveling between events. ''Our obligation is to find a way without tax dollars to still provide better health care for our people.''
 His initiative, which both houses of the Republican-controlled Legislature approved unanimously, enables insurers to create bare-bones policies that the governor hopes will sell for no more than $150 a month. That is about 60 percent less than the average cost of a policy for a single person in Florida, according to state insurance regulators.
 The policies would be available to any Floridian 19 to 64 who has been uninsured for at least six months and who is not eligible for public insurance. In a critical provision, insurers would be prohibited from rejecting applicants based on age or health status.
 To make the policies affordable, Florida will allow insurers to offer policies that do not include many of the 52 services that standard policies must currently cover, like acupuncture and podiatry. The state added a mandate on Tuesday, when Mr. Crist signed a bill requiring coverage for treating autism. 
 The low-cost plans have to include preventive services, office visits, screenings, surgery, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment and diabetes supplies. 
 Some options offered by insurers have to include catastrophic and hospital coverage. But an insurance company could, for instance, choose to limit the number of days of hospitalization it will cover or place a dollar cap on reimbursing certain services.
 The new law also enables parents to cover children up to age 30 on their policies, raising the age from 25.
 Thirteen states have statutes allowing bare-bones policies -- and Florida has tried them on a pilot basis -- on the theory that some health coverage is better than none. The plans have not proven tremendously popular, according to health policy researchers.
 They appeal primarily to people who have to buy insurance on the individual or small-group market, and studies have found that low cost is not always sufficient to persuade consumers to buy policies that may still leave them with high out-of-pocket costs.
 ''We know people are only somewhat responsive to the price of health insurance,'' said Sherry Glied, a professor of health policy at Columbia University. ''The question is whether people will perceive these plans to be worth it to them. People that want health insurance tend to want real health insurance.''
 Mr. Crist acknowledged that the low-cost plans would not provide ''Cadillac coverage.'' But he said he was optimistic that uninsured Floridians would buy the plans after they are able to analyze their costs and benefits, starting early next year.
 ''Even if it's one person,'' Mr. Crist said, ''it would be a success. But I'm sure there will be many more than that.''

HEADLINE: McCain Looks To Fill Ticket, And 3 Step Up

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Julie Bosman, Larry Rohter and Kevin Sack contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator John McCain of Arizona is set to meet with at least three potential running mates at a gathering at his ranch this weekend in Arizona, suggesting that he is stepping up his search for a vice-presidential candidate as the Democratic contest heads toward a conclusion, according to Republicans familiar with Mr. McCain's plans.
 Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a onetime rival for the Republican nomination, have all accepted invitations to visit Mr. McCain at his ranch in Sedona, Republicans said. 
 After a week of campaigning, Mr. McCain is heading home on Friday for three days without a public schedule. His campaign described this as a social weekend that would include 10 couples, and -- as has been its policy -- declined to discuss any aspect of the vice-presidential search.
 ''We don't talk about the V.P. selection process,'' said Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser.
 Some of Mr. McCain's associates said on Wednesday that while these would not be formal interviews, the weekend would provide Mr. McCain a chance to know some of his potential running mates in a social context. He is known as a social and gregarious candidate and senator, and his associates said personal chemistry would be a crucial consideration in his choice.
 The identities of the potential running mates who have been summoned to Sedona are not a surprise. And even encouraging the perception that they are under consideration might be more a matter of appearance than political reality: the mere impression that Mr. McCain is considering a running mate from Florida, for example, could help him in a critical state where he campaigned on Wednesday.
 Still, the timing -- coming as Senator Barack Obama of Illinois appears to have all but nailed down the Democratic nomination -- suggested a new focus on a selection process that several Republicans said could prove critical to Mr. McCain's success in this tough environment. Mr. McCain, arguably more than most presidential candidates in recent elections, has a lot riding on making a choice for running mate that could provide a boost to his candidacy in a tough atmosphere for Republicans. 
 In addition to Mr. Crist, Mr. Jindal and Mr. Romney, the McCain guest list includes some of his top political counselors, among them Charlie Black, a senior strategist, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, his frequent traveling companion and probably his closest colleague in the Senate. Also on hand will be at least one senior business executive prominent in Mr. McCain's circle, Frederick W. Smith, the chairman of FedEx.
 Mr. McCain himself has said his choice of a running mate would draw particular scrutiny from voters given Mr. McCain's age; he is now 71, or ''as old as dirt,'' as he likes to joke, while quickly adding that he is in good health. More than that, with Mr. Obama's selection as his party's nominee now almost assured, Mr. McCain is contemplating a contest against an energized Democratic electorate after a campaign that has highlighted race and gender issues. 
 The meeting, which was not disclosed publicly, is taking place on a weekend after Mr. McCain releases his health-care records. The release of those records on Friday is itself a high-profile event that could -- by design or not -- draw attention away from the gathering.
 Mr. McCain said this month that he had assembled a list of about 20 potential running mates. He said he had not decided when he would make a decision; his aides made clear that he would keep the process as closely held as possible.
 Among the other potential running mates are Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, and Rob Portman, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget who had been an Ohio congressman.
 Mr. Crist, a fairly popular first-term governor, has been included on various lists of potential running mates for Mr. McCain, whom he endorsed shortly before Florida's January primary, which effectively helped Mr. McCain claim the nomination. Mr. Crist said Wednesday that he and Mr. McCain had not discussed the prospect, not even at a fund-raiser in Miami that the two attended Tuesday night. 
 The McCain campaign, Mr. Crist said, has not solicited the kind of personal information typically requested to vet possible running mates. 
 As governor of Florida, Mr. Crist, 51, would bring obvious assets to the Republican ticket, beginning with his popularity in a state that is almost always an electoral battleground -- and where Mr. Obama appears to be struggling. Mr. Crist's relative youth could also be an asset for Mr. McCain, who has made clear that age will be a consideration in his search for a running mate.
 In Florida, Mr. Crist has long been known for his affability and a campaign skills. Instantly recognizable because of his perpetual tan and striking white hair, Mr. Crist, who was Florida's attorney general before being elected governor in 2006, has also acquired a reputation as something of a hard-liner on law and order issues.
 He supports the death penalty, largely opposes restrictions on the rights of gun owners, early on earned the nickname ''Chain Gang Charlie'' because he favored allowing convicts to be used in road work, and has described himself as a ''pro-life and pro-family'' candidate.
 Mr. Romney, the former chief executive who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 2008 and who was born in Michigan, has made no secret of his desire to join Mr. McCain's presidential ticket. Mr. Romney's M.B.A. skills, and business background -- including running the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games -- could address concerns about Mr. McCain's ability to manage a struggling economy. 
 Mr. Romney has also proven himself as a prolific fund-raiser, though he spent enormous sums of money during his campaign and still could not beat Mr. McCain.
 Mr. Jindal, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., to a family that had just arrived there from the Punjab area of India, took office in January after serving three years in the House of Representatives. In a race with four candidates, Mr. Jindal, who was born a Hindu but converted to Roman Catholicism as a teenager, won 54 percent of the vote after campaigning as a social conservative, opposing human embryonic stem cell research and abortion in any form, and favoring teaching ''intelligent design'' in schools as an alternative to evolution.

HEADLINE: Israel and Syria Announce Talks On Peace Treaty

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Israel and Syria announced on Wednesday that they were engaged in negotiations for a comprehensive peace treaty through Turkish mediators, a sign that Israel is hoping to halt the growing influence of Iran, Syria's most important ally, which sponsors the anti-Israel groups Hezbollah and Hamas.
 Senior Israeli officials from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office and their Syrian counterparts were in Istanbul on Wednesday, where both groups had been staying separately, at undisclosed locations, since Monday. The mediators shuttled between the two. Syria and Israel have not negotiated this seriously in eight years. 
 Syria's motives are clear: it wants to regain the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 war, and to re-establish a relationship with the United States, something it figures it can do through talks with Jerusalem. 
 For Israel -- which has watched the Palestinian group Hamas take over Gaza and gain ground in the West Bank, and the Lebanese group Hezbollah display raw power in Beirut -- an effort to pull Syria away from Iran could produce enormous benefits. An announcement on Wednesday of a peace deal that gives Hezbollah the upper hand in Lebanon's government probably added to Israel's sense of urgency. 
 The American government opposed Israeli-Syrian negotiations because they feared that such a negotiation would reward Syria at a time when the United States is seeking to isolate it for its backing of Hezbollah and its meddling in Lebanon, Bush administration and Israeli officials said. The United States yielded when it became clear that Israel was determined to go ahead, they said. 
 The talks come less than a week after President Bush, speaking to the Israeli Parliament, created a stir by criticizing those who would negotiate with ''terrorists and radicals.'' Mr. Bush's remarks have become an issue in the American presidential campaign because they were widely perceived as a rebuke to Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic front-runner. 
 Turkey, a Muslim country and member of NATO, is a close ally of the United States. It is also Syria's neighbor and has an interest in securing regional peace.
 The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been working on convening negotiations for some time, an official in his office said, including holding phone conversations with leaders on both sides, and assigning a special envoy to handle the diplomatic back-and-forth. The fact that messages were being exchanged has been public for a couple of months, because of official Syrian statements.
 The senior Israeli official said that shortly after Mr. Olmert became prime minister more than a year ago, he went to Turkey and held a long one-on-one meeting with Mr. Erdogan in which it was decided that Turkey would mediate between Israel and Syria.
 Efforts to sign a treaty with Syria have often competed with those to build a comprehensive peace with the Palestinians. On Wednesday, Israeli officials tried to make clear that they were not seeking to upstage an important conference opening in Bethlehem -- an attempt to make stability easier in the West Bank through economic investment -- by saying that both tracks remained vital to them.
 While Wednesday's announcement indicated the first real progress on the Israeli-Syrian front in years, and while both sides have clear goals and motivation for success, there is equally good reason for skepticism about the possibility of success.
 Mr. Olmert is politically weak, with a thin parliamentary majority partly dependent on the right-wing religious Shas party. He faces a criminal investigation that many Israelis believe should lead him to step down or refrain from undertaking negotiations with the country's enemies. Moreover, twice before, under Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak, similar efforts to sign a deal with Syria failed.
 In Israel, two-thirds of the public oppose a return of the Golan Heights to Syria, according to numerous opinion polls, and many strategists and generals have said that giving up the strategic advantage of the Heights in exchange for promises or even written treaties makes no sense.
 ''In a period in which Iran is on the march and extending its influence from Lebanon to Iraq, for Israel to consider giving up the Golan barrier would be a strategic error of the highest order,'' said Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former official and adviser to conservative governments under the Likud Party, which is now the opposition.
 ''You have to make a cold assessment whether Israel could drive a wedge between Syria and Iran,'' Mr. Gold said. ''Unfortunately, in the present period, Iran has Syria within its grip to a far greater extent than it did in the 1990s when previous negotiations with the Syrians were held.''
 On the other hand, many other Israeli officials and analysts see great benefits for Israel. Syria is a prime sponsor of Hezbollah and provides it with rockets and arms, many from Iran. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have headquarters in Damascus, and Israel will seek, in these negotiations, to have them closed. 
 To pull Syria out of the orbit of Iran and return it to the more pro-Western world of Egypt, Jordan and even Saudi Arabia would be a major victory for Israel.
 A real peace treaty with Syria would bring Israel significant advantages in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.
 After the midday announcement here of the existence of the talks, the Israeli airwaves were filled with officials of the right and center expressing skepticism about the outcome and saying that Israel should not leave the Golan Heights. Politicians of the left, though, expressed hope.
 Ran Cohen, a member of Parliament from the dovish Meretz Party, told Israel Radio: ''I think this move is very important, very positive. It's too bad it did not begin a long time ago.''
 Others said they feared that the announcement was an attempt to divert attention from Mr. Olmert's legal troubles.
 ''I very much welcome any process that can advance peace between us and our neighbors, first and foremost with Syria,'' said Eitan Kabel, secretary general of the Labor Party, which is in the government with Mr. Olmert's Kadima Party. ''I very much hope this isn't some sort of spin whose goal is pull a screen over the situation that the prime minister is in.''
 In the past, the sticking point in negotiations has been whether yielding the Golan to the Syrians gave them sovereignty all the way to the waterline of the Sea of Galilee. The Syrians say yes, but the Israelis have said no, fearing the loss of water rights and full access to the lake.

HEADLINE: In Ravaging China, Quake Pushes Tibet to the Sidelines

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
As the Dalai Lama toured European capitals this week, the British prime minister closed the door to 10 Downing Street and agreed to meet him only as part of an ''interfaith dialogue.'' In Germany, most government officials declined to talk with him at all. 
 It was a precipitous comedown from just a few weeks ago, when Tibetans and their supporters unexpectedly upstaged Beijing's elaborate global torch relay and catapulted Tibet's cause to the forefront of the world's human rights agenda. The German and British leaders let it be known then that they would skip the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
 The shift is, partly, tectonic. An earthquake in China's Sichuan Province killed tens of thousands of Chinese, evoking an outpouring of global sympathy for China and turning it overnight from victimizer to victim. 
 Tibetan opponents of Beijing, like advocates of several other leading human rights causes, have been consigned once again to play David to China's Goliath, struggling to compete with its growing diplomatic and economic clout worldwide. 
 But the Tibetan movement has also struggled to stay in the limelight because it remains a fractious and informal hodgepodge of cultural, religious, and political groups. It is united by deep emotional sympathy rather than by organization or cash. Increasingly, there are even differences over how closely to hew to the Dalai Lama's vision of nonviolent diplomacy seeking something short of an independent Tibet. 
 ''The protests this spring put Tibet at the forefront of human rights issue -- they accomplished a lot -- but I think the interest can't go further right now,'' said John Kamm, a leading human rights advocate whose San Francisco-based organization, Dui Hua Foundation, has helped free prominent Chinese political prisoners. 
 ''Now the Chinese people are in a state of mourning,'' he said. ''I'm not suggesting that we stop putting pressure on China, but we should use judgment in where and when to direct the fire.''
 That leaves Tibetan exiles and their Western supporters in a quandary. The Olympic torch, now back on Chinese soil, is scheduled to arrive in Tibet in just three weeks, an act that Tibetan activists once considered a potential rallying point against Chinese rule in what Beijing calls the Tibet Autonomous Region.
 Instead, Tibet groups have been forced to lobby quietly. They are asking board members of the International Olympic Committee as well as of corporate Olympic sponsors like Coca-Cola to consider withdrawing support for the torch relay unless China cancels the Tibet segment, a campaign that shows few signs of success.
 Eager for allies, some Tibetan groups have joined hands with Falun Gong, a Chinese spiritual and exercise movement that Beijing outlawed as a cult. Though Falun Gong does not enjoy the cachet among politicians and celebrities that Tibet does, it has money and a tight, if secret, organization. Tibetan groups have joined in a number of events sponsored by Falun Gong this year as part of its human rights torch relay. 
 At one time, overseas Tibetans were notable for attracting more high-profile supporters, like the actor Richard Gere, as well as for the widespread appeal of Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in the exile, has been an energetic, outgoing public face and spokesman. 
 The outbreak of riots in Tibet in March -- which Tibetans say were spontaneous and Beijing says were carefully orchestrated -- prompted a heavy Chinese crackdown and sparked sympathy demonstrations in London, Paris, and San Francisco. At times, the Tibetans appeared to hijack the Olympics for their own cause. 
 Pro-Tibet groups have become more emboldened, forming new alliances and finding themselves deluged with volunteers and donations. About 200 new chapters of Students for a Free Tibet have been started in the past six months, in places like Estonia, the Czech Republic and the state of Montana.
 Sustaining Momentum
 But sustaining that momentum has been difficult. ''It is a challenge to keep people engaged,'' said Lhadon Tethong, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, which operates on a budget of about $400,000 a year from a ramshackle office above a dry cleaners in New York's Alphabet City. ''There's no substitute for China bringing the Olympic torch into your neighborhood.'' 
 The movement is also grossly overmatched. Even in the midst of the quake tragedy, the Chinese government has ramped up attacks on the Dalai Lama as well as international pro-Tibet groups, charging them with collusion. On Wednesday, Chinese officials warned Germany against ''conniving'' with the Dalai Lama, who they said was promoting anti-China separatists activities on German soil.
 Beijing also took steps to defuse the movement by inviting the Dalai Lama to resume talks. The discussions have continued off and on for years without producing any concrete result. But Beijing's decision to resume them after the Tibetan unrest met the main demand of the White House and European powers, which have since toned down expression of concern about Tibet.
 Beijing has not relaxed its attacks, however. In recent weeks, the Chinese state news media have been featuring stories blaming foreign groups like the International Committee for Tibet and the New York-based Trace Foundation, run by George Soros's daughter, for organizing global protests and fomenting unrest in Tibet.
 Trace, which finances middle-school education and health care projects in Tibet in cooperation with Chinese partners, has protested and says the allegation places its Tibetan staff in danger. 
 Likewise, Chinese embassies have become far more active in mobilizing Chinese studying in Europe and the United States through Chinese students and scholars associations, which exist at almost every Western University and often receive financing from the Chinese government. 
 ''The Tibet affair has revealed that the consulates are more active with these groups that we realized before,'' said an Ivy League administrator, who did not want to be named because of the trouble it could bring. ''It does seem they coordinated some of the actions,'' providing buses and the like. 
 Pursuing Different Goals
 Despite Beijing's allegations that the Dalai Lama and others have colluded against it, the Tibet movement in the West is not nearly so focused, those with long experience in it say. 
 ''There is a level of organization but it's certainly not the type of organization that China portrays it to be,'' said Mary Beth Markey, of the International Campaign for Tibet in Washington, whose primary function is lobbying governments, but does nothing in the way of direct action. 
 In fact, there is even little consensus on long-term goals. The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in Dharmsala, India, says he would settle for increased autonomy for Tibet within China and has steadfastly cautioned against confronting the Chinese in Tibet. 
 While the Dalai Lama is revered, groups like Students for a Free Tibet and Free Tibet Campaign in London now work toward more radical goals, reflecting the coming of age of young Tibetans-in-exile who mix the values of Europe and the United States with those of their ancestral home. 
 ''In '87 a lot of the talent was still in Dharmsala, but by 1999, most of those people had migrated to Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.,'' said Patrick French, a former executive of the London-based Free Tibet Campaign, and author of ''Tibet, Tibet.''
 ''In the West, such people started lobbying and taking action,'' he said. ''They represent an American version of how the Tibet problem should be solved.'' 
 With its guerrilla style ''actions,'' Students for a Free Tibet has little in common with the far more established International Campaign for Tibet, which shares a staid Washington townhouse with the Dalai Lama's representative to the United States. 
 The International Campaign for Tibet accepts the Dalai Lama's limited goal of greater autonomy and religious freedom for the Tibetan people. But the students' group wants more. ''Yes, we want independence for Tibet -- that is what the Tibetan people want,'' said Tenzin Dorjee, vice director of Students for a Free Tibet, who tried to unfurl a banner on the Eiffel Tower during the Paris torch relay and last year achieved that goal at Everest Base Camp. ''We have the utmost love for His Holiness and respect for his leadership, and we know where Tibet would be now without him.
 ''But we are inspired not just by his divinity, but also his humanity. So we can disagree with some of his ideas.''
 Bob Thurman, founder and director of Tibet House, a star-studded New York foundation, which focuses on Tibetan culture and heritage, said that the Dalai Lama's position is far more moderate than activist groups elsewhere. Even so, he is anathema to Beijing.
 ''There is no formal organization,'' Mr. Thurman acknowledged. ''The Dalai Lama is beloved at a grass-roots level worldwide, which is why there's been such activity. So for the Chinese to call him a wolf and a jackal, as they have been doing, is not productive. At this point, what better advocate do they have?'' 
 In reality, even the movement's most activist organizations seem often to have only tenuous control over the attention surrounding Tibet. Along the torch's route in Paris, the vast majority of people who gathered to protest had checked the route on the Internet and come on their own. Organized protests by Tibet groups largely missed the mark, or were lost in the crowd. That included two Tibetan nuns famous for their protests while in prison in China, who the International Campaign for Tibet had brought to both London and Paris for interviews. They ended up standing silently, lost in the boisterous crowd.
 Closing Doors to Discord
 Still, the Chinese are taking no chances, carefully closing all doors to discord.
 The government is refusing applications from climbers for the Chinese approach to Everest. Most projects by nongovernmental organizations are now on hold; international meetings for more than 50 people are banned, even in Beijing. 
 Matt Whitticase, an officer of the London-based Free Tibet Campaign, said there had been a ''pretty systematic effort to undermine our work in recent weeks.'' The group's server has been deluged with ''Trojan'' e-mail messages, which spread a virus that allows outsiders to read their e-mail messages and to send out further messages in its name. 
 John Kamm has been negotiating with the Chinese to offer amnesty to some political prisoners in honor of the Olympics, a project that is now on hold ''during the relief efforts.''
 But he hopes that the earthquake may provide a face-saving exit for China from a torch relay that has often been more embarrassment than celebration. Already, the relay has recently been scaled back in response to the disaster. 
 ''The Dalai Lama said he's praying for the victims,'' said Mr. Kamm, noting that many of the hard-hit areas had large ethnic Tibetan populations. ''Maybe this will give the government the opportunity to cancel the relay in Tibet.''

HEADLINE: The Democrats: Into the Homestretch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama Declares Bid 'Within Reach' After 2 Primaries'' (front page, May 21):
 The battle between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama has left America exhausted. Each new day carries reports of racism, sexism and bitterness, and each primary gives both camps new reasons to stay in the fight. But as John Edwards so eloquently said during his endorsement of Senator Obama, ''Democratic voters have made their choice, and so have I.''
 It seems as if Senator Clinton will continue to make her bogus case that she is more electable, and press the Florida-Michigan issue until the Rules Committee of the Democratic Party meets on May 31, but this race is now over. 
 This campaign has not only given us a terrific candidate in Barack Obama, but it has also sharply pointed out the serious need for reforming our entire election process. 
 Henry A. Lowenstein New York, May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Democratic nominee should be selected by a majority of the delegates of all 50 states, rather than a mere plurality! 
 The Florida and Michigan delegates should be seated at the convention, so that they can be counted and included in the denominator of votes cast, even if not allowed to vote on the first ballot.
 Richard Bashner New York, May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Clinton Still Sees Plenty of Reasons to Press Her Campaign'' (news article, May 21):
 As I watch Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's continuing campaign for her party's nomination, I see a self-focused politician who, despite the reality of the situation, continues to stubbornly pour money that the campaign doesn't have into a battle that it can't win. And over these last several years, I have learned that these are the specific qualities that I do not want in our nation's next president.
 J. Maynard New York, May 21, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Charles M. Blow is right that the Democratic nominee may win this fall without claiming West Virginia's electoral votes (''Skirting Appalachia,'' column, May 17). 
 But he misses the larger issue: voters driven by the same concerns -- the swing electorate that will likely push the winning nominee over the top in key states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Missouri -- are crucial to building an enduring Democratic majority. 
 Democrats are fortunate that neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Rodham Clinton is blind to the importance of winning what some have called ''the vital center.'' 
 Those who believe that Washington is in need of wholesale change should hope that progressives follow their lead, and resist the impulse to retreat inward, ignoring the challenges facing parts of the nation struggling mightily to withstand the Bush economy.
 Al From Washington, May 20, 2008
 The writer is founder and chief executive of the Democratic Leadership Council.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Gender Issue Lives On as Clinton's Hopes Dim,'' (front page, May 19):
 The reason Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters, women or otherwise, are so angry is that it is likely that not only will Hillary Clinton have been regarded as having prevailed in most of the debates, not only will she have won most of the large and swing states, but it is also likely that she will have won more popular votes than either of the other two candidates left in the race for the presidency, and yet it will be she who is asked to bow out. 
 And this will be after having endured the worst press beating I have ever seen heaped on a candidate. The shame of it is that she is the candidate with the most reasoned approach to multiple problems, and many of us will be left with no candidate whom we could wholeheartedly support.
 I would not be at all surprised if she were to be the first independent candidate to have a real shot at the presidency.
 Deborah Moran Houston, May 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I am dismayed and also baffled to see that a group of Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters plan to actively campaign against Barack Obama through a group called Clinton Supporters Count Too. To me, this is a slap in the face to everything Senator Clinton has worked for and believes in. 
 Our country is at a critical juncture. John McCain's policy proposals point clearly down the terrible road we're already on, while those of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama promise a much better future. 
 Why would anyone who deeply believes in Senator Clinton's vision turn around and support Mr. McCain?
 Susanna Sharpe Austin, Tex., May 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Hillary Rodham Clinton won't lose the Democratic nomination because she's a woman; she will lose because she hasn't run the best campaign. 
 If she manages the economy of the United States as she has managed her campaign finances; if she manages her cabinet as she has managed her campaign team, I would be extremely concerned about her ability to handle the top job.
 Harriet Kaufman New York, May 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I note with distress that individuals and commentators are now claiming that Barack Obama, to win the election, must address the sexism in this nation that they feel ''lost'' the nomination for Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 For goodness' sake! First we ask him to solve our racism problem, and now he must solve our sexism problem? Can we ask him, instead, to focus on solving our Iraq problem and our economic problem and our health care problem?

HEADLINE: Google Says It Will Defend Competitive Rationale of a Yahoo Deal

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Miguel Helft contributed reporting.

 BODY:
How can Google, the Internet search and advertising giant, contend that teaming up with Yahoo in search ads would not invite an antitrust challenge?
 Under a proposed partnership, Google would let Yahoo use its more sophisticated ad technology to deliver ads next to some Yahoo search results. By some estimates this could bring Yahoo $1 billion a year in added cash. 
 If they strike a deal, the No. 2 company in search ads would hand over some of its business to the dominant company in that market. When asked about the issues this would raise in a meeting with reporters this month, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, offered only a cryptic reply: ''We would anticipate structuring a deal to address antitrust concerns.'' 
 People involved in shaping Google's approach say the deal under consideration would be a straightforward supplier arrangement, similar to ones in the markets for computer printers, appliances and cellphone service. 
 The printer industry, they say, is a perfect example. Canon supplies printer engines to about 80 percent of the laser printer market, including its rival Hewlett-Packard. They point to many others, including Whirlpool's making appliances for Sears, AT&T's licensing its mobile network to Virgin Atlantic and other small carriers, Toyota's selling hybrid engines to General Motors and Microsoft's tailoring its Office software for Apple computers.
 But some antitrust experts say the planned partnership does raise concerns. Whether this pact is completed or not, they add, it points to the kind of antitrust issues that will increasingly surround Google as a dominant company in the Internet economy, which can quickly magnify the market power of corporate winners.
 ''Up to now, Google has been very careful to avoid predatory behavior,'' said Christine A. Varney, a partner at the law firm Hogan & Hartson and a former member of the Federal Trade Commission. ''But a transaction like this, I think, is fundamentally anticompetitive.''
 Google argues that cooperative arrangements between companies that also compete are increasingly common. There is even a term for them: co-opetition. 
 In its antitrust guidelines for partnerships among competitors, issued in 2000, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission said: ''In order to compete in modern markets, competitors sometimes need to collaborate. ... Such collaborations are not only benign but procompetitive.''
 These collaborative deals tend to be easily approved by American antitrust authorities, and Google presented the Yahoo plan as such a deal in response to initial inquiries by the Justice Department. 
 ''There is nothing in antitrust law that says a company can't use the best technology,'' said one person involved in confidential discussions of the deal. ''It can't be bad for competition to help a company become more efficient.''
 An antitrust review, legal experts say, would weigh the efficiencies the companies gained through the collaboration against the risk of reduced competition as a result. And antitrust officials, they add, would be less interested in how Google might structure such a deal than its likely impact on the marketplace.
 One issue, they say, would be whether a Google partnership would reduce the economic incentives for Yahoo to invest in its own search ad technology, which the company has spent millions in trying to close the gap with Google. By some estimates, Google makes 60 percent more revenue for each search than Yahoo because of its superior technology and larger market share, which attracts more advertisers to bid in Google's ad auctions.
 In April, Google had 61.6 percent of the search market in the United States, according to comScore, while Yahoo had 20.4 percent and Microsoft 9.1 percent. Indeed, the motivation for Microsoft's bid for Yahoo was to gain enough market share to become a credible rival to Google in Internet search and advertising.
 Microsoft dropped its bid for Yahoo this month, but said last weekend that it had renewed talks. Those talks have focused mainly on Microsoft's buying Yahoo's search business, not the entire company, say people briefed on the negotiations.
 Yahoo conducted a successful test with Google in April in which Google placed ads on some Yahoo searches in the United States. Microsoft is interested in heading off any expansion of the partnership.
 In search advertising, market share is important to attract advertisers and Web publishers, but also to continually hone the ad auction technology. The more searches run through a company's network, the more it learns to further improve its results. If Yahoo hands a sizable portion of its search ad business to Google, analysts say, it loses that knowledge, falling further behind.
 So while a deal might be good for Yahoo's financial performance, at least in the short term, it could reduce competition.
 ''In this business, where scale is so important, there is a danger that you effectively lose a second major player and the opportunity for a genuine counterweight to Google,'' said C. Scott Hemphill, an associate professor at the Columbia Law School.
 The anticompetitive impact, in theory, would be higher prices for ads, reduced choice for Web publishers and less innovation in search and search ad technology. ''But Google will argue that efficiencies of this kind of collaboration outweigh any anticompetitive risks,'' Mr. Hemphill said. ''It can claim that it is supplying superior picks and shovels to the entire industry, the best mining tools for gold prospectors in the Internet economy.''

HEADLINE: More Questions Are Raised About Moody's Ratings

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The Moody's Corporation is investigating whether it assigned top-flight credit ratings to certain securities because of computer errors, the company said Wednesday, raising new questions about the credibility of its assessments.
 News that Moody's might have made such mistakes emboldened the company's many critics and sent its stock price tumbling. Its shares closed down 15.9 percent, to $36.91, their biggest one-day decline in almost a decade.
 The attorney general of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, who has criticized the practices of Moody's and other ratings firms, said that he was investigating how Moody's had dealt with the possible errors in its computer models. 
 ''One of the areas that most concerns us is the potential favoritism and abusive and illegal practices that involve dealings with the companies that they rate,'' Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview.
 News of the possible errors, first reported Wednesday by The Financial Times, comes as Moody's and the two other big credit ratings firms, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, are under scrutiny for how they rated securities backed by risky mortgages. Many of the bonds that the firms rated highly in the last few years have fallen in value and been downgraded quickly. 
 Citing internal company documents, The Financial Times reported that Moody's discovered computer errors last year that had allowed some complex European securities to be rated triple-A, when they should have been rated four grades lower. But instead of re-rating the securities, the newspaper said, Moody's changed certain assumptions that allowed those bonds to retain those gilt-edged ratings.
 Moody's said it recognized the seriousness of the questions raised by the report and has asked its law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, to investigate the matter. ''The integrity of our ratings and rating methodologies is extremely important,'' the company said in a written statement.
 If true, the allegations could pose a significant challenge and liability to Moody's.
 Until now, the major criticism of ratings firm was that they were not skeptical enough in how they rated mortgage securities and that they used flawed assumptions in evaluating the investments. 
 ''This is a whole different thing entirely,'' said Janet Tavakoli, a financial consultant who raised concern about the types of securities Moody's rated earlier this year. ''Now it makes you wonder what else was going on.''
 The securities in question are known as constant proportion debt obligations, or C.P.D.O.'s, a relatively new investment vehicle that sold insurance protection on corporate debt issued in Europe and the United States. Investors in the securities were essentially betting that companies would not default on their bonds and loans. If defaults occurred or the cost of insurance rose, as it did last year, investors in the security would suffer big losses.
 Relatively few C.P.D.O.s were issued before credit markets began freezing up last summer. Moody's rated 44 European C.P.D.O.s, totaling about $4 billion, the company said on Wednesday. Many of those securities have since been downgraded by Moody's and S.& P. 
 Joshua Rosner, an analyst and critic of the ratings firms, said the questions about Moody's C.P.D.O. ratings are particularly concerning because it appears the firm did not change the ratings after it learned of the errors. ''I would suggest that the story is not in the C.P.D.O.s, it's in the cover-up,'' he said.
 In Washington, some said the questions about the rating of the securities deserved an external investigation. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. Since the credit crisis began, the S.E.C. has sent examiners to the ratings firms and collected reams of their documents; a report is due shortly.
 On Wednesday, Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C., told reporters in Washington that his agency does not have authority over the ratings in question because they had been assigned in Europe. But Bloomberg News quoted him as saying that the agency has an ''abiding interest in this subject and will ensure that our ongoing examinations include this area in a robust way.''
 At the same time, Warren E. Buffett, the investor who is the biggest shareholder in Moody's with a nearly 20 percent stake, said the questions about the firm's ratings would not permanently damage it.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 23, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about an investigation into the possibility that a computer error at the Moody's Corporation led to incorrect credit ratings of securities paraphrased incorrectly a comment by Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, about his agency's power in the inquiry. Mr. Cox said it was unclear if the S.E.C. had authority over the ratings, which were assigned in Europe. He did not say that the S.E.C. had no authority.

HEADLINE: Is It Worth It?

BYLINE: JENNIFER RITTNER and JAVAID KHAN


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students share opinions about the value of a college degree by reviewing a number of statistics, opinions and analyses. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students share opinions about the value of a college degree by reviewing a number of statistics, opinions and analyses.
Author(s):
Jennifer Rittner, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will:
 1. Share opinions about the value of a college degree.
 2. Learn about the economic value of a college diploma by reading and discussing the article "A Diploma's Worth? Ask Her."
 3. Participate in an exercise by reading articles related to the value of a college degree.
 4. Interview adults in their community about the education and career choices they made in their life. 
Resources / Materials:
-Pens/pencils
 -Classroom board
 -5 to 8 large pieces of poster board
 -5 to 8 varied documents as outlined in the Warm-Up (see lesson plan for further explanation)
 -Copies of the graphic "Growing Gap," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/05/21/business/21leonhard.graphix.ready.html
 -Copies of the article "A Diploma's Worth? Ask Her" (one per student) 
Activities / Procedures:
[Note to Teacher: The Warm-Up includes an excerpt from Kanye West's single, "All Falls Down." The lyrics have been edited for profanity. Feel free to use, edit or summarize the lyrics as appropriate to your class. The main lesson plan also requires preparation in advance. See below for explanation.]
 1. Warm-Up/Do Now: Before class, distribute the handout as a prompt for students to address in their journals: "In his 2004 album, 'College Dropout,' Kanye West questions the value of a college degree, saying in the song 'All Falls Down:'
 'Man I promise, she's so self conscious
 She has no idea what she's doing in college
 That major that she majored in don't make no money
 But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
 Now, tell me that ain't insecure
 The concept of school seems so secure
 Sophomore three years ain't picked a career
 She like [forget] it, I'll just stay down here and do hair.'
 What do you think a college diploma is worth? Explain your answer."
 Give students time to respond and then ask them to share their ideas. Follow-up by asking if they think they might be excluded from attending college or choosing a college major for any reason. Which careers do they think might exclude them if they do not earn a college degree? Might they feel excluded from any careers because of their gender? Do they think race, economic status, religion or political beliefs may factor into their future employment? Invite students to explain their answers.
 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "A Diploma's Worth? Ask Her" and the graphic "Growing Gap," and focus on the following questions:
 a. What position does Mr. West assert on the value of a college degree?
 b. What do the statistics presented in the article say about the economic value of a college education?
 c. What segments of the population were compared in the study cited in the article?
 d. Why do some economists still feel that education is the key to prosperity?
 e. What specific evidence is cited to support that claim?
 f. Despite that claim, what inequities still exist between the salaries of men and women? Why might that be?
 g. What factors, other than those addressed in the article, might influence an individual's ability to prosper after college?
 h. Overall, how do you feel about Mr. West's assessment of the value of college? Explain your answer.
 3. Before class, you will need to prepare between five and eight stations around the classroom. (The number of stations will depend on the density of the documents you choose as well as the ability of your students to read and respond to them independently.) Each station should feature a large piece of poster board on which you have pasted a document or excerpt from a document related to the topics of college education, college majors and career options. These documents should include a mix of different kinds of sources like news articles, photographs, infographics, maps, interviews, letters, political cartoons, editorials or excerpts from legal or government documents.

 Have students rotate through every station with pens or markers in hand. At each station, students should read and respond to the featured text by writing a short comment or question on the blank poster board surrounding it. As students circulate in small groups around the various stations and add more to their understanding of the topic, encourage them to have a "conversation on paper," in which they write responses to previous comments and questions. When students eventually return to their original stations, they should spend several minutes reading the comments written by others who have responded after them.
 4. Wrap-Up/Homework: Individually, students should interview 10 or more adults to learn about the choices they made regarding their education and careers based on the options available to them at that time in their lives. In preparing their polls, students should consider questions designed to learn how factors like gender, race, salary and personal goals influenced their subjects' decisions. Might any of the subjects have made different choices today? At what age did they feel they had to make a choice about their careers? When did they make their actual choices? How likely were they to change their minds before, during or after college, or after they had entered a profession? When comparing past to present, what changes do they find most significant?
 Write a report based on your findings. Then choose one person to discuss in more detail. Write about their example in the form of song lyrics either in the spirit of Mr. West or as a rebuttal to his song, "All Falls Down." 
Further Questions for Discussion:
-Are you planning to work toward a college degree? Why or why not?
 -Do you know of resources (family, community, governmental, etc.) that can provide financial support for your education?
 -How might your life change if you earn a college degree?
 -What might your life be like without a college degree?
 -Does your family or social environment support the pursuit of a college education?
 -Are there opportunities for lucrative work with a college degree in your community? If so, what are they?
 -Are there opportunities for lucrative work without a college degree in your community? If so, what are they? 
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, completion of the text-on-text exercise and thoughtful completion of their homework. 
Vocabulary:
Monologue, meager, muddle, deferrals, mediocrity 
Extension Activities:
1. Organize a career fair at your school. Invite employers who might seek to hire teenagers as employees or interns, as well as employers who offer opportunities for teenagers hoping to take time off before entering their freshman year of college, like farm schools, work abroad programs or apprenticeships. Follow-up with one of the presenters to apply for a summer job or internship.
2. Collect data on the local, state or federal budgets for public higher education in the last 10 years. Prepare a series of charts and graphs based on your findings.
3. Investigate the total cost of attending a two-year or four-year college. How might you factor in tuition, living expenses, income from work and financial aid? What additional expenses might you need to investigate further (like costs for books, travel or commuting, emergencies or entertainment)? Prepare a personal economic plan based on your findings. Keep your plan and update it after your first year in college.
4. Investigate and prepare an annotated timeline showing women's career opportunities and average salaries from the 20th century to the present. 
Interdisciplinary Connections:

HEADLINE: A Fountain On Every Corner

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ROYTE. 
Elizabeth Royte is the author of ''Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash'' and ''Bottlemania: How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought It.''

 BODY:
WATER fountain season is here. New York City workers have turned on bubblers in the parks, and the Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has begun to erect four enormous waterfalls in the harbor, each 90 to 120 feet high, that are scheduled to flow from July to October. The shimmering cascades will cost the city nothing (the $15 million cost is being paid by private donations to the Public Art Fund), but here's a better idea for a civic-minded organization or person interested in celebrating water: sidewalk fountains in places outside the parks.
 Convenience is said to be one of bottled water's greatest allures: we're a grab-and-go society, consuming roughly 50 billion bottles of water a year. But as awareness of the product's economic and environmental impact has escalated, mayors across the nation (although not Michael Bloomberg of New York) have canceled city contracts with bottled water purveyors, citing the expense of hauling away empties (less than 20 percent make it into recycling systems); the vast amounts of oil used in producing, transporting and refrigerating the bottles; and the hypocrisy of spending taxpayer dollars on private water while touting the virtues of public supplies. Last summer, New York City spent $700,000 on a campaign reminding New Yorkers that their tap water is tasty and affordable. 
 Delivered by gravity, tap water generates virtually no waste. All that, and it contains no calories, caffeine or colorants either. (Yes, New York's water -- like that of other cities -- contains trace amounts of drugs, but we lack proof, so far, that exposure at these low levels is a human health risk.)
 Bottled water's main virtue, it seems, is convenience, especially for people at large in the city. As the editor of Beverage Digest told The Times, ''It's not so easy, walking down Third Avenue on a hot day, to get a glass of tap water.''
 But it needn't be so. Paris has its ornate cast-iron Wallace fountains (donated in the late 19th century by a wealthy philanthropist hoping to steer the homeless from alcohol toward a healthier beverage); Rome its ever-running street spigots; Portland, Ore., its delightful four-bowl Benson Bubblers.
 In the 1880s, several American cities had ''temperance fountains,'' paid for by the philanthropist (and dentist) Henry D. Cogswell of San Francisco. New York City had six of these, placed at busy corners: ''In the brief space of 10 minutes one morning 40 persons were recently observed to stop for a refreshing drink,'' observed an officer of the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, which helped place the fountains.
 Such fountains have largely disappeared (although the temperance fountain in Tompkins Square Park still stands). Today, we've got plenty of bubblers in parks, but Midtown is a Sahara for parched pedestrians, who don't even think of looking for public sources of tap water.
 An entire generation of Americans has grown up thinking public faucets equal filth, and the only water fit to drink comes in plastic, factory sealed. It's time to change that perception with public fountains in the city's busiest quadrants, pristine bubblers that celebrate the virtues of our public water supply, remind us of our connection to upstate watersheds and reinforce our commitment to clean water for all. 
 On a more practical note: let's make them easy to maintain, with water pressure adequate to fill our reusable bottles. And germophobes, relax: city water is chlorinated, and experts report that pathogens impolitely left on spigots by the lips of preceding drinkers don't creep down into pipes. In other words, the bubbling water is clean, so get over it.
 Minneapolis recently committed to spending $500,000 on 10 artist-designed fountains that will be placed in areas of high foot and bike traffic. Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, archenemy of bottled water, is pursuing a similar plan. New York and other cities should swiftly follow suit, if not with fancy fountains then with several dozen off-the-shelf models. Wheelchair-accessible, and vandal- and frost-resistant, they can be had for less than $2,000 apiece (plumbing not included). It's a small price to pay to quench thirst, reduce bottle litter, slash our collective carbon footprint and reaffirm our connection with the city's most valuable resource: its public water supply.

HEADLINE: Hints of Progress in Drugs Treating Brain Cancer

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Robert A. Swanson, who co-founded Genentech and is considered a father of the biotechnology industry, was only 52 when he died in 1999, one year after a diagnosis of brain cancer. 
 In his own company's laboratories was a new experimental drug that, it turns out, might have helped him. In recent studies, that drug, Avastin, seems to shrink tumors, although it is still not clear how much longer this may help patients live. 
 Avastin, already widely used to treat other types of cancer, is leading a pack of new drugs that look promising as treatments for brain cancer, one of the deadliest and least treatable forms of cancer. The disease has received public attention this week with news that Senator Edward M. Kennedy has a malignant glioma, the worst class of brain tumor. 
 While details of the 76-year-old senator's cancer and his possible treatment are not yet known, glioma has a grim prognosis. Half of people with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and deadliest of the gliomas, die within 15 months. 
 For decades, cancer drugs have been unable to make much of a change in those statistics. But now some experts hope that new drugs, some developed using new biotechnology techniques, can improve the outlook.
 ''I think that what you are going to see in the next five years is substantial improvement in survival,'' said Dr. Henry S. Friedman, a brain cancer specialist at Duke University. ''For the first time the pot seems to be boiling over with a number of different options, while 10 years ago we had nothing.''
 Already, the brain cancer drug Temodar, a pill sold by Schering-Plough, is on track to surpass $1 billion in sales this year, which would make it the first blockbuster drug for brain cancer. And other treatments still in the experimental stage are showing hints of promise. 
 One is a cancer ''vaccine,'' which aims to train the patient's immune system to attack the tumor. An advocate for it is Cameron Mitchell, a 51-year-old man who formerly ran a coin laundry business in Grand Rapids, Mich. One Saturday morning he collapsed at home, writhing in convulsions. It was the first signal of a brain cancer that his doctors said would probably kill him within a year and a half. 
 That was in March 2004. Four years later Mr. Mitchell is leading what he calls a fairly normal life, although he can no longer drive because of occasional seizures. 
 He credits his longevity to the experimental cancer vaccine that he has been taking once a month at Duke. Pfizer recently agreed to pay at least $50 million for rights to the treatment from the biotechnology company Avant Immunotherapeutics. 
 In early clinical trials, patients lived roughly 30 months on average, about twice what might be expected. Others being treated in a clinical trial include Bobby Murcer, the New York Yankees broadcaster and former player. 
 Many experts, to be sure, voice caution about the pace of progress against brain cancer. They point out that neither Avastin nor the vaccine has been shown to lengthen lives when compared with a placebo or another other drug in a clinical trial. 
 Drugs often look good in early testing because doctors, either consciously or subconsciously, choose to try them on the patients with the best prospects. Mr. Mitchell might have survived anyway. 
 ''This is a very select population of patients,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Raizer, director of the medical neuro-oncology program at Northwestern University. ''There are two- to four-year survivors with these tumors who haven't had the vaccine therapy.'' 
 But virtually all experts agree there has been a sharp increase in the number of compounds being tested against brain cancer, in response to new scientific understanding of cancer and the changing economics of the pharmaceutical business. 
 For decades brain cancer was simply not an attractive area for drug makers. 
 Drugs rarely worked, in part because the blood-brain barrier, intended to shield the organ from certain chemicals in the blood, also blocked the drugs from reaching the tumors. 
 Moreover, the market was perceived to be small. There are only about 22,000 new cases of all brain and nervous system cancers in the United States each year, only a tenth as many as there are lung cancers, according to the American Cancer Society. The rapid death rate also limits the appeal of developing drugs. 
 ''The typical life span isn't that long, so it doesn't have the recurring revenue stream, to put it bluntly,'' said Stephen M. Case, chairman of Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, a nonprofit group that spurs research on treatments for the disease. Mr. Case, a founder of America Online, started the group with his brother Daniel, the former chief of the investment bank Hambrecht & Quist, who died from brain cancer in 2002 at age 44. 
 But the situation is changing. As pharmaceutical companies have been able to sharply raise prices for cancer drugs in recent years, it has become possible for treatments for even rare cancers to have hefty sales -- as demonstrated by Temodar. 
 New drugs are considered vital to the fight against brain cancer. Surgery and radiation therapy, which are also mainstays of treatment, might not improve much more. And they still can miss microscopic pockets of cancerous cells. 
 ''We've reached our maximum limit that we can achieve with surgery,'' said Dr. Keith Black, the chairman of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
 Drugs, which can find those lurking cancerous cells by molecular means, might be the best option for further improvement. 
 Drug therapy made a big gain in 2004, when a trial showed that Temodar, combined with radiation, extended the median survival of patients in a clinical trial to 14.6 months, compared with 12.1 months for patients who received only radiation. 
 After four years, 12 percent of those who received Temodar, which is called Temodal outside the United States, were still alive, compared with only 3 percent of those in the control group. 
 Among drugs now in the pipeline, most attention is focused on Genentech's Avastin. The company says it will file this year for federal approval of the drug to treat glioblastoma multiforme patients who have a relapse.
 Avastin works by blocking the flow of blood that brings oxygen and nourishment to tumors. On brain scans, Avastin seems to shrink many tumors. 
 ''This is a remarkable, miraculous response on the imaging that we've never seen before,'' said Dr. Lawrence Recht, professor of neurology at Stanford University. 
 But there is a catch, he and others said. What the scans might be showing is that Avastin is reducing the swelling in the brain caused by leaking blood, not actually reducing the tumor size. 
 Even that can have a benefit because the swelling can cause neurological problems like those affecting speech or motion. In a clinical trial, patients who got Avastin alone had a median survival of more than nine months. Doctors said such patients might have been expected to live six months.
 Other drugs that also work at least in part by blocking blood flow to the tumor are also in clinical trials. Most uncertain are the so-called cancer vaccines, which do not prevent disease like a measles vaccine. Rather they aim to treat the disease by harnessing the patient's own immune system. No such therapeutic cancer vaccine has ever performed well enough to win approval in the United States. 
 Besides the Avant vaccine, another is being tested by Northwest Biotherapeutics. Eight of the first 16 treated patients have lived at least three years, said Dr. Linda M. Liau of the University of California, Los Angeles, who initially developed the treatment. 
 One of those patients, Kevin Carlberg, a 30-year-old Hollywood rock musician, has lived more than five years, getting married, having a daughter, running a marathon and recording new CDs.
 ''I guess I'm living proof that miracles do happen,'' he said. But whether that miracle is because of the vaccine is still open to question.

HEADLINE: Auto Parts Workers Approve a Contract

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The eighth-longest strike ever for the United Automobile Workers union ended Thursday as workers at American Axle and Manufacturing approved a four-year contract that the U.A.W.'s president had described as subpar but ''the best we can do.''
 Under the deal, about 3,650 workers at auto parts plants in New York and Michigan, who had been on strike for 87 days, will earn an average of $10 an hour less. The workers can choose either to take a buyout of up to $140,000 and leave, or to stay and receive three annual ''buydown'' payments totaling as much as $105,000 aimed at helping them adjust to the lower wages. Those who are eligible will also be offered the possibility of early retirement which includes a $55,000 payment.For many, the decision was easy. ''Give me my $140,000 and let me go,'' said Walter Dowery, 36, who has been with the company since its founding in 1994. 
 All workers will receive an immediate bonus of $5,000, although that is less than half of what most lost while walking the picket lines since Feb. 26. Two forging plants, in Detroit and Tonawanda, N.Y., will close. Details about any buyouts will be given to workers after the factories reopen.
 ''It washes away three decades of what the U.A.W. has worked so hard for,'' said David L. Gregory, a labor specialist at St. John's University in New York. ''We definitely have never seen a strike in the history of the U.A.W. that's resulted in such a dramatic reduction in all of the tangible factors that they were fighting for.''
 Many workers who voted Thursday at U.A.W. Local 235 in Detroit summed up their opinion of the contract with a profanity or two, before acknowledging that they voted for it because they feared the alternative.
 ''The writing's on the wall,'' said Peter Grzadzinski, 57, a skilled tradesman who hoped to find another job so he could take a buyout and quit. ''If we voted no, we wouldn't get anything. They'd just close this place down.''
 ''This contract would not have passed 10 weeks ago or even a month ago, but after 12 weeks people are about to lose their house,'' said Keith Bardol, 38, a machine operator who transferred last year to Detroit from a plant in Buffalo, N.Y., that American Axle was closing. ''For a lot of the people here, it's going to be a total lifestyle change. I wanted to vote no, but I've got to take into account my family.''
 An end to the strike will come as a relief to General Motors, which had to stop or reduce production at as many as 32 factories that rely on a steady flow of parts from American Axle; 12 of those plants already resumed normal operations after securing those parts from another source. Most of the parts that G.M. buys from American Axle go on large trucks and sport utility vehicles that have been selling slowly, so the disruption had a minimal effect on sales.
 But the U.A.W., in what analysts say was an effort to pull G.M. into the talks with American Axle, also called walkouts at G.M. assembly plants near Lansing, Mich., and Kansas City, Kan., that build two of the automaker's most popular vehicles. The Lansing strike ended last week, a day before the U.A.W. reached a tentative deal with American Axle, and the strike in Kansas ended Thursday after workers there ratified a new local contract.
 Three days after the Kansas strike started, halting assembly of the hot-selling Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan, G.M. said it would give American Axle $200 million to pay for buyouts and buydowns. G.M. increased its offer to $218 million in the hours before negotiators reached a tentative settlement.
 In addition to that cash, the U.A.W. also got American Axle to loosen its demands for wage and benefit cuts. The company said it needed to cut wages in half, from $28 an hour to about $14 for many workers.
 The U.A.W.-approved deal sets hourly wages at around $18.50, though some support workers at a facility in Three Rivers, Mich., will make as little as $10. Lou Majeske, 45, who works on American Axle's Detroit gear and axle assembly line, said that rejecting the deal would have been foolish.
 ''With the economics of the times, he's got us,'' Mr. Majeske said of the company's chief executive, Richard E. Dauch, whom U.A.W. members used to revere in better times for the industry. ''We'll stick our tails between our legs and hope for something better down the road. There's a lot of people who would kill for what we'll be making still.''

HEADLINE: Urgency Replaces Subtlety in Summer's Struggle for Visitors

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS the crucial summer travel season starts, how much are tourism marketers scrambling to meet the challenges from fast-rising gasoline prices and airfares? Well, ''What happens here stays here'' is not staying around, at least for now.
 That feel-good slogan, which promotes visits to Las Vegas -- also known as ''What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas'' -- is being shelved for harder-hitting pleas. The familiar commercials with cute, funny tales about travelers whose lives are changed by trips to Las Vegas have been supplanted by spots with a fast-talking pitchman who urges the world to ''do Vegas right now.''
 The shift, which includes a new Web site (vegasrightnow.com), began in ads seen in 12 large markets where many travelers to Las Vegas live, including Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, and was recently made nationwide.
 '' 'What happens here stays here' is being given a rest,'' said Rob Dondero, executive vice president at R&R Partners in Las Vegas, the agency for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, because ''it doesn't have a strong call to action.'' 
 ''We need to be a little more retail,'' he added. ''People want to know what is the best value for their getaway dollar.''
 The Memorial Day weekend, which begins on Friday, marks the traditional start of campaigns to peddle vacation destinations. Even experts in tourism marketing say they have not experienced a market like this one.
 ''We are clearly in uncharted waters,'' said Peter Yesawich, chairman and chief executive at Ypartnership in Orlando, Fla., whose agency, formerly Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown & Russell, has long specialized in travel advertising.
 ''There is a palpable nervousness on the part of everybody in the industry,'' he added, ''and for good reason.''
 ''We've seen some of these conditions individually,'' Mr. Yesawich said, referring to problems like high fuel prices and reduced capacity on airlines, ''but never all of them at once.''
 The result has been ''a spate of promotional offers for this summer,'' he added. ''We say, value is king right now.''
 That is underscored in a campaign from his agency for the attractions of Panama City Beach, Fla. An upbeat slogan, ''The beach lovers' beach,'' is being supplemented with a direct appeal to saving money: a ''Summer white sale'' offering discounts, gasoline credits and other deals in person and online (pcbwhitesale.com) at more than 50 local attractions, accommodations and restaurants.
 ''I still think people will travel,'' said Dan Rowe, the executive director of the Panama Beach City Convention and Visitors Bureau, ''but it is tough.''
 The ads for the white sale -- a pun on what Mr. Rowe describes as the ''sugar-white beaches'' -- took a speedy 10 days ''from conceptual approval to the day we were in the market,'' he said. Since the campaign started on May 4, ''the response has been good,'' he added, although it is ''still building.''
 Destinations are not the only travel marketers seeking to woo worried consumers, not only through ads and Web sites but also with public relations campaigns and event marketing.
 For instance, car rental companies like Hertz are offering bargains like 50 percent off weekend rates. The Extended Stay Hotels chain is proclaiming, ''Take shelter from the economy,'' in suites with kitchens from $59.99 a night.
 Even American Express is bringing back a promotion, Going Once, that joins with merchants to sell travel packages at discounted prices.
 ''It's like the perfect storm, highly unpredictable and pretty volatile,'' said John Dunn, the executive vice president at Tourisme Montreal, which is working with an ad agency, Sid Lee in Montreal; an interactive agency, Cactus, also in Montreal; and Laura Davidson Public Relations in New York.
 Their efforts include beefing up the ''sweet deals'' section of a Web site (tourisme-montreal.org) and emphasizing the proximity of Montreal by car, train or plane to American cities like Boston, Chicago and New York.
 ''People still want to go on holiday,'' Mr. Dunn said, but ''I'm sure there are some who will scale back.''
 As a result, ''we have to appeal to the emotion of the traveler,'' he added. 
 This summer, that appeal will be aimed at tugging on the heart strings -- and also at loosening the purse strings.
 For example, the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau in Florida is still running an upbeat campaign by 22 Squared in Atlanta, which carries the theme ''Say yes to Orlando.'' The commercials show parents having such a great time with their offspring that they turn into children.
 ''At the very end of each spot, we added, 'Say yes to special values,' '' said Gary Sain, president and chief executive at the Orlando/Orange County bureau, an appeal that directs viewers to deals on a Web site (visitorlando.com).
 ''We've always been an affordable vacation destination,'' Mr. Sain said, ''but we're not immune to what's happening.''
 ''The travel pie may shrink in 2008,'' he added. ''Our job is to get a disproportionate share of the pie.''
 In pushing proximity as a reason to visit, Montreal is being joined by a growing number of destinations.
 The Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism is continuing a campaign it began last year that carries the theme ''Closer than you think.'' The advertising and public relations efforts are being handled by Pita Communications in Hartford and M. Silver Associates in New York.
 ''Everybody wants to get away,'' said Karen Senich, executive director of the commission, ''but we understand they may not be taking vacations as long and as far as before.''
 So radio commercials extolling the virtues of Connecticut attractions, which are to begin running next week, will be heard on stations in Connecticut as well as New York.
 ''We've stepped it up to reach the in-state market,'' Ms. Senich said, ''because we want our own residents to realize they don't have to go far to have a nice vacation.''
 To reinforce that message, the state's fourth annual ''open house'' will be held on June 14 at more than 230 attractions, she added, offering free or reduced admissions to Nutmeggers.
 The Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association will reach out, starting in mid-June, to residents of nearby states like Pennsylvania and Virginia with a campaign by the Silver agency and Carton Donofrio Partners in Baltimore, for advertising.
 There will be promotions like Harbor Pass+, adding an extra day to the Harbor Pass that offers local attractions at discounted prices, and offers to buy two nights at participating hotels and get a third night free. 
 ''It's going to be a very competitive summer among destinations,'' said Sam Rogers, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Baltimore association, and urban destinations like his can make a compelling argument to potential visitors ''worried about high gas prices: You can put your car in a garage and walk everywhere.''
 Some travel marketers are breathing a bit easier because of growing visits from tourists who are not Americans.
 Mr. Dunn at Tourisme Montreal pointed to countries like Britain, Ireland and Mexico as counterweights to the United States economy. And Mr. Sain at Orlando/Orange County cited increases in visitors from Brazil, Germany and Ireland.
 Still, a big attraction in Mr. Sain's territory, the Universal Orlando Resort, believes it can also draw domestic visitors.
 An online campaign by an internal team and T3 in Austin, Tex., with banner and search-engine elements, is promoting a discount ticket that for $79.99 gives buyers unlimited admissions for up to a week at two theme parks.
 ''We see the value we offer as taking the sting out of high gas prices,'' said Kurt Kostur, the senior vice president for marketing at Universal Orlando Resort, part of the NBC Universal division of General Electric.
 ''Like everyone else in our business, we're watching the economy very closely,'' he added. ''We're cautiously optimistic about what the summer holds.''

 Opera
 'IL MATRIMONIO SEGRETO' (Wednesday and Thursday) Domenico Cimarosa's 1792 comic opera ''Il Matrimonio Segreto'' was a wildly successful work in its day. In recent decades it has barely clung to a place in the repertory. So opera lovers should welcome the American premiere of Jonathan Miller's production of the work that is coming to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The story is stock fare: one daughter of a wealthy citizen of Bologna is under intense parental pressure to marry an English nobleman, but the nobleman loves the father's other daughter, who is secretly married to her penniless beloved. After much confusion, all ends happily. Paul Goodwin conducts the Brooklyn Philharmonic for this limited run (through June 3). At 7:30 p.m., BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $90. (Anthony Tommasini)

At 7 p.m., St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fifth Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 753-2261, saintpatrickscathedral.org; free. (Allan Kozinn)
 BACHIANA CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Friday) When the pianist and conductor Joao Carlos Martins introduced his Brazilian orchestra to New York in 2006, tickets went for $1. This time inflation has done its work: the price has doubled. Mr. Martins is sharing the conducting duties with Laerico Diniz in a program that includes Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3; the ''Suite Brasileira'' by Mateus Araujo; and works by Mozart, Schumann, Piazzola and Jobim. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $2. (Kozinn)

HEADLINE: Step to the Rear of the Bus, Please, or Take a Seat Upstairs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
For decades, they were a fixture of New York life: double-decker buses swaying along Fifth Avenue. They disappeared in 1953 and made a brief and ill-fated return in the 1970s. But now they may be ready for a third act. 
 Howard H. Roberts Jr., the president of New York City Transit, said on Thursday that he is considering bringing the two-level buses back to Fifth Avenue. 
 Mr. Roberts said his interest was based on simple economics. Double-deckers can carry about as many people as the longer bus that the transit agency now uses, according to Joseph Smith, senior vice president for the agency's bus operations. But they cost less to maintain because they lack the complicated connector and accordion apparatus that links the two portions of an articulated bus. 
 Those who rode the double-deckers in their heyday have fond memories.
 ''Back in the days when money was important, it was great to take a date out and you could have a nice ride up and a nice ride back on a summer evening,'' said William J. Ronan, 95, who first rode the buses when he came to New York during his student days in the 1930s (three decades later, he became the first chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority). 
 ''It was sort of a genteel way to travel and perfectly respectable,'' he said. ''Between that and the Staten Island Ferry you could have a wonderful date.''
 Mr. Ronan said the seats in front on the upper deck were considered the best ones. ''You tried to get up in the front seats, which were great because you had the view up the avenue,'' he said.
 Mr. Smith said that he was looking at buses made by three manufacturers but that it was too early to say when, or even with certainty if, double-deckers would be brought to New York for test runs. 
 Double-decker buses were operated by the Fifth Avenue Coach Company starting at least in the early part of the last century. The company used both open-top buses -- the ones that Mr. Ronan remembered so fondly and similar to those used today for sightseeing -- and fully enclosed double-deckers. The transit agency is looking to bring back only the enclosed models. 
 ''The Fifth Avenue Coach was always a premium service,'' said Charles F. Seaton, a transit spokesman. ''When other buses were a nickel, the Fifth Avenue Coach was a dime. And their buses were pretty much viewed as a grand way to travel.''
 The company stopped running its open-top buses in 1946, while the enclosed double-deckers made their last run in 1953, according to news articles. 
 Mr. Ronan tried to bring the double-decker buses back in 1976, when the transportation authority bought eight of them from a British company to be used in a pilot program. Mr. Seaton said the buses had mechanical problems and were off the road after about two years. 
 But there were other problems, including on the continuation of some Fifth Avenue routes where the buses travel along Riverside Drive.
 ''The problem then was all the trees along Riverside Drive had grown such that the branches were in the way of the bus,'' said Robert A. Olmsted, who worked at the authority with Mr. Ronan. If the buses are brought back, he said, ''they'd have to do some clearance runs and trim some trees, which may upset some people, too.'' 
 Walking downtown on Thursday, John Perchinski, 65, recalled riding on the upper decks of the buses as a child. ''It was a really comfortable ride,'' he said.
 An article in The New York Times in 1942, when the coach company was threatening to stop using the double-decker buses, offered a panegyric to their charms. 
 ''The young and ardent New Yorker brought his girl to the top deck of a Fifth Avenue bus and together they sailed into the fabulous land of the shop windows,'' the article said. ''The New Yorker grown old and a bit philosophical found these lofty seats, moving sedately up the Avenue, ideal places from which to watch the passing show of the pavements.''

HEADLINE: Fund Fees Revisited In Court

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
In 1970, Congress decided that there was too little price competition in the mutual fund industry and amended the law to allow fund investors to file suits claiming that management fees were excessive.
 Now a federal appeals court has decided that the law makes no sense, and has essentially rejected it.
 The provision in question is not a model of legislative clarity; it reflects a compromise between some legislators who wanted to impose tough limits on compensation and others who favored a gentler approach. 
 It provides that fund managers have a ''fiduciary duty with respect to compensation for services,'' and gives shareholders the right to go to court without being specific about what criteria judges should use in deciding such cases. 
 ''A fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation,'' wrote Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in a decision issued this week.
 ''The trustees (and in the end investors, who vote with their feet and dollars), rather than a judge or jury, determine how much advisory services are worth,'' he added.
 One reason that decision surprised some lawyers was that such disclosures were required long before the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act were passed. If the new section added no new requirements, as Judge Easterbrook concluded, then the section he was interpreting would appear to be superfluous.
 Until now, the ruling precedent has been a 1982 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a case known by the name of the plaintiff, Irving L. Gartenberg. That ruling stated that a fee could be deemed excessive if it was ''so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's-length bargaining.''
 In the years that followed, there do not appear to have been any cases won by complaining investors. But securities lawyers say there have been some settlements, and the threat of legal action may have lowered some fees. Funds have set up elaborate processes in which the independent directors review information and then seek to negotiate lower fees with the manager.
 Arthur Levitt, when chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflected the widespread view of the law when he said in 1998 that ''directors don't have to guarantee that a fund pays the lowest rates. But they do have to make sure that fees fall within a reasonable band.''
 Mr. Levitt's remarks were cited by Harris Associates, which manages three funds for the Oakmark family of funds, when it asked a federal judge in Illinois to apply the ''universally followed'' Gartenberg rules and dismiss a challenge to the compensation Harris had received.
 The judge agreed, and that might have been the end of the case. But the plaintiff appealed to the Seventh Circuit, based in Chicago, arguing that the judge should have compared the fees charged to the fund with the much lower fees charged by Harris to institutional clients when it manages similar accounts.
 That comparison was cited by Eliot Spitzer, when he was New York's attorney general, when he told Congress that investors in one fund family were overcharged by hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
 At the heart of the dispute is the fact that the Investment Company Act seems to assume an industry structure that is very different from the actual one. It assumes mutual funds are formed by groups of investors who come together and pool their money. They elect directors, sometimes called trustees, and the directors hire managers to run the fund. The directors negotiate to get the best possible deal from the best qualified managers.
 In the real world, mutual funds are put together by sponsors, which have families of funds and try to come up with new ones that will attract investors. The fund directors are chosen by the sponsor and ratified by the few shareholders who bother to vote.
 In the Gartenberg decision, Judge Walter Roe Mansfield concluded that while there was intense competition between mutual funds, that did not mean there was also competition between advisers for fund business. ''The former may be vigorous even though the latter is virtually nonexistent,'' he wrote.
 Judge Easterbrook, in a decision joined by two other judges, disagreed. ''That mutual funds are 'captives' of investment advisers does not curtail this competition,'' he wrote. ''An adviser can't make money from its captive fund if high fees drive investors away.''
 He cited ''a recent, careful study'' which concluded ''that investors can and do protect their interests by shopping, and that regulating investment advisory fees through litigation is likely to do more harm than good.
 That study was by John C. Coates, a Harvard professor of law and economics, and R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School and a former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and was partly financed by the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry group.
 The study concluded that ''existing case law -- prominently the Gartenberg test -- is a sensible interpretation of what was intended'' by Congress and that the courts should not be open to wider fee challenges. It did not suggest dropping Gartenberg, as the Seventh Circuit did, and no parties in the Harris case asked that it be dropped, although the plaintiffs wanted it to be strengthened.
 The Coates-Hubbard study was critical of other studies that found a lack of competition in the fund business. A co-author of one of those studies, John P. Freeman, a professor of business and professional ethics at the University of South Carolina Law School, has fired back, calling the Coates-Hubbard study a ''superficial and deeply flawed piece of advocacy espousing the views of fund sponsors.''
 An immediate effect of the ruling will probably be to reduce the already small amount of litigation in the area. ''It should make plaintiffs think twice before they sue an adviser for charging excessive fees,'' said Jay Baris, a partner in Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, a New York law firm, who represents some fund directors.
 The Seventh Circuit decision is binding only on courts in that circuit, which covers Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. But if it becomes widely accepted it could lead boards to forgo the often extensive process of gathering information to determine if fees are reasonable. Harris asserted that procedure had led to decisions that limited the fees it received as the funds grew larger.
 In any case, there is little evidence that many investors care much about fees. The biggest growth area in money management has been in hedge funds, which normally charge a fee of 2 percent of assets, plus 20 percent of profits. The highest fee Harris charged was 1 percent of assets. 
 If they do care, the S.E.C. took action Wednesday to make it easier to obtain and compare fund fee information electronically. Anyone who finds fees unreasonably high, however, now has a much smaller chance of getting the courts to intervene.

HEADLINE: The Alpha Geeks

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
In 1950, Dr. Seuss published a book called ''If I Ran the Zoo.'' It contained the sentence: ''I'll sail to Ka-Troo, and bring back an IT-KUTCH, a PREEP, and a PROO, a NERKLE, a NERD, and a SEERSUCKER, too!'' According to the psychologist David Anderegg, that's believed to be the first printed use of the word ''nerd'' in modern English. 
 The next year, Newsweek noticed that nerd was being used in Detroit as a substitute for ''square.'' But, as Ander-egg writes in his book, ''Nerds,'' the term didn't really blossom onto mass consciousness until The Fonz used it in ''Happy Days'' in the mid- to late-1970s. And thus began what you might call the ascent of nerdism in modern America. 
 At first, a nerd was a geek with better grades. The word described a high-school or college outcast who was persecuted by the jocks, preps, frat boys and sorority sisters. Nerds had their own heroes (Stan Lee of comic book fame), their own vocations (Dungeons & Dragons), their own religion (supplied by George Lucas and ''Star Wars'') and their own skill sets (tech support). But even as ''Revenge of the Nerds'' was gracing the nation's movie screens, a different version of nerd-dom was percolating through popular culture. Elvis Costello and The Talking Heads's David Byrne popularized a cool geek style that's led to Moby, Weezer, Vampire Weekend and even self-styled ''nerdcore'' rock and geeksta rappers. 
 The future historians of the nerd ascendancy will likely note that the great empowerment phase began in the 1980s with the rise of Microsoft and the digital economy. Nerds began making large amounts of money and acquired economic credibility, the seedbed of social prestige. The information revolution produced a parade of highly confident nerd moguls -- Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Larry Page and Sergey Brin and so on.
 Among adults, the words ''geek'' and ''nerd'' exchanged status positions. A nerd was still socially tainted, but geekdom acquired its own cool counterculture. A geek possessed a certain passion for specialized knowledge, but also a high degree of cultural awareness and poise that a nerd lacked. 
 Geeks not only rebelled against jocks, but they distinguished themselves from alienated and self-pitying outsiders who wept with recognition when they read ''Catcher in the Rye.'' If Holden Caulfield was the sensitive loner from the age of nerd oppression, then Harry Potter was the magical leader in the age of geek empowerment.
 But the biggest change was not Silicon Valley itself. Rather, the new technology created a range of mental playgrounds where the new geeks could display their cultural capital. The jock can shine on the football field, but the geeks can display their supple sensibilities and well-modulated emotions on their Facebook pages, blogs, text messages and Twitter feeds. Now there are armies of designers, researchers, media mavens and other cultural producers with a talent for whimsical self-mockery, arcane social references and late-night analysis. 
 They can visit eclectic sites like Kottke.org and Cool Hunting, experiment with fonts, admire Stewart Brand and Lawrence Lessig and join social-networking communities with ironical names. They've created a new definition of what it means to be cool, a definition that leaves out the talents of the jocks, the M.B.A.-types and the less educated. In ''The Laws of Cool,'' Alan Liu writes: ''Cool is a feeling for information.'' When someone has that dexterity, you know it. 
 Tina Fey, who once was on the cover of Geek Monthly magazine, has emerged as a symbol of the geek who grows into a swan. There is now a cool geek fashion style, which can be found on shopping sites all over the Web (think Japanese sneakers and text-laden T-shirts). Schwinn now makes a retro-looking Sid/Nancy bicycle, which is sweet and clunky even though it has a faux-angry name. There are now millions of educated-class types guided by geek manners and status rules.
 The news that being a geek is cool has apparently not permeated either junior high schools or the Republican Party. George Bush plays an interesting role in the tale of nerd ascent. With his professed disdain for intellectual things, he's energized and alienated the entire geek cohort, and with it most college-educated Americans under 30. Newly militant, geeks are more coherent and active than they might otherwise be.
 Barack Obama has become the Prince Caspian of the iPhone hordes. They honor him with videos and posters that combine aesthetic mastery with unabashed hero-worship. People in the 1950s used to earnestly debate the role of the intellectual in modern politics. But the Lionel Trilling authority-figure has been displaced by the mass class of blog-writing culture producers. 
 So, in a relatively short period of time, the social structure has flipped. For as it is written, the last shall be first and the geek shall inherit the earth.

HEADLINE: U.S. in Difficult Position Over Japan's Rice Plan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and ANDREW MARTIN; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong and Andrew Martin from New York. Yasuko Kamiizumi in Tokyo contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Japan is preparing to send at least 220,000 tons of rice to the Philippines, and possibly Africa. The Japanese government says the plan is meant to ease the suffering of poor nations punished by rising rice prices. 
 But critics, including some in Washington, worry that it could set a precedent for Japan to dump foreign rice it was obligated to import but had never wanted. They say that the Japanese plan risks setting off a trade dispute with the United States -- and may barely dent the price of rice.
 Yet opposing the Japanese plan could put the United States in a delicate diplomatic position. The price of rice, the most important staple food of the world's poor, has risen faster than any other cereal, nearly tripling this year alone, according to rice traders. The high prices have caused protests in many countries and, according to World Bank officials, pushed 100 million people back into poverty. 
 ''It is a fact that people around the world regard the situation as one in which the United States is systematically obstructing Japanese efforts to use its minimum access rice reserve usefully -- we have to exchange opinions with each other,'' said Tatsuya Kajishima, the director of the food trading division of Japan's ministry of agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
 American and Japanese officials are scheduled to resume talks on the issue on Friday.
 The Japanese shipments could damp slightly the rise in global rice prices. The effect would be more pronounced if Japan followed it with further sales or donations from the 1.7 million tons of imported rice now sitting in Japanese warehouses. Roughly 30 million tons of rice are traded globally each year.
 Mr. Kajishima said no decision had been reached yet on how much of the 220,000 tons for the Philippines would be sold and how much might be donated. Japan's cabinet is also preparing to approve $50 million worth of food aid for Africa, part of which may be rice, he said.
 The plan is controversial among trade experts because the rice earmarked for shipment is rice that Japan reluctantly imported from other countries under an agreement to provide at least a minimum level of access to its largely protected rice market each year.
 Separately, experts in international development warn that shipments of free or subsidized food hurt farmers in developing countries, robbing them of their customer base and making the country dependent on foreign food. 
 The United States led an international effort by rice-exporting nations in the 1980s and early 1990s to insist that Japan begin allowing rice imports. Japan finally agreed to buy nearly 700,000 tons a year, as part of the 1993 global pact that created the World Trade Organization.
 But Japan has put much of the imported rice in warehouses at an annual cost to the government of $144 million, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
 Each year, Japan also donates limited quantities of rice to countries, including Tanzania, sends some to rice cracker makers and other food processors and even uses some rice as animal feed.
 Only a small amount of the imported rice has been sold to Japanese consumers, allowing rice prices in Japan to remain four times higher than the world average. ''We look forward to having discussions with the Japanese on Friday to discuss this issue further and learn exactly what they plan on doing with the rice,'' said Gretchen Hamel, a spokeswoman for the United States Trade Representative's office, adding that the Americans would be supportive of any ''food price crisis efforts.''
 Blocking the shipment through diplomatic appeals to the Japanese government or through litigation at the W.T.O. could make the United States appear indifferent to hunger and poverty.
 Protesting that the shipments will hurt local farmers could be difficult because the United States is already one of the world's largest donors of free food to poor countries. President Bush is trying to shift part of these donations to cash instead for the purchase of food from local farmers, but American farm and shipping lobbyists have urged Congress to prevent such a shift.
 Under world trading rules, the United States could have tried to block the re-export of rice that had already been imported from the United States. Almost two-thirds of the imported rice in Japanese government warehouses came from the United States.
 ''We recognize these are extraordinary times,'' said an American official. ''We don't have a problem with using it for humanitarian purposes.'' The official agreed to speak only if his name was not used, because of the delicate nature of the issue.
 Bob Cummings, the senior vice president of the USA Rice Federation, a trade association, said American producers wanted to see if Japan would donate any rice from its reserves of rice grown in Japan. ''We would be very concerned if Japan donated only imported rice,'' Mr. Cummings said.
 Mr. Kajishima said that no rice grown in Japan would be sold or donated because this rice was needed for Japan's own domestic reserves.
 Consumers in many African countries have developed a taste for imported bread and other food that has left these countries dependent on costly imports when food aid is halted, said Supachai Panitchpakdi, a former director general of the World Trade Organization who is now the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
 He declined to comment on the details of the Japanese initiative.
 A draft text for the slow-moving Doha Round of global trade talks would ban countries from exporting free food if it displaced commercial purchases. 
 Selling the imported rice instead of donating it would address the food aid issue, and might comply with the letter of Japan's pledges to the W.T.O. 
 South Korea and Taiwan have both accepted deals under W.T.O. auspices that require them to allow some rice imports and explicitly bar them from re-exporting the rice. But the text of Japan's agreement to allow minimum access to imported rice does not mention the prohibition on re-exports.
 Lawyers at the W.T.O.'s headquarters have been arguing strenuously this week over whether Japan can re-export rice, and have not come to a consensus. The W.T.O. declined to comment on the Japanese plan.

HEADLINE: 74 City Schools Told to Expect 5% Budget Cut

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN; Robert Gebeloff and Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The city's Department of Education released a list on Thursday of 74 schools, including its most prestigious high schools, that are to have their budgets for next year cut by more than 5 percent.
 Almost all the schools on the list are high schools and middle schools. They range from Stuyvesant High School (cut by $955,135, or 5.32 percent) and the Bronx High School of Science ($825,448, or 5.34 percent), to P.S. 5, the Huguenot School, an elementary school on Staten Island ($110,026, or 5.39 percent), to the Salk School of Science ($133,762, or 5.25 percent), a Manhattan middle school that is popular among middle-class parents.
 More than two-thirds of the schools on the list are among the newest small schools that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has created as a centerpiece of his plan to overhaul the system. In fact, many are so new that they will not open until September. 
 At a briefing for principals on Thursday, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein called the mayor's education budget, which includes $428 million less for the system than had been planned, ''prudent'' and ''sensible'' in tough economic times. But he blamed Albany for the harshest cuts to individual schools, saying that if the state loosened its restrictions on $63 million in new state aid that must be spent on the poorest-performing and poorest schools, he could reduce school budgets uniformly, by 1.4 percent. He described that as ''the most equitable way,'' adding, ''With your help I hope we'll get the flexibility we need.'' 
 Mr. Klein's focus on Albany seemed to be an effort to channel the anger of middle-class parents against the state. But it backfired on Thursday as parents directed their ire at the mayor and his chancellor instead.
 The principals and assistant principals who attended the briefing, at the High School of Fashion Industries on West 24th Street in Manhattan, were greeted by two dozen parents and union leaders, chanting, ''Yo, yo, Klein, don't cut a dime.''
 William H. McDonald, a Queens parent leader, said, ''The state's not to blame; it's the mayor,'' adding of parents: ''I don't know how much angrier they can get. He shouldn't be balancing the budget on the backs of these kids.'' 
 The $63 million is part of more than $640 million in new state aid stemming from a 1993 lawsuit by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a coalition of advocates, seeking more state money for city schools. As part of an agreement between the city and the state, as much as $385 million of the new money was to go to schools labeled by the state as failing or considered high-need because of poverty and other factors, like the numbers of students receiving special education services.
 At the briefing, Mr. Klein said he had already corrected the injustices of the past by introducing a new school financing system that apportions money based on similar factors.
 ''When people say our high-needs schools are being underfunded, they don't understand that last year we took a huge step toward solving that problem,'' Mr. Klein said.
 At a news conference on Thursday, Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker, called the chancellor's comments about Albany's responsibility for the largest cuts a ''smoke screen,'' saying: ''The chancellor's cuts are for one reason and one reason alone, and that is the mayor's proposed budget contains cuts. Period.''
 The list of schools hardest hit includes those that are so high-performing or have so few high-need students that they are not eligible for certain pots of the new state money. It also includes new schools that the city considers ineligible because there is too little information to classify them as high-need or failing. 
 City schools officials said that in addition to the 74 hardest-hit schools, more than 400 others would face budget cuts of more than 3 percent if the state does not relax its rules.
 Helaine Doran, deputy director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, pointed out that much of the new state money was not restricted to low- and poor-performing schools, saying, ''We brought home the bacon and we got the money.'' She called it ''absolutely outrageous'' for the city to ''jeopardize the particular piece of money'' intended to benefit the neediest students. 
 At Stuyvesant, a recent newsletter from the parents' association noted that in anticipation of budget cuts, the school's principal, Stanley Teitel, was planning to limit students to seven classes during the fall term. That prospect has caused outrage among parents at what is arguably the city's most elite school, because it could diminish ambitious students' transcripts and, by extension, their appeal to college admissions officers.
 Paola de Kock, co-president of the Stuyvesant parents' association, faulted the chancellor and mayor for putting parents at schools like Stuyvesant in a bind.
 ''What parent is really going to want to say, 'Oh, we really need all this money, and the other schools, they don't deserve it, or we don't care'?'' she said. ''That's what I think is a cynical ploy.''
 ''I don't think the chancellor's blame-shifting is going to work because it's hard to sell an increase in state aid as 'forcing' budget cuts,'' she added. ''It is making us angry with the chancellor.''
 Stewart Weiss, a parent leader at the selective Townsend Harris High School in Queens, said that budget cuts at the school, which are expected to be just under 5 percent, would be ''devastating.'' He said the principal would most likely cut after-school extracurricular activities.
 ''This is a school where all of the kids are under a lot of pressure, and they work extremely hard,'' he said. ''What keeps them going is the sense of community they get from all of the other things, like putting on concerts and plays. When you walk into that building after school hours, it's buzzing with kids.''
 But Dr. Weiss did not blame Albany.
 ''I think that Mayor Bloomberg is playing a political game with us,'' he said. 
 Jon Roberts, co-president of the parents' association at Bronx Science, said of the cuts, ''Our school is being destroyed.''
 He said that he was worried that the school would have to cut Advanced Placement courses and other special offerings, and that he was angry with both the city and the state. Of Mr. Bloomberg, he added, ''He can increase the funding to education in terms of making education a higher priority.''

HEADLINE: Can We Find a New Way to Get Home?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Stranded in Suburbia'' (column, May 19):
 Paul Krugman is correct that Americans are ''stranded in suburbia,'' wedded to gasoline and greenhouse-gas emissions.
 But the challenges of abandoning the suburbs would be huge. For many Americans, home ownership represents independence and demonstrates maturity. It is, after all, the American Dream. 
 In addition, the housing market supports much of the American economy, and many Americans' most significant savings are in home equity. 
 The current housing downturn would pale in comparison with the bloodletting that would occur as the suburbs became obsolete.
 To move away from our energy-guzzling suburban model, then, we Americans will have to reorganize not just our infrastructure, but also our values and our economy. We had better get started.
 Stephen Serene Washington, May 20, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Germany worked hard to become the positive example Paul Krugman describes. Our study, to be published by the Brookings Institution, finds that Germany achieved its standing through deliberate policy choices. 
 After World War II, Germany rebuilt its cities and accommodated the automobile by abandoning trolley lines, widening urban roads and building automobile parking garages in downtowns.
 Since the late 1960s, policy makers have reversed this trend. Today German transport and land use policies are geared toward multimodal transportation by providing infrastructure, services and safety for walking, cycling and transit, and by making car use more expensive and less convenient. 
 In Germany, it is precisely the combination of transportation options for alternative modes and restrictions on automobiles that have made more sustainable travel behavior politically feasible and publicly acceptable. 
 The United States can learn from Germany how to successfully promote alternative modes of transport in a country that loves its automobiles.
 Ralph Buehler, John Pucher Uwe Kunert Berlin, May 20, 2008
 The writers are, respectively, an assistant professor of urban planning at Virginia Tech, a professor of planning and public policy at Rutgers University, and a senior researcher at the German Institute of Economic Research.
 To the Editor:
 I disagree with Paul Krugman's analysis, for two reasons. 
 First, Europe has a much greater population density than the United States, so it's more cost-effective for European countries to build and maintain public transportation. 
 Second, the coming alternative-energy-powered cars will change everything, allowing widely used private transport to be cost-effective once again.
 James W. Voelz Des Peres, Mo., May 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right. More Americans are being ''stranded in suburbia'' by the rising price of gas. The result is that housing prices in far suburbs are declining much more severely than in central cities.
 As a recent report from CEOs for Cities shows, the same price declines are occurring in metropolitan areas without strong central cities. This ought to tell us something.
 High gas prices, while painful, give us an opportunity to accelerate the changes we will have to make if we are to confront global warming. Those changes begin with more density, more local shopping and more transportation options.
 Technological fixes won't solve the problem. Individual sacrifices won't either. We must change the way we live on the land. 
 The good news is that the market for cities is stronger than it has been in half a century, and cities that get this right will be rewarded economically and environmentally.
 Carol Coletta President and Chief Executive CEOs for Cities Chicago, May 20, 2008
 To the Editor:
 During an excursion through Europe last year, I was impressed by the lack of cars in big cities and the easy way I could get around without having to use an automobile. Some technology pioneered in America, like trolleys, was seen in more updated forms in cities across Europe. 
 Yet no public transportation system I've seen is as futuristic as the above-ground monorail system in Bangkok. Even though the world's first above-ground rail system was installed in New York, America's public transportation systems now seem stuck in the past. The rest of the world seems years ahead. 
 Most Americans believe that cities like New York have some of the best examples of public transportation, but we are really falling behind the rest of the world, and it is time to start making changes.
 Dan Palevski Ossining, N.Y., May 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman notes that extensive reliance on commuting by rail and bus in Germany allows residents to avoid using their cars for commuting to work in an era of rising oil prices. 
 But what should be stressed is that the European commitment to maintaining a comprehensive train system for commuting and intercity travel far exceeds ours. 
 In Germany alone, the rail system that reaches practically every village receives an annual government subsidy of more than $3 billion. In France, government support for a truly excellent railroad system is also at the multibillion-dollar level. All major railroad systems in Europe and Japan get substantial public financing, typically for infrastructure and train operations. 
 Few cities in the United States have substantial rail networks linking the suburbs to downtown areas. Moving away from our dependence on the automobile for commuting will require a far greater financial commitment to mass transportation on the part of our federal and state governments.
