HEADLINE: How Do You Spell Los Angeles? One Way Is 'P-A-L-M'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THERE are, of course, the palms of glamour lining the crescent roads of Beverly Hills and Pasadena and the everyday working palms bunched in threes and fours along Los Angeles freeway embankments.
Less obvious are the couples: the male and female palms stationed like husband and wife on either side of walkways up to Victorian houses, and the volunteers, the scrappy palms growing for their lives through sidewalk cracks, the gift of birds dropping seeds. Nearly forgotten are the groves of palms with leonine manes in the city's aging oasis cemeteries: old palms mark old ground. 
 In Los Angeles, it is easy to miss the forest for the buildings, but tens of thousands of palms in scores of varieties tower and sway over the houses and apartments. The official tree of Los Angeles may be the coral, with its far-reaching branches and vivid orange flowers, but when film directors want to signal Los Angeles in an establishing shot, 15 out of 10 choose the palm, whether the starburst Phoenix palm straight out of the Bible; the tall Mexican fan palm, coiffed like a poodle, or the languid king palm, with sprays of grapelike seeds in silver and lavender cascading from its capital.
Palms, which seem subject here to craze cycles of 20 years, are so much a part of the Los Angeles identity that nocturnal thieves regularly traffic in palms they uproot and cart away. Amorously creative boyfriends, unaware perhaps that most palms are hermaphroditic, give fronds to girlfriends on dates. The nuns of Mount Saint Mary's College once charted the city's palm-lined avenues on a map, laid the pattern over the bars of a musical score and played it. Planned in the late 19th century as a garden city that would not perpetuate the ills of industrialized cities, Anglo Los Angeles was founded on the notion of healthful, resort-style living. But just as Angelenos had to invent California architecture, they also had to invent its garden.
Southern California has few native plants, and in the early decades of the century, nurseries did a land-office business importing specimens. Los Angeles's arid climate and imported water produced an Edenic wonderland: the botany of the world imploded here, as though the English garden finally found Italian weather. Never mind that pines and cypresses were planted next to each other, creating a landscape of mixed Alpine and Mediterranean messages. Angelenos collected voraciously; the plants grew furiously. The new greenery proved the urban binder for neighborhoods abounding in mixed, sometimes contradictory architectural fantasies.
Except for the Washingtonia filifera, a palm found in canyon oases near Palm Springs (hence the city's name), the trees were unknown to Southern California until, it is said, a Spanish missionary brought one in by mule in the 18th century. Scores of varieties were imported in the early 1900's from all over the world, which helped cast the image of Los Angeles as the exotic place new arrivals wanted to find here. The most popular were and remain the California desert and Mexican fan palms, but there are more exotic palms among these exotics, including the thick-trunked Chilean wine palm, a slow-grower that is rare and expensive. Palms range from 18 inches to 120 feet high, and from $75 to hundreds of dollars per linear trunk foot.
These perennially green creatures with the magnificent headdresses eloquently make the case that God is a designer. The fronds are the fan, feather or fishtail type, but with many variations. The folded fronds of the splendid fan palms cantilever like the attenuated nails of Balinese dancers. The fronds of the king palm have the long spine of an odalisque painted by Ingres. Once the film industry rooted in Hollywood, the mediagenic palm quickly earned supporting roles in film and recently emerged as a star in the David Lynch television series "Wild Palms." David Hockney has found them an irresistible subject. Fronds still litter the streets after bouts of the strong, dry Santa Ana winds that Raymond Chandler set to murder.
The tree that has been exploited in film, television and literature for its image is, in fact, a most civic-minded botanical citizen and can assume the bearing of a flagpole if asked. Between 1930 and 1932, 35,000 palms of state were planted along the major boulevards of Los Angeles for the 10th Olympiad, both to show the world the city's pride of place and to impart a sense of Mediterranean triumph and glory harking back to Biblical days.
The tall trees form natural colonnades, without closing off the Southland's big sky, which strikingly silhouettes their trunk, mane and top. Sometimes, as on Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, shorter palms are planted with taller ones in a dot-dash-dot-dash rhythm.
The palm's only real competition as the decorative tree of choice in Southern California is the eucalyptus, but this shaggy, undisciplined, untamable native of Australia drops messes regularly and has an image problem. And the ubiquitous and hardworking ficus is really a convenience tree with white-bread looks.
During periods when historical styles are popular, the palms perpetuate themes of other times and climes. Many were planted in the eclectic 1920's and in the Art Deco 1930's. In the 1950's, when architecture relaxed and houses eased into the yard with open patios and lanais, palms were much appreciated for their informality, often planted at angles to the ground. Thickly grouped, they filter light like trellises and, raked by breezes, they rustle sensuously. Modernists sculptured the landscape with their radial, angular geometries. And palms had personality, as though Carmen Miranda, like Daphne, had metamorphosed into a tree after a come-hither chase.
In the post-modernist 80's, the tree was avidly specified by architects looking for a quick way to evoke California sun and fun. Thousands of "style" palms were planted when they were all the nostalgic and camp rage. In a studious exception to this image-binging decade, Campbell & Campbell, a Santa Monica landscape design firm, planted a species collection at the Beverly Hills Civic Center, using them in appropriate ways: pigmy date palms, for example, were planted in front of the police station, for security and visibility.
But in the century since the city's first land booms, Los Angeles has indeed become the metropolis its shameless boosters predicted. Growth has tested the garden city concept, putting the Los Angeles landscape under stress. When the Los Angeles County Museum outgrew its three pavilions in its mid-Wilshire park a decade ago, the new addition hard by the sidewalk typified the city's urbanization. Palms were planted along the sidewalk, forming an exotic colonnade and complementing a facade often likened to a de Mille movie set. The huge new Convention Center downtown is arrayed with a phalanx of palms planted three deep, at a diagonal, another use of the palm as civic symbol, life-style emblem and definer of the street and plaza. Orange groves vanished from the city years ago, but the palm is a survivor. Palms may have looks, manners and breeding, but because of their versatility, low maintenance and drought resistance, they are a panacea tree. With its succinct footprint and high, out-of-the-way canopy, the palm is brilliantly economical. Its omnidirectional fibrous root system does not lift up sidewalks and foundations as central root systems do.
If Los Angeles is more city than garden now, its image as a tree-planting, lawn-mowing place remains tenacious, and the palm thrives even in today's reduced circumstances. The easy-going palm more than ever lends itself to the new Los Angeles. The palm is friendly to buildings, offering decoration to facades that have none and casting evocative shadows on blank walls. Adaptable, photogenic and civic-minded, the palm has weathered changes in Los Angeles's style and civic needs, emerging as a plant for all seasons.
And it is a tree not easily exhausted. The more dots and dashes on the skyline, the more unified this dispersed city looks, and the more "L.A." Los Angeles becomes.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Whitman and Florio on Plans and Promises

BYLINE: By Jon Nordheimer

 BODY:

Candidate: Christine Todd Whitman
Producer: The Murphy Pintak Gautier Agency, Washington
Visual: As Mrs. Whitman talks directly to viewers about trimming waste in Government, pairs of scissors appear on the screen against the phrases "$1.2 Billion in Waste" and "Sell Florio's Helicopter."
 The Script: I want to cut your state income taxes by 30 percent over three years. To pay for it I have to cut Jim Florio's spending. Here's how. Trenton wants to spend $21 billion in the next year and one-half. As Governor I'll cut out the $1.2 billion in mismanagement and waste that you know and I know is in there. Like Jim Florio's $4 million state helicopter. I'll sell it. I'll take all the money I save and use it to cut taxes. And Jim Florio? His only plan is to attack me. Come on, Governor, what's your plan? 

Analysis: Trying to get political mileage out of the state helicopter used by the Governor's office is getting to be a standard political wheeze around Trenton. It's a very odd choice by Mrs. Whitman as a symbol of Government waste since it was acquired during the term of Mr. Florio's Republican predecessor, Tom Kean, who frequently used the chopper to commute to the capital from his Essex County home, having spurned the official Governor's residence. Most of the notoriety associated with the Sikorsky fell to former Attorney General Cary Edwards who was roundly criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike for what was described as flying around the state on personal business. Savings made by scrapping the chopper would be a hiccup against the hurricane of the $1.2 billion budget cut she has promised, and she has not come up with many more specifics. Moreover, her description of a state budget bloated with waste must burn the ears of Republican legislators who with veto-proof majorities in both chambers passed the hated spending package. As for her charge that Mr. Florio has been silent on fiscal matters, he came forth with an economic plan Wednesday; its focus was business and job development, not the state budget. The plan was immediately, and inevitably, attacked by a Whitman spokesman as offering no new ideas and sidestepping the governing issue.
 
Candidate: Jim Florio
Producer: Grunwald, Eskew, Donilon, Washington
Visual: This is a fast-paced 30-second presentation offering a parade of newspaper clippings to support the claims made by the voiceover. A frozen frame of Mrs. Whitman, taken from her tax cut ad aired last week, catches her with eyes gleaming and mouth open, presented like a startled deer caught in the headlights of truth.
The Script: Mrs. Whitman is shown making her tax-cut promise before a man's voice cuts her off. "Whitman uses a loophole to pay $47 in property taxes on 50 acres. She was fined for not paying her taxes on illegal aliens. She just called tax cuts 'cynical'. Now Whitman makes up an election-eve tax cut with no specifics on how she'll pay for it. Unbelievable! Whitman said it best this February: (the voice of a woman takes over) It insults the intelligence of New Jerseyans to dangle election-year handouts before the voters.(The voice of a man returns in stern final judgment). You got that right, Christie.
Analysis: This is Democratic hardball response to Mrs. Whitman's measured, slow-pitch game where she serves up issues like the helicopter. It runs the risk of sounding nasty but sticks with the facts on the main points, though it fudges on some lesser elements. Mrs. Whitman wasn't so much "fined" as she volunteered to pay the penality for employing an illegal alien. And the tax provision allowing undeveloped real estate to be claimed as farm land was in fact written into state law to preserve open space and is widely used; to describe it as a "loophole" is stacking the deck against Mrs. Whitman. Finally, to say "she just called tax cuts cynical" is somewhat misleading when her comment was made four months ago. What Mr. Florio's ad doesn't say is that he was campaigning hard to jump aboard a Republican tax cut initiative this spring before they pulled it away from him. Don Nordheimer

AAMES FINANCIAL SHARES DROP AFTER EARNINGS FORECAST

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The Aames Financial Corporation said yesterday that it expected first-quarter results to slip, and company shares fell $2.625, to $8.375, in Nasdaq trading, a 23.9 percent drop. Aames Financial, of Los Angeles, said it anticipated first-quarter net income between 16 cents and 18 cents a share, less than the earnings of about 23 cents analysts had estimated. The company said earnings were hurt by a drop in the average loan size, though the number of loans originated was only slightly less than last year's. It attributed the drop primarily to the California recession.

HEADLINE: San Diego Issue's Top Yield at 5.40%

 BODY:
A $250 million bond offering by the San Diego Public Facilities Financing Authority through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley was initially priced yesterday to yield a maximum 5.40 percent for a bond due in 2018.
For purposes of comparison, the taxable bond equivalent yield for an investor in a 31 percent tax bracket would be about 7.83 percent. 
 Serial bonds with short maturities were priced to yield from 2.80 percent in 1994 to 3.85 percent in 1998, 4.55 percent in 2003 and 5.15 percent in 2010. The taxable bonds would run from about 4.06 percent in 1994 to 7.46 percent in 2010.
The financing also includes two other long-term maturities, priced to yield about 5.184 percent in 2013 and 5.35 percent in 2023.
Underwriters said the financing was rated A-1 by Moody's and A- by S.& P., except for bonds due in 1997 through 2013, which are insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation and rated triple-A by Moody's and S.& P.

2 Executives To Leave Y.& R.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Two well-known agency media executives said yesterday that they would leave Young & Rubicam New York to form their own media buying service.
Paul Isacsson, 57, executive vice president and media director, and Gerri Donini, 46, executive vice president in charge of the agency's national television, will open IDM International in New York, specializing in buying commercial time in electronic media. At the new company, which is without clients or other employees, Mr. Isacsson will be chairman and Ms. Donini will be president. 
 "We hope we can compete favorably in the marketplace," said Mr. Isacsson, who attributed his and Ms. Donini's desire to strike out on their own to the growing interest among advertisers in hiring independent media services companies for reasons of efficiency and economy.
Richard McGowan, a Y.& R. spokesman, said that in the meantime, the planning and buying operations would report directly to Frank Anfield, the office's president and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hits a Nerve on Race

 BODY:
Bill Clinton struck a nerve when he said that Mayor David Dinkins of New York had a tough re-election fight partly because Mr. Dinkins is black and his Republican challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, is white.
Mr. Clinton's remarks have generated lots of sound and fury, so it's important to look at what the poll-takers have found. Their numbers show that race matters, and matters a lot, in elections. 
 Mr. Clinton made his remarks during a Dinkins fund-raiser this week in Manhattan. Musing about why the city's first black Mayor was in a close contest with Mr. Giuliani, even though New York Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 5 to 1, the President turned to the Mayor's skin color as a possible explanation.
"This is not as simple as overt racism," Mr. Clinton said. "That is not anything I would charge to anybody who doesn't vote for David Dinkins or Bill Clinton or anybody else. It's not that simple. It's this deep-seated reluctance we have, against all our better judgment, to reach out across these lines."
Bill Clinton is capable of using the volatile issue of race for tactical advantage, as in his calculated showdown with the rap singer Sister Souljah in 1992. He manages to exploit it for partisan gain, but without descending into the poisonous code words that dominated political discourse in the Reagan-Bush years.
In this case, Mr. Clinton's remarks were meant to help a candidate being hurt by his uneven record, as well as by racial considerations. Mr. Dinkins would not have won four years ago without white and Latino support. Mr. Clinton was nudging those who are drifting away to examine their motives.
Partisan intentions aside, the President has a point: Race plays a pervasive role in electoral politics, not just in New York but everywhere. There is strong documentation that a substantial fraction of white voters will cross party lines rather than vote for a black candidate of their own party.
A memo two years ago from Larry Hugick of the Gallup Organization examined nine general elections where black Democrats faced white Republicans. In every case, the black Democrat's lead shrank between the final poll and Election Day -- in elections for mayor, governor and the Senate, in the North, South, East and West.
Victories that the polls had predicted as routs were actually squeakers. Some black Democrats who had polled as winners actually lost.
The Gallup memo says: "The best explanation for why these polls so consistently overstate the black candidates' standing is that biracial general elections create a conflict between party and race for a large segment of the electorate. . . . Those who remain undecided in the late polls tend to be white and Democratic. . . . [It] would appear that they solidly end up voting for the white Republican on Election Day."
Republicans, citing the solid black vote for Mr. Dinkins four years ago, point out that the party and racial loyalties of minority voters amount to a built-in disadvantage for their candidates.
So Mr. Clinton's statement that race matters is no less true because he made it with partisan intent. There's no way to create a race-neutral society overnight. But to the extent that such a thing is possible, New Yorkers need to put aside race and elect the next mayor on his merits.

What's SoHo Known For? It May Be Furniture

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
MANHATTAN divides itself again and again into idiosyncratic enclaves. The West 20's are noted for flowers, the West 30's for buttons and fabric, the West 40's for jewelry. And SoHo? It may soon become a furniture district.
Today, three furniture shops or galleries -- Neotu, 1950 and GVG Editions -- opened at new locations in and around SoHo. 
 "SoHo is in the midst of a renaissance of furniture design and home decor," said John Lyle, one of four partners in GVG Editions.
Animals abound at GVG The goat-leg table, shown at near left, has bronze legs and a glass top ($2,600). The white-bronze lamp on the table has a ram's head nestled just beneath the shade ($2,820). The painted sisal rug behind the table, by Michael Stromer, has no animals, but could, since everything in the store can be custom-made.
Vito Giallo, an antiques dealer who used to have a shop on Madison Avenue, has joined GVG., selling 19th-century vases and sterling-silver flatware.
The late 20th century inspires the designs shown at Neotu, which moved from 153 Greene Street to 84 Wooster Street (Spring Street).
The gallery's first show is the bold, boxy, yet highly sensuous furniture of Olivier Gagnere, a designer in Paris. The cushions of his oversize sofa are covered in terra-cotta velvet, and the frame is in a warm turquoise-green velvet ($6,000). There is an armoire covered in pigskin, with wrought-iron handles covered in gold leaf ($7,500).
The furniture at 1950 is rooted in French and American designs of that decade. Jean Royere, Serge Mouille and Charlotte Perriand worked with an economy of form and a simplicity of materials, said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a co-director of the store, which is situated at 440 Lafayette Street (Astor Place).
Jean Prouve, a French industrial architect, designed the desk, at far left, around 1959. The top is white plastic laminate over wood, the drawers are gray-painted metal and the legs are black-painted metal ($8,750).
The floor lamp has a white plastic shade on a steel frame and was designed by an American who is known only by the name Weinberg ($1,850).

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Currents column in The Home Section yesterday, about three new furniture stores in SoHo, omitted the address of one of them, GVG Editions, and the price of a rug on sale there. GVG is at 97 Wooster Street, near Spring Street, and the rug, shown in the photograph, costs $3,200. The report also misspelled the name of the artist who painted the rug. He is Michael Stromar.
