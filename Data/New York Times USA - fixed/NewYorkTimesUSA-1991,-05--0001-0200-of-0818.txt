HEADLINE: Unlikely Union Arises To Press Family Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
An unusual alliance of conservative Republicans and liberal and moderate Democrats is pressing the Federal Government to adopt policies that members say will reverse the decline and breakup of American families.
On the one hand, the coalition includes lawmakers like Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who is one of the more liberal members of Congress, and groups like the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic public policy research organization. 
 On the other are conservatives like Phyllis Schlafly, a staunch opponent of sex education in public schools and a prime force behind the defeat of the Federal equal rights amendment, and the Family Research Council, a group opposing abortion and gay rights.
The coalition is loose, united by similar views on specific issues rather than by a formal organization. Mrs. Schlafly and Ms. Schroeder, for example, have never met to plot strategies.
"Liberals and conservatives in this room would disagee on everything, including the time of day, but not on this issue," Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, recently told a Congressional hearing on financial constraints and the family. "I am convinced that the politics of saving the family will be the politics of the 90's."
In a series of position papers, reports and political remarks, both sides of the coalition agree that strengthening the family is the best way to make progress on a number of domestic ills from drug abuse to poor achievements in education.
"The family is under great cultural and fiscal attack today," said Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia. "Nearly every statistic on family well-being, from teen suicide rates to teen pregnancy, indicates that the family is in a downward spiral. Yet while children are more at risk, parents are pushed by financial pressures to spend less time with their children."
It is improving the financial situation of families that the coalition addresses first, pressing a bill that would raise the income tax deduction for parents with children under the age of 18.
The emphasis on the family is a bit of a rhetorical shift for Democrats. In the past, it was rare for the party, especially the liberal wing, to be linked with calls for strengthening "pro-family, moral values" that the Republican Party has championed in recent decades. Instead, Democrats tended to espouse ideals of individual liberty, privacy and tolerance of diverse ideas and life styles. If they talked at all about helping families, they tended to concentrate on the poor.
But now, Democrats like Ms. Schroeder, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma talk of families as the main engine for teaching moral values to children and of the need for the Government to strengthen families so they can carry out that job.
Referring to the values that have dominated the party since the mid-1960's, Mr. McCurdy said: "It was the agenda of narrow and special interests. You had the formation of women's groups, and organizations like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, and the pro-abortion and anti-abortion debate. The interests got so narrow, and the agenda got dictated by those narrow interests, and we lost sight of the broader principals and objectives."
In an article for the Progressive Policy Institute last fall, William A. Galston explained the shift. "The baby boom generation is aging," he wrote, "and they are starting to have kids in record numbers. With parenting comes a change of perspective and a change of responsibility and second thoughts about a value system oriented toward individual freedom."
In addition, Mr. Galston said, there is a growing body of research documenting the financial and emotional hardship on children arising from divorce.
 
Ripples From Tax Policy
 The current tax relief bill for families, sponsored by Mr. Wolf and 88 other House lawmakers, would raise the personal exemption for each dependent under the age of 18 to $3,500 or $4,000, from the current $2,150. Supporters note that in 1948 the exemption, $600, was 42 percent of the national per capita income but that last year, when the exemption was $2,050, it was only about 11 percent.
If the exemption had been steadily indexed for inflation and growth in real personal income, it would be $7,800 today, C. Eugene Steurle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a public policy research organization, told the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families on April 15.
In addition to simply giving families more money, a higher exemption could send positive side-effects rippling though society, supporters of the bill say. It could lead to a decrease in divorce, they say, because financial stress is a prime factor in the breakup of marriages, and it could permit more parents, generally mothers, to spend more time at home with their children rather than having to work full time.
"By reducing the family's tax burden," Mrs. Schlafly said in support of the bill, "the Federal Government would recognize the value of children and the costs of raising them. Then the choice of having two incomes in a family would become a personal preference, not economic necessity."
But advocates of the bill acknowledge having a difficult time gaining the support of Congressional leaders, probably because of the bill's cost, which some experts put at $8 billion to $12 billion in lost tax revenue annually.
"Increasing the personal exemption is a classic example of a great idea that is running headlong into the practical and immediate Washington constraints, to wit the budget," said a Bush Administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 
Constraints on Divorce
 But the tax change is only one item on the coalition's agenda. Members are also talking about encouraging the states to revise divorce laws to discourage couples with young children from separating.
In his paper for the Progressive Policy Institute, Mr. Galston, who was issues director for Walter F. Mondale's Presidential campaign in 1984, argued for a "braking mechanism in the divorce law." A waiting period of nine months for a divorce to become final "seems enough time to sober people up," he said, "but not too much time to constitute a form of indentured marriage."
And Ms. Schroeder said in an interview: "You need a waiting period in a lot of states before you get married. Where there are children involved, you shouldn't be able to just check out and not even think about it."
An additional brake on divorce, Mr. Galston said, would be to have child support payments automatically deducted from the pay check of the non-custodial parent. Such a policy, which he said the Federal Government should oversee, would make divorce less financially attractive to a parent who might otherwise plan to leave his family and then ignore child support payments.

HEADLINE: United Technologies' Bumpy Ride

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
These should be heady days for the United Technologies Corporation.
Last week, the Air Force chose an engine made by its Pratt & Whitney division to power a new fighter plane. Three weeks ago, the Army tapped the company's Sikorsky division to help build a new light helicopter. And just yesterday, Malaysian Airlines said it had selected Pratt & Whitney engines to go on the airline's new Boeing 747 wide-body jets. That order could be worth as much as $266 million. 
 The three contracts, good for more than $20 billion, and stretching well beyond the year 2000, are a badly needed tonic for a company battered by the recession. But United Technologies executives at the company's headquarters in Hartford are relatively mute and sober. For one thing, the work from the contracts at Pratt & Whitney, the company's largest unit, and Sikorsky will not even begin for several years.
And in the meantime, the giant producer of jet engines, air-conditioning equipment, helicopters, elevators and automotive parts, is enduring one of its toughest periods ever.
The company enjoyed steady growth in the late 80's, fueled by its diversified business strategy. But cuts in military spending, coupled with the downturn in the automotive industry and slackened demand for commercial airline parts, have thrown the company painfully off track.
To dampen the blow, United Technologies has stepped up companywide cost-cutting measures. Pratt & Whitney has laid off 1,500 workers since January, about 3.5 percent of its work force. Capital expenditures, which have risen steadily in the last few years, are now being re-examined with an eye toward delaying some projects. The company has also imposed a three-month delay in merit raises for United Technologies' tens of thousands of salaried employees. The effects of the downturn became clear two weeks ago, when United Technologies reported first-quarter earnings of $40.2 million, a drop of 70 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
At the same time, the company's stock, which traded in the low 60's last spring, has also slipped. Shares closed at $46 yesterday, up 25 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Robert F. Daniell, the company's straight-talking chairman and chief executive, conceded that it was the first time that the company's three core businesses -- supplying parts to the aerospace, building and automotive industries -- "simultaneously have been at the bottom of their industry cycles."
And even Mr. Daniell is not betting on a rebound any time soon. "We are not running our businesses on the assumption that the recession is nearing an end," he said. "The first half will be down. As far as the second half, it depends on how quickly things recover. And we haven't seen many signs of improvement in housing starts, in large building construction or in other areas."
 
Eroding Airline Ridership
 Much of the quarterly decline came from the downturn in the market for spare airline engine parts, normally a highly lucrative business. But eroding airline ridership has led to canceled flights. That translates into lower airline profits and lower spending on spare parts.
Still, many analysts see the company's problems as merely short-term ones tied directly to a sour economy. These analysts contend that United Technologies has worked diligently to shave operating costs and to bolster its dominant positions in many industries. Thus, they say, the company will vigorously rebound when the economy improves.
"Their sales of spare parts are down 25 percent and that's consistent with what's going on with other companies that sell spare parts," said Judith L. Bollinger, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But that's not a surprise because air traffic is weak. When the economy recovers, airline ridership will recover and spare parts will recover."
United Technologies certainly does have many things working in its favor. For one, its main divisions have names that are among the most venerable in their industries. More important, most are in strong positions to take advantage of a recovery.
Pratt & Whitney, for example, is the nation's second-largest jet engine builder, behind the General Electric Company. Although Pratt has seen strong growth in its commercial jet business, that success has been tempered by tough times for its military business. And while the company has a large backlog of orders for commercial jet engines, those orders are spread over the coming decade and cannot compensate for the immediate Pentagon budget cuts.
But Pratt & Whitney may be in line for more new business. Analysts contend that the company's engines so dominate new airline orders, that many customers will opt for Pratt rather than having to adopt the new maintenance procedures that would come with the products of another manufacturer.
The Carrier Corporation, the United Technologies division that makes heating and refrigeration systems for homes and industry, has been hurt by the sharp decline in housing starts.
In fact, profits at the company's building systems division, which consists of Carrier and the Otis Elevator Company, the world's largest elevator manufacturer, fell by two-thirds in the first quarter, primarily because of the drop in housing starts.
Mr. Daniell said that his strategy for Carrier was to follow the growth of Otis, which has a vast global reach and a dominant market position in nearly every country in which it operates.
"It is inexcusable for Carrier not to be pre-eminent, when you consider the technical ability that exists with this company," Mr. Daniell said. "We have a long way to go to have Carrier attain the international infrastructure that Otis has. With that international infrastructure, you're not quite as concerned about the building starts in North America being back to the 1982 level."
Carrier's global growth will be achieved, he said, by a series of small acquisitions and partnerships "in every country you can think of."
 
Expansion Into Eastern Europe
 Analysts agree that Otis will benefit from expansion into Eastern Europe and that Carrier will expand its sales as it begins obtaining a foothold outside of North America.
The company's automotive division makes automobile products ranging from electrical systems and motors for power windows to the wiring harnesses in cars and switching equipment used to power windshield wipers. The big drop in American car sales has caused losses in that division. The prospects of continued sluggish sales by auto makers will mean even deeper deficits than the the $5 million loss United Technologies reported for its industrial segment in the first quarter.
Despite those problems, many analyts say that United Technologies is in a relatively strong competitive position.
"I feel positive about the company's prospects," said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc. "This is a painful period for them, but it's merely short term. They're doing precisely what they should be doing: You have to cut costs and grin and bear the current hard times and keep the research and development going."
Mr. Daniell, while clearly happy about winning two major long-term contracts, remains cautious.
"Airline executives have told me that ridership has increased, but that hasn't filtered down to us yet," he said.
"I am not optimistic that there is going to be a quick end to this recession. I think it's going to be slow, steady progress for the economy as opposed to anything more dramatic. And I expect the same for our company."

HEADLINE: 2 Health Plans With Payments Tied to Income

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
In Germany and Japan, employers and employees contribute to health care, but in a radically different system that holds down society's total costs and treats workers more equally, guaranteeing insurance coverage for all with payment levels linked to incomes.
The German system developed over decades, while Japan adopted its health care system after World War II, modeling it on the German program. 
 A young German, starting his first job, enrolls in one of the nation's "sickness funds" and stays in that fund all his life, no matter how many times he changes employers. During his working years, the employee and his various bosses each pay into the fund a tax of 12.8 percent of the worker's pay. Unlike American health benefits, which companies offer at their discretion, this is mandatory for everyone. And since the tax is a proportion of pay, the burdens are spread more equitably, with high-income workers paying more, low income workers less. The tax revenue also helps cover the health care costs of retirees, who remain enrolled.
In Japan, large companies operate their own insurance funds, but the fee schedules are set by a central authority for all workers, regardless of which fund insures them.
In both nations, government plays an aggressive role in keeping down overall medical spending. In Germany, the Parliament places ceilings on total outlays. In Japan, on the other hand, there are fixed fees, applied nationwide, for a hospital visit, drugs or hospital care, but no limits on total spending.
A German worker can choose his doctors and hospitals, but the fees they charge have been negotiated with the funds and are subject to various federal guidelines. Germans go to doctors twice as often as Americans and the doctors charge for each visit, says John K. Iglehart, editor of Health Affairs, a policy journal, who has studied the German system. But if all the fees threaten to exceed a fund's annual budget for office visits, then the doctors are reimbursed proportionately less as they bill more.
Germany spent 8 percent of its national income on health in 1989, the same share as in 1975, while Japan spent 7 percent of its income on health in 1989, a slight increase over the 1970's. In contrast, American health spending climbed from 8 percent of the gross national product in 1975 to 12 percent in 1989.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Sharply Higher

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Interest rates plunged yesterday as prices of Treasury and other fixed-income securities soared in response to two moves by the Federal Reserve to reduce borrowing costs. The first was to cut the discount rate, which the Fed charges member commercial banks, to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent.
The Fed's second and more important action was to flood the banking system with $3 billion of reserves. This caused the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans, to drop to 5 3/4 percent from 6 percent. The funds rate is considered the basic cost of credit because most other interest rates are scaled upward from it. The rate is so termed because it is the interest rate most easily controlled by the Federal Reserve. 
 The discount rate has become more symbolic in recent years because commercial banks now have access to a much wider variety of sources for capital here and abroad.
One measure of the credit market's response was the price of the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in 2021.
 
Bouts of Profit Taking
 After overcoming several bouts of profit taking, late dealings found the long bonds offered at 96 20/32, up 16/ 32, or a half-point, which is equivalent to $5 for each $1,000 of face value. As a result, the long bond's yield sank to 8.17 percent, from 8.22 the day before. The 7 3/4 percent long notes of 2001 jumped 10/32, to 98 9/32, as the yield dropped to 8 percent, from 8.06 percent the day before. The shorter note maturities posted smaller gains.
Some Treasury securities dealers said the market's somewhat cautious reaction to the Fed's moves was not surprising. On Feb. 1, the last time the Fed simultaneously lowered the discount and funds rate, the moves did not set off a wave of interest rate reductions, which always benefits holders of existing fixed-income securities.
Then as now, commercial or other banks contended they had to regain their financial health before cutting loan rates, citing heavy loan losses.
"Although there was plenty of dismal economic data to warrant action by the Fed, it still came as something of a surprise," said Jeremy J. Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "For one thing, the Fed's Open Market Committee normally decides changes in the funds rate, which is far, far more important than the largely symbolic discount rate, as well as monetary policy generally. But the policy-setting Open Market Committee doesn't meet again until May 14.
"We think the Fed's board of governors, which controls the discount rate, responded to pressure from the White House and Congress to do something to revive the economy."
 
Poor Economic News
 Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa America Securities Inc., agreed that the Fed's action was motivated by the steady flow of poor economic news. As for the Fed's timing, Mr. Moran said "it was undoubtedly influenced by the meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations that met last Sunday."
At the Washington meeting, the United States pleaded for lower interest rates worldwide to stimulate economic growth.
As for the Fed's decision to add reserves to the banking system indirectly through customers, Mr. Moran said that "if the Federal Reserve System added the reserves, the amount involved would have probably led the credit market to believe it wanted to knock the funds rate down by a half- point and not a more limited reduction."
Although the Fed never discloses the dollar amounts involved when it engages in systemwide operations to either add or drain reserves from the banking system, the sums are believed to be far greater than the $3 billion injection of funds. Even so, when the Fed adds reserves by buying Treasury securities from dealers for brief periods "on behalf of customers," usually foreign central banks, it normally involves much less than $3 billion.
As expected, Treasury bill rates, which are the most sensitive to any change in the funds rate, responded immediately with soaring prices and plunging discount rates. After some late profit taking, the 90-day bill rate dropped 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.53 percent; six-month bills lost 11 basis points, to 5.57 percent, and the one-year bills also fell 11 basis points, to 5.71 percent.
The funds rate, meanwhile, closed at 5 15/16 percent after trading at 5 13/16 most of the day. But today is the end of the two-week bank statement period, when the funds rate normally firms. Ironically, the Fed had struggled to push up the funds rate to 6 percent in recent weeks with little outward success.

HEADLINE: Americans Teaching English in Czechoslovakia Learn About Themselves

 BODY:
Missy Darwin teaches English at a parachuting club in Prague. She never trained to be a teacher and has no textbooks. For St. Patrick's Day, she asked students to wear green and bring whatever green food they could find in the drab wintertime stalls of Czechoslovakia's markets.
"I sort of improvised from there," said Ms. Darwin, a former legislative aide to Senator David Pryor of Arkansas. "Every day is an adventure. My students are very enthusiastic." 
 As a volunteer for Education for Democracy/U.S.A., Ms. Darwin is getting by in much the same way as the grass-roots program that sent her -- with a mixture of ingenuity, persistence and a desire to help Czechoslovakia reinvent itself after four decades of Communist rule.
Founded in Mobile, Ala., in the heady months after Czechoslovakia's "velvet revolution" in 1989, Education for Democracy has sent more than 600 Americans to Czechoslovakia to teach English in schools, factories, government agencies and, as in Ms. Darwin's case, private organizations.
"The Czechoslovaks are looking to the West, especially the United States, for many answers," said Ann Gardner, the organization's founder. "To learn Western know-how they feel they have to learn English."
The program, modeled on one founded by Czechoslovak expatriates in Canada, grew out of Ms. Gardner's friendship with Pavel Demes, a Czechoslovak doctor who in 1987 worked at the medical center at the University of South Alabama, where Ms. Gardner's husband, William, heads the pathology department.
After the revolution, Dr. Demes joined the new Government as director of foreign relations for the Ministry of Education in the Slovak Republic and asked Ms. Gardner if she would organize volunteers in the United States.
Working in the dining room of her Mobile home, Ms. Gardner quickly improvised volunteers and arrangements. "Grass roots is really the appropriate term," she said.
 
The Volunteers Enlist
 The first two volunteers, both from Mobile, left in March 1990, followed the next month by about 40 more, most of them students from universities in Alabama.
Since then, Education for Democracy has had a steady stream of volunteer teachers, ranging in age from 19 to 72 and coming from 37 states. The organization is being run from a two-room office lent by the medical center at the University of South Alabama, and Ms. Gardner has applied for a grant from the United States Information Agency so that she can broaden the program's scope.
Volunteers pay their own air fare to Czechoslovakia and bring their own teaching materials -- newspapers, travel brochures, restaurant menus. Through the Ministry of Education, the Prague and Bratislava offices of Education for Democracy in assign them to schools or businesses.
The volunteers typically hold class about 20 hours a week, teaching beginning and advanced speakers of English. They are paid about 2,000 korunas a month, or $65, slightly below the average for a Czechoslovak worker, and they live with families or in state-owned apartments.
Paula Ross, a television journalist from Pensacola, Fla., who spent four months in Prague last summer, lived with a working mother "in one of those giant Communist concrete complexes that goes on forever."
For many volunteers, living in a foreign culture has been at once adventurous and frustrating. Workaday life is complicated by what Ms. Darwin called "Czech management," a sometimes bewildering and seemingly irrational way of running things.
Corrine Palmer, a real estate agent from Myrtle Beach, S.C., who recently returned after four months in Nizna, a small village near the Polish border, said she was astounded by the Czechoslovak standard of living. "Their lives are very, very hard compared to ours," said Ms. Palmer. "They were not even aware there was such a thing as a clothes dryer."
For other volunteers, this overseas teaching assignment has been a personal revelation. "Before I came here, I was doing the whole yuppie thing," said Christopher Kingery, a lumber salesman in Portland, Ore., before volunteering to teach and then to run the program's office in Bratislava. "My life felt so empty. So here I am. I don't know what we're really going to accomplish in the end, but I know we're going to do something."
In a telephone interview from Bratislava, where she was checking on the program's operations, Ms. Gardner said she hopes to expand the program's focus, supplying not only English teachers but business executives, engineers and other professionals who could help ease Czechoslovakia's transition to a market economy.
Ms. Gardner has recently reached agreement with officials in Poland to begin sending volunteers there in September.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Drop in U.S. Interest Rates Sends the Dollar Tumbling

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A surprise cut in American interest rates sent the dollar tumbling on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices staged a strong advance. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $355.90 an ounce, up $3.80 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $4.15 an ounce, to a late bid of $356.25. 
 The dollar opened on a weak note and then moved sharply lower after the Federal Reserve announced it was cutting the discount rate half a percentage point, to 5 1/2 percent, the lowest level since late 1977, in an effort to pull the economy out of recession.
A cut in the discount rate, which the Fed charges on loans to commercial banks, generally leads to widespread cuts in interest rates, a move that is negative for the dollar because it makes dollar-denominated securities less valuable for investors.
"The timing was somewhat of a surprise," said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at the Refco Group in Chicago. He added that relatively high interest rates in both Japan and Germany had served as a kind of "double whammy," taking the dollar lower.
Another negative factor for the dollar, Mr. Malpede said, is that traders had anticipated a rebound in the American economy, but "so far that recovery has not materialized." Indeed, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders to United States factories for manufactured goods fell 2.8 percent in March, the fifth consecutive monthly drop.
Still, some bullish sentiment continues to surround the dollar. "Everyone's loaded with dollars because they all feel our economy is going to turn first," said John Marchese, chief economist at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. There was no "mass dumping" of the dollar, he said, adding that the currency decline "wasn't that bad" considering the Fed cut was not anticipated.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 137.42 Japanese yen, from 137.83 yen on Friday. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday on Monday. In London, it fell to 136.30 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 136.15 yen, down from 136.50 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7235, from $1.6765. In New York it cost $1.7325 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.6980.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.7067 German marks, down from 1.7510; 1.4410 Swiss francs, down from 1.4730; 5.7760 French francs, down from 5.9100; 1,262.50 Italian lire, down from 1,294.00, and 1.1529 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1533.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.7180 German marks, down from 1.7685; 1.4495 Swiss francs, down from 1.4845; 5.8085 French francs, down from 5.9660; 1.9355 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9920; 1,272.00 Italian lire, down from 1,305.25, and 1.1512 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1534.

HEADLINE: Bush Offers Trade-Pact Concessions

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, facing a critical vote in Congress next month over its authority to negotiate with other countries on trade, will make significant environmental and job-security commitments to accompany a trade pact with Mexico, Administration and Congressional aides said today.
The commitments are intended to sway votes in a battle that has pitted the Administration and proponents of free trade against organized labor, textile interests and others who fear that greater trade with Mexico will result in the loss of jobs and a weakening of environmental and labor standards. 
 The initiatives, to be announced on Wednesday, include programs to be jointly operated with Mexico to curb pollution on the border and strengthen environmental enforcement, the naming of environmentalists for the first time to official trade-advisory bodies and beefed-up efforts to asist workers who may lose their jobs because of imports.
They will be detailed in a letter from President Bush to the chairmen of the House and Senate committees responsible for trade policy -- Lloyd Bentsen of Texas at the Senate Finance Committee, and Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois at the House Ways and Means Committee.
At a meeting with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders called today to discuss international trade, President Bush injected himself energetically into the fight.
"This is a priority, and we are going all out," he said, terming the negotiating authority crucial because of the growing importance of exports to economic growth.
"We need this fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements that will open markets, keep our exports strong, and create jobs, and frankly, sustain our leadership in the world economy," the President said.
 
Making Concessions
 The current debate is part of a process that has marked allpostwar trade agreements. Because the Constitution gives Congress power to "regulate foreign commerce," the President's ability to negotiate trade agreements derives from a delegation of authority from Congress.
But the lawmakers, traditionally sensitive to domestic interests, have always demanded a price for going along in terms of increased safeguards for industry and workers.
This time, the Administration is making concessions in connection with its request for a two-year extension of the "fast-track" procedure, a measure that makes trade agreements non-amendable and subject only to up-or-down votes.
Foreign countries have served notice that they will not negotiate with the United States if what they finally agree to is then subject to Congressional amendment.
Extension of the fast-track authority would permit the Administration to negotiate not only a special accord with Mexico but also a sweeping trade liberalization agreement with 107 countries, known as the Uruguay Round, which has been in the works for five years and could be concluded within 12 months.
Initial reaction to the Administration plan was favorable. "The Administration has demonstrated sensitivity to Congressional concerns," said Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's Trade Subcommittee, adding, "A vote against fast-track extension is now clearly a vote for protectionism."
Kathryn S. Fuller, president of the World Wildlife Fund, one organization expected to sit on the trade advisory panels, said, "If we can play a useful role we will."
She noted that environmentalists and conservationists until now have had practically no impact on trade policy.
One result of the Administration's plan may be to split the environmental lobby. Some groups, like Greenpeace and the Natural Resource Defense Council, have taken a hard line against the fast track.
 
Response to a Letter
 One criticism by Congressional aides who have seen the letter is that while the commitments are in strong language, nothing is said about what Washington would do if Mexico does not live up its promises.
The initiatives are in response to a March 7 letter from Representative Rostenkowski and Senator Bentsen asking for reassurance that the Administration will address issues related to the environment, labor standards and worker displacement in seeking the fast-track extension.
The environmental commitments are the most specific. The letter pledges the two Governments to a comprehensive review of environmental laws to see where they need improvement, promises no weakening of American laws in the process and stresses that the United States will retain the right to limit imports that contain hazardous pesticides or other products harmful to health.
Mexico has acted in recent years to orient policies toward standards set by the United States. The letter, according to those who have seen it, says Mexico is strengthening its enforcement budget and expanding from 6 to 100 the number of enforcement agents. It is also said to point out that Mexico has closed 900 plants for environmental reasons, 70 in the last three weeks.

HEADLINE: State Makes Winning Bid In New York On City Notes

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In an odd twist to the city and state's intertwined fiscal mess, the State of New York submitted a winning bid on $50 million in short-term city notes auctioned yesterday, effectively lending the city money that it needed because the state has failed to give the city aid that it owes.
The city had been forced to sell $1.2 billion worth of notes only because the state, unable to pass a budget, had not paid the city money that would have come to the city under the new state budget. Now the city finds itself paying interest to the state to borrow money it should have already received. 
 "In a way the state is creating a problem and profiting from it," said City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
To add insult to injury, said a spokesman for State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the main reason the state bid on the notes was not to help the city but to take advantage of its worsening credit picture -- caused in part by the state budget delay. Yields on the city's notes exceeded the return on alternatives available to the state.
 
'Paramount Concern'
 "Our first, paramount concern is to maximize the return on our investment," said Bob Hinckley, Mr. Regan's spokesman.
The state's winning bid was for only a fraction of the $1.2 billion in short-term notes the city auctioned yesterday. The auction was suspenseful because the city's rating for revenue notes was lowered by Standard & Poor's on Monday because of the city and state's overlapping problems.
But all the notes sold easily -- with the city getting $3 in bids for each $1 of notes up for sale -- and Mayor David N. Dinkins asked reporters to take note that he was commenting on the sale "with glee."
 
The Cost Is High
 But the cost to the city was high. It paid 6.74 percent in interest at a time when a parallel issue by the State of California was trading to yield 4.60 percent. Selling the notes -- which, unlike bonds, typically mature in months, rather than up to 30 years -- will cost the city a total of $11.9 million that it would not have had to spend if it had received state money on time.
However, the Standard & Poor's downgrading -- which precluded many money market funds from bidding because their rules allow them to bid only on higher-rated notes -- hurt the city less than expected because most interest rates dropped sharply yesterday anyway after the Federal Reserve lowered two of its key interest rates and because the investment banks that un derwrite city bonds decided to buy and hold large blocks of the notes.
One city official recalled a Wall Street adage: "It is better to be lucky than smart."
At 11 A.M., when a deputy city comptroller opened a green metal box in a conference room filled with Wall Street executives at the Municipal Building in lower Manhattan, there were gasps when the state's bid for $100 million in city notes was read.
 
'Good and Sound'
 The state was allowed to buy $50 million at an interest rate of 6.95 percent, or a return of $492,291 when the notes come due at the end of June. The chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, Herbert E. Berman, who observed the auction, joked that perhaps the state should be investigated to see if it manipulated the market in city notes for its own gain.
At a City Hall news conference, Mayor Dinkins praised the state for demonstrating that the city "remains a good and sound investment" and suggested -- in jest, he said -- that the state waive its right to the interest payments.
The state's investment comes from its short-term investment pool, a pool of about $2 billion from state and local tax collections, fees and other funds.
Mr. Hinckley, the State Comptroller's spokesman, said the state decided to buy city notes, which are tax-free, for the pool after discovering that they gave a better return than taxable investments with similar maturities. Treasury bills paid around 5.45 percent, he said, while corporate paper yielded about 6 percent.
In downgrading the city's notes from SP-1 to SP-2, the lowest rate currently held by any notes, Standard & Poor's said it worried that the city would face cash problems if the state failed to adopt a budget as the end of the city's fiscal year approached.
Yesterday, city officials said dire warnings by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo about the possibility of an impasse might have contributed to the downgrading decision.
 
Questioned About Warning
 Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance, said the rating agency sharply questioned city officials about the Governor's warning that the state impasse could continue until July.
Most of the notes were purchased by the underwriters of the city's bonds, who said that they were not pressured by the city to bid but understood that they were expected to do so.
But they pointed out that the interest rates for the issue were so high that they would not lose money.

HEADLINE: Recycling to Expand to Businesses in New York

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
New York City's mandatory recycling program, limited so far to residences, will soon be expanded to include the five boroughs' 200,000 businesses.
The city's goal is the same as it is for residences: to reduce the amount of garbage buried in landfills or burned. 
 Regulations describing the recycling obligations of businesses and private garbage haulers, who collect commercially generated trash, were published yesterday in The City Record. They take effect in 30 days.
 
Two-Year Phase-In Planned
 The program will be phased in over two years. Within six months, businesses must begin separating recyclable materials, including high-grade office paper, corrugated cardboard, metal containers and construction debris. After a year, glass containers, newspapers and magazines must be added to the list, and in 18 months separation of plastic containers must begin.
In the process, some businesses may save money by reducing the trash they pay to dispose of, but big savings are not expected because recycling itself is expensive. Like the participants in the residential program, businesses and private garbage companies can be penalized for failing to carry out their recycling responsibilities.
City officials are hoping mandatory commercial recycling gets better results than its residential counterpart. The two-year-old residential curbside program has suffered from lagging participation in many neighborhoods and high collection costs.
At the moment, budget problems have put the future of the entire curbside collection in doubt. But commercial recycling will go forward because the city's responsibilities are largely in enforcement, not collection.
 
Private Haulers Unhappy
 Few big American cities require businesses to recycle, and it is not clear how many New York City businesses currently recycle. Government and private specialists say the number is relatively small but growing rapidly.
Of 1,000 large Manhattan office buildings, only about 50 have full-scale recycling programs, said Richard Fuller, president of Great Forest Inc., a New York recycling consultant.
Over time, mandatory commercial recycling will prompt "major changes in how waste is handled" in New York City, said Sanitation Commissioner Steven M. Polan. Much more responsibility will fall on private haulers, who collect at least 10,000 tons of commercially generated waste daily, and private concerns known as transfer stations, where trash is taken for separation into recyclable components. Private pickups account for more than 40 percent of all trash collected in the city.
The haulers are not happy about their new burden. They say they will face higher costs at a time when the city is trying to cut their rates. City officials say that if the haulers can show their costs are higher, a rate increase will be considered.
Of even bigger concern is the economics of the recyclables markets. If markets are not vibrant enough to absorb the materials, recycling could become prohibitively expensive. Haulers, transfer stations and businesses may have to pay to get their materials taken away. Material designated recyclable under the regulations cannot be dumped in a landfill, even if there is no market for it.
City officials acknowledge that markets may be a problem and hope that the phase-in period will afford the necessary slack.
 
Delays in Drafting Rules
 The recycling law, approved by the City Council in April 1989, called for the commercial regulations to be completed a year ago, but there have been many delays. The law calls for the regulations to designate recyclable materials that in total constitute at least half of all the trash private haulers collect.
The Sanitation Department collects about 17,000 tons of residential garbage daily. Exactly how much private haulers pick up is unclear, but the department estimate is at least 10,000 tons a day. That is the amount haulers dumped at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island until about two years ago, when the city raised the dumping fee sharply and the haulers took their business to landfills out of the city.
In addition private haulers are collecting 12,000 tons of paper a day for recycling, said Anthony Lomangino, an owner of Allied Sanitation, one of the city's biggest private refuse haulers, and Star Recycling, a big transfer station.
Residential recycling is in place in 29 of the 59 city areas supervised by community boards, or nearly two million of three million households. About 6 percent of residential waste is being recycled, the Sanitation Department says. The department failed to reach its tonnage goal for the second year of the program, mainly because of cost-cutting measures. The recycling law calls for 25 percent recycling by April 1994.
 
Choices for Businesses
 Commercial recycling will differ markedly from residential recycling in how the materials are handled. The Sanitation Department collects garbage generated by households and is also responsible for picking up recyclable material separated by residences. In contrast, businesses hire private haulers to pick up their refuse.
Under the city's recycling law, businesses must decide whether they will do their own separation of recyclables from trash and arrange for its collection or whether they will let their private garbage haulers do the work.
Many smaller businesses, like delicatessens, are expected to rely on haulers to pick up unseparated trash and take it to sorting areas. Multi-tenant office buildings will likely do their own separation.
 
Recycling in Offices Praised
 Dozens of big buildings already have introduced office-paper recycling programs to take advantage of strong markets for such products. Smaller businesses, like greengrocers, routinely separate corrugated cardboard.
Office buildings in New York City that have introduced recycling have generally received good cooperation from tenants and their employees, recycling specialists say. The programs usually involve setting out recycling containers, changing cleaning staff practices and educating employees about what to separate.
At 520 Madison Avenue, a 43-story office building owned and managed by Tishman Speyer Properties, about four tons, or 20 percent, of its paper waste is being recycled a week, said David J. Arena, the building manager. About 300 to 400 deposit cans and bottles are separated and donated every two weeks to We Can, a nonprofit organization that redeems containers collected by the poor.
Of 47 tenants, only one balked when asked to begin separating office paper last summer, Mr. Arena said. That tenant "didn't want their executives to walk four feet to a pail," he said. "In an environmental sense, they were living in the Stone Age."
Mr. Fuller, the consultant who helped set up the 520 Madison Avenue recycling program, said most buildings could reduce disposable trash by 10 to 20 percent. The 520 Madison program cost $10,000 to $15,000 to put in place, Mr. Arena said.

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary Proposes Revamping Pension Laws

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin proposed changing the nation's pension laws today to encourage employers to create retirement programs for about 42 million workers who are currently not covered.
In general, the Administration proposes simplifying the rules and reducing the administrative burden for employers, particularly small businesses. But critics, including groups representing retirees, say the changes would do little to encourage employers to make more generous pension contributions and would mainly benefit highly paid employees who can afford to contribute to tax-deferred retirement saving plans. 
 "They are purporting to increase pension coverage, but they're not," said Karen Ferguson, director of Pension Rights Center, a public interest group in Washington. "What they're doing is increasing the availability of tax-sheltered savings plans. Tax-sheltered savings plans are great for yuppies, but they don't work for most American workers."
Ms. Martin said she was not proposing a specific bill to Congress, but was instead trying to start a dialogue on the basic features of a plan.
The proposals come after recent efforts in Congress to deal with growing concern that 45 percent of all full-time employees in the United States have no pension plan, according to Labor Department statistics.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, made similar proposals last year, and consequently Ms. Martin's overall plan is thought to have a good chance of gaining the bipartisan support needed for enactment.
Business groups generally support the proposals, contending that they would eliminate paperwork that now discourages many small companies from offering retirement programs for workers. But business lobbyists also noted that the biggest obstacle for many employers was the cost.
"Generally speaking, this is a very positive step, but I'm not sure how much change it will create in the marketplace," said John Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council, which represents dozens of trade associations that lobby for small companies. "In the end, the biggest issue is whether a small business has the money."
 
Plan for Small Businesses
 The central proposal is a new, simplified retirement plan for small businesses, which in recent years have accounted for most of the nation's new jobs. The National Federation of Independent Business, a trade association, estimates that as many as three-quarters of all small companies currently provide no retirement benefits for their employees.
Under the Administration plan, small employers would not have to follow complex rules that prevent companies from discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees -- often including the owners -- when they offer a qualified plan, or one that receives favorable tax treatment. Some small companies simply cover the owners with a nonqualified plan, forgoing the tax benefits, but do not offer a qualified plan for everyone.
Another proposal would expand the availability of the retirement savings plans known as 401(k) plans to employees of nonprofit organizations and state and local governments. A third provision would allow employers to transfer money in a retirement plan to an individual retirement account when a worker changes jobs. A fourth measure would let more workers keep accumulated retirement benefits after five years.
 
'Security and Dignity'
 "The goal of this proposal is to add as many individuals to the list of those with pension coverage as we can," Ms. Martin said. "An enlightened and caring society insures that its senior citizens are protected. And the best way to protect them is seeing they have the economic power, the means, the pension coverage, to live out their retirement years with security and dignity."
Ms. Martin said the proposals would not increase the deficit, because measures that are likely to cost the Treasury tax revenues would be offset by not allowing retirees who take lump-sum pension payments to average their tax liability over 5 or 10 years, as they now can. The Labor Department provided no revenue estimates, and some Congressional experts were skeptical of the Administration's assertions.
The new retirement plan for companies with fewer than 100 workers is intended to eliminate as much paperwork as possible. Small employers complain the nondiscrimination requirement entails too much paperwork to make such plans practical.
Under the proposed rule, employers with fewer than 100 workers would be free of the nondiscrimination requirements, as long as the employer contributes 2 percent of each employee's salary to their retirement accounts.
But groups representing retirees said the move would make it too easy for employers to ignore the needs of low-paid workers. "All this does is give a tax break to workers who would be saving for their retirement anyway," said Ms. Ferguson of the Pension Rights Center.
Another key feature in the plan would require the multiemployer pension programs established by trade unions to cover members at different companies to give workers full access to their retirement funds after five years. Under current rules, union members sacrifice their accrued benefits if they take a job outside the union in less than 10 years.

HEADLINE: New Jersey to Add Trains to Midtown

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
Thanks to almost $100 million in new money from the Port Authority, New Jersey plans to start work next year on a long-delayed railroad connection that will give four counties a direct train link with Penn Station in Manhattan.
The project is designed to link N.J. Transit's Morris and Essex Lines with Amtrak's main New York-Philadelphia line where the two cross in a desolate stretch of Kearny near the New Jersey Turnpike, a few miles northeast of Newark. 
 The new system, to be completed in 1995, would allow the Morris and Essex Lines' 14,000 daily passengers from cities and suburbs in Essex, Morris, Union and Somerset Counties to bypass the Hoboken train station and its link, via PATH trains, to lower Manhattan and midtown.
Railroad old-timers say the idea for the link-up, called the Kearny Connection, originated after World War II. Over the years, major preliminary work has been done. Some designs are finished. The Morris and Essex Lines' electrical system was modernized and made compatible with Amtrak's in the early 1980's. And Amtrak and N.J. Transit, which operates the Morris and Essex, have worked out scheduling to accommodate more commuter trains on Amtrak's line.
Despite all this groundwork, construction never started because New Jersey said it lacked money. N.J. Transit says it now has enough -- about $125.5 million in all -- for all necessary work in and around Kearny. The only financing still missing is for a new concourse at Penn Station in New York and escalators linking it to train platforms to handle an anticipated 8,000 extra passengers expected to take the new direct line. But officials say the new concourse-escalator system, expected to cost up to $50 million, is not critical and lack of money for it now will not mean more delay for the Kearny Connection.
"Our preference is to have the new concourse because it will facilitate movement of people, but we can do without it for now," said Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for N.J. Transit.
The money that finally assured construction of the Kearny Connection is coming, indirectly, from the $1 toll increase that took effect April 7 on the Port Authority's tunnels and bridges on the Hudson River. Before Gov. Jim Florio and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo approved the increase, the Port Authority agreed to give each state $200 million over five years for economic development and transportation improvements. The toll increase is expected to generate $117 million in new revenue each year.
Between now and 1994, New Jersey's $200 million share is to be deposited into a state economic development fund. Of the total, $98.5 million in Port Authority money is to be transferred by 1994 to the state's transportation trust fund, which finances improvements to mass transit, highways and bridges.
The Port Authority's infusion into the trust fund will free $98.5 million in state funds committed to other projects to be used, instead, on the Kearny Connection through 1995, said Barbara Richardson, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Transportation Department.
Of the $98.5 million, $71.5 million is earmarked for construction, new tracks and switching equipment, and a storage yard. Another $27 million will be spent upgrading signals on the Amtrak tracks.
In addition, $27 million in state and Federal funds will be spent to increase electrical power on the Amtrak tracks to accommodate the additional trains.
 
A Sense of Relief
 The Port Authority is restricted, through convenants in its bonds, from subsidizing operating railroads, except for the PATH system, which it owns. Richard Kelly, head of the agency's interstate transportation department, said he planned to meet with New Jersey officials this week to review if their use of Port Authority money to free state money for a railroad construction project poses any problems with the bond restrictions.
"I don't anticipate any," Mr. Kelly said.
Commuters in the four counties have agitated for the Kearny Connection for years. And N.J. Transit's vote last week to start construction in 1992 brought a sense of relief and joy.
"It's long overdue," said John Hyde, who represents Summit on the Lackawanna Coalition, a commuter group serving 15 towns on the Morris and Essex Lines.
"It'll be a big improvement, we couldn't be happier," said James Laurie, a retired railroad consultant and Millburn's representative on the coalition. "It'll save anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to Manhattan."
A direct train to Manhattan will make midtown's theaters, stores and other attractions more accessible, and thus more enticing, to residents of the four counties, suburban officials believe. An easier commute to Manhattan will also make communities along the lines more attractive to newcomers.
The Morris and Essex Lines have three parts, vestiges of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. The main one is the Morristown Line, which runs from Hoboken to Newark, through the Oranges, and on to Morristown. The Montclair branch veers off it outside Newark and serves Bloomfield, Glen Ridge and Montclair. And the Gladstone branch veers off the Morristown Line in Summit and serves towns in Union and Somerset Counties, including New Providence, Berkeley Heights, Basking Ridge, Bernardsville and Far Hills.
At least 10 trains will run on the direct line during morning and evening rush hours, said Rick Richmond, N.J. Transit's assistant executive director for engineering and construction. Off-peak service will be similar to current scheduling.
He said officials expected that 3,000 riders who now reach midtown via Hoboken and PATH would switch to the direct trains. In addition, he said, the new line is expected to lure 5,000 new riders who now drive or take buses to Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Weicker, to Block Indian Casino, Seeks Repeal of Charity Gambling

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 30

 BODY:
In senior centers, church basements and high school gymnasiums across the state, nonprofit groups are allowed to go crazy once or twice a year and pretend that old Connecticut is really wild Las Vegas. With play money and small prizes, "Las Vegas nights" are a way to raise money.
But now, hoping to prevent an Indian tribe from using the state's charity-gambling laws as a legal basis to build a casino on its reservation, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. wants to repeal those laws. 
 In a letter sent today to legislative leaders, he asked for emergency legislation repealing nonprofit-gambling statutes that he said had been interpreted by the tribe and the courts in a way that was never intended.
Mr. Weicker has consistently argued that allowing the Indians to open a casino would create pressure for other casinos, and could lead to a host of social problems like compulsive gambling, prostitution and organized crime.
Federal law says that if a state permits gambling, federally recognized Indian tribes within its borders have the right to conduct gambling, too.
Under a court order, Connecticut reached an agreement last year with the 200-member Mashantucket Pequot tribe of Ledyard to permit a profit-making casino that could operate blackjack, poker, roulette and other games at whatever stakes the tribe chose. The state still opposes the plan, but its last appeal was rejected last week by the United States Supreme Court, and the agreement now requires only the approval of the Federal Interior Secretary, Manuel Lujan Jr.
But Connecticut's Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, said he believed that if the Weicker measures were passed and signed within the next two weeks and forwarded to Washington, the agreement could not be approved.
Tribal spokesmen said that trying to change the law now, after ground has already been broken for a multimillion-dollar casino, hotel and restaurant complex that could open as early as this fall, is duplicity of the same stripe that American Indians have endured for centuries.
"Indian people have faced a long and tragic history of broken treaties," Tribal Chairman Richard Hayward said in a statement. "It would be very sad if Connecticut added another chapter to that history. We cannot believe the state would do this to us now."
A lawyer for the tribe, Barry A. Margolin, said he did not believe that Federal law would allow the state to unilaterally change the terms of the compact after the fact. He also contended that Connecticut could not block the tribe's casino plan unless the state was willing to dismantle all its gambling enterprises, including dog tracks, jai alai, and the state lottery -- and thus forgo the hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that those games contribute to the state budget.
But Mr. Weicker, in a news conference, said that no compact was final until it left Mr. Lujan's desk in Washington, and that there was still an opportunity "to protect Connecticut's right to determine its destiny in this critical matter."
He said that if a law were passed by the General Assembly and signed before the period for public comment on the compact expires on May 17, Mr. Lujan would have to consider the state's new public policy.
And regardless of what Federal officials do, changing the law would inevitably throw the question back into the courts, lawyers on both sides said, thus possibly delaying the casino for months, if not years.
But lawmakers, Interior Department officials and tribal spokesmen also said that Mr. Weicker had launched the state onto an uncharted course. Currently five states -- California, Minnesota, Nevada, South Dakota and Nebraska -- have formal compacts with tribes in their borders under the Indian gaming law signed by President Reagan in 1988. Nowhere has a state tried to turn the tables in the middle of the game.
 
'It's Very Curious'
 "It sounds like an overnight change of heart," said Carl Shaw, a spokesman for the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs.
"It's very curious," he added, "that they would only be in opposition to this when the courts have ruled that the tribes can participate in it. I don't know what will happen."
In the legislature, which is already wrestling with a huge tax-revenue shortfall and a statewide recession, some lawmakers said that Mr. Weicker's proposal could face problems. It would deprive nonprofit groups of a proven way of raising money, and also pass up what the tribe promised would be 1,900 or more new jobs -- all in the southeast corner of the state, which has been hard hit by the recession and by cuts in defense spending.
Groton, less than 10 miles from the proposed site of the casino, is home to the state's largest concentration of defense contractors, led by Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics that makes submarines for the Navy.
"I'm caught in a bind," said State Representative Glenn N. Arthur, a Republican who represents Ledyard in the legislature. Mr. Arthur said he was opposed to the casino, but did not want to hurt nonprofit groups and had doubts about whether changing the law now would be constitutional.
 
Potential for Jobs
 The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, noted at a news conference that he had participated in Las Vegas nights himself to raise money for a football team in his town. He said he was not convinced that repealing the charity-gambling laws was desirable.
Because Indians lands are not subject to state taxes, the state would not derive any tax revenues from casino profits.
But the president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southeastern Connecticut, William D. Moore, said the casino would make the Pequots the fourth-largest employer in the county. In just the week since the Supreme Court said it would not hear the state's appeals, Mr. Moore said, he has received calls from four developers who wanted to talk about building hotels.
"There is considerable amount of business support for the casino -- considerable," Mr. Moore said.
At the senior center in the town of Manchester, a Las Vegas night scheduled for May 15 could face cancellation if the charity-gambling laws are repealed. The director, Jeanette Cave, said that while the center did not depend on the occasion for fund-raising, the cancellation would deprive elderly members of "a night of fun" and the chance to win hundreds of dollars in donated prizes.
"We even make the play money ourselves," she said.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE TRIMS LOAN COSTS TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Trying to end the recession, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates today, noting as it acted that the latest data showed the economy to be still quite weak.
In an early-morning announcement, the Federal Reserve said it had lowered the discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks, to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent. A few hours later, the central bank pushed down the important Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other on loans, to 5 3/4 percent from 6 percent. 
 Both rates affect what banks pay for deposits and other funds, and what they can then charge when they lend out this money for mortgages, home equity loans, car loans and the like.
 
Benchmark Rate at 9%
 With their cost of funds lower, banks are now under pressure to reduce their prime lending rate, currently at 9 percent, but no large bank moved immediately. This rate is the benchmark for many commercial and other loans.
The Federal Reserve's move came after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had failed to persuade Germany and the other major industrial nations to lower their interest rates to help give the American economy a lift. The timing suggested to some economists that the Federal Reserve had acted today at least partly in response to the Bush Administration's call for lower rates.
"All signs point to the Fed trying to bail out the Brady position after the unsuccessful meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations on Sunday," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street investment firm. "This is arm-twisting by the Administration, successfully."
 
A Different Explanation
 But the Federal Reserve offered a much different explanation. The announcement accompanying the discount rate cut said the Fed had acted because data released in the last few days, including some figures published today, showed "continued weakness in economic activity." Industrial production and factory orders have declined, spending for new machinery and other equipment has fallen more than expected, employment costs have edged down and consumer confidence -- a measure of the willingness of Americans to spend -- fell in April.
"I am reasonably confident the economy will turn up," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve governor, reflecting a view held not only in the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve, but also among many private economists. "Still," he said, "you have to make adjustments, and the latest numbers are softer than I and others would have expected."
The credit markets seemed to agree that the economy was quite weak, and interest rates on bonds fell today.
The Federal Reserve's action -- praised by the President -- did not come without opposition among its policy makers. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the four other sitting governors control the discount rate, and they voted 4 to 1 to lower it by half a percentage point, the third such reduction since last December. Although it is the least important of the two rates, since banks borrow very little directly from the Fed, changes in the discount rate serve as a very public signal of the central bank's latest concerns about the economy.
 
One Negative Vote
 The negative vote came from Wayne Angell, a governor who has said that he believes a recovery is imminent and that lowering rates now might make the recovery too robust in the initial months, risking inflation.
A similar view among some of the Federal Reserve's other policy makers -- the chairman, the 4 governors and the 12 regional bank presidents -- has led to debate over whether the Federal funds rate should have declined as sharply as it has since last December, when it was more than 7 1/2 percent. As the rate that banks charge each other on very short-term loans, the Federal funds rate more than anything else helps to determine what banks pay for funds that are then lent to consumers and businessmen. All 17 policy makers play a role in determining its level.
Mr. Greenspan agreed in late March to consult in advance by telephone with the other policy makers when he wanted to move the Federal funds rate at the same time that the Federal Reserve changed the discount rate, officials said. This new procedure, called "enhanced consultation," was used this morning. The Fed policy makers spoke on a conference call, before the discount rate announcement.
Rate Lowest Since 1987
Some policy makers asked questions, but none reportedly objected to the Fed funds rate cut. Some objections could come to the surface, however, at the policy makers' next meeting, on May 14, if the economy turns out to be stronger than it appears today, Federal Reserve officials said. The discount rate is now at its lowest level since 1987
The discount rate announcement came just as Horst Kohler, Under Secretary of Finance for the German Government, was winding up a news conference at the conclusion of the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting here, and he greeted the news enthusiastically. "Wonderful," he said. "We gave them the advice to lower their own rates. That is what we thought they should do."
The German official had argued that the German economy, unlike the American, was still robust and that a cut in German rates would, therefore, only result in too much demand and lead to higher inflation, despite Mr. Brady's arguments to the contrary at the Sunday Group of Seven meeting. Besides, he said, lower German interest rates would result in "a free fall" in the German mark. "That is not in anyone's interests," he said.
The mark jumped in value in trading today, as the dollar weakened on the cut in American interest rates.
Mr. Brady had sought lower European rates -- and in particular lower rates in Germany, which dominates Europe's economy -- to encourage more growth and with it more purchases of American goods to help the United States out of recovery. But Germany argued that while European economies were weakening this year, they were still too strong to justify rate cuts. Nevertheless, he said that the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Japan, Canada and Italy -- would consider a coordinated rate cut in the future to help the United States, if there was evidence that the American recession was deepening.
 
Signs of Some Recovery
 "We have not heard an estimate that there is a cumulative spiral downward in the United States," Mr. Kohler said. "We heard from Mr. Brady and Mr. Greenspan that there were signs of some recovery."
Mr. Greenspan and David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman-designate of the Federal Reserve Board, have taken the lead in pushing for lower interest rates in recent months, and some of their actions were challenged on procedural grounds by other policy makers, particularly those who disagreed on strategy. The disagreement is not over whether a recovery is imminent -- nearly all the policy makers agree this is the case -- but whether some insurance is called for in the form of more rate cuts to guarantee the recovery.
With Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Mullins and a few others believing additional rate cuts were necessary, according to all accounts, the Fed lowered the discount rate and the Federal funds rate half a percentage point on Feb. 1. Mr. Greenspan advised the other policy makers, by telephone, of this action just before he put it into effect and no one objected, Federal Reserve officials said. But some objections were reportedly raised when the policy makers held one of their regular meetings five days later.
 
Set Stage for Agreement
 Then Mr. Greenspan, acting without telephone consultation with other policy makers, lowered the Federal funds rate on March 8 by a quarter of a percentage point. The Labor Department had just announced a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. The two actions reportedly set the stage for the agreement on "enhanced consultation" that was reached at the policy makers' March 26 meeting.
With the discount rate and Federal funds rate both at 6 percent, Mr. Greenspan seemed locked into consultation before today's action, if only because the Fed rarely moves the funds rate below the discount rate.
Procedurally, Mr. Greenspan and the four other governors vote on a discount rate change when regional banks submit requests for one. Today's reduction was requested by the banks in Boston, New York, Atlanta and Dallas. Later, the other banks joined the request, except for those in St. Louis and Cleveland, whose presidents have lately been reluctant to reduce rates.

HEADLINE: Dow Edges Upward 10.89, to 2,887.87

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
After stock traders waited a month for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, the Fed finally came through with a surprise cut, but stock prices did not respond much.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged 10.89 points higher, to 2,887.87, while the Standard & Poor's 500 moved ahead a bit more. The Nasdaq composite, though, home of many of the stronger small stocks, edged lower, along with the American Stock Exchange's market-value index. 
 Traders, economists and market strategists have been arguing for weeks that what the market needed to give it a shot in the arm was a strong dose of Fed easing.
Yesterday, with professional short- sellers overwhelmingly convinced that the market was headed lower, many had sold the market short, selling borrowed stock in the hope of profiting by buying it back later for less.
But on the opening bell, with the Fed cutting the discount rate to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent, stocks took off.
 
Buying by Short-Sellers
 Within a few minutes it was ahead sharply. Short-sellers, scared that prices would move still higher, rushed in to buy, driving the market ahead 30 points well before 10 A.M. Then it started dropping.
By 10:30 the Dow had given up 21 points. It tried several times to recover but failed. By 11:46 and for the next 13 minutes waves of program selling lopped 11 points off the Dow.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said that in spite of the selling, heavy computerized buying lifted the blue-chip index 16 points.
Trading soared to 204.9 million shares, the heaviest in almost two weeks. Monday, by comparison, activity slumped to 149.9 million, barely enough to keep stockbrokers awake.
Advances led declines by 843 to 757. Still, 59 reached new highs. One was FMC, maker of chemicals and machinery, which rose 1 3/4, to 44 3/8, after a new high of 44 1/2.
Jack Solomon, market technician for Bear, Stearns & Company, said that the lukewarm response means that the market "will probably still go lower because this is the news everybody waited a month for and there was no big fanfare."
Still, he said, "It did arrest the decline of the last few days."
Analyzing the Fed rate cut, he argued that while the response at first was favorable, "so far, there's been no beneficial net effect."
He blamed fears of a recession and concerns over disappointing earnings and European interest rates, particularly high rates in Germany that siphon off money that might otherwise flow into the American market.
"The rate cut," he said, "thus may be a little bit late to have an effect to lift us out of recession."
Among the casualties yesterday, Apple Computer tumbled 3 1/4, to 55, and Quantum, a maker of computer disk drives, sank 3 5/8, to 19 7/8, both in exceptionally heavy trading after Andrew Neff, computer analyst for Bear, Stearns, eliminated his "buy" rating on the stocks.
I.B.M., which told stockholders on Monday that it felt uncertain about 1991, slid 1 7/8 in heavy trading, to 103. It also dropped to a new low for the year of 102 1/8.
Other high-tech stocks, normally leaders in an up market, were down. Digital Equipment fell 1, to 67 1/2; Intel 1 1/8, to 49 1/4; Compaq Computer 1 3/8, to 49 1/2; Borland 3 1/4, to 51 1/2, and Storage Technology, 2 7/8, to 35 7/8.
U.S. Surgical and Amgen, two medical stocks, dropped sharply after Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional Tape Reader in Hollywood, Fla., recommended their sale because of heavy gains. U.S. Surgical slid 7 1/4, to 104, and Amgen 5, to 126 3/4, both in heavy trading.
In a quiet bank group, Wells Fargo lost 4 1/8, to 83 1/2, although there was no news to account for the drop. Mellon Bank, which will offer 5 million shares, fell 2 1/2, to 27.
UAL, which is planning a $1 billion shelf offering of notes, fell 3 7/8, to 153 3/8.

Stocks in Tokyo Gain
 TOKYO, Wednesday, May 1 (Reuters) -- Japanese stock prices rose today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 377.75 points, or 1.45 percent, to 26,489.00.

HEADLINE: Insurance as a Job Benefit Shows Signs of Overwork

SERIES: The Price of Health - Fourth of five articles.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
World War II was only a few months old. The nation was mobilizing. With millions of young men in uniform, civilian workers were in short supply and the War Labor Board, to avoid inflation, put a ceiling on wages.
So the trade unions proposed "hidden" raises. Money earmarked for raises would pay for health insurance instead. And the board gave its approval. 
 Thus was born, accidentally, the job-linked health insurance system that dominates medical care in the United States today, providing coverage for nearly 150 million people. Businesses soon became enthusiastic supporters, viewing company health plans as a recruiting lure and a "comfort factor" for employees. And the unions saw health care as a rich benefit to be won in collective bargaining.
 
System Once Worked Well
 For a time the system worked well for most companies and most workers, although since it was voluntary, many small companies never participated. Now, as medical costs climb and companies and insurers seek ways to limit their obligations, the insurance system is in turmoil and new questions are being raised about its economic and social costs.
"Corporate America thought that health care was a cost they would not see, and for many years this was the case" said Eli Ginzberg, an economist at a Columbia University. "As health care expanded, companies passed on the expenses in higher prices for their products. Now they can't pass them on very easily and they are larmed."
Arguing that health costs are putting them at a competitive disadvantage, a few big companies like the Chrysler Corporation and Caterpillar Inc. have even suggested that national health insurance might be a less expensive and more efficient alternative. Many economists say that if the country were starting from scratch, they would not choose to tie health insurance to employment. But the system is deeply entrenched and seems likely to survive, if only because a majority of the nation's largest companies still want it to.
"Companies take a lot of pride in being able to offer health benefits; it is something they have done traditionally and some of them have made big investments in systems that try to manage costs," said Sharon Canner, director of employee benefits for the National Association of Manufacturers. "It would be very hard to just dump out job-based health care."
Most of the proposals for change now being debated try to build on the system rather than scrap it, seeking ways to counter its adverse effects on the economy and people. Among other problems, the current system depresses take-home pay; gives large companies an advantage over small ones, which have to pay higher premiums for health insurance; provides some workers with better health care than others, and leaves tens of millions of Americans, some of them jobholders and some unemployed, with no insurance.
Intensifying all of these effects, economists note, is the rapid rise in health care costs. They contend that the job-linked insurance system, as it has been run in the past, has fueled that inflation by offering open-ended coverage. Employers, insurance companies and government are all now experimenting with ways to slow the rising costs, in effect trying to place ceilings on what Americans spend for health care.
 
Big Companies' Problems
Older Workers, Global Markets
Among American companies, the push for change is led mostly by big, long-established manufacturing companies, like the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Chrysler, Caterpillar and others. They say soaring health expenses make them uncompetitive in world markets, or will once they run out of ways to offset rising bills.
The outspoken companies tend to share three characteristics: their work forces are mostly people in their 40's and 50's who require more health care than younger workers; their health plans cover a much larger number of retired workers than do those of newer companies like computer or airline concerns, and they make products that must compete on world markets.
"Our cars are not priced higher than others; you have to stay competitive," said Walter Maher, Chrysler's director of government relations. While Chrysler offsets most of the increases in health costs by reducing wage increases, this cannot go on indefinitely, Mr. Maher said. Moreover, profits are being squeezed, which might eventually dampen investment, he said.
The biggest concern of companies like Chrysler or Bethlehem is that of retirees. Chrysler has one retiree for every active worker. At Bethlehem the ratio is two retiress to each worker.
 
New Bookkeeping on Retirees
 Until now, companies with coverage for retirees paid the retirees' health care bills as they were incurred and listed the outlays as a corporate expense. But under new accounting rules set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a private institution whose rulings are accepted by industry and Government as if they were law, companies must estimate health care costs for present and future retirees and enter these on their books. The ruling takes effect in 1992.
I.B.M. entered the entire amount, $2.26 billion, in this year's first quarter, which cut sharply into profits. Chrysler and others are likely to spread the entry over 20 years. Whatever the method, the requirement means damage to profits, a point that Walter F. William, Bethlehem's chairman, emphasized in a recent statement to Congress.
But so far it is the workers more than the corporations who are largely footing the mounting health care bills, data show. Corporations subtract the cost increases from the money available to pay salaries. "Such cost-shifting has been showing up as slower wage growth, and not as higher labor costs for employers," said Alan Krueger, a Princeton labor economist who has studied the phenomenon.
A consequence is that while health insurance payments and Social Security taxes, adjusted for inflation, rose by 1.9 percent last year for most of the work force, wages fell by 2 percent, the Labor Department reports. Such offsets have kept total employment costs, combining wages and benefits, from rising since 1985.
 
Differing View of Implications
 But this process cannot continue, Mr. Maher says, echoing the views of many executives and their trade associations. Corporate officials express their alarm by noting that the health care costs in 1989 equalled 56 percent of pretax company profits, as against 8 percent in 1965. Or they point out that health care spending consumed 7 percent of total compensation for employees in 1989, as against 2 percent in 1965.
But economists charge that such comparisons are often misleading. Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton says that in Germany, health care is financed through a payroll tax that is 12.8 percent of a company's total employment costs. "I tell executives, 'You should be in Germany or Japan, where health care spending is a higher percentage of total compensation," he said.
And Mark Pauly, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, says the real competitiveness issue is not health care costs but productivity. If a German worker can turn out, say, 100 calculators a day and an American only 80, then the revenue from selling the 20 additional calculators finances more compensation for the German. "The true competitiveness issue is whether our companies are productive enough to support a high level of compensation," Mr. Pauly said. "How the compensation is split between health care and take-home pay isn't relevant."
 
Problems of Uninsured
Government Role Favored by Many
The preference of business leaders for retaining health insurance that is tied to employment, and their recognition of the system's inadequacies, emerged in a recent poll of chairmen and chief executives at 1,000 of the nation's largest companies. Seventy-five percent of the executives said they wanted to keep employers, not the Government, as the chief brokers in funneling money into health care.
But 67 percent said that while they did not want national health insurance, they did want the Government to pay for the growing number of Americans who lack any coverage.
"These executives are saying, 'We want to keep the employer areas,' " said Randolph Desonia, program officer for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a New Jersey philanthropy on health issues that sponsored the survey by the Gallup organization. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
For the companies, the burden of runaway health costs is compounded by the bills for society's uninsured. When a patient cannot pay for medical care, doctors and hospitals can make up some of their loss by adding to the fees they charge patients who do have insurance. Since insured patients are mostly covered by company policies, the companies pay higher insurance premiums.
Similarly, as payments from Medicaid and to a lesser degree Medicare have failed to cover the costs incurred by their poor and elderly clients, uncovered hospital costs have been shifted to private insurers.
 
Major Cause of Labor Strife
 The battle between corporate owners and workers over who will pay the mounting bills has made health care a major issue in collective bargaining. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. estimates that three-fourths of the days lost to strikes in 1989 involved disputes over health care. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and several steel companies, for example, agreed last year, after strikes, to maintain health benefits. But the extra expense curtailed wage increases, which in each case were fixed to rise by less than 3 percent a year, or less than the expected inflation rate.
To help save the system, and hold down their own health costs, the major employer organizations want the Government to fill the gaps in the current system. Groups like the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Business and the United States Chamber of Commerce propose that the Government provide better coverage for the elderly, the poor and those who are now uninsured. Since many of the uninsured work for smaller businesses, there is also wide support for new regulations aimed at providing cheaper policies to small groups.
"There is always the notion in the United States that government is encroaching on the private sector," Dr. Reinhardt said. "But the government is also being asked to be a shovel brigade, bailing out employers in health care."
 
Small Companies' Problems
As Costs Go Up, Pay Is Squeezed
The current system produces inequities that have increasingly given some Americans more health care than others. Generally, workers at large companies do better than employees of small ones and unionized workers fare better than nonunion.
Among small companies, there is a growing third tier. As health insurance premiums rise, the many companies that want to pay roughly $8 an hour or less to cover both the pay and benefits for most employees discover that they cannot divert more money to health care without reducing wages below $5 or $6 an hour, a level frequently unacceptable to workers. So such companies, including, for example, many restaurants and other service concerns, often do not provide medical insurance.
Three-fourths of the 33 million Americans without health insurance are workers or their dependents, Federal data show, and the number is rising. Most of these work for small operations of fewer than 25 people. But some low-wage workers at fast-food chains and other big retail operations also lack health insurance.
 
Further Economic Distortions
 "There is just so much money to pay employees, and at some level of pay, you can't take money out of the pay package anymore to put it into health insurance," said William Dennis, research director of the National Federation of Independent Business, representing 550,000 companies, most of which employ fewer than 20 people and pay, on average, less than $10 an hour.
The federation favors the Government's paying medical bills for households with annual incomes below $15,000.
The job-based insurance system distorts the economy in additional ways. One is the uneven pattern of insurance premiums, with small companies forced to pay much more for each employee than, say, General Motors, General Electric or International Business Machines.
The national average is $2,300 a year, but a company the size of I.B.M., with tens of thousands of workers, can come in below average by spreading the cost more easily than a company with fewer than 500 employees. I.B.M. has enough healthy, young workers who do not require much medical care that their payments subsidize the older employees, who might require more medical attention than their payments can finance.
As a result, smaller companies, particularly the vast number with fewer than 50 employees, often have to pay more than $3,000 a person for an annual health insurance policy, said Karen Davis, chairman of the health policy and management department at Johns Hopkins University. That forces the companies to either charge higher prices to cover health costs or offer employees less pay, economists say. Both alternatives can make a company less competitive.
Various schemes have been proposed to reduce insurance premiums for these smaller companies, which employ more than half of the nation's work force. One frequent proposal, put forth by the insurance companies themselves, would set up an insurance pool, privately operated, offering back-up coverage to insurers, who would then feel more secure about providing coverage for thousands of workers in small companies.
The goal would be to simulate the sort of broadly based insurance that large companies with thousands of employees can provide, said Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. Ten small companies might have 10 different health insurance carriers, but each of the 10 carriers would in effect sell part of the risk to a "reinsurer." The reinsurer, forming a pool that covered many employees, would spread the risk and thus lower rates.
 
Some Inequity Likely to Remain
 As part of the plan, the insurance companies would not be allowed to deny insurance to a small company's employees, a restriction that is likely to prod insurance companies into trying to negotiate fee ceilings with doctors and hospitals, Mr. Schramm says.
But whatever the rule changes, some inequity in premiums is likely to remain. For one thing, low-income workers, concentrated in small companies, are less healthy than higher-income workers in larger companies. For another, the costs of administering a small company's health insurnance eat up 30 percent to 40 percent of the premiums, as against 10 percent or less for plans covering many more employees, Dr. Davis estimates.
The system favors big over small companies in another way. Corporations are allowed to deduct their contributions to health care from profits, a deduction that saves them billions of dollars in taxes. Small, unincorporated companies do not qualify for this tax break.
"The small company market, no matter how you cut the cards, will end up with rates that are higher than those paid by larger employers," Mr. Schramm said.
Another drag on the economy in the current insurance system is its tendency to limit an insured worker's ability to switch jobs and still have health insurance on the new job. Economists consider such "portability" vital to the efficiency of a free-enterprise system, with workers free to seek better pay and companies more produtive workers. But switching jobs and insurance is becoming harder for workers who have chronic medical conditions or histories of ailments like cancer. Proposed changes in insurance regulation would address the problem.
Such built-in inequities and inefficiencies have led some conservative theorists, as well as liberals who want national health insurance, to propose scrapping the current system. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for example, has urged eliminating the tax break for corporate policies, instead giving personal tax credits so that people can buy their health insurance directly.
 
Problem-Solving Efforts
Leverage Has Limits
While most companies have so far managed to remain competitive by shifting most of the rising health care costs to employees rather than into higher prices, this approach tended until recently to make companies lazy about cost control, Dr. Reinhardt and others say.
"When I talk to business, I say, 'Look, you're not using your money; you're using employees' money,' " Dr. Reinhardt said. "I've asked, 'Did you stop to think that you might be taking such and such a percentage of your employees' money and blowing it wastefully on health care?' "
The money "wasted" by generous, open-ended health plans that encouraged overuse, in this argument could be used more productively by society to support education, public works, the environment and high-tech machinery or could allow higher pay, which would eventually show up in more consumer spending.
Companies and their insurers are now trying to hold down costs with strategies like making workers pay higher deductibles and urging more workers into health maintenance organizations or other "managed care" plans.
And while they wait for better solutions, some companies are trying to negotiate cost controls on their own.
Some have tried to improve their bargaining power through service contracts with networks of doctors and hospitals. The doctors and hospitals are offered thousands of insured employees as patients, if they agree to ceilings on their fees and other controls. The Hewlett-Packard Company, the computer giant that has 20,000 workers in the San Francisco area, has such an arrangement with El Camino Hospital there.
But even that big a worker pool provides El Camino with only 2 percent of its patients. "We picked that hospital because it was already a low-cost, quality provider," said Robert Hungate, director of government affairs and health care at Hewlett-Packard. "But we can't leverage the hospital much. We are not trying to force discounts."
The General Electric Company, with an aircraft engine plant in Cincinnati and 18,000 workers there, teamed up with the Procter & Gamble Company, which is headquartered there, to increase their leverage with a network of doctors and hospitals that have contracted to care for thousands of employes of the two companies.
But with all their size, General Electric and Procter & Gamble fail to provide most of the network's patients. "The group practice we are attempting is in an early stage and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty about how much it will have to evolve to be effective in controlling costs," said Charles Buck, G.E.'s director of health care management.

HEADLINE: Wages Show a More Moderate Advance

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Wages, salaries and benefits paid to American workers rose 4.6 percent over the last 12 months, a much slower advance than the year before, the Government said today in a report viewed as evidence that wage inflation was abating.
Analysts said the more moderate rise in the Labor Department's employment cost index, considered one of the best gauges of wage inflation pressures, probably played a part in the Federal Reserve's move to lower the discount rate. 
 The 4.6 percent increase in overall compensation costs for the year ending March 1991 marked a sharp decline from a year ago, when those costs had soared 5.5 percent for a similar 12-month period.
Also today, the Labor Department said that workers covered by collective bargaining agreements settled so far this year won annual wage gains averaging 3.4 percent over the life of the pact. Previously, those contracts had provided 2 percent annual gains.
The employment cost report showed that both wages and salaries and benefit costs appeared to be moving downward. Wages and salaries increased 4.2 percent for the year ended in March, compared with a 4.4 percent increase a year ago.
For the last year, too, there was a substantial slowdown in benefit cost increases, which rose 5.9 percent for 12 months ended in March, down from the 7.4 percent spurt for the year ended in December.
In the first quarter of 1991, benefit costs rose 1.4 percent, well below the 2 percent increase for the corresponding three-month period a year ago.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Tells Tourists, Yo! Don't Overlook Us

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The bedroom's lace curtains rustle in a cool spring breeze, filtering dots of sunlight onto a four-poster bed. Like hundreds of other bed-and-breakfasts throughout America, the appeal of Donald Kurz-Fiedeke's small hostelry is its 19th-century charm, its whiff of romance.
But just beyond the curtains and a well-tended garden, laundry hangs from red-brick tenements; a block from the front door are decaying East River piers, and a short stroll away is the Pulaski Bridge, which connects southwestern Queens with Greenpoint in Brooklyn, the setting for Mr. Kurz-Fiedeke's Brooklyn Bed and Breakfast. 
 The presence of a bed-and-breakfast amid the industrial grit of Greenpoint tells the story of Brooklyn's quixotic but resurgent aspirations to become a tourist mecca.
The hearts of Brooklyn boosters have been stirred in recent weeks by a combination of optimistic, if unlikely sounding, developments: the publication of a full-fledged Brooklyn guidebook, the first of its kind in 50 years, its publishers say; the reawakening of plans for a Downtown Brooklyn Hilton Hotel, and the designation of Brooklyn, by the New York State Department of Economic Development, as its official "I Love New York" destination for next spring.
But the very idea of attracting out-of-town visitors to the borough whose most famous landmarks -- Coney Island, the Navy Yard, Ebbets Field -- are dead or dying, and whose international image lies somewhere between Beirut and Podunk, has the inevitable flavor of a routine by a Brooklyn-born comedian like Henny Youngman: "They dropped a bomb on Brooklyn," he said the other day. "It did a million dollars' improvement."
 
'In the Shadow of Manhattan'
 "I won't say that Brooklyn is a hard sell," said Borough President Howard Golden, who tirelessly touts his turf and whose words of welcome greet drivers on the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. "But our No. 1 problem is that we sit in the shadow of Manhattan. And the only time you see Brooklyn in the news is if there's some violent act."
Whereas 25 million out-of-town visitors come to pump more than $12 billion a year into New York City every year, pumping more than $12 billion into its 's economy, only an comparatively infinitesimal trickle find their way to Brooklyn. De spite a wealth of cultural institutions like the Brooklyn Museum and theBrooklyn Botanic Garden, landmarked buildings, historic neighborhoods, and a world-famous beach and a wealth of cultural institutions like the Brooklyn Museum and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn faces several seemingly insoluble problems in attracting out-of-towners.
At the New York Aquarium on Coney Island, for example, only 5 to 10 percent of its 775,000 annual visitors are non-New Yorkers, said a spokesman, Rick Miller. And at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, barely 2 percent of its 250,000 ticket buyers are from out of town, said Doug Allan, the academy's vice president for marketing.
With Brooklyn a low priority for state and city tourism officials, the job of promoting Brooklyn to tourists has fallens to poorly financed private hands. One organization, the Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn, prints attractive booklets on picturesque neighborhoods, famous Brooklynites and noteworthy poets and restaurateurs. Robert Ohlerking, a freelance promoter, has a project called Destination Brooklyn, but the effort it has stalled, and he is now seeking to unite local institutions behind the cause.
 
New York's 'Soul'
 In general, their Brooklyn is an antidote to the showiness across the bridge, a place where an out-of-towner can experience the real New York. "Brooklyn is an ideal destination for visitors who've been to New York before, seen all the Manhattan sites, and want to discover the rest of the city," Mr. Ohlerking said.
Ellen Freudenheim -- whose new guidebook, "Brooklyn: Where to Go, What to Do, How to Get There," is being promoted as Brooklyn's first in a half century, calls Brooklyn New York's "elusive soul" to Manhattan's "thumping heart."
"Brooklyn's got personality because it's so ethnically diverse and human-scaled," says the guidebook by Ms. Freudenheim and her husband, Daniel P. Wiener. "And it's a treasure chest of history, culture and family fun."
Judy Deutsch, who came with her husband, Harry, from St. Louis last week to visit New York, heard of Liana Paolella's Victorian on the Park bed-and-breakfast in Park Slope, and decided to opt for something different from the high-priced, high-glitz, high-density midtown hotels.
"I've come to New York many times, but I wanted to be out of the Manhattan rat race," she said, sitting in her $135-a-night garden-floor suite, replete with Oriental rugs, antique furniture and a fireplace. "The first night, I felt I was imposing on someone else's house, but then it felt wonderfully homey, quiet and relaxed. It's a nice respite after a day in Manhattan."
 
Where Whitman Edited
 Despite such testimonials, even the boosters acknowledge that Brooklyn is widely perceived as a place whose glory days have long passed. Baseball pilgrims in search of Ebbets Field will find a housing project.; d Dreamers may prowl the Coney Island Boardwalk in search of the ghosts of fabled turn-of-the-century amusement parks like Dreamland and Luna Park, only to find the crumbling Parachute Jump., And the printing plant for the daily newspaper that Walt Whitman once edited, The Brooklyn Eagle, is now a heavily guarded luxury condominium.
Some 800 murders were committed in the borough last year, the police say -- a rate no higher or lower than the city as a whole. Yet to legions of out-of-towners, Brooklyn is little more than a famous bridge and the a grisly setting for the grisly crime du jour.
Beyond its image of decline, Brooklyn seems either unable to capitalize on its resources or hellbent on cultivating attractions that may not exert magnetic appeal on to the occasional visitor.
 
Not for Everybody
 At the Transit Museum, for example, one can pay more than the cost of a token to descend into one of New York's typically cheery subway stations and get on a train and go nowhere. The Harbor Defense Museum, hidden on the Fort Hamilton aArmy base near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, beckons to those with an interest in 19th-century coastal fortifications. For tourists in search of panoramic views, a platform atop the Grand Army Plaza Arch is open 28 days a year. But the pinnacle of the borough's tallest building, the 512-foot-tall Williamsburg Savings Bank, is off-limits to all visitors except those with bad teeth. It is a dentist's office.
Less quirky attractions like the borough's Dutch colonial and Victorian homes are unknown; its Russian and West Indian nightclubs are frequented largely by people who live in the area; imaginative small museums like the Brooklyn Children's Museum and the Brooklyn Historical Society are often bereft of visitors, and potentially attractive recreation areas languish -- places like Floyd Bennett Field and Marine Park, both in the Gateway National Recreation Area, and even Coney Island.
 
Where to Stay
 Brooklyn's once-great hotels like the St. George, where Brooklyn Dodgers cavorted in the hallways; the Brooklyn Arms, and the Half Moon on Coney Island and the St. George, the city's largest in 1929 with more than 2,600 rooms, are now either apartments, welfare hotels or homes for the elderly.
Now the borough's has only two sizable overnight accommodations. One is now are the Gregory Hotel, a recently refurbished 66-room establishment in the Bay Ridge section that rivals Manhattan hotels at least in with its rates -- of $115 to $245 a night. (It also has and a Sinatra suite for honeymooners.), The other is and the 150-room Golden Gate, a 1960's-vintage, Interstate-style motel built for the 1964-65 World's Fair. Less enticing to out-of-towners are a strip of motels along the Shore Parkway distinguished mainly by their advertisements for mirrored ceilings and short-stay rates.
About 50 times a year, half-filled Gray Line buses take tourists from Manhattan to 12 of the borough's "key points of interest," including a view of lower Manhattan's skyline. These money-losing tours are subsidized by the city and state.
The city's Convention and Visitors Bureau has increased its efforts to promote Brooklyn and its attractions, yet the borough has been all but invisible in travel magazines and New York City guidebooks.
 
A Seed Grows in Brooklyn
 "It's not that it's not worth covering, but it's a hard sell to readers," said Ila Stanger, the editor of Travel & Leisure magazine. "It's hard enough to get Manhattanites to cross a bridge to Brooklyn, so it's hard to expect an out-of-towner to come there."
The borough's brightest glimmer of hope for tourism is now an empty downtown lot behind the State Supreme Court. As soon as the city approves a leasing agreement for what is optimistically called Renaissance Plaza, ground will be broken on a 31-story office building that is to include a 380-room Brooklyn Hilton. Alas, even the builder, the Muss Development Company, sees the Hilton as "mainly a business hotel, and clearly not the first choice for tourists coming to New York," said a spokesman, Lloyd Kaplan.
A more fundamental problem is that the hotel is likely to share the building with the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office. So, as guests search for the health club or conference rooms, they may be confronted with a steady stream of lawyers, police officers and felons.

HEADLINE: Fire Damages a Nuclear Plant in Maine

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., April 30

 BODY:
A nuclear power plant in Maine was crippled by explosions and a fire Monday night, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today, but it said no radiation was released into the air.
The commission and officials of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset said the flames, heat and firefighting efforts did no damage to the reactor or other nuclear parts of the plant. Automatic firefighting equipment in the nuclear part was not needed, they said. 
 The fire began at 6:32 P.M. in the non-nuclear part of the plant, plant officials and the commission said. Its cause has not been determined, but employees told Federal investigators they heard what appeared to be explosions before the fire broke out near the plant's main electrical transformer and beneath the turbine generator.
The fire occurred 100 feet to 200 feet from the containment building that encases the plant's nuclear reactor within a 4 1/2-foot-thick wall of concrete reinforced with steel.
Plant officials said the fire burned for four hours and was fed by hydrogen used to cool the generator. It was hot enough to cause the main electrical transformer to buckle, rupturing seals, and allowing thousands of gallons of lubricating oil to spill into a catchment area outside the plant. At least 200 gallons of oil leaked into the Back River, plant officials said.
No one was injured, plant officials said today in a prepared statement.
 
System Worked, Officials Say
 Richard H. Wessman, project director in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, stressed that although the fire appeared to be severe such accidents have occurred before in nuclear and conventionally powered electrical generating plants. The automatic shutdown system, as intended, shut down the reactor without incident immediately after the fire broke out, he said.
At a news conference this afternoon, Maine Yankee's president, Charles Frizzle, also said the fire could have happened at any power plant.
"I don't want to downgrade the seriousness of the event," Mr. Frizzle said, "but it's not a nuclear event. From my perspective, this should not reflect negatively on the use of nuclear power. It has nothing to do with nuclear power."
 
Crucial Time for Industry
 The accident occurred during a politically sensitive period for the American nuclear power industry. On Thursday, the regulatory commission is to rule on a staff recommendation to restart a reactor at Browns Ferry, a troubled nuclear plant near Athens, Ala., that has been shut for safety reasons since March 1985. John Moulton, a spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tenn., the plant's owner, said the accident in Maine should not effect the decision to restart Browns Ferry.
Next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is scheduled to vote on a measure that would streamline the licensing procedures for nuclear power plants. The changes, proposed by the committee's chairman, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, would make licensing a one-step process and eliminate almost every stage that enables the public to make comments.
The Bush Administration has also staked a sizeable portion of its national energy strategy on reviving nuclear power. It says the 110 American nuclear power plants are safe and are far less polluting than electric power plants fueled by coal or oil. The Administration has also financed studies through the Department of Energy to design a new generation of nuclear reactors that would be largely incapable of melting down.
But critics of the technology say that splitting atoms to gain energy is inherently dangerous and insist that the mining, milling, and processing of uranium for nuclear fuel is one of the dirtiest and most dangerous industries in the United States. Moreover, they say, the Administration has yet to find a permanent solution for safe disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants.
The regulatory commission reported today that unplanned incidents occurred Monday and last week at two other nuclear plants in New England, forcing their shutdown.
A leak of hot water in the nuclear containment vessel at the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Mass. prompted its shutdown on Monday, the commission said, but no radiation was released. The plant's owner, the Boston Edison Company, had been aware of the leak for weeks before the shutdown and planned to repair it during a planned shutdown beginning May 4. A worsening of the leak caused the utility to take the reactor out of service early.
The other incident occurred April 24, when the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant five miles south of Brattleboro suddenly lost its primary source of power. The interruption of power prompted the plant to turn on its independent electrical generators and led to an unplanned shutdown of the reactor. The incident may have caused when an employee mistakenly tripped a switch that caused all power into the plant to be cut off, the regulatory commission said. Its investigators are studying the incident.
For more than a decade Maine Yankee, which sits along the coast about 40 miles northeast of Portland, has been at the center of a struggle between environmentalists and the nuclear power industry. Critics tried three times from 1980 to 1987 to shut it down with voter referendums on statewide ballots; each time about 60 percent of voters favored keeping the plant open.
Leaders of the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, an antinuclear group based in Portland that has led the campaign to close Maine Yankee, said today that since last July the plant has been shut down nine times because of unexpected problems. "We feel very strongly that what we're dealing with is an aging nuclear reactor that is beginning to show its age," Thomas Coffin, a spokesman for the group, said.
Residents of Wiscasset say the plant has been a good neighbor, a good employer and a supplier of about 90 percent of the local tax base. Of the plant's 420 employees, many come from Wiscasset, which has a population of about 3,400.
"Until they come up with a better alternative, I support its being here," said Robert Rogers, who lives less than a mile from the plant. "It does pump quite a lot of money into the economy here, and they've had a real good safety record."
The regulatory commission said that in the last several years the owners of Maine Yankee have received the Government's highest rating for operating the plant.
Maine Yankee, which began operating commercially in 1972, is owned by 10 utility companies in New England, with the Central Maine Power Company having the largest share. The 825-megawatt plant was designed Combustion Engineering Inc., a nationally known engineering company in Stamford, Conn. It provides low-cost electric power to about one-fourth of the homes and businesses in Maine.
Plant executives said today it was too early to determine when Maine Yankee would return to service. The generator and transformers sustained extensive damage, and the plant could be shut down for weeks if not months. But the shutdown will not cause a shortage in power, they said, because hydroelectric power is plentiful this time of year.
The regulatory commission sent a team of experts Monday night to investigate the causes of the explosion and fire and determine how well the plant's operators and its automatic systems responded.

HEADLINE: Courts' Role as Land Manager Grows

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 30

 BODY:
A zoologist who tracks nocturnal birds in the forest was in court here today, trying to explain the breeding habits of an owl to a Federal judge. One floor below, another Federal judge was going over maps prepared by the Government to determine how much land the owl needed to avoid extinction.
The cases are likely to result in the most sweeping land protection measures ever taken on behalf of wildlife, restrictions on millions of acres. The cases also illustrate that, more than ever, many of the nation's most important natural resource decisions are being made by Federal judges. 
 Whether the dispute is over bison in Yellowstone National Park, salmon on the Columbia River or wolves in the high Rockies, questions that were usually left up to scientists have moved into the courtroom.
Last year 540 legal challenges were made to the Forest Service's timber-selling program nationwide -- a record, more than doubling the previous year's 234 appeals. Federal timber policy is essentially paralyzed, with most logging on national forests in the Pacific Northwest halted by injunction or similiar legal threat.
 
Restraining Order on Bison
 The story is much the same in some national parks. A plan, years in the making, to shoot 25 bison in Yellowstone National Park as part of a test on disease was halted earlier this month after a judge in Washington, D.C., issued a restraining order.
Under possible threat of judicial order, Federal dams on the Columbia River are drawing down their water this spring to help save endangered salmon, which need a strong current to help them migrate.
Environmentalists say there are more than enough laws to protect land and wildlife; what is lacking, they say, is enforcement of those laws. The higher the economic cost, the more likely it is that the cases will end up in court. The plan to save owls, for example, could result in more than 20,000 lost logging jobs; bringing wolves back to the Rocky Mountains is said to pose a threat to the cattle industry.
"The laws are there, but the Administration is just not following them," said Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington. "If they would simply follow the law, we wouldn't be in this mess."
In the absence of clear direction from the top, some wildlife managers and forest supervisors say they are now as likely to get their management instructions from a judge as they are from agency heads.
 
Concern About Court Role
 "When you have a judge interpreting the Endangered Species Act the way some of them are doing it now, in essence the judge is acting as the Secretary of Interior," said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Manuel Lujan Jr., the Interior Secretary. "Obviously that is a major concern to us."
Until the mid-1980's the Government would decide how much Federal timber from national forests it would sell, then move ahead with minimal delays. But in recent years, court injunctions on behalf of owls, grizzly bears, fish or other creatures protected by law have tied up the program.
"I look at court action now as the basic cost of doing business," said John Butruille, the Regional Forester for the Pacific Northwest.
Administration officials say they are trying to strike a balance with laws designed to protect animals that can also require a huge human sacrifice.
"For many years it was as easy to support the Endangered Species Act as it was motherhood or apple pie," said Mr. Goldstein. "But that's not the case anymore."
 
The Owl and the Secretary
 One lawsuit, now before Federal District Judge Thomas Zilly in Seattle, is entitled: Northern Spotted Owl v. Manuel Lujan. After the owl was listed as a threatened species, imperiled by logging of its forest home in Washington, Oregon and Northern California, the Administration and Congress failed to agree on a long-term plan on how much land to set aside for the owl.
Environmentalists stepped in, asking the the United States District Court to force the Government to come up with a plan. Last Friday, two days before the court deadline, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that logging might have to be restricted on 11.6 million acres. The plan, which timber industry officials say could cost $600 million a year in lost jobs and income, is now before Judge Zilly.
A second owl lawsuit, before Federal District Judge William L. Dwyer of Seattle, targets another Federal agency, the Forest Service, for failing to sufficiently curb logging in national forests. Judge Dwyer today convened an extraordinary 10-day hearing on the fate of the nation's last big sections of old-growth forests. Loggers, biologists, timber managers and others will testify. At the end of the hearing, the Judge Dwyer will act on a request to shut down logging for up to 15 months in the most productive timber-producing region in the country. Such an injunction would cost more than 20,000 jobs, Government officials said.
 
Plea for Law Enforcement
 "Again and again, environmentalists are going to court to simply ask judges that they enforce the laws that are on the books," said Todd True, the lead lawyer for the group of environmentists before Judge Dwyer.
Bill Pickell, general manager of the Washington Contract Loggers Association, said, "I think foresters should be making these decisions, not Federal judges."
The foresters, who often live in the same community where jobs may be curbed to save an animal, are not immune to the views of their neighbors.
"There was a tremendous amount of political pressure put on the Forest Service last year to not follow their own scientific report," said Representative Dicks. "As a result, things are much worse than ever before."
On rare occasions, Congress has tried to exempt some land and wildlife decisions from judicial review. But those Congressional actions have also wound up in court.
"We're dealing with the system, checks and balances, the way it's always been, " said Mr. Butruille. "It's just that more people are using it than ever before. I've never seen such a level of public interest in natural resource decisions."

HEADLINE: New Orders At Factories Drop by 2.8%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Orders for factory goods fell 2.8 percent in March, the fifth straight decline, the Government said today in a report showing widespread weakness persisting in the industrial sector.
Laurence H. Meyer, head of the St. Louis economic forecasting firm of Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, said the Commerce Department report "convinced us the economy is still sliding" and would post a third quarter of negative growth from April through June. 
 Falling orders for both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the decline, with orders for durable goods at their lowest level in three and a half years.
The Federal Reserve cited the continuing weakness in the industrial and capital goods areas today when it announced that it was lowering its discount rate to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent.
It was the third such move in four months and was intended to drive down interest rates on other loans and thus stimulate the economy.
The Commerce Department report said new orders for both durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $226.6 billion, down from $233.1 billion in February. New orders have fallen every month since October.
Orders for durable goods -- items from trucks to turbines expected to last more than three years -- fell a revised 4.9 percent, to $111.8 billion. It was the lowest level since September 1987, when orders had fallen to $111.7 billion.
Although the decline in durables orders was less than the 6.2 percent estimate reported last week, it was the fourth drop in the last five months.
The key category of nonmilitary capital goods fell 5 percent, to $32.1 billion, its third consecutive monthly loss. This category is often a barometer of industry plans to expand and modernize.
"At first, I thought we would see the bottom in the first quarter," said Evalina Tainer, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "But the fact that it continued in the first quarter means capital spending will be pretty anemic for three to six more months."
Transportation orders tumbled 5 percent, to $28.3 billion, for the third consecutive drop. Excluding this category, however, orders still fell 2.5 percent.
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment plunged 13.5 percent, to $15.6 billion, wiping out an 11.2 percent gain a month earlier. Primary metals were down 1 percent, to $9.7 billion, after posting a 2.8 percent advance in February.
Orders for nondurable goods declined six-tenths of a percent, to $114.9 billion, in part because of a large drop for chemicals and petroleum products. Nondurable goods orders have fallen every month since October.
Unfilled orders, an indication of how busy factories will be in coming months, slipped four-tenths of a percent, to $524.9 billion.

HEADLINE: For A Lot of Mainers, Lobstering Life Is Losing Allure

BYLINE: By DENA KLEIMAN

DATELINE: SPRUCE HEAD, Me.

 BODY:
IT was more than 100 years ago that Maynard Post first put down lobster traps in the icy waters off this isolated fishing village on the craggy Maine coastline.
Both of his sons became lobstermen. So did four of his grandsons, as well as three of his great-grandsons, in what has been far less a job than a proud heritage passed from one generation to the next. 
 But a kind of malaise has settled over the lobster industry in Maine, a state known more for its salt-of-the-earth common sense than for introspection and self-analysis.
As the state prepares for its busy summer lobster season, which unofficially begins today, the Posts along with many other Maine lobstermen, wholesalers, biologists and others are worried about where Maine's $180 million lobster business -- the largest in the world after Canada's, and a major tourist attraction -- is headed.
"No question we're at a turning point," said Dave Dow, director of the Lobster Institute, an industry-supported education and research group at the University of Maine in Orono. "All of us are scrambling around trying to figure out how we can put the king of seafood back on its throne."
The problem is that last year the supply of Maine lobster was at an all-time high and its dock-side price was the lowest since 1981. In 1988 the average price lobstermen received from wholesalers was close to $3 a pound, an all-time high, but last year the average dipped to $2.13, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service in Portland, Me., and retail prices fell as well.
"We've got to fish twice as hard to earn the same amount of money," said Darren Post, 25 years old. Like his father, grandfather and great-grandfather before him he is a lobsterman in Spruce Head, which is just south of Rockland and about 90 miles northeast of Portland. And like many, he worries about the industry's future.
Industry analysts say the decrease in the price of lobster is due in part to today's lean economic times, to the general decline in sales of luxury items and to competition from other species of seafood around the world that are being marketed more aggressively.
But clearly a chief reason for the 1990 price decline was the record catch, estimated at more than 28 million pounds. More lobster were caught in Maine last year than ever before; the second-largest catch was 101 years ago, in 1889, when 24 million pounds were caught.
Part of the uncertainty brewing in Maine is just what to do about the oversupply at a time when new technology has made it easier to catch a lobster than ever before and when the state has sought to regulate the lobster industry out of fear that overfishing would lead to the species' decline.
"Lobster continues to be an overfished resource," said Jay Krouse, chairman of the lobster and crab fisheries division of the Maine Department of Marine Resources in Booth Bay Harbor. "And without lobster there is no industry."
Currently, lobstermen must throw back "chicken lobsters," those that measure less than 3 1/4 inches from the eye socket to the tail, a restriction begun in 1988.
Lobstermen oppose this measure because these smaller lobsters, which weigh about a pound each, are highly desired by Japanese consumers and provide a lucrative export market for Canada, which does not have such size restrictions.
But biologists argue that last year's record catch may mask serious losses in the lobster population. They note, for example, that the average lobster caught in the mid-1960's weighed five pounds, but the average today weighs just over two.
Over the heated objections of lobstermen, a number of bills have recently been introduced into the Maine Legislature to further restrict lobstering. These include proposals to limit the number of traps lobstermen may set as well as putting a limit on the lobstering season, which currently extends all year long.
"It will soon get to the point where it won't pay anymore for many to fish," said Gilbert Post, 51, who has been fishing for lobster off Spruce Head since he was 10.
Mr. Post and his family, who all live within a few blocks of each other, have been busy these past few weeks painting buoys and repairing traps for the new season. Speaking to them provides a window into the frustrations, joys and uncertainties that surround lobstering in Maine.
"To us lobstering is all that we know," said Richard Post, 48, who is Gilbert's younger brother and who remembers catching his first lobster when he was 3. "It is all I ever wanted to be as a child. I knew I wanted to become a lobsterman when I was 2. But these days it's gotten almost to the point where it no longer pays. The price of bait keeps going up but the price of lobster keeps going down. Everyone's got ideas but no one really knows what to do."
At this season the haunting sound of a fog horn often pierces the quiet of this modest but immaculately kept village. The dock overlooking the Atlantic is crowded with mountains of wire traps and ruddy-faced men.
Like 85 percent of Maine's lobstermen, the Posts fish from May through October when the frigid waters warm and lobsters become more mobile. During these warmer months lobsters typically migrate from the deeper ocean floor to shallower waters nearer land, where they shed their shells so they can grow.
The Posts set lobster traps in the same spots that Maynard ("Grampy") Post used more than a century ago in what is an unofficial but firmly enforced inheritance in Maine. (Lobstermen are known to come to blows over fishing spots.)
But the difference is that when Maynard Post fished for lobsters all he had to guide him were his compass and a watch, whereas his great-grandsons would not think of looking for lobster without a computer.
Indeed most lobster boats today are equipped not only with devices that can tell the precise location of where the lobsterman caught lobsters before but also instruments that register the depth and composition of the ocean floor. The best place to catch a lobster is on a ledge leading from shallow to deep water, and the only way Maynard Post could determine that was with a piece of rope and a weight. Old lobster hands like David Post, 73 years old, who is one of Maynard's sons, feels that the art of lobstering has disappeared.
"Today anyone can catch a lobster," said Mr. Post, who is the father of Gilbert and Richard. He is convinced that the new technology aboard lobster boats is to blame for many of industry's current woes. Because it is so easy to catch a lobster, he says, so many more lobsters are being caught by so many more inexperienced people that there is far more supply than there is demand.
Years ago all a lobsterman needed to do to make a living was to set 100 traps; today each of the Posts sets between 800 and 1,000 traps. It is cold, hard work that requires hauling some 300 wire traps on board each day to retrieve the catch and replace bait. (But an energetic lobsterman can earn as much as $80,000 a year.)
"There are only so many hours in a day," said Ashley Post, 44, another of Maynard's grandchildren living here in Spruce Head.
Like most of his relatives, Ashley Post rarely thinks of eating lobster because of all the effort involved in the catch. In recent years, he said, he has often put in 12-hour days. "Before, it was fun. Now it's just work."
Despite these difficult times, lobstering appears to be in the Post family's blood. Just talking of a new season seems to give them a tangible spirit of renewal. "The fever," they call it in Spruce Head, when men awake at 5 A.M. and rush to the sea to check the tide.
"Once you get in a boat and you get a little salt water in your face, that's what happens to you," said David Post, now retired, who desperately misses his days at sea.
"It's the cold; it's the wind; it's the freedom of it," said Gilbert Post, David's son, who still loves what he does.
"I love it too," said Duwayne Post, Gilbert's 29-year-old son, adding that from the time he was a child, becoming a lobsterman was the only thing he ever wanted to do. He gave his boat the name Skylark -- the same as his great-grandfather Maynard's -- and says he is proud of his heritage. He has a son, Dennis, who is 4.
"But it's not something I want anymore for my son," he said. "No one knows where all of this is going to lead."

HEADLINE: Unresolved Questions

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Although the draft agreement reached in Madrid appeared to satisfy environmental groups as well as the nations that had sought to keep open the option of mining in Antarctica, many questions remain unresolved.
For one, it remains to be seen whether the draft will be approved by the governments whose representative met in Madrid. Robert Ford, a spokesman of the State Department's Bureau of Oceans and Environment, said that the department had not yet had time to study the draft. Meanwhile, he said, it would be premature to guess whether the United States would ratify it or not. 
 A spokesman for the National Science Foundation said that in any case the United States would not agree to any provision that would interfere with the free conduct of scientific research in Antarctica.
Still, the support of the United States delegation of at least a temporary ban on Antarctic mineral exploitation represented a significant shift in the State Department policy that prevailed until last autumn, when Congress voted to ban American mineral exploitation of Antarctica.
 
Agreement Falls Apart
 Earlier, the State Department had supported the kind of agreement by which mining could be conducted in Antarctica only under international regulation and with the agreement of the parties to the Antarctic Treaty. This approach was incorporated in the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Resources tentatively adopted by the Antarctic Treaty nations in 1988 at a meeting in Wellington, New Zealand.
The New Zealand agreement began to fall apart the following year when Australia decided to withdraw. Soon afterward, France joined Australia in repudiating the agreement, also calling for a complete ban on Antarctic mineral exploitation. Since then, the convention has been effectively abandoned.
Although the 39 nations party to the Antarctic Treaty may finally agree to ban the exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources for 50 years, there is no legal mechanism to prevent any of the hundred-odd nations remaining outside the pact from moving in on Antarctica with oil drill rigs and mining machinery. Some third world nations, led by Malaysia, have accused the Antarctic Treaty signers of "economic imperialism" that denies the poorer nations their fair share of Antarctica's supposed mineral wealth.
In fact, most geologists and other experts doubt that Antarctica's resources, such as they are, could ever be exploited economically. There is some chance that oil reserves may exist under the ocean floor off West Antarctica's coast. But experts say that only a supergiant oilfield, the existence of which has been virtually ruled out, would warrant the gigantic expense of drilling under water covered with thick drifting ice during much of the year.
The Madrid draft agreement also leaves unresolved the issue of fishing and biological resources in Antarctic waters.

HEADLINE: More City Business, for Less Money

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins of New York has taken a small but firm step in the right direction by consolidating six city agencies concerned with economic development into two agencies: a new Department of Business Services and the New York City Development Corporation. This will eliminate 71 jobs, saving $5 million over 18 months.
Given the size of the city's growing budget deficit for the coming fiscal year, which could reach $3.5 billion, the saving is small. But that's not the main point. The consolidation sends a healthy message to business that the administration is prepared to overcome squeamishness about cutting the bureaucracy. It's also an example of the fundamental streamlining that can help the city provide services more efficiently. 
 Government experts, including Mr. Dinkins's own blue-ribbon management advisory committee, have been recommending this sort of merger for many years, and for good reason. The agencies shared too many overlapping functions, aimed mainly at helping businesses thread their way through a confounding maze of regulatory rules and tax concessions.
New York State's tax policies invite complex case-by-case negotiations on issues like tax abatement. But even if the State Legislature some day summons the courage to modify these rules, New York City will still need an agency to stimulate new investment while encouraging existing businesses to stay.
But the city plainly did not need the separate bureaucracies that have now been consolidated. Mayor Dinkins and his Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, deserve praise for taking this difficult, if overdue, step.

HEADLINE: The Great Game Of 'Gai-atsu'

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis ;Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The word for it in Japanese is "gai-atsu," literally "foreign pressure," but in effect "Japan-bashing." It covers all those things like extracting billions of dollars to help pay for the gulf crisis, pushing on the sacrosanct ban against rice imports, trying to set market quotas on semiconductor chips.
But new undertones have been added, with new candor, as the Japanese struggle to define their relations with a world in which they have become a huge and proud economic power yet still feel virtuously weak. There are admissions now that "gai-atsu" has been exploited to serve a neat political trick, "a strong, face-saving device to which [domestic] vested interest groups were persuaded to give in" by a Government pretending to be their champion. 
 These were the words of a leading Japanese economist to a recent meeting of the Trilateral Commission. They were echoed by a number of others who admit they are getting frustrated by their country's dithering passivity on all but trade.
They reflect the shock of Japan's political and moral quandary when it was confronted by the gulf crisis and sought reasons for avoiding responsibility. There is a gradually spreading awareness that Japan is a global power, but incapable of initiative, in a sense immature, avoiding asking itself what it should do but asking what others, perhaps unfairly, expect of it.
But what kind of power does it want to be? The phrase "no taxation without representation" became a fashionable argument in Japan in response to American demands for more and more money to support the gulf coalition. But it was clear that the last thing they wanted was to have to face a decision.
Talk of a permanent Japanese seat on the U.N. Security Council arouses excited interest. Japan is the world's second largest contributor to the U.N., and recognition of its status matters to people. But apart from the trouble that opening the U.N. Charter to amendment would provoke, the same people admit Japan really isn't prepared to take a stand on the tangled issues that come before the council. Helping to keep the peace involves more than pacifism.
Whenever the argument goes deeper, the complaint comes quickly that Japan now has an unusually weak Government. Nobody has a good word to say about Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. Yet he is likely to be chosen to succeed himself when his term expires this fall. Nor is there the slightest sign of an alternative to the ruling Liberal Democrat Party.
The subtlety of relying on "gai-atsu" is that it helps keep the existing political structure in place, blaming somebody outside for uncomfortable accommodations that are needed without having to examine Japan's internal power relations. And as the journalist Yoichi Funabashi points out, "It shifts debate away from the issue of what Japan should do in its own best interest and toward what other countries want Japan to do. For this very reason, it often arouses nationalistic feelings and emotionalizes the issues."
He is one of relatively few who see a problem in Japan's failure to come to terms with its militaristic past. Mr. Funabashi's ambition for Japan's role is that of "a global civilian power" with a "value-oriented diplomacy." He is against a military buildup or projection of force, as some Americans misguidedly urge, but he is also against perpetuating Japan's "patron-protege relation" with the U.S. and their "love-hate emotions."
The U.S. should not fear this Japanese self-assertion and search for self-reliance. It prolongs the gai-atsu game by accepting the role of stern tutor and protector, instead of insisting that Japan become a partner in its own self-interest. Time to tell the Japanese: when you need bashing, do it yourselves. You'll feel better.

HEADLINE: So Call It a 'Victory Dividend'

BYLINE: By Barney Frank; Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, is a member of the House Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
What's in a name? Sometimes, hundreds of billions of dollars.
In 1989, with the Russian empire crumbling, some of us in Washington argued that the time had come to begin a shift of America's resources from the worldwide military competition, which we are winning decisively, to the global civilian area where we are lagging. It make no sense, we said, to spend two to six times as much of our gross national product on the military as do our wealthy allies while they outsell America. It is poor policy, we argued, to spend more than $100 billion a year defending Western Europe from the defunct Warsaw Pact while our deficit expands and our infrastructure decays. 
 Our mistake was calling this a "peace dividend." The phrase suggested that its advocates were naive about the world, apologetic about America's role in it, or both.
Consequently, when repression persisted in Russia, and America went to war in the gulf, the peace dividend was pronounced dead. Had the case for it depended on Mikhail Gorbachev becoming head of Amnesty International and Saddam Hussein being as reasonable as the Bush Administration thought he was before Aug. 2, it would deserve its demise.
But it didn't. And doesn't. Given the drastic weakening of the Communist military, the great increase in industrial strength of our allies and America's proven military superiority over any likely adversary, a military budget that is less than two-thirds of our current expenditure would more than suffice to keep us the strongest power in the world.
What taxpayers are entitled to after 45 years of carrying a grossly disproportionate share of the non-Communist world's military burden is a "victory dividend." It is a dividend, because it is more than $100 billion a year that we can use for health care, deficit reduction, education or any other purpose. It is a victory dividend because it has been made possible by our success in the cold war and the increased self-defense capacity of our allies.
It is not a call to disarm. We should retain the ability to deter nuclear war, to deploy air, sea and land power rapidly around the globe when our vital interests are at stake, and to reassure weak nations threatened by belligerent neighbors. The consensus to keep such a force is overwhelming in Congress and the country.
In fact, the weapons used by the U.S. in the gulf were not the controversial ones of the 80's. The MX and Midgetman missiles, the B-1 and B-2 bombers, anti-satellite weapons, and Strategic Defense Initiative were irrelevant to victory in Iraq and will be to future conflicts of this sort. (The effort to claim the Patriot for the S.D.I. program is one of the great acts of intellectual piracy of our time.)
We demonstrably do not need a huge land force in Europe and a $5 billion a year subsidy for Japan in the form of American forces stationed there. Nor do we need to add tens of billions of dollars to a nuclear deterrent already more than sufficient to its task.
The victory dividend can also be used for foreign policy objectives not achievable through military strength. If we took a small part of the money we spend on NATO and applied it to debt reduction in Latin America, we would be better off morally and from the standpoint of national security.
There will be debate over how much of our victory dividend should be used to reduce the deficit, how much should go to meet social needs, and how much should be spent to avoid war. But properly understood -- as a recognition of West's great success, rather than as a declaration that the world is now safe for pacifism -- the case for a phased-in reduction of military spending should not be controversial.
In fact, the choice of reducing our deficit, inoculating our children against disease, and repairing our bridges and roads versus sending large sums to subsidize Japan and Europe should be an easy one.

HEADLINE: Burdens of Keeping New York City Going Must Be Shared

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Public Servants: Public Spirited?" (editorial, April 21), calling on New York City's municipal unions to be "social statesmen" as in the 1970's and to agree to furloughs of city employees, misrepresents the situation. 
 For months, municipal union leaders have advocated actions to share the pain, to have all parts of the community absorb some costs to keep the city going. The policy of furloughs or layoffs, unfortunately, would land disproportionately hard on the employees of the city and lower- and middle-income residents who rely on the city for health care, education, parks and recreation.
Union leaders have strongly advocated for months that the city downsize its structural costs with a management-controlled attrition plan and an early retirement program. These alone would reduce the city payroll by many thousands of employees -- without the pain (and added unemployment insurance and welfare costs) of layoffs or forced furloughs.
Further, we have maintained for years that the city could save hundreds of millions by control of a contracting-out process that costs more than $10 billion a year. A moratorium on outside contracts or an agency-by-agency program to reduce even 5 percent of the total spent on them would significantly reduce the city's budget costs.
We too would like to see more of the spirit of the 1970's that you recall, in which all New Yorkers work and share together.

HEADLINE: Don't Make Greece Europe's Black Sheep

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Club of Europe Is Seething About Greece" (The Week in Review, April 7), your report from Athens about alleged gossip in Brussels attacking Greece, claims that Greece has ignored European Community regulations and has used the Community "as a cash register." 
 The most recent report from the European Community Court indicates that in 1989 the number of cases brought before it involving Italy, for example, was almost double that for Greece. Moreover, the history of farmers misusing Community funds predates Greek membership, for instance, the infamous case of olive growers in Italy claiming to have far more trees than they actually had, to claim bigger grants.
Nor are northern Europeans beyond reproach: last year the Community Court of Auditors uncovered a $50 million sting involving British, Danish and French farmers re-exporting wheat from Germany to Eastern Europe to qualify for grants.
European Community aid is too little to have much impact. Greece and Portugal are the two poorest Community members, and in 1989, the Court of Auditors reports, they received nearly equal grants from the regional and social funds. However, Portugal lost out under the common agricultural policy, a Communitywide system, because of the commodities covered. Greek farmers received more from its price-support mechanism, but the money went to individual farmers, not public infrastructure projects.
You compare Greece with Portugal. The Portuguese economy has recently grown faster than Greece's. However, Portuguese inflation rates fell significantly below those of Greece only in the late 1980's. Athens has introduced austerity measures, so that the rate of money supply is lower in Greece than in Portugal. Moreover, economic growth is higher in Greece than in Britain, Denmark or the United States. The Greek economy is thus showing some signs of promise.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Big Losses For Ford And G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 30

 BODY:
The nation's two biggest auto makers announced huge first-quarter losses today.
The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest car maker, reported a net loss of $377 million. It would have reported a $1.1 billion loss except for one-time gains from an accounting change and the sale of the G.M. Building in New York. 
 The Ford Motor Company posted a quarterly loss of $884 million.
Although the companies' failure to make money was unsurprising, given the slumping economy, the size of the losses underscored the vulnerability of the nation's biggest manufacturing industry to worldwide competition.
 
Ford Sees Improvement
 Ford's vehicle production and sales to dealers are expected to improve sharply in this quarter, but Ford said it would probably not be profitable because of competitive pressure in the American market caused by a glut of worldwide production capacity. Moreover, Ford said it would be "difficult" to make a profit for 1991.
Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive of G.M., said the company was facing "the toughest and most competitive North American automotive market in the corporation's history."
Both auto makers have been slashing expenses and laying off salaried workers, but the collective bargaining agreement reached last fall with the United Automobile Workers union, which guaranteed income for all hourly workers regardless of layoffs, has prevented the companies from reducing their labor expense as production has dropped. In addition, the cost of discounting remains about $900 for each Ford car and truck, and $1,100 for each G.M. vehicle.
 
Chrysler Loss Also Expected
 "The gross profit margins at G.M. and Ford were up slightly from the fourth quarter, but those were so bad as to be off the scale," said Ronald A. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "In the case of both companies, the profit margins are significantly worse than in the past."
The Chrysler Corporation, the No. 3 domestic auto maker, is scheduled to release its results on Wednesday, and automotive analysts are forecasting a large loss.
G.M.'s shares rose $1.75 each today, to $35.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Ford's stock gained 62.5 cents, to $32.50.
G.M.'s $377 million net loss compared with a $710 million profit in the first quarter of last year. Sales declined 3.1 percent, to $29.2 billion.
G.M.'s loss attributable to its common stock was $461 million, in contrast to a profit last year of $619 million, or $1.02 a common share. The latest results included a gain of $403 million, or 66 cents a share, on the G.M. Building sale and $303 million, or 50 cents a share, as a result of G.M.'s decision to account for the expense of spare parts in the year they are used, rather than immediately.
Ford's $884 million loss compared with a profit of $506 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. Ford's revenue dropped nearly 10 percent, to $21.3 billion.
Ford's heaviest losses came in North America, but the overseas operations were also unprofitable. Ford's American automotive operations lost $947 million, in contrast to a profit of $160 million a year earlier. Overseas automotive operations lost $208 million, in contrast to a profit of $155 million last year.
Ford's factory sales of vehicles to dealers, on which the company books revenue and profit, dropped almost 25 percent, to 590,000, in the quarter. Overseas factory sales were down 1.1 percent, to 651,000 cars and trucks.
Ford was particularly hard hit by losses in Britain, its most important overseas market. David N. McCammon, vice president-finance, said the British car market was "worse than in the United States."
One bright spot was Ford's financial services group, which earned a record $271 million, up 42 percent from a year earlier. The increase reflected strong results of the Ford Credit Company and the Associates.
Ford's First Nationwide savings and loan unit, which added $66 million to its reserves to cover bad loans, lost $20.9 million, in contrast to a profit of $35.9 million a year earlier. On April 1, First Nationwide signed an agreement with Federal regulators to overhaul its management practices.
G.M. said many of its worldwide businesses, including vehicle sales overseas, performed well. European profits were at a record, but they were overwhelmed by the losses of the North American automotive business. On Monday, G.M.'s E.D.S. unit reported higher profits while its General Motors Acceptance Corporation and GM Hughes units posted lower earnings.
The single most important factor in the North American losses was lower volume. G.M. said North American factory sales were down 13.9 percent in the quarter, to just over a million cars and trucks, while worldwide factory sales were down 8.8 percent, to 1.65 million.
In addition, G.M. was building more lower-priced models with fewer options than a year earlier, a spokesman said, and it was still paying rebates averaging $1,100 a vehicle.
About 37 percent of G.M.'s cars were sold to fleets, including daily-rental fleets, a business that is less profitable than the normal retail business. A year earlier, about 26 percent of G.M.'s cars were sold to fleets.
Ford's sales to rental fleets are projected to average about 26 percent of all car sales for 1991, up from 22 percent last year.
Both companies expressed optimism, supported by recent consumer confidence surveys, that retail sales will improve this year. They conceded that the timing and magnitude of the recovery were uncertain.
But Mr. McCammon warned that personal income levels remained low and unemployment was high -- and that both factors directly affected vehicle sales. He applauded the Federal Reserve's decision today to lower the discount rate, which he predicted would make it easier for consumers to get auto loans.
After two progressively stronger months of vehicle sales in February and March, sales were down in the first 20 days of April. Ford said it thought the downturn might be temporary, caused by the expiration of several incentive programs in March.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the quarterly reports of the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company misstated Ford's first-quarter revenue in some editions. It was $21.3 billion, down 9.7 percent from $23.6 billion in the comparable quarter last year. The article also misstated the first-quarter performance of two of G.M.'s non-automotive units in some editions. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation had lower, not higher, profits; the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation had lower profits, not a loss.

HEADLINE: William Paton, 101, Pioneer Accountant, Theorist and Scholar

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
William A. Paton, a certified public accountant who was a pioneer in modern accounting theory, died Friday at the Whitehall Convalescent Home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 101 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.
Dr. Paton, who received a Ph.D. in economics in 1917 from the University of Michigan, taught accounting at his alma mater for 45 years. He started as an instructor in 1914, was named a full professor in 1921 and at his retirement in 1959 was named the Edwin Francis Gay Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Accounting and of Economics by the university. 
 In 1987 he was named "Educator of the Century" by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
In the 1920's Dr. Paton was one of the first accounting theorists to argue that economic factors, like inflation and interest rates, should be considered when presenting a company's financial picture, rather than just a listing of the assets and liabilities of the owners.
In his years as a teacher, he had contact with more than 20,000 students. Many became corporate leaders, including Roger Smith, former chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, and Lynn A. Townsend, former chairman of the Chrysler Corporation.
Dr. Paton wrote dozens of books and hundreds of articles. His many awards and honors included the naming of the accounting center at the University of Michigan in his honor. He was the editor of "Accountants' Handbook," a widely used source book for certified public accountants. He was also a founder of the American Accounting Association and in 1926 began Accounting Review, the oldest scholarly journal in accounting.
He is survived by a son, William Jr., of Saline, Mich.; a daughter, Margaret Buttrell of Denver, and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Tsongas Is First Entrant In '92 Presidential Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., April 30

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts began a long-shot campaign for the Presidency today with a scornful indictment of "Washington mediocrity" and a plea for "a different path" toward economic and political renewal.
With a quietly reflective speech here and in his hometown of Lowell, Mass., Mr. Tsongas became the first official candidate of the 1992 Presidential campaign. 
 "Today I begin a journey of purpose," he said at an outdoor rally in Lowell, where hundreds of supporters listened stoically through a driving rain. "I ask you to come with me."
Mr. Tsongas (the name is pronounced SONG-guss) enters a race for the Democratic Presidential nomination that seems frozen by the war in the Persian Gulf, the remarkable popularity of President Bush and the fear among many Democrats that the President is all but unbeatable. Democrats from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Senator Al Gore of Tennessee have been considering a race, but only Mr. Tsongas, who left the Senate six years ago because he had cancer, has taken the plunge.
 
'Values of Our Ancestors'
 The 50-year-old Massachusetts Democrat, who underwent a successful bone marrow transplant five years ago, seemed untroubled today by the conventional wisdom, which holds that his chances for the nomination are slim. Indeed, he offered his candidacy as an antidote to politics-as-usual, seeming to play to the same restless mood among voters that showed up in numerous public opinion polls and some elections last year.
He talked of returning to "the values of our ancestors" and of recognizing the nation's responsibility to future generations by refusing to burden them with a spoiled environment and a bloated Federal debt. "In the Apache tongue the word for grandfather and grandson is the same," said Mr. Tsongas, surrounded by his wife and three daughters. "They understood linkage. They understood honor. They understood mutual obligation.
"In Washington there is no such wisdom. It is all here and now. It is all polling data. The vision extends only to the next election."
This failure of political leadership, Mr. Tsongas said, has left the nation drifting, falling far short of its destiny. "We were never meant to be the world's greatest debtor nation," he said. "We were never meant to have American workers rank ninth in the world in wages. We were never meant to have dysfunctional schools or imploding cities or racial disharmony or an evironment at risk."
 
A Harder, Steeper Path
 In contrast to the made-for-television messages of most political speeches, Mr. Tsongas's announcement speech had an almost mystical tone. "I offer a different path," he said, "harder but more hopeful, longer but more compelling, steeper but more worthy."
He compared the political journey facing the nation to his own journey past cancer. "Born out of that adversity was a commitment to devote myself to those people and to those issues that truly matter to me," he said.
So far, Mr. Tsongas's campaign has revolved around what he sees as the nation's serious economic decline, and he says this demands new thinking and new policies, like a more aggressive Federal role in helping businesses develop new technologies. He presents himself as a pro-business liberal who is committed to an "economic renaissance," and he breaks with fellow Democrats on several issues.
 
A Loyal Audience in Lowell
 Mr. Tsongas supports a carefully targeted cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment. He backs nuclear power as a means of easing the nation's dependence on fossil fuels, a stance he did not mention here in New Hampshire, where the issue has long been controversial. And he backs a free trade pact with Mexico, an issue that has caused bitter debate among Democrats.
His announcement in Lowell this morning drew a loyal audience that came packing umbrellas and determined enthusiasm. "He's a hometown guy, what do you think?" said David Gannon, when asked where he stood on Mr. Tsongas.
The new candidate delivered his speech against a backdrop of renovated textile mills, intended to reflect the economic development projects that Mr. Tsongas pushed for during much of his political career. Still, the "Massachusetts miracle" that Michael S. Dukakis rode to the Democratic nomination three years ago has long since faded.
From Lowell, Mr. Tsongas drove to New Hampshire, where the nation's first Presidential primary will be held early next year, then flew on to Iowa, which holds the first caucuses. In New Hampshire he spoke on the Manchester campus of the University of New Hampshire, where some Democratic politicians shied away from assessing his chances but noted that he certainly had an opportunity to fill a void.
"It seems there's few other Democrts with the courage or the wherewithal to jump into the field," said Joseph Grandmaison, former state Democratic chairman. "That gives him an opportunity."
Peggy Connolly, spokeswoman for the campaign, said the response of much of the Democratic establishment was "cordial but not enthusiastic." She said Mr. Tsongas, whose campaign at the moment has a full-time paid staff of three, would obviously not be "the Democratic Party establishment candidate."
Still, he plans several trips to Iowa, including a two-week stay there in July. And his announcement tour this week will also take him to Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Calif., and Tampa, Fla.
The campaign is clearly sensitive to the issue of Mr. Tsongas's health, making the candidate's physician, Dr. Tak Takvorian, generally available. Dr. Takvorian, who treated Mr. Tsongas for lymphoma, said the former Senator has shown no sign of the disease since he underwent the bone marrow transplant in 1986.
Regardless of Mr. Tsongas's chances for the nomination, there was the reassuring air today of the old rituals of Presidential campaigns grinding forward once again: the bus motorcades from Manchester to Logan International Airport in Boston, the New Hampshire pols sizing up a candidate, the audiences willing and eager for applause lines. "Let's go!" Mr. Tsongas exclaimed at Lowell today -- and with a lurch, the campaign began anew.

HEADLINE: At This Circus, The Sideshow Is in the Kitchen

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
"I NEVER had sushi before I joined the circus," David Lebel, an acrobat, was saying the other day between numbers at the Cirque du Soleil, the French Canadian circus that is appearing at Battery Park City in New York through May 19.
When people think of a circus, they usually picture tumblers, contortionists and clowns. Ah, but here the real theater is in the kitchen. 
 In a small yellow-striped tent tucked behind the big top and no more than a back flip or two from the Hudson River, a kitchen manager, two chefs, a pastry chef and two or three assistants ply the 105 cast and crew with food that could make just about anyone want to run away and join the circus.
"The food is as good as the show," Mr. Lebel said. "At a lot of circuses, you're pretty much on your own. Here, it's like having a gourmet restaurant under a tent."
The impresario behind this smaller scale but equally ambitious production is Laurent Comeau, a 47-year-old former restaurant chef who has been the Cirque's kitchen manager for three years. Mr. Comeau, a thick-waisted Acadian with spiky reddish hair, darts about constantly inside the three trailers that form the nucleus of the mobile kitchen, pantry and dining area.
With black rubber bracelets dangling from his wrist and one pierced ear, a rakish reminder of the 10 years he was the chief steward on a cargo ship, Mr. Comeau is passionate about his latest moving kitchen. He can see the poetry in puff pastry and takes pleasure in cosseting the performers, technicians and family members in his care.
He knows their favorite foods and routinely puts heaping plates aside for performers who like to put off supper until after the last show. He also keeps plastic cups of ice in the freezer for bruised knees, and a blender on standby in case someone's infant needs "these little concoctions," as he puts it.
From 7 A.M., when the kichen opens, until 2 A.M., when it closes, anywhere from 300 to 500 meals are turned out every day of the week except Monday, when the performers are off.
Mealtime never officially ends. Breakfast flows into lunch and lunch into dinner as the chefs refill the steam tables in a shifting kaleidoscope of tastes and smells. The espresso, a dark roast shipped in from Seattle, is served Quebec style in two-handled bowls. And except for wine, beer and soft drinks, all the provisions are free.
It is all a far cry from the way of life at other circuses. At the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, for instance, cast members can buy sandwiches and snacks from the pie cars on the trains that house and transport them. The Big Apple Circus, whose performers live in trailers, has a mobile cookhouse featuring mostly Southern fare, where the crew members eat free and the performers pay a small fee.
Yet many performers in both shows -- for reasons of health, economy and convenience -- tend to fend for themselves. Either they find restaurants where they can grab a healthful bite between shows, or they make do in small kitchens with limited pantries.
"It's not really my type of food," David Dimitri, a tightrope walker with the Big Apple Circus and self-taught cook, said of the fare at the cookhouse. But he perked up when the conversation turned to the Cirque, where he once ate as a guest. "They have a real cookhouse," he said. "It's more like a restaurant."
Mr. Comeau is aware that other circus performers are a bit envious of the Cirque's pampering. Not only are the meals paid for, but the Cirque's cast and crew are put up in hotels like the Marriott in lower Manhattan.
"The other circuses, they call this the Cadillac tour," Mr. Comeau said. The perks do add up, of course, and the show's owner, Groupe du Soleil of Montreal, charges slightly more to cover its costs. As a result, in some cities, the Cirque's cheapest seats cost more than Ringling Brothers' most expensive ones.
To be sure, Mr. Comeau grapples with constraints that few kitchen managers face. One trailer serves as his refrigerator and freezer. The other day, it was packed with melons, salmon pate, cheeses and a shipment of quail for Sunday night's supper. "I'd rather have pigeon," he said, "but good pigeon is so hard to find."
Another trailer doubles as the bakery and the library. A well-worn copy of Larousse Gastronomique is one of dozens of references and cookbooks, most in French, stuffed inside the cubbyholes. All the cooking takes place in a third trailer, 38 feet long by 6 feet wide.
Meat, fish and dry goods are delivered once or twice a week. But Mr. Comeau must find new sources for many perishable or hard-to-stock items like fresh bread, croissants and cheese each time the circus picks up tent. He often resorts to specialty stores like Dean & DeLuca in New York. "There's no real supermarket in Manhattan," he muttered.
The search for fresh, tasty ingredients is harder than one might imagine, he said, even in a metropolis like New York. New York bagels? Don't ask. "They look like doughnuts," Mr. Comeau said contemptuously. What about the smoked meats? Forget it. "The closest thing you have is pastrami," he said.
Where he has no problem with a local product, his charges often do. For instance, he scrambles to find Canadian maple syrup for the Quebecers in the troupe, who expect it on or in everything from pancakes to maple mousse pie. Mr. Comeau thinks Vermont maple syrup is just as good, "but try explaining it to them," he said. "The contortionists, it's like wine to them. They'll taste it and know right away if it's not from Quebec."
Lack of counter space also forces Mr. Comeau to make compromises. For instance, he would prefer to do his own butchering, but he buys his meat precut.
His biggest challenge is a clientele that never changes, one reason he hired Emile Poulier, one of his two chefs, away from a Montreal restaurant. Mr. Comeau said Mr. Poulier impressed him in his job interview because Mr. Poulier said he was bored cooking the same menu night after night. "I knew he would experiment," Mr. Comeau said.
Last Saturday, lunch featured five different selections of Indian cuisine, including curried lamb and apricot chutney with cranberries. There were also two vegetarian dishes, in addition to cheese souffle and vegetable-corn soup. For nibbling, there were platters of croissants, mounds of cranberry muffins and loaves of French bread. Dessert was a sugar pie that tasted like pure butterscotch. Mr. Comeau also keeps cereals on hand, and a salad bar is always open, piled high with huge artichokes, slices of cantaloupe and bunches of grapes.
On special occasions, the kitchen goes all out. It prepares an opening dinner in each city, complete with Champagne, escargots, sushi and other delicacies. It also does weddings, in one case a rabbit dinner for 125 people and a wedding cake -- or more precisely, a croquembouche, a pyramid-shaped confection doused with caramelized sugar.
On Saturday, Mr. Comeau was behaving like a bombardier on a precision raid, plopping lemon-poppy seed drops on an outdoor patio table, where some performers were gathered, and vanishing before anyone could protest. "See, this is what happens," said Julie Dewhurst, whose husband and son are the show's tightrope walkers.
"Well, you can't be rude, can you?" her husband, Brian, said, popping one of the warm cookies into his mouth. Unlike his wife, he never frets about his weight. "Most of the acrobats are training during the day and working at night, so they need a lot of calories," he said.
Other performers find Mr. Comeau's kitchen a tough test since it doubles as the town hall, the place to drop by to exchange gossip, play backgammon and check out any new romances. "What's hard is not eating something each time you come in, when you come in 10 times a day," said 12-year-old Laurence Racine, a contortionist.
Still, no one is a fanatic calorie-counter. "They're athletes, but they're not Olympic athletes," Mr. Comeau said. He gets occasional complaints, he said, "about too much butter in the vegetables, and you see them eat three pieces of cake."
For all this, Mr. Comeau is paid about $300 a week less than what he made on the ship, but he couldn't care less. "I'm having more fun than I ever had in my life," he said. "I'm finally managing a kitchen that has respect for food. It's priceless."

 1. To make the crust, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the lard, and with a pastry cutter or two forks, cut the lard into the flour until the mixture resembles small peas. Add the ice water, 2 tablespoons at a time, and mix with two knives. Add just enough water so that all the flour is incorporated and the dough pulls together into a rough ball.
2. Turn out onto a lightly floured board, and with a rolling pin flatten the dough into a 6-inch square. Scatter the butter pieces all over the dough, then fold the dough in half. Roll the dough back out into a 6-inch square, then fold and roll out again. Repeat once more, then cover the dough with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for an hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and allow to soften.
5. To make the filling, combine the sugar, condensed milk, flour and butter in a medium-size bowl. Stir until smooth.
6. On a lightly floured board roll out the dough until it is 1/4 inch thick. Gently lift the dough, and put it in a 9-inch pie pan. Trim the edges, then pour in the filling. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 325 degrees, and continue baking for another 25 minutes. The filling will look cracked and bumpy. Do not overbake.
Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

HEADLINE: Japanese in U.S. Aiding Charities As Volunteers

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
If Toshio Matsunami's countrymen in Tokyo could have seen him and several of his co-workers, they would not have believed it. There he was, the executive vice president of the Fuji Bank and Trust Company, carrying rubbish out of a building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan that is being turned into a residence for the homeless. Nearby, two bank managers were painting a ceiling in the building.
In Japan such activity is virtually unheard of: helping the needy is considered the government's duty. But exposure to American customs and a desire not to be seen as interested only in making money has led Japanese executives and their employees to rethink their relationship with the United States, its people and its problems. 
 "We don't want Americans to see us as Godzillas," said Akiko Mitsui, a 26-year-old Fuji assistant vice president, twisting her face to imitate the fire-breathing monster of Japanese films. Miss Mitsui said she had worked on five renovations on the Lower East Side "for personal satisfaction."
 
A Shift in Style
 Charitable work by Japanese executives and professionals living in America is becoming more common as a tiny but growing number of them plunge into philanthropic ventures.
And with that surge of activity has come occasional questioning about whether the Japanese initiatives are goodwill gestures or calculated public relations. Nonetheless, the Japanese are serving on fund-raising boards like the United Way, teaching language classes, counseling students, joining charity marathons and finding jobs for teen-agers.
Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Center for International Exchange, with offices in New York City and Tokyo, said there was a clear shift in style: until recently most Japanese companies "simply wrote checks to big universities and cultural centers."
"Now they are working in depressed neighborhoods and developing real human contacts instead of being locked up in a bank or boardroom," he said, adding that the companies and their employees realized that they needed to become "good corporate citizens."
"These days the term 'stakeholder' has entered their business jargon," he said, "and corporate leaders understand that unless they help protect the environment and improve schools, they will suffer."
That sentiment, Japanese executives say, is reflected around the country.
 
Involvement in Communities
 In New York City, for example, Japanese executives are not only working to create shelters for the homeless, but are also joining their American counterparts in trying to help the city develop strategies to ease its budget gap and improve the economy.
The Bank of California, owned by Mitsubishi Bank, has encouraged its 3,700 employees to volunteer in the community, including working at shelters for the homeless and residences for battered women or abused children. It also donates money to organizations where its employees serve.
In Seattle, the Japan-American Society got the wives of some Japanese executives to work in day-care centers in the inner city, pairing them with the wives of American businessmen.
After building a plant in rural Georgetown, Ky., Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A., voluntarily donated $15 million to county schools because the plant was financed in part with tax-free bonds.
Some Japanese executives say their philanthropy helps counter anti-Japanese sentiment, while others argue that companies that demonstrate a social conscience attract more customers.
 
Likened to Investments
 Osamu Yamada, chairman of the Bank of California, says Japanese companies should apply the same care to giving and volunteering as they do to business investments. "We will not make progress if Japanese goods are no longer thought of as cheap, but Japanese companies are," he said.
Jiro Ishizaka, chairman of the Union Bank in California, who helped raise $1.85 million from 300 Japanese companies for the United Way, said he had done so because "I wanted to improve the image of Japanese companies, and I also wished to have Japanese enterprises recognize the importance of corporate citizenship."
Whatever the motive, Japanese involvement in charities in the United States is spreading. And nowhere does it seem more ventursome than with the Fuji bankers in Manhattan.
 
Involvement 'Very Natural'
 "When did anyone see a dozen Japanese officials walking along Avenue D at 9:30 on a Saturday morning?" asked Gabriel D. Boratgis, an administrator of the Lower East Side Catholic Conference Area, an association that is developing the shelter for the homeless.
"It's tremendous that the Japanese are coming into our neighborhood and trying to help with a problem that troubles all of us."
Mr. Matsumani said that when he worked for Fuji in San Francisco he was not impelled to volunteer. But after moving to New York City, he saw "that it is very natural for concerned people to be involved, to do whatever they could to help."
With at least 3,000 Japanese companies in the United States, 70 formal philanthropic programs and 23 company foundations, the Japanese are becoming more visible and more influential. Six hundred of the Japanese companies are in the New York area.
 
Variety of Efforts
 A survey of Japanese companies in the United States conducted for the Japan Society underscores the evolution of Japanese corporate thinking.
"An increasing number of companies see being a good corporate citizen involves nondiscriminatory hiring and promotion practices, encouraging employees to volunteer, lending the corporation's prestige to support commmunity goals and puchasing supplies from local firms," said Daniel E. Bob, an assistant director of the society, which got in touch with nearly 3,000 Japanese companies and received responses from 585.
A few Japanese leaders have goaded companies to act. One such leader is Sadahei Kusumoto, president of the Minolta Corporation. Mr. Kusumoto spends five hours a week campaigning for United Way of Bergen County, N.J. Recently he proposed that Japanese companies contribute one-tenth of 1 percent of all American sales to philanthropy.
Tsuneo Tanaka, who is leaving after five years as president of Hitachi America, an electronics company, decided to give $10,000 checks to the volunteer ambulance corps and the Fire Department in Tarrytown, N.Y., where Hitachi has its headquarters, instead of having a farewell party.
But expansion of Japanese giving and volunteering has its negative side.
 
Some American Skepticism
 Some American foundations have voiced skepticism and concern about the independence of the Global Partnership Center, which the Japanese Government has established with a $375 million endowment. The organization will have offices in Tokyo and New York and is supposed to help the United States and Japan look together at issues like urban poverty, aging, the environment and crime. The critics maintain it could be just a device for polishing Japan's image.
And Dr. Delwin A. Roy, president of the Hitachi Foundation, cited lingering suspicions that the Japanese were using philanthropy to gain access to American technology or to influence American education.
"Such comments continue to crop up in Congress, the media and within the philanthropy community," he said, adding: "Given the decline in funds for social needs, one would expect Japanese giving to be encouraged, not discouraged."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in U.S. Trading And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher yesterday against most key currencies after falling overseas.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $356 a troy ounce, up 10 cents from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $355.75 an ounce, off 50 cents. 
 The dollar started out lower in Asian and European markets on concern about the sagging United States economy, but rallied later in domestic trading.
Dealers said traders snapped up dollars because they were attracted to the currency's lower rates, which stemmed in part from a drop in two key interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
The Fed cut the discount rate and the Federal funds rate to help bring the nation out of the recession, and banks followed suit yesterday by trimming the prime lending rate half a percentage point, to 8 1/2 percent.
Earl Johnson, a vice president for Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said United States traders shrugged off the prime cut because they had been anticipating one for days.
Also helping the dollar, Mr. Johnson said, was a survey released yesterday by the nation's purchasing managers, which said that while the manufacturing economy declined in April, it showed some modest signs of recovery.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 136.64 Japanese yen, from 137.42 yen Tuesday. It stood at 137.60 yen in London, and at 138.15 yen in New York, up from 136.15 yen Tuesday.
Against the German currency, the dollar moved up in New York to 1.7100 marks, from 1.7067, after tumbling more than 4 pfennigs on Tuesday after the United States interest rate cut.
Against the British pound, the dollar was mixed compared with Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.7265 in London, up from $1.7235, and $1.7225 in New York, down from $1.7325.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late quotes, included: 1.4480 Swiss francs, up from 1.4410; 5.7885 French francs, up from 5.7760; 1,266.00 Italian lire, up from 1,263.00, and 1.15175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15285.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $357 an ounce, from $357.60 late Tuesday. The Zurich market was closed yesterday for the May Day holiday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.70 an ounce to close at $357.01.
Silver prices were lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.95 a troy ounce, down 1.9 cents from Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $3.98 an ounce from $3.99.

HEADLINE: Therapists Say a Single Session May Be Enough

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
In keeping with the mood of the times to economize in all things, some therapists are saying that a single session of psychotherapy is enough for most people.
The approach capitalizes on the fact that on average about a third of the people who consult a therapist never return for a second session, making one session the most frequent length of therapy.
The advocates of single-session therapy argue that what is so often a person's only therapeutic encounter should be used to maximize its effect. 
 But they also contend that for many, if not most, people, one therapy session can leave them with the tools and the encouragement to handle their problems on their own. For example, a single session may be all that is required to give a person the resolve to end a destructive relationship.
 
Idea Seems Absurd to Some
 "It's not hard to be helpful to somebody in a single session," said Dr. Bernard Bloom, a psychologist at the University of Colorado who is an originator of the approach.
For most psychoanalysts and other psychotherapists who routinely do therapy lasting months or years, the idea seems absurd. And even some therapists who have milder reactions are skeptical.
Typical was the reaction of Dr. Robert Michels, dean at the Cornell Medical School who is a former chairman of the psychiatry department."In my clinical experience," he said, "a single session of therapy is unlikely to be enough for most patients."
Even so, Dr. Simon Budman, a psychologist at the Harvard Community Health Plan in Boston, said: "There is more single-session therapy going on than many therapists realize. I find that 10 to 15 percent of my clients only need a single session."
 
Panic About the Future
 Recently, Dr. Budman treated a college senior who had been suffering from panic attacks. The first occurred in the initial meeting of a second-semester course, when the instructor asked students to introduce themselves and tell their plans for the future.
"He got so panicked, he had to walk out," Dr. Budman said, after which the student became increasingly anxious because of the fear he would have more attacks.
In talking to the student, Dr. Budman discovered that he was worried about his future. "Here it was, the end of his senior year and he was unsure about what he would do next," Dr. Budman said. "I pointed out that it was entirely appropriate for him to be anxious in his situation."
Sometimes, Dr. Budman said, all a person needs to hear is that his or her reaction is normal given the circumstances. Four months after their single meeting, Dr. Budman called the student and found that he had not had any more panic attacks.
Normally, therapists use the first session, or several, to gather information about a client, delaying therapeutic intervention until later. But single-session advocates argue that, in addition, therapists should use the initial session to make interventions and suggestions that can have therapeutic effect.
"You can say from the outset, let's see what I can do to be helpful to you in an hour or so," Dr. Bloom said. "When the hour is over, the person can have gotten enough to make a change in his life."
Dr. Bloom's book, "Planned Short-term Psychotherapy," which describes methods for brief therapy, including single sessions, will be published in August by Allyn & Bacon.
To be sure, even the most enthusiastic supporters of single-session therapy admit limitations. Perhaps the most important is how long a person expects the therapy to last.
"If a client comes in the door expecting long-term therapy, single-session therapy can't work," said Dr. Moshe Talmon, a psychologist at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Hayward, Calif., a leading advocate of the approach. But he said that most first-time patients in community clinics and prepaid medical plans do not expect therapy to last long.
People who need more than a single session, Dr. Talmon said, include those with problems so severe, like psychosis or suicidal feelings, that they require hospital treatment, or with conditions like manic-depression, which require a longer period to find the proper medication.
Still, Dr. Talmon said, most people who go to therapists are appropriate candidates for a single session, especially those have a specific problem, like family conflicts.
"At the beginning I thought single-session therapy would be most helpful for less severe and acute problems," Dr. Talmon said. "But when a problem is very urgent and painful, people are motivated to change quickly."
Data supporting the single-session treatment has come from a variety of studies, often unexpectedly. For example, one of the earliest was a follow-up of 141 people who had consulted therapists on only one occasion in community clinics in New York City. Done in the 1950's, the study found that two-thirds said they had been helped, though their therapists thought of them as "dropouts."
Indirect evidence of benefit came from a 1979 study of 304 patients in a prepaid medical plan in California. The study found that people who consulted a psychotherapist for a single session had a 60 percent decline in their use of all other medical services over the next five years.
And in recent research, 200 patients who had consulted a therapist just once at a California prepaid medical plan were called several months later; 78 percent said they had got what they wanted out of that single session and felt better about the problem. The research is reported in Dr. Talmon's book "Single Session Therapy," published last year by Jossey-Bass.
One of the first to suggest that a single session could be therapeutic was David Malan, a British psychoanalyst who was one of the developers of short-term psychotherapy, which usually lasts from 8 to 20 sessions. Dr. Malan, writing in the 1970's, said that there could be a "powerful potential therapeutic effect both of telling a patient that he must take the responsibility for his own life, and of reassuring him that he can manage without therapeutic help."
Those principles are at the heart of the method Dr. Talmon has developed for single-session therapy. Right from the start of the session, Dr. Talmon recommends, therapists should suggest that the single meeting may be sufficient, while leaving open the possibility that more therapy may be necessary. The session should be scheduled for two hours rather than the usual one, he advises.
From the patient's early description of the problem, the therapist must find a focus that seems to be the main issue, and identify strengths in the patient that might be used to deal constructively with the situation.
 
Break for Final Thoughts
 Then the therapist suggests a step the patient could take toward a solution and helps the patient rehearse that step. For example, with a woman who came to Dr. Talmon because she was full of anger and guilt over her father's forced sex with her in childhood, Dr. Talmon recommended a ritual in which she burned her father's picture along with her written account of the sexual abuse and her feelings of outrage. He said she required no further therapy.
In general, just before the end of one session, Dr. Talmon takes a brief break from the room while the client thinks about any issues that have not been aired. In his closing remarks, Dr. Talmon acknowledges the client's emotional upset, reviews what positive qualities the patient has to deal with the problem on the client's own, and suggests a simple task that will be a step toward its solution.
He also says that the patient can come back for more any time. Most, Dr. Talmon says, do not.

HEADLINE: 161 Hospitals Found With High Death Rates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Federal health officials today listed 161 hospitals with higher-than-expected death rates for Medicare patients, including 15 that have had high rates for four years in a row. Six of the 15 were in Puerto Rico.
In all, about 3 percent of the nation's more than 5,600 hospitals were found to have death rates significantly higher than expected, about the same proportion as in earlier years. 
 The information, included in the government's fourth annual report compiling data in 25 volumes, is intended to give consumers a yardstick for choosing a hospital.
 Medicare is the government health care program for the elderly and disabled. It has 34 million beneficiaries, and in 1989 about 6.4 million of them were hospitalized at least once.
This year's report covers 1987, 1988 and 1989. It differs from previous reports in that it includes deaths that occurred within 30, 90 and 180 days after hospital admission. The earlier studies reported deaths within 30 days. The new report also includes data on surgical procedures for the first time.
Though hospitals with repeatedly high mortality rates may have quality problems, some of them may actually be "fine institutions with unusually sick patients," the report said.
"In general, hospitals in this country, given the kinds of measurements we are using, appear to be performing well," said Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs the Medicare program.
"We are, of course, concerned about hospitals that are repeatedly showing on the list" of hospitals with higher-than-expected death rates of Medicare patients, she said.
But she emphasized that "mortality is not the only measure of quality." On further review, she said, "we have found that as many as one-third of the cases that appear to be problems may be, in fact, special characteristics of the patients that we are not able to adjust for."
The main factor that the calculations are unable to account for is the severity of illness of a hospital's patients.
The information is used by peer review organizations that conduct certification reviews of hospitals, Ms. Wilensky said.
The 161 hospitals that were identified were found to have significantly higher-than-expected death rates for Medicare patients at both 30 days and 180 days after admission in 1989.
Last year, 32 hospitals were reported to have exceeded the upper limit of the range of predicted mortality for 1986, 1987 and 1988. Fifteen of those hospitals were on this year's list of 161. Sixty-five hospitals were found to have higher-than-expected rates at 30 days after admission in 1987, 1988 and 1989.
In predicting a hospital's mortality rate, the agency considers age, gender, hospital admissions within the previous six months and reason for admission.
The agency's study of mortality rates has been criticized by researchers at New York University Medical Center. In the April 10 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, they contended that the agency's assessment of mortality rates was flawed because it does not properly consider the patient characteristics.
Officials at two Puerto Rican hospitals on the list of four-year repeaters, the Ponce District Hospital and the Dr. Ramon Ruiz Arnau Hospital, said the survey did not give enough weight to economic and other factors.

Money-Fund Yields Mixed, But Analysts Expect Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The yields on money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report remained mixed for the second straight seven-day period, which ended yesterday.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's said investors should see more declines in yields in the coming weeks as a result of the Federal Reserve's reduction Tuesday in its discount rate, the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks, to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent. 
 "This move was a surprise to the market," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's, "and we can't rule out another move by the central bank at a later date. We always live with one more move, whether it's up or down."
 
Tax-Exempt Yields Rise
 Analysts said they did not expect yields on money market funds to decline by more than about a quarter of a percentage point.
Yields on tax-exempt money funds increased for the second consecutive week, as supplies of new issues continue to overwhelm investor demand. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios declined by a day, to 45, while their total assets fell by $1.6 billion, to a total of $87.6 billion.
For the period ended yesterday, the average seven-day compounded yield rose 16 basis points, to 4.44 percent, while the seven-day simple yield increased 15 basis points, to 4.34 percent. The 30-day compounded average yield fell one basis point, to 4.29 percent, and the 30-day simple yield dropped four basis points, to 4.20 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt compunded yield is 6.16 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 6.62 percent in the 33 percent tax bracket.
 
Taxable Fund Assets Drop
 Among the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the General California Municipal money market fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation of Garden City, L.I., had the best return for the week at 5.32 percent.
The assets of taxable money market funds declined $4.5 billion, to a total of $456.9 billion, with the assets of consumer funds down by $2.9 billion, to $342.8 billion. The assets of institutional funds fell by $1.6 billion, to $114.1 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell six basis points, to 5.90 percent, while the 30-day yield fell seven basis points, to 6 percent.
For the fourth consecutive week ended yesterday, the taxable fund with the best return on investment was the Olde Premium Money Market Series with a yield of 6.84 percent. The distributor is the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, the average yield on money market accounts at banks, which compete with money market funds, fell one basis point, to 5.43 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: Indicators Are Up 0.5% In 2d Consecutive Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Sending an ambiguous message about the economy, the Government's principal forecasting index rose for the second straight month in March although most of its components fell.
The index of leading indicators rose five-tenths of 1 percent, after a 1.2 percent gain in February. The March increase was entirely caused by a surge in consumer expectations after the Persian Gulf war, but subsequent surveys have shown that that jump in confidence is ebbing. 
 Analysts generally regarded the results as mildly favorable but they said even a third straight increase, which is thought likely, would not indicate an imminent economic upturn.
 
Calculating Probabilities
 Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank, called the March result an "encouraging sign but by no means convincing evidence of the end of the recession." He calculated from the March data that the chance of economic recovery within the next six months is only 30 percent -- "far below the important 90 percent threshold used as confirmation of a business cycle turning point."
In a separate report today, a monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Managers showed the industrial sector of the economy declining at a slower pace in April for the third straight month. And the Federal Reserve said today that its survey of business conditions by district through April 21 found activity "remained weak in much of the nation, but there were some indications that the decline may be bottoming out."
Only 4 of the 11 components of the index contributed to the March advance, with the jump in consumer expectations, as compiled by the University of Michigan, adding more than three times as much as the second-biggest positive factor, which was an increase in the money supply.
The other pluses were increases in stock prices, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and a rise in permits to construct buildings.
The four components that moved up in March -- three of them financial or psychological -- were the same four that paced the February increase.
The seven negative March factors, ranked by their importance, were a decline in factories' orders for consumer goods and materials, a rise in average weekly new claims for state unemployment insurance, a decline in the length of the workweek, lower contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a fall in unfilled factory orders, a decline in the price of materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle and speedier deliveries by corporate suppliers.
"We're still declining, but at a slower rate," said Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "The issue is not whether we get a recovery but how strong and how soon." He predicted that an upturn would begin in late summer.
 
Two Other Indexes
 The leading index is intended to predict economic turns but failed to do so for this recession, which began in July. As complements to the index, the Commerce Department compiles indexes of indicators that tend to move at the same time as the economy and of indicators that trail behind it.
The index of coincident indicators fell five-tenths of 1 percent in March, the same as in February, its ninth straight decline. The latest two months, however, showed the smallest declines since August.
The index of lagging indicators rose three-tenths of 1 percent in March, continuing the zigzag pattern of the last 18 months.
The ratio of the coincident to the lagging index, which is considered a long lead-time predictor, fell for the seventh straight month.
Reflecting a longer average workweek than initially estimated, the department revised upward to 1.2 percent, from 1.1 percent, the advance in the leading index for February.
The leading index now stands at 141.1, with the first-quarter average 3.4 percent below its level a year earlier, today's report showed.

HEADLINE: Door Opens a Crack for Colombia's Indians

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
With his brown bowler hat, striped poncho and blue wraparound dress, Lorenzo Muelas Hurtado causes more than a sartorial clash as he moves among the delegates in business suits at Colombia's constitutional convention.
In politics, Indian tribal elders like Mr. Muelas have rarely found open doors among the capital's elite. 
 "We Indians were always called anti-social, delinquent, anti-Christian," Mr. Muelas, traditional leader of the Guambia tribal group, said between sessions of rewriting Colombia's Constitution, which dates from 1886. "Now, if I want to see the President of the Republic, I can see him tomorrow."
To the dismay of Colombia's political elite, the process of revising the oldest Constitution in Latin America has been thrown open to a host of new voices.
In a nation where Roman Catholicism has long enjoyed the advantages of an official religion, two delegates are Evangelical Protestants. In a political system restricted for decades to members of the Liberal or Conservative Parties, almost a third of the 73 delegates come from recently disarmed guerrilla groups.
And in a nation that in 1890 passed a law setting a 50-year target to "civilize the savages," three delegates speak for Colombia's 600,000 Indians.
"Our arrival at the convention is a historical event: it means a break in our marginality," said Francisco Rojas Birry, an Embera Indian elected on Dec. 9 in a nationwide poll for convention delegates. With pluralism now a hallmark of Colombian politics, the Indian delegates are challenging the nation to grapple with a new concept: cultural pluralism.
Here as in the rest of the continent, the fight for Indian rights has accelerated with the impending 500th anniversary of the arrival of Columbus in the Americas. One poster seen on streets here shows an international stop symbol superimposed in red on a cartoon of the explorer's face. The caption reads, in Spanish, "500 Years -- No."
"We, Indians of Colombia, reject with all the anger we have built up over hundreds of years the 'celebration' that the West wants to make in 1992 of the great ethnocidal saga," Mr. Rojas Birry, a 31-year-old lawyer, said last February in his opening speech to the assembly here.
Representing 80 indigenous ethnic groups -- from the Amazon rain forest to the Andean mountains -- the three Indian delegates propose that Colombia's new constitution accord Indians rights to bilingual education and to political and economic control over recognized homelands.
The Indians also want to be judged by Indian courts and to have seats set aside for Indians in Colombia's congress. The Indians seek to end work by missionaries like the Summer Institute of Linguistics, a United States group that encourages Indians to abandon traditional religious beliefs and medical practices in favor of Evangelical Protestantism and Western medicine.
 
'Right to Be Different'
 "The Right to Be Different," Colombia's largest-selling newspaper summarized in a headline over a list of Indian demands. As never before in Colombian history, the constitutional convention has provided a national pulpit for Indian demands. With his distinctive felt hat and knit shoulder bag, the 53-year-old Muelas is an instant celebrity who is often greeted by applause when he walks down the streets of this somber mountain city.
Grumbling about "theatrics," conservative delegates complain that Mr. Muelas converses with them in fluent Spanish, but adopts an artificially broken "Indian Spanish" when television cameras are rolling. Mr. Muelas, who has escaped from three attempts on his life since he left a local landowner's debt peonage system 35 years ago, knows that in Colombia, instant celebrity is not a bulletproof jacket.
Last Dec. 13, four days after the Indian delegates were elected, members of the Arhuaco tribe recovered the mutilated bodies of their three most senior traditional leaders. The Arhuaco, who live in Colombia's northern Sierra Nevada range, say an army detachment kidnapped and killed the leaders after leftist guerrillas kidnapped a local rancher.

HEADLINE: Fed Sees Signs That Slump May Be Close to Low Point

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Despite the ending of the Persian Gulf war, economic activity remained weak in much of the nation during the early spring, the Federal Reserve said today. But the central bank said its latest survey of the economy found scattered signs that the recession may be nearing its low point.
The survey, compiled from information supplied by the 12 regional Fed banks, was prepared for top Fed officials to use at their May 14 session to map interest rate policy. 
 The central bank on Tuesday pushed two key interest rates lower; it is believed that the signs of weakness noted in the survey played a role in that decision.
The regional banks reported that retail sales were sluggish, nonresidential construction remained in the doldrums and demand for bank loans was essentially flat.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, remained sluggish in most regions. Weaker sales were reported by Philadelphia, Chicago and Dallas, although Cleveland reported a pickup in activity in areas not affected by auto layoffs.
Increased sales of autos were reported by Kansas City, Cleveland and Atlanta, but most other districts found little improvement in this sector, and Dallas reported a sharp drop in car sales.
In manufacturing, the Fed survey found that the steep slump over the last two years might be bottoming out. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and Kansas City all noted stable or slightly improving conditions for manufacturing companies.
St. Louis said manufacturing conditions were continuing to worsen, and attributed the weakness to further layoffs in the auto sector and an expected plant shutdown in May.
Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco reported stronger foreign demand for products, which they credited to contracts to rebuild Kuwait.
One of the few bright spots, the Fed said, was a significant pickup in the housing industry, with most parts of the nation reporting improved sales of both new and existing homes.
But the survey said conditions in nonresidential real estate remained severely depressed. The Boston district reported that construction of new commercial space had nearly halted as vacancy rates continued to rise "due to further contraction in the financial services industry."
The New York Fed reported that office leasing in midtown Manhattan had dropped to its lowest level in three years. High vacancy rates were also reported in Los Angeles and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
The demand for bank loans was reported to be flat or only slightly improved around the country. Some strength was noted in mortgage lending and mortgage refinancing, but Atlanta and Boston said tight lending conditions continued to restrict loan growth.
Kansas City reported that warm weather had helped the winter wheat crop, but California said a late December freeze had halved fruit production and exports and destroyed many fruit and nut trees.

HEADLINE: Seattle Showpiece of Health Care by Democracy

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 1

 BODY:
For a single monthly fee, most members of Group Health Cooperative have access to nearly unlimited medical care. If they live well, without smoking, drinking heavily or becoming overweight, they can pay even less. If they do not like the way their local clinic is being run, they can change it by voting out the management.
Group Health, medical care by democracy, is the nation's largest consumer-governed health care organization, with 470,0000 members. One of every eight residents of the Puget Sound area belongs to the cooperative, which is based in Seattle. 
 As other health maintenance organizations have floundered, or run into financial trouble, Group Health turned a $19 million surplus last year.
 
'Model of the Future'
 With its healthy balance sheet and growing membership, Group Health is attracting national attention. "It's my model of the future," said Dr. Arnold Relman, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.
"With patients right on the board of directors monitoring them, doctors are committed to the highest quality of care," he said. "There's no incentive for doing more tests than indicated, but every incentive to do all that is indicated."
It has taken the cooperative more than 40 years to work out its kinks. The mid-1980's, as health care costs soared far beyond the rate of inflation, were particularly rough.
Group Health keeps costs down by eliminating unnecessary surgery and procedures and by stressing preventive care. "We have tried to get away from the idea that the more surgery you do, the more money you make," said Dr. Phillip M. Nudelman, the president and chief executive of Group Health.
 
Avoiding Unneeded Surgery
 About 30 percent of all surgery in the United States is not needed, Dr. Nudelman contends. On average, he said, the cooperative performs about 40 percent fewer cardiac operations on patients with heart disease than are done in other health systems.
Twice as many Group Health members receive flu immunization shots as the national average. There is an aggressive screening program to detect colon, skin and breast cancer at early stages. The cooperative's program for smokers who want to quit succeeds at a rate twice the national average. Consulting nurses are available 24 hours day by telephone to answer questions.
 
Complaints About Waiting
 Doctors here insist that they do not shortchange their patients. Dr. Nudelman says any procedure that is available, including costly operations like bone marrow and organ transplants, can be had at Group Health, which has 29 medical centers and 2 hospitals in the Northwest. Cosmetic surgergy is excluded.
"On a technical and service level, Group Health is as good as anybody," said Dr. Douglas Conrad, an economist at the University of Washington.
Complaints have to do with waiting periods for certain doctors and certain procedures. Group Health has more than 700 staff physicians. Members choose their own doctor, but the more popular ones can be hard to see.
The doctors are paid anywhere from $60,000 to $220,000 a year, said Dr. Nudelman, and the turnover rate is about 3 percent a year, well below the industry average.
Almost all the cooperative's revenue, which totaled $577 million last year, comes from premiums paid by consumers. In the early years most members were self-employed, jobless or could not find afford medical insurance. Now, about 85 percent of members are on company payrolls, including large corporations like Boeing, with premiums paid by the employer.
Membership in Group Health is slightly more expensive than the local average. A 40-year-old with full coverage will pay about $100 a month, but most members pay no deductibles.
 
Threat of Rising Cost
 The rising price of medical technology and services, though, poses a threat to Group Health's ability to provide top care at low cost. Officers wonder whether the group will always be able to afford the best and newest. But without staying on the cutting edge, it may have trouble attracting new members.
The concept of Group Health may not be easily transplanted. Group Health grew out of a Scandinavian tradition of pooling costs and talent. For this to work elsewhere, said Dr. Nudelman, "there has to be a culture willing to accept something that goes against the grain of most American health care."

HEADLINE: Apple Warns of an Earnings Dip

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 1

 BODY:
Although its sales are growing rapidly after it cut prices on its popular Macintosh machines, Apple Computer Inc. said today that its earnings for the third quarter of its fiscal year might be lower than for the corresponding period a year earlier.
Apple executives said the dollar's resurgence on currency exchanges and the company's shift toward lower-priced products would hurt profit margins for the quarter ending June 30. 
 The news seemed to catch many analysts and investors by surprise, and Apple shares plummeted $7.75, to $47.25, in over-the-counter trading today.
 
Pressure on Profit Margins
 The pressure on Apple's profit margins was well known, but many analysts had anticipated that a big jump in sales volume would offset the lower profits on each computer. While Apple's move to gain market share makes sense in the long term, it is likely to create short-term earnings disappointments, analysts said.
In its third quarter last year, Apple earned $119.8 million, or 96 cents a share.
Apple's announcement followed a report on Tuesday by the Quantum Corporation, a major supplier of disk drives to Apple. Quantum said that it expected slower growth in orders from Apple in the next few quarters. Apple, however, said it expected shipment growth to continue in the third quarter at about the same rate as it had in the second quarter.
The announcement today led some analysts to cut their earnings estimates for the company, which is based in Cupertino, Calif. Last month, Apple shares fell after the company announced lower than expected earnings for its second quarter, ended March 31.
Apple can point to some signs of success in its transition from a low-volume producer of high-profit computers to a company seeking higher market share by lowering prices and profit margins. Macintosh shipments have increased 85 percent in an economic downturn, indicating Apple is succeeding in gaining market share.
But Joseph A. Graziano, Apple's chief financial officer, said the company had not been able to reduce costs rapidly enough to accommodate the lower profits on each sale.
"Clearly, we are succeeding at our overriding business objectives," he said. "We are attracting new users to the Macintosh platform and increasing our share of the personal computer market. At the same time, our gross margins have declined faster than we had originally expected, challenging our ability to achieve the levels of profitability we had targeted at the start of the fiscal year."
Speaking to analysts today at a technology conference here sponsored by Hambrecht & Quist, a brokerage firm, Mr. Graziano said the company would cut sales and marketing expenses to improve its operating margin, which fell to 11.8 percent in the March quarter, from 14.8 percent a year earlier. He said that the company would continue to increase its research and development spending, and that he did not anticipate any layoffs.
In the past, Apple made so much profit from its computers that it could afford to be profligate, leading to high operating costs relative to competitors.
Apple does have reasons to hope for improved future earnings. They include the introduction later this month of System 7.0, an updated version of the basic operating system software that controls the Macintosh. It is expected to be accompanied by major new programs from several software companies.
Apple also has "a whole slew of new products coming out in the fall," Mr. Graziano said. These are expected to include new high-end Macintosh models and a notebook computer to be developed in conjunction with the Sony Corporation.
So far, the bulk of the growth has been from Apple's new entry-level product, the Macintosh Classic, which is less profitable than the company's higher-priced models. The shift in product mix toward the low end, coupled with a higher dollar, which lowers the value of overseas sales made in foreign currencies, has cut margins faster than Apple had anticipated.
"We are going through a transformation, but I think we're on track, and we are sticking to our strategy," Mr. Graziano said.
That transformation is one that other personal computer makers may also experience. The Compaq Computer Corporation last month slashed prices across the board in an effort to increase market share, and the International Business Machines Corporation is expected to cut prices soon. The maturing of the personal computer market, and the entry of many low-cost clones, has made such plays for market share necessary.
 
'Period of Transition'
 "I think the industry overall is going through a very real period of transition," said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. The rapidly changing market will distort many companies' profit and loss projections throughout 1991, he said.
When Apple introduced the lower-priced models in October, it answered critics' charges that its machines were too expensive, but the move raised concerns among analysts about what these low-profit items would do to Apple's profitablity.
Analysts also fretted that the new models were too good, and would cannibalize sales of Apple's middle-range and high-end machines. Apple lowered prices on those models in March.
"While our mid-range and high-end products are up, they are still not up as much as we would expect," Mr. Graziano said. But he added that it was not clear whether this was a result of cannibalization or of the general economic downturn, since those models are primarily sold to business users.

HEADLINE: Bush Trade Concessions Pick Up Some Support

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The Bush Administration got a favorable reception in Congress today to its commitments to insulate American workers and the environment from the effects of a free trade agreement with Mexico.
But while several key interest groups were swayed in favor of the President, it was still uncertain whether the 150-page "action plan" sent to Capitol Hill today would be enough to win a critical vote later this month on extending Mr. Bush's trade-negotiating authority for two years. 
 Organized labor, textile interests and others who fear that greater trade with Mexico will result in a loss of jobs and a weakening of environmental and labor standards have been lobbying against an extension.
"This response contains some significant concessions by the Administration," said Lloyd Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who was among Congressional leaders warning Mr. Bush that the extension could fail without reassurances on the environmental and labor fronts.
 
Some See Mushiness
 The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Trade Subcommittee, Sam Gibbons, a Florida Democrat, said the program came out "better than expected."
Among the commitments are special provisions that would restore tariffs on fruits and vegetables to earlier levels if protection was needed. The tariffs would probably be cut in the trade pact, and the fruit and vegetable industry in Texas and Florida fears low-price, low-tariff Mexican competition.
But other lawmakers, such as Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and William D. Ford, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, remained steadfast in their opposition.
"It would be hard to be vaguer and mushier than this Administration has been in these so-called commitments," Mr. Wyden said.
Mr. Ford, who comes from an automaking area, said, "I think the Mexican free trade agreement would make the Great Depression look like a Sunday school picnic in my Congressional district."
These were the key pledges by the Administration:
*To work with Congress to fashion an "adequately funded" program of assistance for workers dislocated as a result of increased foreign competition.
*To exclude changes in immigration policy from the trade pact.
*To prevent Mexican products that do not meet United States health or safety requirements from entering this country.
*To put in place an integrated environmental plan for the border between the United States and Mexico and appoint representatives of environmental organizations to official trade advisory bodies.
Howard F. Rosen, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, said of the commitment on workers: "They are reversing a Reagan Administration policy against special adjustment programs."
As the documents were released, President Bush told a conference of business editors that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and the Mexican people "have no interest in allowing their country to become a pollution haven for U.S. companies."
The National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization that has expressed concerns about pollution and labor standards, today endorsed an extension of the Adminstration's negotiating authority, according to its chief executive, Raul Yzaguirre.
Among the interest groups that significantly softened its opposition to the extension was the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S. Wants Iraq to Finance Kurdish Relief Operations

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The United States wants Iraq to pay for the American-led effort to help Kurdish refugees in the northern part of the country, senior Bush Administration officials said today.
Although the Administration is uncertain exactly how to require the Baghdad Government to finance the operation, which is expected to cost more than $500 million over six months, one option under consideration would link such payment to approval of Iraqi resumption of oil exports. Linkage would require the approval of the sanctions committee of the United Nations Security Council, which is setting the terms for lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. 
 The idea of collecting payment from Iraq, initially floated by Britain, reflects the Administration's overall strategy to keep President Saddam Hussein politically and militarily weak, while also searching for new ways to strangle his economy.
Resigned to the prospect that Mr. Hussein may remain President of Iraq for some time and determined that the country not be allowed to rebuild as long as he remains in power, the Administration is preparing a proposal under which Iraq would have to contribute 40 to 50 percent of its oil revenue for reparations from its invasion of Kuwait last August, senior Administration officials said.
But there is considerable skepticism in the Administration that the United States will succeed in convincing the sanctions committee, which includes all 15 members of the Security Council, to require Iraqi financing of the relief effort or to extract such a high percentage of its oil revenue for reparations for damage done to Kuwait during the war.
India, Cuba and Yemen, members of the Security Council, have urged that Iraq pay no more than 10 percent, while Britain proposes that Iraq pay the same amount for reparations as it did for the purchase of weapons over the last decade, a figure equivalent to about 25 to 30 percent of its prewar oil revenue. Under the British plan, these payments would be phased in as Iraqi oil exports come back on line.
The Security Council will begin this week to grapple with the reparations issue. Under the cease-fire resolution adopted by the Council on April 3, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar must submit an initial report by Friday with the structure for a fund generated by oil sales. This fund will be tapped for reparations.
Administration officials acknowledge that the American demand for Iraq to pay for the relief effort goes beyond two Security Council resolutions that dictate Iraq's conduct: a cease-fire resolution that sets a series of demands and deadlines that must be met before economic sanctions are lifted, and a resolution giving the Security Council sweeping authority to provide relief to Iraq's refugees. But they argue that these resolutions are flexible enough to take changing circumstances into account.
The United States and Britain take a strict interpretation of the cease-fire resolution in opposing Iraq's requests to sell close to $1 billion of its oil and to gain access to $1 billion of its assets frozen in foreign banks. Baghdad says it needs this money to buy food and medical supplies.
"Everyone in the Council is inclined to be more flexible than us and Britain," a White House official said. "We're motiviated not only by the fact that Saddam is still in power but also that if we open the door a little, he'll find ways to circumvent the sanctions and undermine the coalition aligned against him."
Administration officials argue, for example, that Iraq still has considerable assets in its central bank and sizable gold reserves that it should spend first. Other Security Council members, such as China, are leaning toward aiding Iraq's economy, but the United States remains suspicious of its appeals that its civilian population is in desperate need of food.
The hard line was reflected by Under Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz, who said on the "McNeil-Lehrer News Hour" on Monday: "As far as we can tell, some large share of the trucks bringing food in from Jordan get diverted to Iraqi military camps, and as far as we know, the Iraqis still have plenty of assets with which to buy food. So these claims are greeted with considerable skepticism."
 
U.S. Approach Unavailing
 Administration officials acknowledged that their hard line thus far has had no success in dislodging Mr. Hussein. In fact, they said, he is stronger now than he was at the end of the war because he has successfully put down civil insurrections and because the presence of foreign troops on his soil gives him the chance to argue that Iraqi sovereignty is being violated.
These officials acknowledge that there is increasing sympathy in the Security Council for Iraq's economic plight and that the United States may be swimming against the tide.
"There's a new mood that Iraq should be able to get on with their own affairs and recover after the war," an official said. "There's a lot of feeling that 'you destroyed their infrastructutre and they've suffered enough.' "
Former United Nations officials question the wisdom of continuing sanctions that might backfire.
"There is a limit beyond which you may not be able to get much out of the Iraqis," said Sir Brian Urquhart, a former Under Secretary General. "If the object of the exercise is to get Saddam to leave, I can't believe this is going to work. There's the danger that you will revive undeserved sympathy and support for the guy."

HEADLINE: The Interest-Rate Battle;
U.S. Wants to Grow Out of the Recession, But Its Partners Fear Rekindled Inflation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's efforts this week to bring down worldwide interest rates are being portrayed in the Bush Administration as the opening round in a battle between a rather pessimistic American view of the world's economy and a more buoyant German approach.
To European finance ministers, Mr. Brady's actions seem quixotic at best. Perhaps that reaction is inevitable for an Administration that is trying to argue simultaneously that the recession in the United States is about to end and is also in danger of getting worse, along with many other national economies. 
 Whatever the contradictions, the Administration argument -- with Mr. Brady as the spokesman -- is that the other industrial nations must understand they are more deeply mired in slow growth and recession than they realize. And, incidentally, the Administration seems to say that if the industrial nations do not change their ways, the United States may remain in recession.
The American concern is that if the other nations -- Britain, Japan, Germany, Canada, France and Italy -- do not adopt pro-growth policies, then American exports will level off or fall, particularly the 30 percent that go to Europe. If that happens, the United States recession could endure. The nation's exports to Europe in fact have leveled off this year.
The Brady solution is to campaign for lower interest rates, despite the failure of that approach this week. Lower rates mean cheaper loans, which in theory, at least, lead to more spending and investment and eventually stronger growth abroad. The danger, the Germans and others argue, is that lower rates and the greater demand can also mean rising inflation -- and that concern, for the moment, is uppermost in their minds, they say.
Mr. Brady's office says he is planning to continue his campaign for lower interest rates abroad, and the Administration seems to be endorsing his efforts, despite the initial failure.
As Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, put it carefully today: "Secretary Brady is clearly right to point out to those other countries that we have a worldwide growth slowdown, several countries in recession and the need for all countries to renew their commitment to growth-oriented policies."
Mr. Brady got into trouble last weekend when he tried to lean on Germany to reduce its interest rates, although the Germans had warned him in advance that they would not respond to his plea. The other nations lined up with the Germans, who dominate Europe's economy.
Then the Federal Reserve Board reduced American interest rates on Tuesday, in effect doing just what the Germans had said the Americans should have done in the first place.
 
Performance Is Criticized
 Mr. Brady's performance, played out at a meeting here of the world's seven largest industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, brought forth derisive criticism. The Financial Times of London, in the opening words of an editorial, declared, "Rarely can a great power have come to an important international meeting with arguments as feeble as those advanced by the U.S."
And Horst Kohler, an Under Secretary in Germany's Finance Ministry, told reporters that Mr. Brady and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, could not appeal for help by implying that they needed it to avoid a potentially more severe American recession while arguing at the meeting that "there are signs of recovery."
Back home, there is speculation about what Bush Administration officials might be up to. Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he thought the Administration was becoming "increasingly concerned that the recovery won't be strong enough" -- a concern that various economic statistics this week seems to support. "The Administration wants a real recovery for the 1992 election year, not a half-hearted one," he said.
Others, like C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, contend that while the Administration tries to maintain a confident aura -- adhering to a forecast that the recession will end by summer -- it is reaching out for solutions to a recession that in fact may turn out to be worse than anyone had figured.
 
'Pounding on Foreigners'
 "The pounding on the foreigners plus the Fed's cutting of interest rates can only be explained by the concern that the Government feels about the economy," Mr. Bergsten said.
And then there is the view that Mr. Brady's performance seemed inept, whatever its merits, because the United States failed to carry the day against Germany.
"It is desirable to try to get the others to lower interest rates," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who is chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee and who endorsed the Brady strategy. "But I think it is a commentary on the times that the United States muscle was not sufficient for us to be listened to."
Indeed, German concerns were much different, and they won the day. As the Germans saw it, lowering interest rates would weaken the mark at a time when it has fallen in value anyway since early this year. That would create huge difficulties for Germany, encouraging holders of German marks to sell them for other currencies at a time when the Germans need all the capital they can get to revive eastern Germany.
 
Looking to Eastern Germany
 The Germans in attendance this week -- Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister, Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, and Mr. Kohler -- also argued that eastern Germany's economy, while in deep trouble now, would rebound before long and the new demand would help to revive national growth.
Reducing interest rates in this context, the Germans argued, would only result in a rising inflation rate -- a concern that other finance ministers also raised. German short-term rates, adjusted for inflation, are four to five percentage points higher than similar American rates.
Most important, Germany's overpowering role in the European economy constrains other nations from lowering rates if Germany does not, although the weakening economies of France and Italy make them natural allies of the Brady approach, American officials argue.
"Japan also might be wavering," Mr. Bergsten said. "They are saying that they are concerned about growth and inflation. My suspicion is that they might attempt to reduce rates in two or three weeks."

HEADLINE: Kodak Net Dips to Low End of Forecasts

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company reported yesterday that its first-quarter earnings declined 10.6 percent, to $178 million, or 55 cents a share, from $199 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results were at the low end of analysts' expectations. Most had forecast that the company would report earnings of more than 60 cents a share. Kodak's stock closed yesterday down 87.5 cents, to $40.75. 
 The company attributed the earnings decline to advertising and promotion costs needed to stimulate sales in a recession. Kodak's sales increased 7.3 percent, to $4.4 billion in the period from $4.1 billion in last year's first quarter.
"Continued recession in the U.S. economy, the dampening effect of the Mideast war -- particularly in travel and tourism, a dollar that was stronger than expected and signs of weakness in other world economies made the first quarter a difficult period for Kodak," said Kay R. Whitmore, chairman.
 
Gains Are Forecast
 Mr. Whitmore forecast "continued gains in sales and margin recovery later in the year, assuming improvement in the tone and pace of the U.S. economy."
Earnings in the company's imaging segment, Kodak's basic photographic film business, declined 18.7 percent, to $178 million from $219 million, although worldwide sales increased to $1.4 billion from last year's $1.3 billion.
Profits in the information segment, which includes copiers and printers, plunged to $1 million, from $28 million. The company attributed the falloff to "general softness in the U.S. economy," which contributed to lower sales of equipment and supplies.
However, earnings of the chemical segment increased 19.2 percent, to $155 million from $130 million. Higher prices in the United States and "excellent sales increases" overseas were cited.
Earnings in the health segment, largely from its Sterling Drug unit, increased slightly, to $122 million from $121 million.
The company, based in Rochester, said its research and development spending totaled $352 million in the period, compared with $317 million in the period last year. Capital spending totaled $511 million, up from $308 million.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Gun Measure Is Lesson in Geography

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The Brady bill is the first tough domestic issue the House will face this year, and the whole issue of gun control has stirred intense ideological passions. But next week's vote will not be an occasion for rounding up the usual stereotypes of the 101st Congress.
The fight over the Brady bill, which would impose a seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases, is not really a fight between liberals and conservatives or Republicans and Democrats. Neither party's leadership is demanding, or even counting, votes. This issue is intensely individual and representative. 
 There are divisions that offer a better clue to how the roll-calls will break than the traditional political analyses; they are geographical. Like the major battles of the last century, over railroads and banks, this one pits the East against the South and the West and, most of all, divides the House on rural-versus-urban lines.
Consider two outspoken Wisconsin Congressmen.
Representative David R. Obey is one of the most dogged liberal Democrats in the House, and he is leaning strongly against the Brady bill.
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. is one of the House's most conservative Republicans. National Journal, the Washington weekly of government, found that last year he voted more conservatively than 89 percent of the House on social issues and 98 percent on economic issues. Although rarely found backing any measure that can be attacked as increasing the power of government over the individual, he is a supporter of this bill.
Mr. Obey represents the forests, farms and iron mines of northern Wisconsin, where, he said, "we look at hunting as a normal recreational experience" and where pistols are frequently used on squirrels and "other nuisance animals."
He scoffs at the proposed waiting period, saying it would do nothing but keep vacationers from buying guns from hardware stores or tobacco shops in his district. "If you say you're going to have a seven-day waiting period," he said, "you're sending all of those guys back to Chicago or Milwaukee, just taking away an opportunity for a sale."
Mr. Sensenbrenner's constituents may go fishing in Mr. Obey's district. But a lot of them work in Milwaukee, and they live in the Milwaukee suburbs, where crime is an issue. Mr. Sensenbrenner argues that the bill would help "reclaim our streets and our communities for our families."
His latest newsletter sought to reassure constituents that the bill would protect "the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms," a paraphrase of the Second Amendment, on which the National Rifle Association has based its constitutional objection to anti-gun legislation. And he argued that the waiting period would not only enable the police to check a buyer's background but also offer a "cooling off" period that would reduce "impulsive crimes of passion."
Mr. Obey and Mr. Sensenbrenner are not alone. Conservative Republicans like Representatives Henry J. Hyde of Illinois and Frank R. Wolf of Virginia, both representing suburbs near high-crime cities, back the Brady bill. Liberal Democrats like Bob Carr of Michigan, Mike Espy of Mississippi and Dave Nagle of Iowa support a substitute that would have no waiting period but that would require instantaneous checks of criminal records; the Brady bill's proponents and the Bush Administration call the measure impractical. And Representative Bernard Sanders, the independent socialist from Vermont, opposes the bill because it does not attack the "hopelessness and despair" that cause crime.
But party will still matter in the end. Democrats are more likely to support the bill than Republicans are, if only because they are more likely to represent cities.
And, because they control the House, the Democrats will get much of the credit and blame distributed for next week's result. The Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, has fought the bill in the past, but has pushed it to an early vote this time.
Next week's losers are likely to blame him for not doing more for them, and each has a claim. He reflects those competing constituencies. A party whose strength is in the cities elected Mr. Foley to be Speaker, but a vast rural district whose largest city is Spokane, Wash., with a population of 177,196, elected him to the House.

HEADLINE: Strategy for a Boston Comeback

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
As the nation's banks try to recover from the billions of dollars in bad real estate loans they made during the 1980's, the road back will inevitably lead past places like 89 Broad Street, a 14-story Art Deco office building in this city's financial district.
In 1985, when the New England economy was surging and downtown office space was scarce, the Bank of Boston lent $27 million to Harold Brown, a big local developer, to buy and refurbish the building. Now, after Mr. Brown has sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the bank's enthusiasm looks like a costly mistake, with an $11 million loss from writing down the loan's value to $16 million to better reflect the depressed New England economy. 
 But the bank is not giving up on Mr. Brown and the building just yet. In fact, an agreement to restructure the loan for 89 Broad Street is a prime example of how some lenders throughout the nation are trying to prevent further losses while creating the potential for future profits.
 
Patience for Profits
 In a nutshell, the Bank of Boston has decided that 89 Broad Street will eventually fill with tenants and that Mr. Brown needs both time and concessions to make the project successful. So the bank has agreed to take a number of steps, including reducing the interest rate on the loan, deferring some payments and even lending more money to the developer for renovations.
For its patience, the Bank of Boston stands to be fully repaid over time and possibly earn a share of any profit if the building operates successfully or is later sold.
Restructured loans like that for 89 Broad Street are proliferating. They require close cooperation between a bank and a developer. The bank agrees to extend payments on existing debt and often to arrange new loans for the developer. The building owner gets the financial breathing room necessary to begin the slow, steady work of attracting additional tenants and generating more income.
Guilliaem (Rusty) Aertsen, a bad-loan specialist who worked on Texas real estate problems a few years ago, was named last year to head the Bank of Boston's real estate department. His task now is to try to recover some of the losses. For banks that stay with projects that recover, the rewards for patience can be considerable. And Mr. Aertsen clearly believes that in three to five years, 89 Broad Street will prove a shrewd bet.
"I don't need 'Massachusetts Miracle II -- the Sequel' to have this property recover," Mr. Aertsen said. "All I need is some improvement in the local economy. And the upside potential for the bank for staying with a situation like this is enormous."
Not surprisingly, the real estate "workout" business is becoming one of the few growth fields in banking these days. At the Bank of Boston, the number of real estate and workout professionals has jumped to 170 from 100 in 18 months, a period of austerity for the bank as a whole. And last year, the bank handed the challenge to Mr. Aertsen, a veteran of the Texas real estate slump.
Few banks that have survived have been hit harder by bad real estate loans than the Bank of Boston Corporation, a once-aggressive lender based in the slumping Northeast. In the last two years, the bank has taken losses of $546 million on its commercial real estate business.
"It's a deep hole for the bank," said James Moynihan, senior vice president of Advest Inc., a securities firm in Boston, "but in Rusty Aertsen they've got one of the best workout specialists in the industry,"
 
Fast Response to the Problem
 Banking executives and analysts credit the Bank of Boston with moving more quickly than others to face up to its real estate troubles, taking charges against earnings sooner and thinning out its portfolio of bad loans. "They have their hands around the problem in a way that many banks don't," said Thomas Hanley, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.
The Bank of Boston has cut its commercial real estate loans from $6.38 billion in 1988 to $3.91 billion by the end of 1990, according to the IBCA Inc. credit-rating agency, while such loans increased at most other banks.
And the Bank of Boston's nonperforming loans -- those at least 90 days behind -- and real estate seized from delinquent borrowers both stopped growing by the second half of last year; both are expected to shrink. Yet that pile of bad loans and seized property still amounts to more than $1 billion.
 
Two Kinds of Decisions
 A bank's success in dealing with troubled real estate depends on choosing which owners and developers to work with and which to abandon by foreclosing on their property. The easy decisions, Mr. Aertsen explained, are on loans for speculative projects, built during the boom days in outlying suburbs, that will not attract tenants even after the region's economy revives. "Some are in places where the highest possible economic use is a cornfield or something," he said.
The difficult judgments are on delinquent loans for solid projects where a deteriorating economy has eroded rents, leaving the owner unable to meet payments. The decision to restructure developers' debt and allow them to hold on to their property is a bet on their character and competence.
Mr. Aertsen insists that both 89 Broad Street and Mr. Brown are worth the risk. Mr. Brown made his fortune by buying older buildings just outside the most costly blocks of downtown Boston, then refurbishing and renting them as growth expanded the central business district. He is known for frugality, working out of austere offices and living modestly without yachts, private planes or a distracting social life.
 
How the Project Fell Ill
 Poring over a cash-flow analysis of 89 Broad Street at his office, Mr. Aertsen explained how the project fell ill and how the bank plans to restore its financial health. Mr. Brown originally invested $8 million of his own money along with the $27 million loan from the Bank of Boston, for a total of $35 million. The building is 70 percent occupied -- a respectable figure in a weak market -- but rental rates and the building's value have fallen sharply.
At the going rate of $20 a square foot prevailing in June 1989, the bank and its appraisers calculated that the building had a long-term value of about $140 a square foot, or $38.1 million. But by the end of last year, with rents falling to $14 a square foot, the estimated long-term value of the asset slid to $61 a square foot, or $16.6 million, or less than half its previous estimate.
The bank not only wrote down the amount of the loan on its books to $16 million but also, as part of its agreement, trimmed the interest rate by a percentage point, to 9 percent. The result: Operating income that Mr. Brown needs to service the current debt has been sliced from $3.2 million a year, including interest and fees, to $1.4 million.
 
The New Plan
 Under the new plan, Mr. Brown must make monthly payments and, eventually, pay the full, $27 million amount of the original loan with deferred interest. Mr. Aertsen said that over three to five years, the local economy is likely to revive sufficiently to raise rents and to allow Mr. Brown to meet these terms.
The Bank of Boston stands ready to give Mr. Brown new loans of as much as $8.8 million to complete interior renovation and the restoration of the Art Deco lobby. But the bank will not lend the additional money until Mr. Brown lines up new tenants, generating the income to make payments on the new loans.
In return for its cooperation, the Bank of Boston received not only a pledge of full payment on all its loans, but also what amounts to an equity stake in the building.
Such delicate debt negotiations between banks and hard-pressed developers are typically private. But the plan for 89 Broad Street was filed in a Boston court in early April, the month after Mr. Brown sought bankruptcy protection. The developer hopes the 89 Broad Street pact will serve as a model for refinancing another $640 million in bank loans on more than 300 properties he controls in New England.
 
Stake in Building's Appreciation
 For the next 30 years, the bank will be entitled to 25 percent of any appreciation in the building's worth above the original $27 million loan value. Should 89 Broad Street be sold or refinanced for $45 million, the bank is entitled to one-fourth of the $18 million difference -- a $4.5 million profit.
If Mr. Brown fully repays the original loan of $27 million, the bank would report another $11 million profit over the $16 million loan value the bank now carries on its books.
Mr. Brown, 65, who bought and renovated his first Boston building in 1953, is used to taking the long view. He says he firmly believes that after the Northeast's slump ends, the Bank of Boston's patience will prove profitable.
"All we need from a bank is the vision to restructure the debt and some faith that this down cycle will end," he said. "The Bank of Boston has shown those qualities, and they'll get their money back."

Chart: "What Happened on Broad Street"
How Bank of Boston's loan was restructured.
 
1.Bank of Boston wrote down the loan to $16 million from $27 million, taking $11million in charges against earnings in the fourth quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of this year.
 
2. The operating income needed to service the debt was reduced to $1.4 million a year, from $3.2 million.
 
3. The interest rate was reduced to 9 percent, from 10 percent, as the developer, Harold Brown, agreed to repay the original loan ($27 million) and all deferred interest.
 
4. In a 30-year agreement, the developer agreed to pay the bank 25 percent of the net cash flow, sale or refinancing proceeds in excess of the debt claim, which includes $27 million of principal, any additional money advanced by the bank and any accrued but unpaid interest. These proceeds would be gains for the Bank of Boston, as are all loans payments above $16 million.

HEADLINE: NASA Says It Is Time to Build Space Station

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
 The space agency, bombarded by conflicting cost estimates for a planned space station and continued disagreement among scientists about its usefulness, said today that it was time to stop studying the proposal and to build it.
Adm. Richard Truly, the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, told a Congressional hearing that the program finally had a stable configuration and promised funds, and that it was time to move to construction. 
 Responding to suggestions from members of Congress that NASA should have independent auditors review cost estimates and that experts should study whether necessary research could be done elsewhere, Admiral Truly defended the current plan.
"I believe the space station program has had enough reviews," he said at a hearing of the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Activities and Transportation. The project "has been reconfigured based on the recommendations of previous reviews and the will of Congress," Admiral Truly continued. "Let's give it to the engineers to build."
NASA officials said the space station, recently scaled back in size and capability at the request of Congress, could be finished in space by 1999 for $30 billion. After the station is permanently occupied by astronauts, agency officials estimated that operating costs would average about $2 billion annually through the year 2027.
Admiral Truly testified that the $84 billion estimate did not include potential additions to the station.
The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, said NASA's estimate was too low and put the 30-year cost of the project at $118 billion.
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher told the hearing that even the space agency's estimate of $30 billion for the initial phase of the project was about $10 billion too low. NASA figures, he said, did not include the total cost of using the space shuttle to build and service a station, nor did it include money for a space "lifeboat" for station astronauts or the installation of expensive scientific instruments.
"What we actually have is at least a $118 billion program -- about $40 billion to achieve permanent occupancy and about $78 billion to keep the station operational between 2000 and 2027," said Mr. Bowsher, who called NASA's estimates inappropriate.
Representative Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who heads the subcommittee, said even the G.A.O. figures on the space station might too low.
"I believe that the $30 billion NASA estimate will get us a garage in space with nothing in it and nothing happening around it," she said. "Our subcommittee investigation has estimated that the true cost of this project will be approximately $180 billion, plus inflation, over its lifetime."

G.M. Outlet In Manhattan Closes Doors

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 1

 BODY:
The last remaining General Motors Corporation dealership in Manhattan, a Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet franchise belonging to Roger S. Penske and G.M., quietly closed its doors today.
Mr. Penske is a transportation entrepreneur with interests as diverse as truck leasing and Indianapolis 500 racing. A spokesman for Mr. Penske said the decision to close the dealership was based on declining prospects for automobile sales in New York City and the poor state of the Northeast economy. 
 Mr. Penske had previously acknowledged that sales at the dealership had been weak from the day he bought it from Victor Potamkin in the fall of 1987.
Mr. Potamkin, 80 years old, at one time was one of the nation's top Cadillac dealers. He remains active selling other car brands at a dealership near 787 11th Avenue at West 56th Street where Penske Cadillac had operated.
 
Another Dealer Sought
 A G.M. spokesman said the auto maker was searching for another dealer to take over the franchise and had discussed the idea with Mr. Potamkin, among others. He said the dealership would honor "all sales and service commitments" and those owning G.M. cars and trucks could take their vehicles for service to dealerships in other boroughs.
The spokesman, Harold Jackson, said G.M. learned last week that Mr. Penske planned to close the dealership. This morning the sign came down.
Originally, the dealership was known as Penske Cadillac, but G.M. added Buick and Chevrolet franchises in an effort to increase the store's sales volume. Even that was not enough to save the business.
 
Problems in Cities
 The closing of the dealership reflects not just the growing difficulties of selling cars in downtown locations, but the nationwide automotive slump that has put pressure on the profits of all franchised dealers, causing many of them to fail. Last year about 900 of the 25,000 United States dealerships failed.
Increasingly, city dwellers avoid owning cars, while suburban commuters prefer to do business with dealers close to their home.
Mr. Penske's venture in Manhattan seemed star-crossed from the outset. He signed the contract taking over the dealership on the Friday before the stock market crashed in October 1987. He then spent more than $6 million refurbishing the showroom and service bays to offer white-glove pampering of customers. Mr. Potamkin, by contrast, always had attracted customers by aggressive advertising and competitive pricing.
With G.M.'s help, Mr. Penske had been able to open in Manhattan under very favorable terms. G.M. agreed to invest an unspecified amount in the dealership. The No. 1 auto maker also agreed to lease the building from Mr. Potamkin under a 25-year agreement and charge Mr. Penske rent based on the number of cars he sold.
 
Successful Elsewhere
 The skyrocketing price of urban real estate has been an important factor in driving many dealers to the suburbs.
For Mr. Penske, it was an unusual instance of a business venture gone sour. He owns several other successful car dealerships in California, including a Cadillac dealership and the nation's biggest Toyota dealership. He also owns the Detroit Diesel Corporation, which makes engines for trucks, boats and tanks and which he bought from G.M.; Hertz Penske Truck Leasing, and a car racing team that competes on the Indy car circuit.

HEADLINE: Angry Taxpayers Reject 44% of New Jersey School Budgets

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., May 1

 BODY:
After a year of angry debate over tax increases and the way New Jersey finances public education, voters on Tuesday rejected 44 percent of the local school budgets submitted to them in one of the most politicized school elections in years.
That percentage, however, was less than the 48 percent rejected last spring, reversing five years of steady increases in the number of school budgets rejected. 
 In the days leading up to the vote, Gov. Jim Florio and Senate President John A. Lynch, themselves targets of taxpayer anger because of sales-tax and income-tax increases and the shifting of some school aid from well-off districts to poorer ones, began openly criticizing education spending.
Many school superintendents, in turn, said Mr. Florio and other Democratic leaders were trying to deflect voters' animosity onto local school boards and undermine the local school budget process. Many in the education field, most notably the statewide teachers' union and an association of school boards, began predicting that upward of 70 percent of the budgets would be rejected.
 
Two Sides Breathe Easier
 After the results were counted today, with the defeat of 245 of 556 budgets, the warring sides expressed relief and a sense of surprise that the damage had not been worse. In the southern half of the state and its relatively rural western counties along the Delaware River, a majority of budgets were approved.
But a broad wave of rejections hit much of northern New Jersey, where schools are the oldest and property taxes and education costs the highest. The pattern spread across wealthy districts, working-class and urban systems, and growing suburbs.
In Mercer County, seven of eight budgets were rejected, including Princeton's. In neighboring Middlesex, 18 of 22 lost and in Monmouth, 34 of 54.
Farther north, in Bergen, 49 of 74 were defeated, including those in Ridgewood, Teaneck and, for the first time, Franklin Lakes, one of the state's wealthiest communities.
 
Newark Budget Approved
 Essex County voters bucked the pattern of rejection in North Jersey and approved 15 of 17 local budgets, including Newark's, the state's largest at $495 million.
In the aftermath of the voting, all sides claimed some measure of victory. Governor Florio said in Trenton that more budg ets would have been rejected if not for the Quality Education Act, his overhaul of the state's school-financing law, which gave districts $832 million in new state aid.
"He felt encouraged that in the midst of a recession, a majority of budgets passed," said Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's spokesman.
 
Union Sees 'Major Victory'
 Betty Kraemer, president of the New Jersey Education Association, the statewide teachers' union, called the returns a "major victory" for children and schools.
In a thinly veiled reference to Mr. Florio's and Senator Lynch's election-eve criticism of local spending, Robert E. Boose, executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, said: "We commend the people of New Jersey for cutting through the political rhetoric they have been hearing for the past few weeks and for making their own assessments of proposed school budgets."
Every year the question before the voters is whether they approve of the portion of the school budget to be raised by local property taxes. The budgets defeated in the state must now be reviewed by local government officials.
While the votes are nonbinding on the officials, they have power to recommend, but not order, cuts in education programs and spending. Any disputes between local government and school officials over cuts are mediated by the State Department of Education. The final budgets are not resubmitted to the voters for approval.
 
Growing Tension for Months
 The atmosphere surrounding this year's budget elections had been highly charged for months, starting with the Governor's overhaul of the state's school spending formula and his $2.8 billion increase in income and sales taxes last spring.
The mainfeature of the new formula, the Quality Education Act, shifts millions in state aid, starting in the 1992-93 school year, from the wealthiest suburban districts to urban, rural and middle-income districts.
In addition the State Supreme Court last June ordered the state to provide enough aid to its 30 poorest urban districts so their spending for each pupil matches that in the state's richest districts by mid-decade.
Residents in 21 of those 30 districts vote on their school budgets, as do the vast majority of other districts in the state. School spending in nine of the 30 districts is approved by an appointed board of local officials. In 12 urban districts voters rejected budgets on Tuesday.
 
Rich and Working-Class Defeats
 Towns hit by rejections Tuesday ranged from the wealthy to the working-class. Franklin Lakes, one of Bergen County's richest, suffered its first budget defeat despite efforts by school officials to adhere to a tradition of holding budget increases to 6 percent. Officials attributed rejection of the $8.6 million budget to newly organized groups of elderly citizens who were upset about property taxes.
Twenty-two percent of Franklin Lakes voters turned out, exceeding Tuesday's statewide average turnout of 18.6 percent, itself a record in budget election.
"But our affluent parents did not come out to vote," said Margaret Ann Vrola, secretary of the Franklin Lakes school board.
On the other side of Bergen, in Bogota, the budget lost by 246 to 209, even though the tax levy was cut by $62,000 and state aid increased from $2.3 million to $3.2 million. Bogota's turnout was 12 percent, and Christopher Tarantino, the board secretary, attributed the defeat to voter apathy.
 
First Loss in 15 Years
 In Monmouth County, a hotbed of anti-Florio sentiment where nearly 63 percent of the budgets lost, Holmdel's budget lost for the first time in 15 years. The $16 million plan called for a 5.3 percent increase in school taxes.
In neighboring Middlesex County, where 18 of 22 budgets went down, Woodbridge, the state's 10th largest district, approved its first budget in 27 years. The $103 million document called for no new taxes. To guarantee that, 79 teachers, supervisors and administrators, along with 20 teachers's aides, were dismissed. And art programs, violin and cello intruction, and honors and advanced placement courses for high-achieving high school students were reduced, said Fredric Buonocore,the superintendent.
Dr. Buonocore said he believed the voters did not want to risk more cuts by rejecting the budget. "I think they felt enough was enough and they didn't want a good district to become a poor one," he said.

HEADLINE: Angola Agrees On a Cease-Fire With Guerrillas

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LISBON, May 1

 BODY:
After 16 years of civil war, Angola's leftist Government and United States-backed rebels agreed today to call a cease-fire before the end of this month and to hold the nation's first free elections in the second half of 1992.
The peace agreement was initialed here after a year of complex negotiations in which Portugal, which was Angola's colonial master, and the United States and the Soviet Union, which backed the opposing factions, played a key role in encouraging the two sides to end a war that has taken some 300,000 lives and shattered the Angolan economy. 
 The accord is to be formally signed by Angola's President, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and the rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, at a ceremony scheduled to take place here May 29-31.
 
U.N. to Monitor Cease-Fire
 The official cease-fire will go into effect immediately after the agreement is signed, but Portugal's chief negotiator, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said the two sides had agreed to respect a de facto cease-fire from May 15, the deadline for confirming acceptance of the peace plan.
A United Nations force of about 600 men will be charged with monitoring the cease-fire, but a joint political and military commission made up of the two Angolan factions and the three mediating governments will have the main responsibility for preparing elections and forming a single army.
The agreement establishes that the elections will be held between September and November 1992, but the mediators strongly recommended that they be held in September before the rainy season complicates campaigning and verification of a fair voting process.
The main contenders will be the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or M.P.L.A., and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita. New political forces are also likely to take part.
Portuguese diplomats warned that despite the details built into today's draft accord, Angola's transition to democracy will nonetheless be difficult because of the deep distrust that still separates the opposing forces.
They said that, more than a sign of true reconciliation, the agreement resulted from recognition by both sides that neither could win an outright military victory.
"There were no winners and no losers today,"' Mr. Durao Barroso said tonight. "The only winners are the Angolan people."
 
Outside Influences
 But the peace process also benefited from changes beyond the country's borders, including new Soviet-American cooperation to settle regional conflicts, South Africa's decision to grant independence to Namibia last year and the agreement that all Cuban troops will leave Angola by July 1 this year.
For Angola's 10 million people, a lasting cease-fire should bring respite from a seemingly endless process of internal warfare that began when nationalist guerrilla groups first started fighting for independence from Portuguese colonial rule more than 30 years ago.
After Portugal's rightist dictatorship was toppled in 1974, in good measure because of the unpopularity of its efforts to hold onto its African colonies, the new Government in Lisbon was so eager to get out of Africa that it granted independence to Angola in 1975 without adequate preparations.
A scramble for power resulted, with the Soviet-backed Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola calling in Cuban troops to help it obtain control of the capital city, Luanda, and much of the coast and oil-producing areas, and Unita, then backed by China, and other armed groups occupying rural areas bordering on Namibia and Zaire.
 
South Africa Joins Conflict
 Cuban troops, which at one point numbered 50,000, insured the survival of the Luanda Government in the growing civil war, but they also drew South Africa into the conflict from Namibia. By the late 1970's, Pretoria was backing Unita. By 1986, American military aid to the rebels was public.
A turning point came when Washington and Moscow began working together to try to end several regional wars. This led to agreement that Cuba start withdrawing from Angola on Jan. 1, 1989, and that South Africa stop arming Unita as well as pull out of Namibia. Simultaneously, both the Luanda Government and Unita began floating their own peace plans.
Finally, in April last year, Portugal, using its influence as the former colonial power, brought the two sides together for the first of what would prove to be seven negotiating sessions ending in today's accord. Since September, Soviet and American observers have also taken part in the talks.
In Luanda, the Government has been preparing for peace by permitting the emergence of new centrist political forces that hope to profit from popular disenchantment with both the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, which has earned a reputation for corruption as well as repression, and Unita, which has been blamed in massacres.
At a special congress last week, the Popular Movement also abandoned its commitment to Marxist-Leninism and declared itself a social democratic force. Addressing the congress, President dos Santos said peace was essential. "In spite of enormous sacrifices," he said. "the country is more devastated than it was in 1975."
With Lopo de Nascimento representing Luanda and Jeremias Chitunda leading the Unita delegation, the negotiations dealt with all aspects of the peace process, including the complex question of insuring that neither side will be in a position to use the army to swing next year's elections.
In the final round of talks, held since April 4 at a hotel school at Bicesse near Estoril on the outskirts of Lisbon, one of the main points of dispute was the date of the elections. The Luanda Government proposed November or December 1992, while Unita insisted on September next year. In the end, a compromise was found.
Earlier today, President dos Santos told a May Day crowd that an accord had been reached but, hinting at problems that may still lie ahead, he warned, "We must be in condition to prevent our adversaries from taking advantage of any distraction on our part to try and achieve by force what they have failed to win up to now."

 BODY:
In the 1930's, when Shenandoah National Park was established here in the Blue Ridge Mountains and engineers boldly stretched the Skyline Drive from one lofty end of the mountain range to the other, visitors could clamber up Mary's Rock and, on a clear day, make out the tip of the Washington Monument 65 miles to the east.
These days, even on the crispest morning after a hard rain, the view from the rock seldom reaches halfway to the monument, and on most mornings little can be made out more than 15 miles away. 
 Air pollution, most of it blown by winds that carry a high concentration of acids produced from factories and utility plants in the Midwest, is the worst in any national park in the country, according to the National Park Service.
The pollution at Shenandoah National Park, which extends 80 miles along the crest of the Blue Ridge in northern Virginia, not only obscures the striking panoramas once visible from cliff-hugging overlooks, but is also slowly poisoning the park's trout streams and killing its ferns, flowers and forests.
 
On the 'Edge of Disaster'
 The Park Service considers the threat to Shenandoah and other parks so serious that it has recently become one of the Federal Government's most aggressive proponents of antipollution measures. It is opposing two new power plants in southern Virginia, and has suggested other remedies that could slow the pace of economic development in the country.
"Shenandoah National Park is under siege more than any other park in the country," said J. William Wade, the superintendent of the park, where spring is now climbing the mountainsides at nature's rate of 100 feet a day, the buds bursting bright green, white, red and yellow despite the haze.
"We've got fish and trees up here that are slowly but steadily beginning to weaken, and in a few cases die, and we've even had a couple of days up here when we've had to issue pollution health warnings," Mr. Wade said. "We're right on the edge of disaster, poised."
"What we do to correct this problem could set a pattern," he continued. "But in any case we've got to act, and fast. More industrial sites and power plants are on the drawing boards, and that means more pollution will soon be on the way if we don't somehow head it off."
 
Top-Ranked Park in Sulfates
 The Park Service says Shenandoah ranks first among major Federal parks in the amount of sulfates in its air, and second in the amount of ozone. Sulfates are a critical part of acid rain, which contains high concentrations of acid-forming chemicals produced in the burning of coal and other industrial processes and carried aloft by air currents. The acidic deposits kill aquatic life, and ozone damages the leaves and slows the growth of plants and trees.
As a result of its concern for Shenandoah, the Park Service is opposing new industrial plants for the first time in its history.
In findings that are disputed by state and Federal environmental agencies, the Park Service contends that the two new coal-fired electric power plants, proposed for southern Virginia would mean more air pollution in Shenandoah, even though the plants would be equipped with pollution control devices. It has said the construction permits should be denied until a way can be found to put a limit on the amount of pollution flowing into the park.
One suggested solution: allow the new plants to be built if their owners agree to pay for devices to cut pollution from older plants elsewhere in the state. In other words, offset new pollution with a reduction in old pollution.
The Park Service also plans to study new industrial sites and power plants planned near other parks, including Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina line and Acadia National Park in Maine.
The agency is also focusing on older plants that affect air quality in Federal parks, particularly Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, where visibility is often a serious problem.
"Parks are meant to be beautiful and heathful places, by definition," said Molly N. Ross, the Park Service's assistant chief of air quality. "We intend to protect ours. We will report what we find and what we think must be done. If that has a beneficial effect beyond our parks, so much the better."
The Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control acknowledges that air pollution in Shenandoah is a serious problem. Nevertheless, it has approved construction of the new plants. The department says pollution estimates and wind calculations do not indicate that the plants, the first of a dozen or so planned for the rapidly growing state, would add to the park's problems.
The regional office of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the nation's final nonjudicial arbiter of air pollution cases, also says its calculations and estimates do not indicate that the new plants would cause further damage to the park.
Environmental groups are expected to appeal these findings, and Park Service officials say they will continue to lobby against building the plants unless steps are taken to put a limit on the level of pollution in Virginia.
"This case is much too serious to let such a flawed finding pass unchallenged," said David W. Carr Jr., a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit group based in Charlottesville, Va., that monitors environmental issues.
"The future of a unique park is at stake, along with the environmental future of a lot of the rest of the state and, for that matter, the future of a lot of other parks," he said. "We'll challenge it, if necessary, if people don't back off and find a better solution. In fact, we'll take it into the courts if necessary."
 
'A Really Major Decision'
 Mr. Carr added: "Sooner or later the E.P.A. will be forced to pass judgment on a fellow Federal agency that has suggested a far-reaching solution to an air quality problem that could affect the pace of industrial growth in a state. That's a really major decision, a precedent, really, and you can bet it will go all the way to the White House before it's over."
On April 18 the Law Center, along with 14 other leading environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Trout Unlimited, called the Virginia and E.P.A. findings inadequate and urged the Federal environmental agency to reassess problems that new power plants might cause in Shenandoah National Park and the rest of Virginia.
While there is a dispute about how much the new power plants would add to Shenandoah's pollution problems, there is little dispute with longstanding statistics indicating that the park is already under serious assault from air pollution, with more than 90 percent of it coming from west of Virginia.
 
Turning Water Into Vinegar
 Studies by the park's scientists and by scientists at the University of Virginia show that air pollutants, particularly the sulfur spewed from coal-fired power plants -- most of them in the industrial Midwest -- are getting into the Shenandoah's streams, mainly in the form of acid rain, raising the acid level in many of them to the point where some fish are dying. A year or so ago, after a particularly heavy assault of foul air, one stream was found to be almost as acidic as vinegar.
Other studies have found that pollutants, especially ozone, are beginning to harm plants and forests, causing some to lose leaves and weakening the disease resistance of others. Twice in recent years, ozone levels have risen so high that park officials have been forced to issue health warnings to hikers, climbers and joggers.
"A lot of national parks are heavily impacted by too many visitors, and some by encroaching development," said David Haskell, chief of the Division of Natural Resources and Science in Shenandoah. "We have some of that, too. But what we have more of than any other park is bad air. It's slowly but surely killing us. When you think about what parks are supposed to be, that's a terrible irony."

HEADLINE: Stricken Nuclear Plant Was at Capacity

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WISCASSET, Me., May 1

 BODY:
The fire that has indefinitely shut the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant occurred while the plant's operators were running the reactor here at record power levels, plant officials said today.
They said equipment installed in the last few years had increased the reactor's capacity to 880 megawatts from its original design capacity of 825 megawatts. In March and through much of April the plant generated record amounts of electricity, most of it sold to utilities outside New England. 
 The Monday explosion and fire that crippled the power plant came in the most troubled year of operation in the plant's 19-year history, the officials said. The accident did not release radiation or damage the nuclear portion of the plant, utility and government officials said. They added that the nuclear reactor was safely shut down today, its heat slowly diminishing through clouds of steam vented into the atmosphere.
Weeks before the accident, an anti-nuclear group here warned that mechanical malfunctions and what it said was an operating philosophy stressing economic returns over safety were pointing to the potential for a major accident.
 
9 Shutdowns in 9 Months
 Among the factors cited by the group, the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, was a sudden turn last July in the plant's operating record. After enjoying years of relatively trouble-free operation, the Maine Yankee nuclear plant was shut nine times in nine months because of leaks in the reactor, problems with gauges and monitoring equipment and difficulty in controlling the turbine that generates electricity.
The group also said Maine Yankee officials were planning to replace a deteriorating electrical generator in September, yet were running the reactor at peak power, generating electricity in near-record levels in April.
"I'm sorry it happened, but things were going on out there that we were worried about," said Robert Moldaver, the executive director of the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, which is based in Portland, 40 miles south of here. "We get accused of making up wild scenarios, but the way I feel is we were lucky it wasn't worse."
Charles D. Frizzle, the president of the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, which operates the plant for 10 utilities that own it, criticized anti-nuclear groups for trying to make the accident a political statement against nuclear power. He sought to characterize the accident as something that could happen at any electrical power plant, and said that in the moments after the explosion the plant's monitoring system identified a malfunction and automatically shut down the nuclear reactor without incident.
"As you can see, there isn't a lot of external damage to the generator and the fire does not look like it was very hot," Mr. Frizzle said in a tour this morning. "This accident had nothing to do with the nuclear operations at this plant and had nothing to do with nuclear power."
Mr. Frizzle said engineers had determined that the accident was probably caused by a short circuit in the transformer outside the plant.
 
Fire Less Intense Than Thought
 The short circuit produced a huge electric current that struck with enormous force. The transformer appears to have sustained an immense internal explosion. Its supporting steel beams are bent, bolts sheared in two, and the sides of the 750,000 pound unit bowed outward.
Monday night, thousands of gallons of mineral oil, used to cool the transformer, poured out of the ruptured transformer, and some of it seeped into the Back River 200 feet away. Workmen scraped seaweed off rocks this morning, finishing the cleanup today.
Inside the plant on Monday, the bolt of electricity split pipes carrying hydrogen gas to the generator, igniting a fire that was controlled within minutes but allowed to burn for nearly four hours for safety reasons, Mr. Frizzle said. The plant's fire brigade shut off the source of the hydrogen, a common coolant for electrical generators, seconds after discovering it.
The fire did not appear to be especially intense, as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission initially reported on Tuesday. Paint near the source of the fire was smeared with soot but had not bubbled as a result of intense heat.
The condition of the generator, however, is not known, Mr. Frizzle said. Workmen have been unable to dismantle the machine to get a closer look. A team of specialists from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the manufacturers of the generator, are on the way here to assist Maine Yankee technicians, Mr. Frizzle said.
The Maine Yankee Plant will be shut for at least a month to replace the transformer, Mr. Frizzle said. Three years ago, the same transformer malfunctioned and had to be rebuilt.
In the worst case, the plant could be shut until December. Maine Yankee was planning to close the plant in September to replace the generator because it was not large enough. It takes two months to install a new generator, and the replacement may not be ready until September.
Maine Yankee supplies about a quarter of the state's electricity, but because of ample power supplies from hydroelectric dams, a short shutdown would not affect households or businesses, said a spokesman for the Central Maine Power Company, the plant's principal owner.
A long shutdown, however, would cause problems in the summer, when demand for electricity is much higher.
If the shutdown drags on, Central Maine officials said, the company may need to buy power from other sources at a cost of $2 million to $5 million a month in the summer. The company did not estimate today how much extra a typical household might pay as a result.
Thomas Coffin, a spokesman for the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, said the extra expense might have been avoided had the nuclear plant's operators paid attention to what he called "unmistakable warning signs."
 
Leaks and Malfunctions
 In the past nine months, the plant was shut down to repair leaks in the reactor steam generator system, malfunctions in gauges and monitors, and a problem in controlling the steam turbine.
The anti-nuclear group said another sign of potential trouble was the boosting of the reactor's generating capacity. They warned the company and the public last week that such power loads might be dangerous because the reactor, the electrical generator and other main components were nearly 20 years old and might not be able to withstand the stress.
"Their song is always 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' " said Mr. Coffin. "But what I say is the potential for a severe accident is always there in a nuclear plant. It didn't happen. I'm glad. What you can also say is it didn't happen this time."
Mr. Frizzle, an electrical engineer who helped to start the reactor in the early 1970's and became the plant's president in 1989, said today that pushing the plant to peak power had nothing to do with the accident.
"There is no relation at all in the events of the last several months that would lead one to have any concern for the safety of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant," he said.

HEADLINE: BIG BANKS REDUCE PRIME LOAN RATE TO 8 1/2% FROM 9%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Most of the nation's largest banks reduced their prime lending rate yesterday to 8 1/2 percent from 9 percent, a move that will cut borrowing costs for small businesses and some consumers, and could eventually help stimulate the lagging economy.
The rate cuts were led by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company; Citibank, the nation's largest bank, and the First National Bank of Chicago and were joined by a host of others, including the Bank of America late in the day. 
 A cut in the prime lending rate is most important to businesses that have loans on which interest rates are pegged to the prime and to consumers who have mortgages or home-equity, credit-card or other installment loans that are adjusted according to the prime.
 
Hoping for a Revival
 The move came one day after the Federal Reserve signaled its desire for lower interest rates by reducing the discount rate it charges on loans to banks to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent and by pushing down the important Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for short-term loans, by a quarter-point, to 5 3/4 percent.
Federal Reserve officials hope the lower rates will help an economy still largely mired in a recession that began in July, but some private economists are not sure the rate moves will provide much aid. The continuing weakness was evident yesterday in the release of divergent results of four barometers of economic activity, from the Government's index of leading indicators to an industrial index of corporate purchasing trends.
 
Pace of Decline Slows
 The reports added up to a picture of an economy still losing ground but not so quickly as it was and with a few encouraging signs showing up. Stock traders focused on those signs yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 42.33 points.
"The economy is not declining so rapidly as during the winter months, but it is still declining," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank.
The Government's chief economic forecasting gauge, the index of leading indicators, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March, its second consecutive monthly advance, the Commerce Department reported, and that followed a revised 1.2 percent gain for February. But the gain came mostly from improved consumer confidence, higher stock prices, and an increase in the nation's money supply.
Analysts said that more recent readings of consumer confidence, taken in April, showed modest declines, and that most parts of the leading-indicators index continued to point toward a weak economy. Furthermore, in another report yesterday, the department said construction spending fell 1.5 percent in March, wiping out a small gain registered in February.
And the Federal Reserve said its latest survey of its 12 regional banks showed that economic activity remained weak in much of the nation during the early spring, but that the recession might be nearing its low point. That assessment was also evident in a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The group's monthly survey showed that the economy remained in recession in April, although with slight improvement in new orders, production and deliveries.
The association's index of economic activity rose to 42.1 percent in April from 40 percent in March. But economists said the improvement was virtually insignificant because the economy remained sluggish. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is declining, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion.
These economic reports lead some private economists to conclude that declining interest rates alone will not be sufficient to revive the economy. Unlike the economic downturn of 1981 and 1982, when the prime rate rose above 20 percent, the economy's current malaise is attributed to a variety of other factors, rather than to high interest rates.
"A half-point change in interest rates does not do much to stimulate loan demand," said James E. Annable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago, one of the first banks to cut its prime rate yesterday. "The major impact of the rate cut is among people who are already borrowing."
Similarly, H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, the securities firm, said, "The latest rate reduction by itself is not likely to stimulate a lot of borrowing or pull the economy out of a recession." But he added that the cumulative effect of the drop in short-term interest rates in the last two years "plus the declines still to come" are key parts of the Federal Reserve's efforts to revive the economy.
The prime rate has little effect on large businesses, particularly the 1,000 largest corporations, because they generally pay interest rates that are linked to conditions in the financial markets. Currently, the highest-quality large companies can borrow at interest rates below 6 percent by selling commercial paper, a kind of i.o.u., or they can borrow at rates below prime from banks.
Lower rates entice some borrowers, economists say, but most borrowers are more concerned with the general economic outlook. Businesses, for example, are most concerned about future demand for their products, while consumers are more concerned about employment conditions and the chances of losing their jobs.
Analysts expect that unemployment will be one of the last measures of the economy to show improvement. The number of jobless is expected to increase in May, and analysts warn that the unemployment rate could rise from its current level of 6.8 percent, which is up sharply from 5.3 percent last summer.
Federal Reserve officials began pushing short-term interest rates lower in early 1989 amid gathering signs of economic weakness. Banks, in turn, have lowered the prime rate from its 11 1/2 percent level of early 1989, but their cuts have been less than the drop in other interest rates. Analysts and bankers say the reason is that the banks need to offset losses from record amounts of defaulted and delinquent loans.
Economists noted that the recent declines in interest rates have already helped some sectors of the economy, particularly housing, where new building permits have been increasing, and mortgage lenders are reporting an increase in sales activity now that mortgage rates are below 10 percent.
 
Sluggish Demand for Loans
 But lower interest rates have not yet caused the widespread rebound in loan demand that would point to a general rise in spending by businesses and consumers. Business loans at large banks across the country, after adjusting for seasonal aberrations, fell at about a 3.3 percent rate in the month ended April 11, the lastest available data, and have fallen at a 6.1 percent rate since mid-December, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Consumers also do not seem much attracted by lower rates, as shown by a decline in consumer credit in March.
At its current level of 8 1/2 percent, the prime rate is the lowest since February 1988. The only time it has been lower in the last 10 years was a 14-month period in 1986 and 1987, when it fell to 7 1/2 percent.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Book Says Powell Had Doubts on Bush's War Plan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
A new book on the Bush Administration's decisionmaking in the Persian Gulf war says that Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had serious reservations about the President's push for an offensive military strategy against Iraq's army in Kuwait.
The Washington Post reports in its Thursday editions that "The Commanders," a forthcoming book by a Post editor, Bob Woodward, says that General Powell repeatedly suggested a "containment" strategy of sanctions and pressure to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Mr. Bush was said to have rejected this advice, citing the political costs of waiting for such a strategy to work, The Post reported. 
 The Post account did not say that General Powell opposed the military option, and the general has said publicly that he supported the decision.
Mr. Woodward also writes that a senior Defense Intelligence Agency officer, Walter P. Lang, sent an explicit warning to Pentagon leaders two days before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait that President Saddam Hussein intended to send his troops across the border.
 
No Alarm Sounded
 Mr. Lang was said to have intended for his warning to generate a "thunderclap" in the Pentagon, but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney rejected a suggestion from General Powell that they sound an alarm at the White House, Mr. Woodward's book reports.
Mr. Woodword's account is likely to reignite the debate over the adequacy of the intelligence warnings and the Administration's response to them.
"The Commanders" covers decision-making surrounding the gulf war and the invasion of Panama in December 1989, protraying the relationship between General Powell and other senior Administration officials, including President Bush.
Excerpts from the book are to begin running in The Post on Friday.
The news article about "The Commanders" in The Post's Thursday editions emphasizes that Mr. Woodward "once again employs a technique that has created controversy for him in the past," by "describing how several key figures thought and acted without saying explicitly whether they provided him with the information."
Mr. Woodward also uses direct quotations in the book without specifying how he obtained such details of conversations, The Post says.
But in an opening note to readers, the author says that "thoughts, beliefs, and conclusions attributed to a participant come from that individual or from a source who gained knowledge of them directly from that person."
Mr. Woodward says in the note that he interviewed more than 400 people over 27 months, The Post said.
Pentagon officials have said that among those who gave interviews to Mr. Woodward were Mr. Cheney; General Powell and other senior members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams; the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Carl E. Vuono; and Adm. William J. Crowe, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
According to the book, the commander of allied forces in the gulf, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, was "furious" when President Bush began pressing for a plan for an attack on Iraqi forces in October.
Mr. Woodward's account parallels General Schwarzkopf's public statements that he was rushed into offering a plan that was rejected. He maintains that this early plan, for a frontal ground assault against Iraqi forces in Kuwait, was never his recommendation.
The book suggests that the President's inner circle was divided between hawks and doves.
The President and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, along with Mr. Cheney, were pressing for a military offensive because they were convinced that sanctions would not deliver a timely victory, The Post quoted the book as saying.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, General Powell and perhaps other military chiefs were worried about both the human costs and the political costs of a war, it said.
Though Mr. Woodward draws distinctions between the views of these officials, the Post account of the book gives no indication that these reservations carried forward into January, when the final decision to attack Iraq was reached.
Judging from the Post's account, the magnitude of the book's assertions do not rival those in Mr. Woodward's previous works -- "All the President's Men" and "The Final Days," on Watergate and the Nixon White House, which he wrote with Carl Bernstein; "The Brethren," which examined the inner workings of the Supreme Court, or "Veil," a 1987 expose about the C.I.A.
After President Bush's election in 1988, General Powell reportedly turned down offers to serve as Director of Central Intelligence or take a senior State Department position. He chose instead to return to the Army from his last White House job in the Reagan Administration, where he was national security adviser.
 
Powell's View of Campaign
 Mr. Woodward asserts that General Powell made that decision partly because "he felt uneasy about the man who was about to become President." The general "was troubled by the way the Bush campaign had been run. The race-baiting Willie Horton television commercial especially bothered him," the Post account quotes the book as saying.
It was Mr. Cheney, the book says, who sought out General Powell for the top military job upon the retirement of Admiral Crowe.Mr. Cheney has taken credit for in a number of press accounts.
The book also reports some conflict between Mr. Cheney and the White House Chief of Staff, John H. Sununu, who is said to have denied a request from the Defense Secretary to borrow a Presidential helicopter to fly the military chiefs to Camp David for a meeting after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
Baker Said to Back Powell
 The book portrays Mr. Baker as General Powell's chief ally in seeking to urge Mr. Bush to let the sanctions take their toll on Iraq as a means of averting war. Mr. Woodward says that Mr. Baker confided to some of his closest aides that the White House was "speeding, not thinking through what it was doing."

HEADLINE: New York City's Loss Is Albany's Gain

 BODY:
What happened in the State of New York this week sounded like a political satirist's idea of a joke, but it was far from funny.
To summarize: New York City had to raise money by selling $1.2 billion in high-yield notes because the state, more than a month late in passing its budget, hasn't paid money it owes the city. No budget, no state aid. So who bought $50 million worth of the notes? The State of New York -- which in effect profited from the fiscal anguish it had helped cause. 
 The transaction was a good deal for the state because the city is in such poor economic shape it had to pay an unusually high interest rate of 6.74 percent on those tax-free notes. "Our first, paramount concern is to maximize the return on our investment," explained a spokesman for State Comptroller Edward Regan.
It's hard to fault that logic. But it's very easy indeed to fault some of those playing the budget game in Albany.
Gov. Mario Cuomo has at least proposed a plausible if painfully austere budget that deals with the state's growing deficit, and has warned that excessive delay could push the city over the brink. Mr. Cuomo could help matters along by showing an inclination to compromise. But even that might not do it. The process is bogged down. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller waited until the eve of the budget deadline to offer a sketchy alternative to the Governor's proposal, and the Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino, unduly concerned about helping the state's wealthiest school districts, has hardly provided strong leadership. Neither has mobilized the Legislature to act on a budget.
The problem, of course, is that the economy is so tattered and the looming deficit so large -- as high as $6.5 billion -- that nobody can agree on how to mete out the pain. But the budget deadline was April 1. The longer the wait, the more cities, towns, counties and school districts will have to borrow by selling notes and bonds at high interest rates.
A paradoxical twist allowed the State Treasury to benefit from the problems the state visited on an already burdened New York City. But in the long run, the absence of a budget only hurts localities and the state itself, which has to worry about its own bond rating and credibility.

HEADLINE: Hollow Rhetoric From the Unions

BYLINE: By Mario M. Cuomo; Mario M. Cuomo of New York is one of 31 Governors facing budget deficits this year.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
There are a lot of unhappy people in New York City and throughout the state. The rally on Tuesday in downtown Manhattan arranged by public employees' unions was one of the latest expressions of dissatisfaction with the cold reality of the recession, a recession felt not only by New Yorkers but by nearly every American.
Cold, too, is the reality of New York State's loss of revenue that has led to a nearly $6.5 billion potential deficit in the current fiscal year and the need to take drastic steps to deal with it. 
 Significant truths were obscured in the rhetoric at the rally. The representatives of the city employees said that the spending cuts I have recommended to close the state's budget gap are too deep and that the state should raise taxes instead.
What they called for, in effect, is a $3 billion to $4 billion tax increase. They say Albany can get it all from the "rich." But Albany can't raise that much money without taxing the working poor and middle class as well. One income tax proposal, offered by Mel Miller, the Assembly Speaker, would raise less than one-quarter of what the unions want, and would tax people making as little as $11,000 a year.
Those who ask for a tax on nearly every working poor and middle-class New Yorker under the guise of a "tax the wealthy" slogan are just not telling the truth. The billions in taxes the union leaders ask for would be paid largely by the working people of New York City. And by driving away businesses already thinking of leaving, a $3 billion to $4 billion rise in taxes would result not in coffers filled with revenues to preserve services and jobs but a loss of the work opportunities that our poor and middle class need.
Also lost in the protest rhetoric is the fact that the state already taxes the wealthy heavily. In 1983, on my recommendation, the state imposed a real-property gains tax on the sale of higher-priced real property. In my budget proposal this year, I asked the Legislature for an expansion of the mansion tax, for an increased estate tax on the wealthy and for increased fees on luxury automobiles.
Only Oregon relies more heavily on income taxes -- the most progressive tax a state has at its disposal -- than New York does right now.
Workers represented by the union leaders who demanded higher taxes will receive $1 billion in salary increases over the next two years. While that is a victory for union members, that's $1 billion less that the city has to spend for all the poor and the working class people for whom the union leaders claim to speak.
Even if money were available, it is not sensible for the state to commit additional wealth to the city to finance raises for its unions when I have called for layoffs, payroll deferrals and no raises for state workers.
Despite the protesters' slogans and signs, I am sure that the soundly balanced, while austere, budget I have submitted is the best way to preserve jobs, services and programs. It gives the poor and working people a better chance of making it through these hard times, with a better hope for the future, than would placing a crushing new tax burden on an already terribly weak New York City economy.
The protesters should remember that the state and city share common antagonists. There are conservatives who criticize us for having spent too much on our children, on hospitals, housing and roads and bridges in the prosperous 1980's -- and even in the lean budget I have submitted. It will take strength to resist the efforts of these conservatives to disable our progressive state programs.

HEADLINE: Lower East Side and Chinatown Need Distinct Council Districts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The so-called multiracial plan for a New York City Council district proposed by Lower East Siders for a Multiracial District (letter, April 16) violates every conceivable definition of this community. 
 It takes the area west of Avenue A from Third Street to 14th Street and consigns it to another district with which it has no ties. The portion they would discard is the best known and most traveled part of the neighborhood. If Astor Place, St. Mark's Place, LaMama Theater, the Second Avenue Deli and the Ottendorfer Library are not an integral part of the Lower East Side, what is?
Their plan would also exclude the Polish and Ukrainian communities, two of our oldest immigrant groups. Although they call it multiracial, their plan is both racially and economically segregationist. It would take the primarily Hispanic and low-income Alphabet City and call that the Lower East Side. Such a plan ignores the splendid diversity of ethnic groups and cultural heritages that form the true mosaic of the city's most historic neighborhood.
The Puerto Rican-Hispanic Political Council, of which I am an executive committee member, is a coalition of once-feuding Latinos, now united for political empowerment on the Lower East Side. We want the same things as our neighbors -- affordable housing, clean and safe streets, and hope for our children and elderly. We see the Lower East Side as a neighborhood, not a museum of poverty.
Our plan keeps the Latino community intact and combines with it traditional Lower East Side communities. Our Hispanic-based district was created after consulting leaders of the Polish and Ukrainian neighborhoods. Further, it recognizes the legitimate aspirations of the Asian community.
The Multiracial district proposal would force Latinos and Asians to fight for a single council seat. The vast majority of both populations don't want such a fight, but neither are they willing to put their aspirations on hold. Since neither Latinos nor Asians have the numbers to be a majority in any Lower East Side district, both groups would have to form coalitions to win.
Better to have separate districts, each free to build its own coalitions, each with the opportunity to win a Council seat. It is for this reason that we have excluded Chinatown and Asian areas from our plan.
The Redistricting Commission has a mandate to create districts that preserve historical, racial, cultural and economic ties. That mandate will be violated by any plan that divides the Lower East Side and forces half of it into a shotgun marriage with Chinatown.

Chrysler's 'Abysmal' Loss of $598 Million

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 1

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, hurt by slumping automotive demand, posted a first-quarter loss of $598 million today. However, the ailing auto maker said it would build more vehicles in the current quarter than it did in the first quarter, and said it did not plan to draw on backup credit lines for the remainder of the year.
The first-quarter results followed reports of steep losses yesterday by its larger rivals. The General Motors Corporation posted a loss of $377 million and the Ford Motor Company one of $1.1 billion. 
 "The quarter was abysmal," said Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive. "Industry volume simply collapsed and, as a result, we suffered our worst car and truck retail sales since the first quarter of 1983."
Looking ahead, Jerome B. York, Chrylser's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said: "Losses should be less in the second quarter than in the first, but it would require optimism to say that we will have a profit in the second quarter. The recovery will be gradual for the next two quarters. Based on everything we've seen, we think the first quarter was the bottom."
The No. 3 auto maker is in a precarious condition as it attempts to ride out a recession that is battering Japanese and European auto makers as well as the stronger American companies. Because its financial resources have dwindled, Chrysler in recent months arranged a $1.75 billion line of backup credit with more than 30 banks.
Chrysler had a profit of $71 million, or 32 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1990. The auto maker's loss in this year's quarter reflected a $257 million one-time charge attributable to a change in the way consumer incentives are accounted for, a $199 million one-time charge to cover the cost of reducing the salaried work force and a $242 million after-tax credit for the reduction of certain costs related to the 1987 acquisition of the American Motors Corporation.
 
24% Drop in Revenue
 Chrysler's first-quarter revenue fell 24 percent, to $5.8 billion, from $7.63 billion in the period last year.
Worldwide factory sales of cars and trucks to dealers, on which revenue and profit are booked, slipped 19.7 percent, to 396,410, during the quarter. Mr. York said Chrysler planned to build approximately 100,000 more cars and trucks this quarter than last.
Earnings at Chrysler's financial subsidiary dipped 13.5 percent, to $77 million, primarily because of the increased cost of borrowed funds, Mr. York said. During the last six months the Chrysler Financial Corporation has been all but shut out of the commercial paper market because of a poor debt rating; instead, the subsidiary has been forced to borrow from banks, which charge higher interest rates.
Meanwhile, Chrysler has had to continue to discount aggressively to hold its share of the market. The average cost of consumer incentives was $1,100 a vehicle in the first quarter, down from about $1,250 in the fourth quarter of last year. Mr. York predicted that incentives costs would remain high in the current quarter, averaging $1,100 to $1,250.
Through the first quarter Chrysler was selling about 35 percent of its vehicles to fleets, including daily-rental companies. That compared with 24 percent during the similar quarter last year and put additional downward pressure on profit margins since fleet sales are far less profitable than retail sales to individual customers.
Mr. York said the average number of cars and trucks ordered by Chrysler dealers rose to 8,900 a day in April, compared with 4,600 a day in January, 5,100 in February and 8,600 in March.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the first-quarter loss at the Chrysler Corporation misstated the Ford Motor Company's loss for the quarter. It was $884 million.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Academy Preparing Festival Despite Money Fears

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
With its customary buoyancy, the Brooklyn Academy of Music yesterday announced details of its next Next Wave Festival, which has become New York City's foremost showcase for the vanguard performing arts.
 Behind the air of enthusiasm, however, lies deep concern about whether the Brooklyn Academy will be able to present the annual fall festival or even sustain its overall operations. Already shaken by fund-raising troubles in the current recession and by arts-support cuts at the city, state and Federal levels, the academy will, its president says, be "absolutely devastated" should Mayor Dinkins's suggested cuts of up to 50 percent be carried out. 
 The academy has received a relatively generous city grant, $2.6 million for this fiscal year. But it was later trimmed by $200,000, or 8 percent, and could be reduced by a further $1.1 million in fiscal 1992 if Mr. Dinkins's full cuts are put into effect. On May 10, the Mayor is to present his proposed budget, which requires approval by the City Council, but in the meantime he is trying to extract concessions from labor unions to soften the worst of the blows.
 
Survival of the Fittest
 Of the 31 arts organizations currently supported by the city, such major institutions as the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic would also be hurt by the cuts, but their existence would not be threatened. Many others, however, whose financial underpinnings are more tenuous, have expressed fears for their very survival. These include the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of the City of New York and the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens as well as the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
 "This institution was built on the idea of cooperation between the city and the private sector," said Harvey Lichtenstein, the academy's president and executive producer. "We could not have survived without that partnership. If these cuts, or even half these cuts, go through, we will be in serious jeopardy."
 When Mr. Lichtenstein announced last month that he would be unable to import the Hamburg, Germany, production of Robert Wilson's cabaret opera "The Black Rider," which has music by the rock star Tom Waits and had been announced as a centerpiece of this year's New York International Festival of the Arts, there was talk in arts circles that the academy was in a perilous financial condition. The current budgetary proposals only underscore that peril.
 The academy's annual budget has fluctuated in recent years between $10 and $14 million. That is because so much of the budget depends on specific projects, which vary in scope from year to year. The academy's fund-raising, too, is "project driven," in the words of Karen Brooks Hopkins, the executive vice president, who is in charge of finances.
 With "The Black Rider," as with all of the academy's imports, specific fund-raising for that project, along with expected box-office revenues, had to balance costs. The academy has no endowment fund, although there is a contingency fund to cover last-minute emergencies.
 
Final Straw: An Extra $150,000
 Although details of the "Black Rider" disagreement have been obscured by squabbling between Ludwig von Otting of the Thalia Theater in Hamburg and Mr. Lichtenstein, both sides agree that the Thalia insisted late in the negotiations that an extra $150,000 was needed (beyond a total budget of $800,000) to present the production properly. Mr. Lichtenstein couldn't -- and wouldn't -- free up that kind of money, having already committed his contingency fund to the overall budget deficit. By the time compromises were discussed, Martin E. Segal of the International Festival had withdrawn his support.
 A closely related problem has been Mr. Lichtenstein's failure to plan foreign engagements long in advance, as is common in the world of opera. That is in part because he is used to working with more spontaneous dance and theater companies, partly because of his financial limitations and partly because the Metropolitan Opera suddenly withdrew from a planned three-year collaboration, leaving Mr. Lichtenstein to hustle up replacements at short notice. He is, however, working now on a multi-year agreement with the Opera Comique of Paris to present a French Baroque opera annually.
 Despite his disappointment over "Black Rider," one had the impression that Mr. Lichtenstein was a little relieved when the project collapsed, given his broader and deeper problems. For the 1991 fiscal year ending June 30, the academy's expenses will be $11 million, and for the first time in a decade it will show a deficit. (For cultural institutions, the word deficit means an unexpected shortfall between expenses and income from the box office, fund-raising and grants.)
 
A $1.1 Million Shortfall
 Income for the current fiscal year will fall $1.1 million below what Mr. Lichtenstein calls Ms. Hopkins's "conservative" estimate. Some $300,000 of that comes from poor box-office revenues from Martha Clarke's "Endangered Species" and the Berlin Komische Oper's production of Gluck's "Orpheus and Euridice." An additional $400,000 can be attributed to fund-raising falling below its goals, and the remaining $400,000 to cuts in public funds.
 Over the last few years, a significant source of income for the academy has been the sale of prints donated by such well-known artists as David Salle and Roy Lichtenstein. But the decline in the art market in general has seriously undermined such sales. Whereas blue-chip corporations and senior executives support mainstream institutions like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, the academy has generally drawn its support from trendier, more youth-oriented industries -- fashion, advertising -- that are more susceptible to economic cycles.
 The academy has been able to make up much of the $1.1 million gap. A 10 percent cut in operating expenses -- through layoffs, furloughs and other cost-cutting measures -- saved $650,000, and the contingency fund of $300,000 was applied to the deficit. That still leaves, depending on final accounting (including next month's importation of three Ingmar Bergman theater productions from Stockholm), between $150,000 and $250,000 that must be made up by after-the-fact fund-raising.
 
Some Lively Items Left
 For fiscal 1992, Ms. Hopkins has projected a budget of only $9.5 million, which includes a cut in this fall's Next Wave Festival from $2.1 million to $1.7 million. The program still includes some lively items -- the Pina Bausch Dance Theater from Wuppertal, Germany; a number of dance and puppet-theater troupes (dance is usually less expensive than opera or theater); a Brooklyn Philharmonic program of premieres with Keith Jarrett and Dennis Russell Davies, and several Brazilian and African-American works reflecting the multi-cultural interests of the new Next Wave director, Liz Thompson.
 Still, all this could be threatened if the academy cannot resolve its financial difficulties, of which the threat of a major reduction in city support is the most extreme and immediate.
 "If these cuts go through," Mr. Lichtenstein said, "and unless somebody bails us out, which is highly unlikely, we may simply have to close our doors."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Brooklyn Academy of Music misstated the circumstances under which the New York International Festival of the Arts canceled its contract to support the import of "The Black Rider," a Hamburg theater production. The contract was canceled at the request of the academy, after its negotiations with the producers of the show had broken down.

HEADLINE: Rescuing Health Care

SERIES: The Price of Health - Last of five articles.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Chaotic, costly and even cruel, the nation's health care system may pose the supreme political test of the 1990's.
Never before have so many groups -- including many doctors, large corporations, public officials, economists and worried citizens -- called urgently for sweeping change in American health care. 
 Everyone agrees on the goals: insuring access for all and cutting down runaway costs while preserving high-quality care.
But there is still no consensus on how to restructure the system, a fiendishly tangled thicket of traditions, expectations and special interests that has long defied rational control. Many of the proposed solutions would require new tax dollars and all would mean wrenching change for someone.
And remedies will almost certainly mean new constraints, limits on choice in an area where Americans are accustomed to demanding the best, regardless of price.
"We are inconsistent," said Gail Wilensky, who as head of the Health Care Financing Administration presides over the increasingly costly Federal medical programs for the elderly and the poor. "We want everybody to have everything, and we don't want to wait for it. But we certainly don't want to increase taxes."
 
Push for Overhaul
 Congress is taking up health care with a fervor not seen since the 1960's, when creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs brought a temporary reprieve. For its part, the Bush Administration says it also is developing proposals for change.
Partial measures to extend health insurance to more people could be adopted in the next year or two, lawmakers predict. Broader measures that guarantee care for everyone, or reorganize the way care is paid for or delivered, seem more distant, though that could change as runaway costs shake up more parts of society.
The United States spends far more on health per person than any other country. And technically the care is often superb, the envy of the world. Yet the United States is the only advanced industrial nation that fails to insure care for everyone, the only nation that leaves families vulnerable to medically induced financial disaster.
In Europe, Canada and Japan, governments not only play bigger roles in financing health care; they also play more powerful roles in setting medical prices and limiting overall spending.
The payment system, a chaotic mix of private and public insurers, encourages overuse and overpricing. Doctors and hospitals are forced to spend ever more energy trying to reap funds from the bewildering array of payers, each with different rules. The mounting paperwork and second-guessing are deflating morale in the medical profession, leading more doctors to retire early and fewer young people to apply to medical school.
"We have a badly organized, improperly motivated delivery system, and an inefficient, wasteful payment system," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine who is a leading critic of American health care.
In the current structure, rising payments do not reflect a social choice for better health; costs are eluding anyone's control. There is no leveling in sight.
"We spend 12 percent of our income on health, and 6 percent on education," said Daniel Callahan, a medical ethicist who is director of the Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. "Thirty years ago we spent the same amount on each."
"We really have to ask how much is enough."
 
When the Solutions Create New Problems
 As its failings become more apparent, the system is responding, but with partial steps that often create new problems as they solve old ones.
Free-market mythology aside, government already plays a central role. More than 40 percent of all health spending is paid by Federal, state and local governments through the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled, the Medicaid program that covers some of the poor and the military medical system.
Medicare has made pioneering efforts to contain costs by paying uniform fees for hospital care. But, like a balloon that is squeezed in one spot only to bulge in another, these efforts are undermined by shifting of costs. If beleaguered hospitals receive lower public payments, they charge private payers more; if doctor's fees per service are capped, then the number of services jumps.
While government has led the battle to restrict fees, private insurance companies are trying to slow inflation by encouraging "managed care," including aggressive scrutiny of treatment decisions and more use of health maintenance organizations. The scrutiny saves money, but it also means more bureaucracy.
Already, administrative costs soak up one-fifth of the country's health spending, twice the share as in Canada, said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler of the Harvard Medical School, a co-author of a study on administrative costs published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Dr. Woolhandler is also a leader of some 3,500 physicians who are calling for national health insurance, along Canadian lines. Their position goes well beyond that of the powerful American Medical Association, which supports measures to extend private insurance to all workers and Medicaid for the poor, but opposes national insurance or spending ceilings. In a sign of shifting attitudes, though, other mainstream groups representing tens of thousands of doctors have declared their willingness to consider radical overhaul, even including national health insurance.
 
A Blizzard of Choices For Congress to Sort Out
 For decades there has been talk of closing the gaps in the insurance system. Now, even as concern about access is surging, so is fright about soaring cost, creating new obstacles to change. Many in the debate, including major labor unions that had long stressed the access side of the equation, now oppose major new programs to extend care without cost control. And that is a far more complex and divisive matter.
Congress, according to major legislators, is still sorting out the myriad of possible responses. This year, it will consider proposals to reduce the uninsured by requiring most companies to offer health benefits or else pay into a public insurance pool.
To work, this approach should be accompanied by new regulations to make insurance more accessible to small businesses, said George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader. It must also be accompaned by effective cost controls, he added.
Mr. Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, has made health care a personal crusade. He says measures that "build on the current system" should be tried before the country considers national insurance or the setting of national spending limits.
These deeper changes face the fierce opposition of private insurance companies, manufacturers of drugs and medical equipment and some medical groups, among others that could lose income or influence.
"If you nationalize health insurance, you'll have Americans covered very poorly in 10 years," said Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, the industry's trade group. "Government hasn't kept its promises to either the poor or the aged."
Huge political obstacles confront even the more modest proposals, said Senator Mitchell, who drew a comparison with legislation against acid rain, which he first offered in 1981 but that did not pass for nine years.
Requiring companies to offer health insurance, for example, is opposed by small-business owners, while proposals for new public programs run up against budgetary fears.
Perhaps the most likely legislation to pass in the next year or two will be aimed at insurance rules, trying to reduce the skyrocketing rates for small businesses and individuals. "I think that this year it's feasible to do something by way of small-business insurance reform," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the crucial Senate Finance Committee.
As for broader change, he said, "I've got senators coming at it from all different directions."
Democrats accuse the President of a lack of leadership. President Bush has passed the issue to Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Dr. Sullivan has described the system's problems in detail in recent speeches and exhorted the public to lead healthier lives. He has not yet announced any proposals for change, though he has made his instincts clear. "We need to build on our achievements by getting an even higher percentage of people covered by insurance," he recently said, "rather than replacing our system with something that Americans do not need and would not tolerate."
 
The Day of Reckoning With a New Life of Limits
 However financing and care are reorganized, Americans are destined to confront unfamiliar limits.
"Medicine is not going to conquer death," said Dr. Callahan, the ethicist. "But it's going to find every more expensive way to stave off mortality."
Agreeing on how and when to limit spending may pose the hardest political test of all.
At a minimum, better ways are needed to judge the merits of costly procedures and actively discourage their overuse.
"All of us are interested in seeing that useful new technology gets out there," said Dr. Wilensky, the Federal official. "But all the pressures in the system are to do more, expect more, want more."
Where procedures are clearly useless, the decision is easy. More often, real medical gains must be weighed against huge increases in cost. Is a thousand-dollar scan with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging device warranted to rule out a small risk of brain disease? Should insurers pay for an antibiotic that is 10 percent more likely to be effective but costs 10 times as much as the alternative?
The Federal Government, as it decides what Medicare will cover, is gingerly entering the slippery arena of cost-effectiveness. It hopes, through studies of medical experience, to promote more cost-conscious guidelines for appropriate treatment. These studies might clarify, for example, which patterns of headache justify using the costly M.R.I. scanner, and which patients with heart disease truly benefit from now-overused bypass surgery.
But it is one thing to issue guidelines, and another to deny payment against a doctor's professional judgment. And in any case, will more prudent practice be enough to contain overall spending? Some experts say society will have to cross the murky zone between urging sensible, cost-effective treatment and overt rationing, refusing to pay for some kinds of care to hold down costs.
Questions are raised especially about huge payments for patients with poor odds of survival -- $100,000 bone-marrow transplants in certain cancer patients who are unlikely to be saved, for example, or $5,000-a-day intensive care for aged, extremely ill patients who are unlikely to regain consciousness.
Many experts insist that at current spending levels, the country should have ample funds to provide all medically useful treatments -- if only the system could be overhauled to get rid of its pervasive waste.
"Maybe 20 or 30 years out, with a more aged population and even better technologies, maybe then we won't be able to do everything we know how to do," said Karen Davis, a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University. "I don't think we're near that point now."
"Things that work, we should do," Dr. Davis said. "Kidney transplants work, heart transplants work. They are expensive, but we can afford that in a $650 billion budget."
But Dr. Callahan, who believes the country must begin debating health priorities, said: "Efficiency will only stave off the day of reckoning. An aging society and increasingly expensive technology are going to force limits on us sooner or later."
A more politically feasible way to limit care may be the less direct path now followed by Canada and other countries: limit investment in costly machines, medical specialists and intensive-care services.
"Once you're there in the intensive care unit, it's extremely hard to withhold things," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. "If you wish to ration, I feel the only way to do it is not to put the resources there in the first place."
But first, the country must do something about another kind of rationing, already here and more shameful, that through expense and indignities prevents the poor from getting decent medical treatment.
"Our public hospital system is withholding care in a brutal fashion," Dr. Reinhardt said.

GRAPHIC: Graphs: "Rethinking the Health System: Choices for Change . . . "
 
Improve Current Coverage
 
* Use tax incentives, new insurance regulations and public programs to promote insurance for those now left out.
 
* Employers would be required to offer insurance or pay into a pool that would offer policies to uninsured workers. Medicaid would be expanded to cover the unemployed poor.
 
* While this approach has gained the widest support so far, it is fiercely opposed by small-business owners and critics say it would only add to the administrative morass. Aid for smaller cmpanies and the poor could require significant new public spending.
 
National Health Insurance
 
* Following the Canadian model, private insurance could be largely scrapped for a universal public insurance program, financed by income, payroll or other taxes. The public payer would set uniform national fees.
 
* National financing has the virtue of simplicity, reducing paperwork and allowing easier control of costs. Universal care could in theory be achieved without major new net spending.
 
* Opponents fear this approach would impose rigid limits on medical decisions and personal choice, and would lead to a shortchanging of healthcare by a fiscally strapped Government.
 
Individual Coverage
 
* Promoted by market-oriented conservatives, tax incentives would support direct purchase of insurance by individuals and households. All households would be required to carry a minimum policy and would receive tax credits, linked to income level, for insurance and medical expenses.
 
* This would allow people to switch jobs without worry and would assure minimal coverage for everyone. But even with tax credits, high out-of-pocket payments could be a hardship for poor people, and the price of insurance for those with risky medical histories could soar, requiring major public subsidies.
 
". . . And Strategies to Control Costs"
 
Several strategies, not mutually exclusive, have been proposed. Most could be used in combination with any of the broad structures described above.
 
* Managed Care: Expand efforts to scrutinize doctors' decisions and encourage more patients to enter health maintenance organizations. In some proposals, major payers like government and large corporations would contract with H.M.O.'s for all care.
 While scrutiny saves money, it involves new layers of bureaucracy and is deeply resented by doctors. Also, many doctors and patients oppose being pushed into H.M.O.'s.
 
* Malpractice limitations: Legal changes to hold down lawsuits and size of settlements could help reduce "defensive medicine" in which procedures are used to rule out slight risks.
 
* Single payer: All medical fees could be paid by a single public entity, giving it enormous bargaining power over fee levels and medical practices. While this would happen automatically with a national health plan, private insurers could also, in some proposals, channel their payments through a single public payer.
 In a half-way approach already emerging in Medicare, national guidelines on appropriate fees and use of technology, could be adopted.
 
* Annual cap on expenditures: In an approach successfully used by other countries, annual health budgets could be set - for the country, for states, for individual hospitals - with all care provided for the preset level of funds. If budgets were reasonable, care could be high quality, with strong incentives to offer only cost-effective treatment.
 Critics say the implicit rationing could mean denial of beneficial care and impede medical progress.
 
* Explicit rationing: As proposed in Oregon for its Medicaid program, insurers could refuse to pay for treatments judged as low in priority. Divisive ethical issues would have to be resolved.

HEADLINE: Lawyer Layoffs: Boon to Temporary Job Agencies

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
In waves of cost-cutting, law firm associates have been laid off, suffering misery if not calamity. The firms suffer fear of hiring. And this is an opportunity for people like Lesley Friedman, who notes that "some incredible talent" has been set adrift since she started a temporary placement agency for lawyers in 1987.
Back then, her Manhattan agency placed lawyers who really wanted to be writers or dancers or entrepreneurs, or to spend more time with their children. Now, according to Ms. Friedman and others in the business, lawyers who want full-time law jobs are the largest single contingent of applicants for temporary jobs. 
 Ms. Friedman estimates that a third of the resumes she receives are in this category. Elsewhere, the proportion is higher at agencies specializing in temporary jobs for lawyers. At the Lawsmiths in California, Eric Walker, who manages the Los Angeles office, said about three-quarters of his applicants for temporary work had lost their jobs. Robert S. Hamberger, co-owner of D.C. Legal Support Inc. in Washington, estimates that 70 to 80 percent of the lawyers who notify him would prefer permanent work.
But the option that is commonly called "contract work" in the business is taking up some slack.
 
Quick Changeover for Some
 Sometimes, matches are made practically without a hitch. Michelle S. Babbitt, who was laid off along with 20 to 30 other associates from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan in Manhattan, left there on a Tuesday and on Wednesday started a nine-month job with Schulte Roth & Zabel.
When she got the bad news in December, Ms. Babbitt sent out hundreds of resumes, knowing that the market was "very very dire." Although she initially had something permanent in mind, she was swayed by the prospect of working, even on a temporary basis, at a firm with "a reputation of having excellent, excellent litigators."
And after the "assault on the ego" that dismissal inevitably brings, she said, it is refreshing to concentrate on work and dispense with office politics. "You have the luxury of working in a politically free environment," she said. "You're just free to be an attorney."
Placements like this one helped Lesley Friedman's Special Counsel Inc. enjoy a record year. Ms. Friedman said her gross billings were about $4 million last year, twice what they were in 1989. The agencies pay the lawyers in temporary jobs 70 percent to 80 percent of what they they bill a law firm or corporation. Smaller agencies in other cities say they have only recently seen business pick up, but they agree with Ms. Friedman that they are benefitting from law firms' moves to cut back.
"In 90 percent of cases they've overreacted," said Mr. Walker, of Lawsmiths, "and then can't handle the work. The last thing they're going to do a month or two after this bloodletting is turn around and start hiring laterally again. Then is the time when they turn to people like us."
Part of the increase is the result of the growing acceptance of temporary hiring among lawyers. Even in a profession where self-employment has long been respectable, many initially looked askance at the idea of dispatching people to fill in as lawyers at firms, some of which would not even use temporary secretaries.
 
Part of Change in Firms
 The resistance eroded, though, along with some of the traditional practices of big firms. "There used to be tremendous loyalty of firms to associates and vice versa," said Mr. Hamberger in Washington. "These things tend to dissolve mutually. Law practice has changed in a thousand ways. We are a piece of that."
There is less skepticism, too, about lawyers who have lost jobs. Janis Meresman Goldman, owner of Lawyer's Lawyer in Washington, said her law-firm clients no longer ask. "They know why these people have been laid off," she said.
Robert C. Webster, head of the Lawsmiths' San Francisco office, said that from the day the agency opened in 1985 he had consistently received one or two resumes a day; beginning late last year, he said, the number rose to five or six. Now he says he is receiving three times as many resumes as he did a year ago.
This trend insures a financial advantage to employers, who pay agencies about two-thirds, on an hourly basis, of what a permanent associate would cost.
 
Temporaries Making Less
 Ms. Friedman lowered her rates recently, acknowledging that people coming from law firms "realize the salaries they were paid were quite inflated." Associates with a few years' experience are now pleased to make $40 an hour in a temporary job, she said, whereas a year ago they commanded $50 or $60.
And sometimes there is no work, at least in the areas where layoffs have hit lawyers the hardest. For corporate lawyers, temporary employment "is not an answer," said a partner who was recently asked to leave the firm and spoke on condition of anonymity, adding: "People being laid off hope it's an answer, or that a temp job will turn into a permanent job. But what really happens is that out there, there are three jobs and 2,300 people who want each job. That's the problem that the corporate or real estate lawyer is facing."
Temporary agencies have also heard from laid-off partners, and, especially in Washington, from lawyers with years of experience in regulatory specialties. Some highly marketable people, like the former Supreme Court clerk who signed up with Janis Goldman's Washington agency, are in no rush to commit themselves.
Jed S. Rakof, now a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Manhattan, who has worked with about a dozen lawyers in temporary jobs over the years, acknowledged that some people do contract work "because they do not fit into a normal working situation."
"You might well decide," he said, "that you wanted to hire someone who was brilliant but flaky to help draft some motion papers and yet not want to take the person on on a long-term basis."
Lawyers who have been laid off yet still want to be lawyers do not have the luxury of being flaky or pleading artistic interests. They must also dispel fears that they will leave if a permanent job materializes.
As Mr. Hamberger in Washington sees it, a law firm should not worry about a temporary lawyer's life plan. "You can't make a mistake," he said, "because you're not promising anything."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Pressure Mounts On Fed to Do More

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE good news is that the Federal Reserve Board has cut the discount rate and the Federal funds rate, and leading commercial banks have followed with cuts in their prime lending rates. The bad news is that the Fed made the rate cuts because the economy is softer than most economists had expected.
John Robson, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, said in an interview yesterday: "I think this was a smart thing for the Fed to do while the economy is so sluggish. There's further room for reductions. The goal is to see growth restarted, and if it takes further rate cuts, we'll be for it." 
 Indeed, consensus is emerging among economists outside the Administration, as well as inside, that Federal Reserve policy needs to be further relaxed. After looking at the latest batch of economic data, George L. Perry of the Brookings Institution said, "There is need to do more."
In part, this stems from the fear that if the recession continues or worsens, the banking crisis would be aggravated and could lead to a systemic breakdown.
For the Administration there are special anxieties -- that the bank-insurance funds would quickly be wiped out, its banking-reform and trade legislation would be derailed, its already yawning budget deficits for 1991 and 1992 greatly widened and its electoral prospects in 1992 gravely threatened. The bailout from these dangers, economic and political, depends primarily on the Fed.
Consumer confidence indexes leaped upward after the victory in the Persian Gulf war, but consumers have not translated that early postwar euphoria into greater spending.
Business, too, has remained cautious. It is still trimming payrolls and holding down inventories and capital spending. Factory orders slipped again in March -- the fifth straight decline. Manufacturers' expectations for production gains dropped slightly in mid-April, according to a new Dun & Bradstreet survey. "Immediately after the Persian Gulf war, manufacturers' optimism rebounded sharply," said Douglas P. Handler, manager of econometric services for D.& B. "But now that the recession has lasted longer than most manufacturers expected, they are taking a wait-and-see attitude."
Contracts for new construction fell in March to the lowest level since December 1983, according to a survey by F. W. Dodge, the construction industry arm of McGraw-Hill Inc. Housing sales have been edging up, but builders' response to lower interest rates has thus far been extremely sluggish.
Worried lest its predictions of a healthy recovery this summer and on into 1992 prove wrong, the Administration has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates. And during last weekend's meetings in Washington of the Group of Seven industrialized countries, the Administration leaned on foreign central banks to relax their monetary policies.
While the American pitch for easier money had no apparent effect on the German Bundesbank or the Bank of Japan, it apparently influenced the Federal Reserve, which won applause from President Bush for cutting rates -- applause that the Fed, cherishing its independence, might prefer to have been spared.
Even so, Administration pressure on the Fed has not ceased. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, after congratulating the Fed, said he still believed there was "ample room for lower interest rates." Many private economists share that view.
The large majority contend the risk of worsening inflation by further easing money and credit is well worth taking in view of the continuing recessionary dangers. As Stephen S. Roach, principal senior economist of Morgan Stanley, put it, "Inflation is expected to remain under good control, with the Consumer Price Index projected to rise only 4.2 percent through 1992."
Secretary Brady and his advisers stress that nearly all of the United States economic growth in 1990 resulted from rising exports, and they are concerned that a slowdown in Europe and Asia will jeopardize the American recovery.
The Germans have shown no sign of yielding to American pleas. Horst Kohler, State Secretary of Germany's Finance Ministry, while praising the Fed's cut in interest rates, said the Bundesbank would not move. "For the time being, there's no possibility to say we can lower rates," he said. The German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, offered the deeper German philosophy with his remark: "Quick fixes to push growth would collapse, as they did in the 1970's."
With the German economy still growing solidly, even officials like Jacques Delors, president of the European Community, who would like to see an easier German monetary policy because it could spur growth and ease strains on their currencies, despair of pressing Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, into relaxing monetary policy. Europeans and Americans alike may simply have to let the Germans and the Deutsche Mark go their own way, and take whatever stimulative measures they can to ward off recession and hasten recovery.

HEADLINE: New Claims by Jobless Again Hit Half a Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hit the half-million mark again in April as the ranks of those seeking help rose for the second straight week, the Government said today.
"This is the recession biting at the personal level," said Peter Radford, chief economist at the National Westminster Bancorp of New York. 
 "It's another half a million people who lost jobs and are filing for unemployment," added Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities. "It's a very high number, and it's very disturbing."
For the week ended April 20, the number of people who filed initial unemployment claims rose by 2,000, pushing the total to 500,000, the Labor Department reported. The gain followed a much steeper increase in initial jobless claims of 47,000 the previous week, the agency said.
While cautioning that the number can be extremely volatile, analysts said today's data showed that the recession did not abate last month.
On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its overall unemployment figures for April. Many analysts have predicted that the rate will probably rise from 6.8 percent to as high as 7 percent. They have estimated that businesses cut 150,000 to 200,000 more jobs.
"The recession did not end in April," said Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. "It is still with us. The decline has slowed, but nonetheless, the economy is still in a decline."
Today's report also showed that the number of people actually receiving unemployment claims posted a huge increase for the week ending April 13, rising by 61,000, to 3.6 million.
Still, that means less than half of the nation's 8.6 million unemployed are receiving benefits.
The weekly ncrease in new claimants reported today was relatively small, but it marked a dramatic increase over levels from last year. For the same week in 1990, there were 373,000 new jobless claims.
In early March, claims remained above the half-million mark for two consecutive weeks -- something that had not happened in more than eight years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Thin Trading; Gold Is Down in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most key currencies in thin trading yesterday, as the markets awaited the latest United States unemployment data.
Gold prices declined, with gold bullion for current delivery settling at $355 a troy ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange, off $1 from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $354.80 an ounce, off 95 cents. 
 Currency dealers attributed the dollar's increase largely to the German Bundesbank's decision not to raise interest rates at its biweekly policy-making meeting. Higher German rates would have strengthened the mark at the dollar's expense.
Kevin Logan, chief economist for Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said trading was quiet as many dealers kept a low profile in advance of the Labor Department's April unemployment report, which is due for release today.
Some economists predicted the data would show that unemployment continued to rise last month, nearing the 7 percent level. That could hurt the dollar because it reflects a weakening economy, thereby increasing the likelihood of further cuts in interest rates.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 2,000 in mid-April, to 500,000. For the corresponding week in 1990, there were 373,000 people filing new jobless claims.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 137.68 Japanese yen, up from 136.64 yen on Wednesday. It stood at 138.05 yen in London, and 138.15 yen in New York, unchanged from Wednesday.
The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.7170 in London, down from from $1.7265. In New York, the pound closed at $1.7193, down from $1.7225.
Against the German mark, the dollar traded at 1.7240 marks in Europe, up from 1.7055 marks, and at 1.7203 in New York, up from 1.7100 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.4585 Swiss francs, up from 1.4480; 5.8255 French francs, up from 5.7885; 1,274 Italian lire, up from 1,266, and 1.14955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15175.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $354.50 an ounce, down from $357 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Panel Backs DNA Tests on Lincoln's Tissue

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
There are no compelling legal or ethical reasons to bar an attempt to clone Abraham Lincoln's genes from tissue samples obtained at the time of the President's assassination, a panel of experts concluded today.
The committee, assembled by the Government museum that holds samples of Lincoln's tissue, said it considered issues of privacy, probable consent, ethics and law, and gave the proposal a "qualified green light." 
 The nine-member panel, headed by Dr. Victor A. McKusick, professor of medical genetics at Johns Hopkins University, concluded that there was merit in the proposal to see if Lincoln suffered from a potentially fatal genetic disease called Marfan's syndrome, which is characterized in part by a tall, gangling appearance.
In February, the National Museum of Health and Medicine, an affiliate of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, asked the committee to advise it on whether to examine the samples of Lincoln's hair, bone chips and blood stains in its collection to see if any DNA remains 126 years after the Lincoln's death. Such tests would require the destruction of a small amount of the samples.
 
Building Block of Heredity
 "The panel's conclusion is that exploration of the technical aspects of the Lincoln DNA Marfan study be encouraged to proceed," Dr. McKusick said at a news conference. DNA is the basic building block of heredity that makes up 80,000 to 100,000 genes, which contain the biological essence of a person.
Dr. McKusick and other panel members said there was no urgency in beginning laboratory work on the tissue samples because a definitive genetic test for Marfan's has not yet been developed. In addition, they said, the panel wanted to consider the latest test methods and look for ways that might produce the highest yield of genetic material from the smallest amount of sample. Panel members said it would be at least a year before any DNA cloning could be tried.
After the news conference, Jeremy Rifkin, a frequent critic of genetic research who heads a Washington-based organization called the Foundation on Economic Trends, said he would oppose the project to clone Lincoln's DNA and would ask Congress to investigate the social, ethical and commerical implications of working with the genetic materials of dead people.
"The scientists involved in this study are using the corpse of a revered President of the United States for a public relations stunt to draw attention and research funds for a particular disease," Mr. Rifkin said.
 
'Very, Very Good Chance'
 Dr. McKusick said several research groups are working on isolating the gene and defect that causes Marfan's, and that a test should be available before the end of the year.
Dr. Victor Weedn, a panel member who is chief of the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, said there was a "very, very good chance" that the Lincoln tissue samples contain DNA, although no one could know how intact it is. "DNA tests have been performed successfully on many old skeletal remains," Dr. Weedn said, adding that it very likely that scientists could get useful DNA from the Lincoln samples, particularly the blood and bone specimen.
Genetic tests could reveal if Lincoln was afflicted with the inherited connective-tissue disease, as some experts suspect. The disease could have taken his life prematurely even if John Wilkes Booth had not fired his fatal shot. Lincoln was 56 years old when he died.
Marfan's syndrome, which the National Marfan Foundation estimates afficts 40,000 Americans and one in 10,000 people worldwide, can result in abnormalities and weakness in bones and joints, eyes, the heart and blood vessels. Sufferers often grow to be tall and gangly with unusually long limbs and fingers. They are at increased risk of death from exertion that causes the aorta, the main artery from the heart, to burst.
Cheryl Williams, president of the Marfan foundation and a member of the Lincoln panel, said that if Lincoln is shown to have had the disease, it would be inspirational to Marfan patients and show everyone that a person with a genetic disease can achieve great things. "It will foster research and increase public awareness of Marfan's syndrome," she said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges Changes by Bankers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 2

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said yesterday that the banking system of the 1990's was likely to be smaller but stronger.
As banks recover from a record level of troubled loans, Mr. Greenspan said bankers must change their practices as Congress and regulators move to limit the scope of deposit insurance and consider granting banks powers to enter new businesses. 
 One of the most important changes, he said, is that banks must increase their capital -- the difference between assets and liabilities -- and to make make fewer high-risk loans.
But, although he stressed the need for more capital, Mr. Greenspan said now was not the time for regulators to raise minimum capital standards, as banks cope with recession. Previously, Mr. Greenspan had warned bankers that they should expect continued pressure by regulators to increase their capital.
In a talk at a banking conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Mr. Greenspan argued that a stronger banking system would be in the best interest of bankers and their shareholders, and was not just a demand by regulators trying to protect the deposit insurance fund from further losses.
Mr. Greenspan said the current shortage of credit indicated that banks were becoming more cautious lenders, and were trying to improve their financial strength by reducing their size.
Banks that increased their capital, recent Fed studies show, tend to earn a higher return for shareholders than when they are more weakly capitalized. This finding is contrary to the widespread belief among bankers that the highest returns come by expanding a bank's lending while keeping capital low. In that way, profits of the bigger bank are divided among a smaller group of investors who own the bank's capital.
But as bank problems have become more visibile, the financial markets have looked more critically on the banking industry. The presence of higher capital "appears to be convincing uninsured creditors to lend to these safer institutions at significantly lower rates," Mr. Greenspan said. The benefit of lower interest rates paid for uninsured deposits and other funds is enough, Mr. Greenspan said, to increase bank profits.
The benefit of lower borrowing costs for well-capitalized banks are enough to substantially reduce the cost to banks of major reforms like higher capital standards or deposit insurance premiums adjusted for the riskiness of a bank's business, the chairman said.
A bank should prepare for a future with fewer lending opportunities, Mr. Greenspan said. Besides avoiding risky borrowers -- many of whom were welcomed at banks in the 1980's -- he said banks should expect large corporations to continue to raise funds without using banks.
 
Cost Control Cited
 As a result, "the banking industry of the future is likely to be smaller in relative terms than the banking industry of the present," Mr. Greenspan predicted. While mergers will result in larger banks, he said, the newly created banks are likely to be smaller than the sum of the individual merger partners.
Bankers' traditional reliance on growth to increase profits must be replaced, Mr. Greenspan said, by stricter controls over costs, the skillful use of technology and business loans with interest rates that are high enough to compensate the bank for occasional losses and still produce enough profit to satisfy shareholders.
Banks have learned in the 1980's "that they can make significant monies without taking heavy risks," Mr. Greenspan said, and are not making new loans that will likely sour. While there are no signs yet of an increase in bank lending, he said, the groundwork for a revival is being prepared as what bankers call nonperforming loans are increasing at a rate "somewhat under the average banker's expectation."
 
Forecast of Lending Increase
 When the growth in nonperforming loans, which are loans that are badly delinquent or in serious trouble, slows further, he said bank lending would increase and banks would become more willing to reduce the interest rates they charge on loans.
John Rau, visiting scholar at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, and former chairman of the La Salle National Bank here, said that the benefits of stronger capital were clearest "at the 40 or so large banks which rely most heavily on uninsured deposits." For other banks, he said market discipline might not be enough and regulators might have to dictate capital levels.
Robert E. Litan, a banking specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that banks with capital of 6 percent or less of assets earned lower returns for their shareholders than banks whose capital equaled 6 to 8 percent of assets. "But there can be such a thing as too much capital," he said, since banks with capital greater than 8 percent of assets earned a lower return on equity than those in the 6 to 8 percent group.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates on Treasury Issues Ease

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Rates on long-term Treasury securities continued to ease yesterday, prompting a flood of corporate debt offerings. Most corporate bond and other debt issues are priced relative to comparable Treasury maturities.
Thus when yields on Treasury debt issues decline, many corporate borrowers seize the opportunity to sell bonds and other debt issues. Dealers estimate that roughly $1.5 billion of corporate debt came to market on Wednesday and perhaps as much yesterday. 
 The Treasury's current benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, were offered late in the session at 97 9/32, up 16/32, equivalent to $5 per $1,000 of face value. This caused their yield to drop to 8.11 percent, from 8.16 percent the day before.
 
$11.75 Billion Auction
 Next Thursday, the Treasury plans to auction $11.75 billion of new 30-year bonds as part of its quarterly refunding, and the bonds traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.10 percent.
The Treasury's long notes, the 7 3/4's of February 2001, gained 12/32, to 98 24/32, while its yield fell to 7.93 percent, from 7.99 percent the day before. Next Wednesday, the Treasury will auction $11.75 billion of new 10-year notes, and they traded to yield 7.92 percent on the same basis. In similar trading, the $13.5 billion of new three-year notes up for sale on Tuesday yielded 7.05 percent.
"The day's most important market news was the rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance, but the increase of 2,000 in the week ended April 26, to 500,000, was widely expected," said Peter D. Mayers, Treasury securities trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich, which manages investments for many big European pension funds and other institutions.
What may have surprised some market participants, Mr. Mayers said, "was the absence of any reaction to the larger-than-expected amount of Treasury paper to be offered at next week's refunding. One explanation may be that declining yields are forcing investment managers to try to squeeze as much as they can. For some, this means selling the shorter debt issues and buying longer maturities."
But many investors also sought to lock in short-term rates. As a result, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills plunged eight basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.46 percent; six-month bills fell two basis points, to 5.56 percent.
 
Fed Action Watched
 The Treasury auctioned $11.8 billion of new one-year bills at an average discount rate of 5.71 percent, down from 5.88 percent a month ago, and the lowest rate since March 1987, when it was 5.68 percent.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, was expected to add some reserves to the banking system because of the heavy Treasury withdrawals for Social Security and other payments. But the Fed did not do so. Mr. Mayers of Bank Juluis Baer said, "Many of us had expected the Fed to add some reserves indirectly through weekend repurchase agreements with its customers."
Few expected the Fed system itself to add reserves, he said, because it would have involved a much larger amount of money and thus could have sent a signal that it wanted the funds rate below its current presumed target of 5.75 percent. As it was, the key funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans and from which most other interest rates are scaled upward, traded at 5.75 percent for most of the day and closed at that level.
Following are the details of the Treasury's monthly auction of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor Seeks Sharp Cutbacks in the Budget

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 2

 BODY:
Gov. William F. Weld announced a Draconian package of budget cuts today that would sharply curtail the General Relief program for the hard-core unemployed, force state employees to accept salary cuts and reduce scholarships for students at state colleges.
The cuts, which would save $802 million, are part of an effort by Governor Weld to cover the $2 billion deficit he has forecast in the state's $13.7 billion budget for the next fiscal year, beginning July 1. The state has been in a fiscal crisis since Massachusetts's economy began to plummet into recession in 1988, causing widespread layoffs, political paralysis over the budget in the Statehouse and growing public disenchantment with state government. 
 To justify his action today Mr. Weld said, "The overriding imperative is to bring the budget into balance." He noted that Massachusetts already has the lowest bond rating of any state and that Wall Street has threatened to downgrade its securities to junk bond status, making it much more expensive for the state to borrow to cover the budget deficit.
The proposals, part of the Governor's continuing campaign to cut back state government, will not go into effect unless they are cleared by the Legislature, which normally seeks to have a budget approved by the start of the new fiscal year. Both houses of the Legislature are controlled by Democrats, but because their leadership has been in disarray, it is hard to predict the outcome of the budget talks.
"The notion of fiscal stability is not some metaphysical idea," he said at a news conference in the Statehouse. "It's got to be done, or the economy will grind to a halt."
Mr. Weld, the state's first Republican Governor in two decades, said his predecessor, Michael S. Dukakis, had tried to reduce the deficit with cuts of 4, 5 and 6 percent. "We can't continue to nibble away at state problems," he said. "The only way to achieves cuts of this magnitude is to eliminate programs." Mr. Weld has consistently ruled out any tax increases.
The proposed cuts drew an immediate outcry from advocates for the poor. "General Relief is not a program for free-loaders, it is for the extremely poor," said Neil Cronin, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, a legal services group. "You have to be incapacitated in order to qualify."
There are 40,000 people on General Relief in Massachusetts, receiving $338-a-month payments. All are unemployed and have assets of less than $250. Many have never been employed and more than half are mentally or physically disabled.
 
Dire Impact on Poor Is Seen
 "General Relief is the bottom of the barrel," Mr. Cronin said. "And once you are not eligible for General Relief, you are homeless, hungry and without health care."
Sue Marsh, the executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, said: "I think Governor Weld is shooting himself in the foot. If even 10 percent of those families become homeless, he will have wiped out his savings. He will have to pay more far more money to shelter them than he would have if he had provided them with the benefits that would have prevented their homelessness."
Under his proposed cuts, Mr. Weld would eliminate the entire $213 million annual General Relief program, though he would partly replace it with a $98 million plan to provide "emergency aid for the elderly and disabled," which would serve less than half the current recipients.
Mr. Weld has argued that many of the people on General Relief, a program that many other states have, are not truly deserving and would be able to find jobs.
The new emergency replacement program will include strict eligibility requirements and will have a medical board to check people's condition to cut down on fraud and abuse, he said.
In last year's gubernatorial campaign, Mr. Weld repeatedly pledged not to make any cuts that would undermine a "safety net" for the poor. Asked today about that pledge, Mr. Weld said, "The elderly and disabled, who are the most needy, will be protected."
But he acknowledged that another of his cuts, which would chop $20 million from a program established by Mr. Dukakis to train welfare recipients for jobs, "will be a tough hit."
The cuts announced today are in addition to other reductions in state spending Mr. Weld made public in February when he introduced his budget for the fiscal year 1992. One of the major cuts at that time was a plan to change the state's Medicaid program into a managed health care system that would give the government greater control over which doctors and hospitals a patient uses.
The new cuts today have been made necessary because state revenues have continued to fall along with the slumping state economy, Mr. Weld said. Unemployment in Massachusetts, the lowest of any of the major industrialized states in the 1980's, has risen to 9.7 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S., Japan Reach Pact On Exports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Export financing agencies of the United States and Japan announced the first cooperative arrangements today between the two Governments, a plan in which Japanese money will be used to help finance American exports to Japan and to third world countries.
The initial objective is to support American exports to the tune of $1 billion. But Japanese and American officials said at a news conference here that they expected more money to be allocated by Tokyo if the program proved successful. 
 "This is a major step by the Japanese Government to improve the trade balance between the two countries," said Eugene K. Lawson, vice president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
Yoshio Ichiryu, the senior executive director of the export-import insurance division of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said the arrangements "demonstrate how we can deliver something good to international society," adding, "We need a partner to dance to the tango."
 
Swords Have Been Crossed
 The United States, which is running a trade deficit of nearly $50 billion with Japan, has been counting on export growth to pull the economy out of a recession.
"Anything that promises export growth is desirable," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a policy research organization in Washington.
The agreement comes at a time when Tokyo and Washington have crossed swords on a number of trade issues. Last week the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, announced plans to impose trade sanctions against Japan's construction industry because of the limited access that American companies have to Japan's huge construction market.
Japan's trade ministry is making the $1 billion available for insurance to cover exporters' risks in shipments to Japan or third world countries. Once a contract is insured by the ministry, companies can borrow against it and use funds to build up their inventories, produce more goods or for a wide variety of other purposes. "This is very nice money to have up front," Mr. Lawson said.
But Mr. Ichiryu stressed that it was up to American companies to get the contracts. "We cannot insure nonexistent contracts," he said.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States and similar agencies in Japan facilitate trade by providing credits, insurance and loan guarantees to buyers of exports. It is unusual for the credit agency of a foreign government to finance American exports.
 
Backlash Risk Cited
 The Japanese may also be financing exports of Japanese subsidiaries in the United States, which have a growing presence here. Japanese investment in the United States reached $78.5 billion last year.
Asked whether the Japanese would be using the program to provide special assistance for their American subsidiaries, Seiji Hagiwara, an associate of Mr. Ichiryu, said that under the rules established by the ministry, "there can be no discrimination."
Bradley R. Larschan, general counsel of the Association for International Investment, said that because of the political tensions with Japan, the program could run the risk of "creating political backlash here if it discriminates in favor of companies owned by Japan."
Under the arrangements announced today, plans were sealed for extensive cooperation between the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Japanese export finance agencies, which besides the Ministry of International Trade and Industry division, include the Export-Import Bank of Japan and the Japan Development Bank.
The Washington agency is to engage in so-called co-financing arrangements with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Japanese Export-Import Bank. This means that for certain large-scale contracts that may include consortiums of Japanese and American companies, the two Governments will team up to provide financing.
Under another arrangement, the Japan Development Bank will provide long-term financing to American and Japanese companies and their joint ventures, both for increasing imports from the United States and for investments in additional Japanese production operations that may import goods and services from the United States.

Home Fed Posts Loss For Period

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 2

 BODY:
The HomeFed Corporation, the parent company of one of California's largest savings institutions, said today that it lost $173.9 million in the first quarter, leaving it short of the Government's standards for financial strength.
HomeFed, the San Diego-based banking company, said the loss resulted primarily from continued weakness in real estate in California and the East. In the period last year it earned $34.5 million, or $1.48 a share. 
The loss continues an abrupt slide at HomeFed, which until last year seemed to have escaped most of the financial woes that plagued the savings and loan industry in the late 1980's. It also suggested that battered real estate markets in many regions, including California and Florida, had not yet hit bottom.
 
Added Reserves for Bad Loans
 The company added $200 million to its reserves for possible losses on loans and on real estate it owns. The size of the additional loss reserves was far higher than expected, and appeared to reflect the results of an intensive examination of HomeFed's books recently completed by Federal regulators.
The weak results left HomeFed, which has assets of $18 billion, short of capital by one of the three standards imposed by Federal regulators. The company said its risk-based capital ratio stood at 6.09 percent on March 31, or $154.6 million below the required level of 7.2 percent. Capital is the financial buffer an institution maintains to guard against losses and this measure considers the amount of risk in a financial institution's loan portfolio.
 
Federal Requirements

 The company said it barely met a second capital requirement, for what is known as core capital, and expected to fall short of the requirement soon. The company continues to meet the third and most basic measure, known as tangible capital.
HomeFed said it expected the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal regulatory agency, to require the company to rebuild its capital to levels higher than the minimums set by the Government two years ago. The company said the regulators had not indicated what the new capital levels might be.
Robert F. Adelizzi, HomeFed's chief executive, said he expected regulators to impose additional operating restrictions on the institution soon, although he could not say what they might be. HomeFed has already been barred from increasing its asset size or attracting new deposits by offering high interest rates through brokerage houses.
HomeFed's stock rose 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange to $3.625, but the quarter's results were announced after the close of trading.
Mr. Adelizzi said the increase in loan-loss provisions and the resulting loss for the quarter were "certainly higher than I would have expected." And he said the real estate outlook remained clouded.
"Some markets are stabilizing and improving, and some we're not sure have hit bottom yet," he said.
HomeFed and its primary operating subsidiary, HomeFed Bank, shifted focus over the last decade away from home mortgages and into the far riskier business of making loans to developers of homes, apartments, office buildings and shopping centers. HomeFed also plunged into the development business itself, building single-family homes, for example, in California.
The strategy seemed to be paying off until last year, when the company began posting large losses. The company's problems are spread throughout its portfolio of residential and commercial real estate loans, with particular difficulties in California, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C.
Analysts have said for several months that HomeFed has no better than an even chance of avoiding being seized and sold by Federal regulators. Mr. Adelizzi acknowledged in a telephone interview that the job of turning the company around would be made that much harder by the unexpectedly large size of the loss, but he said he remained optimistic that the company could survive.
"This company still has a lot of strengths," he said.
But the loss leaves HomeFed in a serious bind. It will be almost impossible for the company to raise new capital while it is losing money. The only realistic way it can bring itself into compliance with Government standards is to shrink by selling assets, increasing the ratio of its capital to its assets.
Unless the real estate markets turn around, however, the only assets the company will be able to sell at a profit are those it most needs to keep, like loans that are being repaid on time and mortgage-backed securities that have appreciated in value.
As of March 31, the company's nonperforming assets -- primarily loans 90 days or more delinquent and real estate it has foreclosed on -- amounted to $1.47 billion, or 8.2 percent of its total assets.

HEADLINE: Czechoslovakia Clings to Arms Sales

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, May 2

 BODY:
Soon after becoming President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel expressed his revulsion at the country's large arms exports. But a year and a half after the Communists were forced from power, his Government is having a hard time weaning its feeble economy from such trde.
Faced with growing unemployment and political instability in Slovakia, Prague has authorized the export of tanks to Syria. Slovakia, the eastern third of the country, is where most of the munitions industry is concentrated. 
Much as the peace oriented officials in Prague would like to phase out the production of heavy weapons, they are aware that after four decades of Communist rule, Soviet-designed T72 tanks remain one of the few profitable exports this country produces.
Officials are giving few details of foreign sales of the tanks, but this week a Czech investigative weekly, Respekt, reported that 300 T72 tanks will be sold to Syria.
 
Negotiations With Iran
 The newspaper also said that negotiations were under way on a potentially bigger tank sale to Iran. Officials here say the Government is more reluctant to authorize that deal out of concern that there is a greater chance that tanks sold to Iran could be involved in conflict.
Asked about the reported deals on Monday, President Havel told reporters that the profits from tank sales would be used to help the country's arms industry convert to civilian production. "If it were without political risks, we could export them and invest the earnings in conversion," he said.
On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier visited Czechoslovakia's two biggest arms factories, both in Slovakia, and told worried plant directors who have run out of orders and have been laying off workers that the exports to Syria would be allowed to go ahead. He also promised $50 million in Government help to convert to civilian production.
On hearing of the negotiations over the exports at the beginning of April, the Bush Administration raised objections. In a telephone call to President Bush, Czechoslovak officials say, Mr. Havel asked him to try to understand the importance to Czechoslovakia of selling the tanks, some of which have already been built. Mr. Havel also pleaded with Mr. Bush for help in the conversion to civilian production. The phone call took place just before Foreign Minister Dienstbier left on a trip to Washington. Mr. Dienstbier brought back a promise that the Administration would try to interest American companies in helping Czechoslovakia develop and market new products.
 
Slovak Tensions on the Rise
 Political tensions in Slovakia have risen since the decision of the regional Parliament last week to dismiss the Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, who opposed the rapid transformation to a market economy favored by Prague. Critics accused him of exploiting local fears of unemployment.
Although only about 4 percent of the Slovak work force is out of work, that is double the rate in the large Czech part of the country. This is largely a result of the concentration of now uncompetitive heavy industry in Slovakia.
Czechoslovakia's formerly large military exports have plummeted to only one-eighth of their value just four years ago. Officials say exports to third world countries will total about $1 billion this year, down from $8 billion in 1986. Arms sales to the Warsaw Pact countries, which were even larger -- the figures are not being made public -- have dropped by the same proportion.

HEADLINE: BANGLADESH REPORTS TOLL FROM STORM IS NEAR 40,000; SAYS IT MAY EXCEED 100,000

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh, May 2

 BODY:
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia said today that at least 100,000 people may have died in the devastating cyclone that pounded this low-lying country's densely populated coastal areas on Tuesday, leaving hunger, disease and homelessness in its wake.
With bodies washing ashore in the thousands and the Government pleading for international aid for millions of destitute survivors, the official death toll, based on reports from the hardest-hit regions, crept toward 40,000. But many of the victims were swept into the Bay of Bengal, and their bodies will probably never be recovered. 
 "It is a vast devastation, and the loss of human lives could exceed 100,000," Mrs. Zia said. "The information is incomplete. We fear it could go up much more. I pray to Allah it's not true."
 
Bodies Wash Ashore
 Relief workers and journalists who visited the stricken area in the southeast, dominated by ragged islands and river deltas, said the tides were bringing in thousands of bodies. Survivors searched for relatives among the corpses piled on beaches.
"I saw deaths, devastation, agony and misery of a magnitude I have never seen before," a photographer who went to the area told The Associated Press. The impoverished Government struggled to ferry food, water and medicine to the survivors, but vast areas hit by the cyclone were inaccessible. Helicopters dropped essentials to people huddled on the rooftops of marooned buildings.
[Already burdened by efforts to help Kurdish refugees and famine- stricken Africans, the United States and private relief agencies are beginning to assess how to provide aid to Bangladesh. Page A8.]
Lutfar Rahman Khan, Minister of State for Relief and Rehabilitation, said this evening of the death count: "I would not be surprised if the total exceeds 100,000." The death toll was the highest since 1970, the year before Bangladesh proclaimed its independence, when 500,000 people were killed by a cyclone that hit the same area.
The Government has appealed for international help to buy food, clothing, shelter and at least 20 large helicopters to deliver the relief supplies, the Minister said. About 10 million people out of a population of 115 million have been uprooted by the storm, which roared across the region with winds of 145 miles an hour.
The most devastated stretch of shoreline was around the seaside town of Cox's Bazar and on nearby islands, where 95 percent of the houses were destroyed. All along the southeast coast, brackish water has ruined drinking supplies. Roads have been severely damaged and telephone communications are cut off.
 
Rice Crops Destroyed
 A tempestuous sea has destroyed thousands of acres of rice crops that were almost ready for harvest. Experts said that land flooded with salt water might be unworkable for two or three years, a severe blow to the predominantly agricultural economy.
Shrimp farms, salt pans and fishing fleets, all vital sources of employment, have been blown apart. Damage to fledgling industries, including an oil refinery, has not been assessed.
In the port of Chittagong, eight ships, at least one belonging to the small Bangladesh Navy, have sunk, blocking the only harbor that the country can use for berthing large vessels bringing in relief supplies. Mr. Rahman Khan said Bangladesh "desperately" needed foreign expertise in clearing the port.
He said hospitals and schools were destroyed, leaving no place to shelter and treat the homeless. More than 100,000 people have no cover at all, not even tents or lean-tos. Health hazards are considered potentially disastrous in this intensely hot, humid climate.
 
6 Functioning Helicopters
 Three C-130 cargo planes were expected to arrive in the capital with relief supplies from Saudi Arabia, a large donor of aid to predominantly Muslim Bangladesh. But this country has only six functioning helicopters, most of them too small to ferry much equipment to the neediest areas.
Two light fixed-wing planes have dropped some dry food and clothing -- 40,000 saris for women and 20,000 sarongs for men -- in plastic bags from low altitudes. No planes can land on the estuary islands, which are still knee- to chest-deep in water, officials say.
Relief workers will try on Friday to use small boats to deliver food and water to offshore islands.
Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis have been living on relatively new silt islands in the estuaries of rivers in defiance of the law. They have fled there over the years in desperation, for land is in short supply in this extremely poor and densely populated country.
Many Bangladeshis on the islands were tending the cattle or crops of landlords who live safely on the mainland. Although they were advised to leave 48 hours before the cyclone struck, many could not think of a place to go -- or chose not to abandon the herds or their own subsistence crops, local journalists say.
Officials listed coastal areas or islands where the devastation has exceeded that of any recent disaster: Moiscali, Chakori, Sandwip, Kutubdia, Hatiya, Manpura, Charfashion, Bhola, Banshkhali, Patharghata, Sitakundu, Cox's Bazar, Patenga and Urirchor.
On Moiscali Island, the local authorities said today, at least 11,000 people died. At Chakori, near Cox's Bazar, the official death toll was 10,000. On Sandwip Island, at least 5,022 people perished.
 
The Leap in the Death Toll
 When the typhoon struck, there was immediate alarm that the death toll could soar into the tens of thousands. The Government initially put the official death toll at 1,000, and then at 3,000, as reports from stricken regions filtered in.
After new reports from remote areas and ravaged provinces, the official toll leaped early today to 35,000. The Government put the number at 37,543 late in the day, but did not say how it had arrived at such a precise figure.
The cyclone is the first crisis for Mrs. Zia's Government, which came to power just weeks ago. Prime Minister Zia, the widow of an assassinated President, Ziaur Rahman, led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to victory in an election at the end of February.
Bangladesh's previous leader, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, abruptly resigned last December under pressure from democracy campaigners. Their unexpected success gave the country a huge psychological boost. President Ershad is under arrest on charges of corruption.

HEADLINE: Wage Accord Ends 12-Day Strike by New York Apartment Workers

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The 12-day strike by building service workers that had disrupted life for several hundred thousand New Yorkers ended last night after union leaders and representatives of apartment building owners announced a tentative settlement.
Some of the striking doormen, porters, elevator operators and handymen began returning to work even before the tentative agreement was announced at 7 P.M. in a statement from the owners' bargaining unit, the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations. 
 Tony Roman, a doorman at 165 West 66th Street, was back in uniform by 6 P.M., after learning about the settlement from union officials.
"Strike's over?" Constance Mensch, a resident, asked as she entered the building about an hour later. Mr. Roman nodded. "Hallelujah!" Ms. Mensch said.
The rest of the workers in the 2,800 affected buildings are to return to work today, said James F. Berg, the executive vice president of the owners' group.
The tentative settlement -- a three-year contract with annual increases averaging about 4 percent -- essentially split the difference on wages, the chief issue in the strike.
The accord was reached at about 4:30 A.M. yesterday after protracted bargaining on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to a management representative. The negotiating committee for the union, Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, and the full board of the owners' group ratified the proposed contract yesterday afternoon and evening.
Individual building owners do not have to vote on the tentative agreement. It could not be learned whether the union membership must ratify the pact. Gus Bevona, the president of the union who did not speak publicly during the strike, did not return a telephone call last night seeking comment.
The union communicated quickly with its 30,000 members, and many had shifted enthusiastically from picketing to working by early evening. Richard Koch was back as the doorman at 465 West End Avenue, at 82nd Street, working his regular 4 P.M.-to-midnight shift.
"Everybody's happy, even the tenants, even if they have to pay a couple of dollars more," Mr. Koch said. "They like the full service, and why not? They pay for that."
Under the agreement, doormen, elevator operators and porters would get a raise of $16 a week, or 3.46 percent, in the first year. They would get another raise of $19 a week, or 3.97 percent, in the second year, and $21 a week, or 4.22 percent, in the third year. They received $462.73 a week under the contract that expired on April 21, when the strike began.
 
Part of Cost Is Offset
 Before the strike, the union had proposed a wage increase of 5 percent a year, and the owners' representatives had offered an increase of 2 percent a year. The cost of the first year's raise will be offset for the owners because they did not have to pay their employees during the 12 days of the strike.
The Realty Advisory Board said the union members' health and pension benefits would remain basically the same, with the building owners agreeing to contribute more to maintain the current benefit levels.
But the union, in a statement released last night, emphasized several small increases in benefits, from a $50-a-month rise in the maximum pension to additional college scholarships.
"It was unfortunate that a strike had to be called," Mr. Bevona said in the statement, "but under the circumstances it was necessary."
Mr. Bevona also said he was delighted that the workers would receive a "badly needed and much deserved" raise.
Irwin Gumley, the chairman of the realty board's negotiating committee, described the agreement as "a fair settlement after difficult negotiations."
 
Some Complaints
 "We're delighted that the employees who have suffered during the strike are back at work, and we know that the residents will be pleased by the return to normalcy," Mr. Gumley said in a statement.
Some union members complained yesterday before the settlement had been ratified that they had already paid a great economic price for their new raises, whatever they turned out to be. After 12 days on the picket lines, the strikers had lost nearly $1,000 in pay. The raise of $16 a week will give them $832 more in their paychecks over the next year. But the increase will also be built into all future raises.
Management had sought a number of concessions that the union found unacceptable. Among them was a proposal to create a lower wage scale for new workers and the right to switch some full-time positions to part time.
From the beginning, the two sides fought a mild war of attrition. The union ordered its members in about 1,400 Manhattan apartment buildings to go on strike first, although it left the impression in news releases that union members employed in apartment buildings in Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn had also gone on strike. The workers in those boroughs walked off their jobs on Tuesday, the 10th day of the strike.
Building service workers in the Bronx are represented by a different union local.
The union tried to divide the building owners' group by inducing individual apartment buildings to sign separate labor agreements. These called for a 5 percent wage increase and promised that, if the eventual citywide settlement was less favorable to the union, the citywide terms would prevail in buildings that settled early.Most building owners remained allied with the Realty Advisory Board.
Some owners no doubt benefited from the strike financially because they did not have to pay their employees for its duration. But they were under pressure from residents, many of whom were inconvenienced considerably by the strike.

HEADLINE: Alaska House Rejects Settlement for Exxon Spill

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The Alaska House of Representative tonight rejected the $1 billion civil settlement of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, a move that puts the agreement closer to collapse.
By a vote of 27 to 13, the House decided to scuttle the agreement, saying it neither penalized the Exxon Corporation sufficiently nor provided enough money to help Prince William Sound recover from the nation's largest oil spill. 
 The House's decision comes little more than a week after a Federal District Judge in Alaska rejected the agreement the Government and Exxon had negotiated to settle the criminal portion of the overall $1.1 billion pact. Judge H. Russel Holland said the $100 million fine proposed by the Government was too small.
But the agreement, which stems from the grounding of the Exxon Valdez on March 24, 1989, is still alive, at least until Friday when the state Senate is scheduled to decide on it and Governor Walter J. Hickel will sign it or reject it.
 
Pledge to Legislature

On March 13, a day after the $1 billion agreement was signed in Washington, Governor Hickel pledged to the Legislature that he would abide by its decision to approve or disapprove the pact. Sentiment in favor of approving the agreement is running much stronger in the state Senate, which is expected to ratify it tommorrow.
Mr. Hickel apparently feels that a split decision in the Legislature gives him the political room to make his own decision.
"The bottom line is the Governor gave the Legislature the opportunity to approve or disapprove," said Eric Rehman, the Governor's spokesman. "He would like the Legislature to act responsibly and give us a clear signal one way or the other. If they do not do so, there is a possibility this decision is open to the Governor's interpretation. If the Legislature ends up split, the Governor may decide to go forward with it."
The civil agreement between Exxon, Alaska and the Federal Government called on the nation's largest oil company to pay up to $1 billion over the next 14 years for scientific studies, environmental restoration work and other activities related to the recovery of Prince William Sound.
 
Initial Satisfaction
 Signed at the Department of Commerce here before midnight on March 12, the pact was applauded by the Bush Administration, environmental groups and many Alaskans as a pathbreaking effort to hold polluters responsible for environmental destruction.
But in the last few weeks, support for the agreement began to erode as its provisions came under more scrutiny. A Congressional study estimated that after inflation, the real value of the settlement was less than $400 million and Exxon could write every penny off on its state and Federal taxes. In no year was Exxon required to pay more than $150 million, the equivalent to a company taking in over $100 billion annually of a $30 traffic ticket to a family earning $30,000.
Many of Alaska's political leaders began to criticize the agreement as a good deal for Exxon and a bad deal for the state.
Mr. Hickel insists that the agreement provides Alaska with enough money to pay for the restoration of Prince William Sound, and years of litigation would be unlikely to gain more money from Exxon.
 
Ready for a New Pact

In rejecting the civil agreement, the House said it was seeking changes and was prepared to approve any agreement that included its members, said a spokesman for Representative Max Gruenberg, the House majority leader.
The House said it wanted Exxon to pay much more immediately; $100 million within 90 days after a new agreement is signed and $600 million more a year after that. The House also wants to increase Exxon's criminal fine to at least $500 million, of which Alaska would be paid $100 million.
Exxon should be prohibited from deducting the cost of the settlement from its state taxes, the House said. And lawmakers asked that a wealth of scientific and economic data about the spill be made public. That information, which was paid for by Alaskans, is currently secret.
Joe Tucker, an Exxon spokesman in Anchorage, said the company would have no immediate comment on the House vote. Exxon's sales totaled more than $107 billion last year and it reported earnings of more than $5.1 billion.

HEADLINE: COLLEGES;
Educators Examine Standards for Athletes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
College administrators, who have been challenged to bring athletes into the mainstream of campus life, are also being faced with this thorny question: Should athletes recruited by big-time sports programs receive special treatment in admissions?
A survey published this week in The Chronicle of Higher Education shows the extent of special admissions. According to the survey, athletes admitted at Division I-A universities for the 1989-90 school year were four times as likely to receive special consideration in admissions. Football and basketball players were six times as likely as regular students to receive special treatment. 
 Over all, the survey, to which 96 of the 106 Division I-A schools responded, found that 17.5 percent of all athletes and 27.2 percent of football and basketball players were characterized as "special admits" by the universities.
A special admit is generally defined as someone who falls outside the normal profile of students admitted to the university but who is admitted because of some talent in a specific area like sports, art or music.
While the notion that athletes receive special consideration is not new, some educators said they felt the figures proved the system was not overly biased toward athletes.
 
Surprising Figures
 "Frankly, I think a number of people are surprised that the percentage of special admissions for athletes is not higher," said R. Gerald Turner, chancellor of the University of Mississippi and chairman of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's President's Commission.
"What you see is that most student athletes are being admitted on a basis other than special admissions," he said. "That flies in the face of the jock stereotype."
Among other things The Chronicle reported was that while many schools said they did not have a special policy for athletes, many of their football and basketball players had lower academic profiles than the general student body.
For example, the survey points out that the University of Michigan does not have special policies for athletes. But football and men's basketball players entered college in 1989 with an average Scholastic Aptitude Test score of 957, 200 points below the average for all Michigan freshmen that year.
"My own sense is that whether it's a Michigan or a U.S.C. or Notre Dame or Harvard or Yale, if you were to look at the average quantitative statistics characterizing intercollegiate athletes -- S.A.T., A.C.T., class ranks -- you would find those probably on the average somewhat lower than the mean characterizing the institution," said James Duderstadt, the Michigan president. The A.C.T. is the American College Test.
"From my own experience at Yale, I know that characterizes the Ivys just as it does the Big Ten, just as it does most conferences," said Duderstadt, who played football at Yale.
Duderstadt said that 90 percent of Michigan's athletes were "indistinguishable from the normal students we admit."
"Probably 10 percent are at the lower end, and those are sometimes associated with the big-time sports," he said. "But in no case do we admit students who we do not believe have a capacity to graduate."
 
Moving Into Mainstream
 The question of admissions standards sharpens the debate among educators over bringing athletes into the mainstream of college life by eliminating, among other things, athletic dormitories and training tables. Some critics would add to that list eliminating special admission standards for athletes.
Others who argue for equal access to education contend that if special considerations are removed in one area they should be removed entirely.
"Universities have been making special considerations in a number of categories for years," said Reginald Wilson, senior scholar at the American Council on Education. "Athletics is just another category. If they're going to make a special case for eliminating special admissions for athletes, and leave all the others in place, it seems to me that's discriminatory."
 
Disparity for Minority Students
 Another issue raised by special admissions for athletes is the disparity that frequently exists between the energy and resources expended to bring in black athletes and black students who are not athletes.
William Davis, the chancellor at Louisiana State University, said that the university would bring 150 students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds on campus this summer and provide them with four months of intensive course work and academic counseling. The students will enroll at L.S.U. in the fall. Davis said the program, which will cost L.S.U. between $60,000 and $100,000 and is being financed by the athletic department, is an attempt to correct an imbalance.
According to The Chronicle's survey of 24 basketball and football players enrolled at L.S.U. in 1989, 15 were special admissions.
"What we were doing wasn't bad," Davis said. "We just need to do the same things for more people."

HEADLINE: Horses, Taxes And You

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
THE barns used to buzz with dentists at play, jolly men with gold chains and open hands. They loved to get their Guccis dirty and play Owner. If the trainer said that Doc's horse -- call it Perio Dough or LuvWendy -- needed special X-rays or a Calvin Klein blanket or a Florida trip so she could run with her own class, Doc would say, No problem, I'll make it up in gold crowns.
But those were the days when we all helped subsidize thoroughbred racing. The tax reforms of 1986 made it more difficult to deduct the routine expenses of horse racing -- perhaps $60-$100 per day for LuvWendy -- from other income. Since most horses don't turn a profit, a lot of dentists took up sculpture instead. I missed their energy and their capacity to fall in love with horses who, like them, were not considered well bred enough for the Big Events. 
 The breeders who supplied them with horses missed them even more than I did.
 "Two tax stories you can count on every April," says Lou DeFichy, a longtime handicapper and jockey agent. "The I.R.S. tries to scare us by floating one on how they're nailing cheaters, and the breeders try to scare us by putting out the story that the sport is going under."
It's julep time and we've been scared. If you have any money left over from taxes, it is your sentimental duty to bet tomorrow's Kentucky Derby, even if only with the family in front of the TV while some sportscaster actually says that there isn't a dry eye at Churchill Downs while they sing "My Old Kentucky Home." I always thought it was the juleps or taxes.
The big money, once in breeding, is now in parimutuel gambling, and most of the gamblers seem to be hanging around the Offtrack Betting shops in my neighborhood. I frequently go to OTB for intellectual inspiration; where else is everybody in the room either reading or writing? But they are not friendly people. For the past two days, I've tried to poll them on breeding, the Derby and the imminent demise of the bluegrass farms of Kentucky. I only get their attention with questions about the state's take of the gambling dollar ("Outrageous, pally") and the conditions of the OTB shop ("Look around, Jack"). It's a lousy atmosphere, dirty, crowded, smelling of failure, the waiting room for a ship that will never come in.
But the race track can be wonderful, ever sunny and green and wrongheadedly hopeful, which is why the dentists will come as long as you don't brush properly. There's always something going at the track, a long shot that can turn your life around. The rituals of the track mask the problems it shares with the world outside: the alcoholism and drug addiction among the grooms and hot walkers, the greed and political corruption that drive the frontside, the hardscrabble life of the everyday trainers and jockeys whose horses fill most of the low-rent races that draw the betting dollars that keep the game alive.
Lou DeFichy thinks the OTB bettors don't really care about horses; they could be betting on the cockroaches in the OTB rooms, he thinks, or on computerized Nintendo horse composites.
If breeding farms go bankrupt, there will be fewer horses. Some day, there may only be enough horses for a dozen live tracks in the country, beaming out TV races to bet on.
This is a scenario the horse-racing lobby is peddling. The lobby wants the tax laws re-revised. Outrageous, pally. I certainly don't want the Government to do anything for the sport of kings that's going to cost me money. Let all those whiney Kentucky breeders who made so much money in the good times go suffer the recession with everyone else.
 A small Maryland breeder, Cynthia McGinnis, agrees with all this in principle, but she has another solution. The prize money in racing is at the top, in the major stakes races run by very well-bred horses owned by very well-bred people. She estimates that 85 percent of the prize money goes to 10 percent of the horses. She thinks that if the purses were more equitably distributed down through the classes, with the first eight instead of four finishers getting a piece, not only would the game be saved, but so would a lot of lovely 2-year-old horses who might otherwise be sold for meat.
Cynthia McGinnis gets emotional here as she describes spirited young thoroughbreds whose owners can't afford them anymore being sold for $200 at auction for overseas consumption. They will be packed into trucks for a last ride to abattoirs in New Jersey where they will be slaughtered and quartered and frozen and loaded on planes to France.
Like all good racing tales, this one has a twist. Cynthia's passionate voice takes on a wicked edge. Do those French housewives cooking filly mignon, she wonders, know how much steroids and other drugs Americans pump into their race horses?
Next time I go to OTB, before the Belmont, I'll see if I can get their attention with that, Jack.

Support A Toe Shoe

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Who was that standing and cheering, so full of pleasure and happiness?
Why, it was all of us, everybody in the huge ballroom, hundreds of us. And what were we cheering and hugging ourselves about? 
 The children, of course, and the young adult artists, but also something we had forgotten how to cheer and cherish -- all the talent and creativity, bounce, zest and desire of New York, the great city of New York. You heard me: the great city of New York.
It happened at a benefit. Can you believe that? Now everybody knows that benefits are necessary. Where else is the money going to come from for this philanthropy or that cause? Particularly now, when the government -- every one of them, city, state, Federal -- is cutting back to the bone and philanthropies, like hospitals or schools for talented children, or causes, such things as human rights or trees, will have to go, just too bad, if you don't kick in yourself.
Yes, but benefits have to be wearisome. Everybody knows that too. It is some kind of a law, and it is very useful. It prevents people at the benefit from getting above themselves just because they can afford a ticket or a table. Boredom is the great leveler, uniting everybody in the room -- donors, beneficiaries and waiters.
 This benefit was on 34th street, which is nowhere -- south of usual benefit country, but not south enough for SoHo chic. It was in the Manhattan Center Ballroom, long closed but now prettied up, fit for the honor of receiving and displaying the beauty and genius of the Dance Theater of Harlem, for which the benefit was organized.
The DTH is a dance troupe, a dance school, and it is an inspiration. Under Arthur Mitchell and his staff, it inspires children to value themselves enough to absorb the relentless disciplines of art. Then it teaches them to dance in such a way as to enrich their lives, and the souls of those who watch them.
Unhappily, New Yorkers do not get to watch them enough. Things are getting tighter for this glory of New York, as it is for the other glories of New York -- the other talent-schools, performing troupes, museums, libraries, concert halls without which this would not be a place worth visiting, and certainly not a place worth actually inhabiting.
Naturally, these are the first to go in times of budget-cutting. The city stands to lose scores of millions in ticket and tourist money, but that's how it goes.
Fortunately, New Yorkers like Gayfryd Steinberg and Elizabeth Ross Johnson Kennan, co-chairmen of the DTH evening, find it difficult to see the cost benefit of allowing the city to commit cultural suicide. But then they are not economists or government officials.
Some of the girls and boys who once danced at DTH have become ballet stars or managers. Others have become executives or doctors. Some of them testified on video that the discipline and self-mastery they learned at DTH stayed with them always and were part of their success in life.
That is obviously true. But the point is not that DTH turns all its youngsters into impresarios, CEO's or brain surgeons. It teaches children growing up in mean streets to find value in themselves, which of course is essential to being of any value to anybody else. Also, it teaches them to dance like crazy.
 I do not know the terminology ballet critics would use to describe what we saw but to me the whole performance was a dance of growth. Through the choreography, very small children grew into somewhat larger children, who became young adult dancers, who became principal dancers and Broadway stars, and then they were dancing together, all separate and all part of each other, in elegant ballet or shaking the place with stomp, as life and art moved them. In the darkened ballroom, it was a sunburst, an hour or so of sunburst that was pure, total New York.
Please, don't write to me telling me I am too old, too well paid, to be sentimental or too whatever to admit how horrible, poor and stenchy New York has become. I know, I know. But, listen, I also know a sunburst when I see one.
So call or write the Dance Theater of Harlem, 466 West 152d Street, New York, N.Y. 10031, or phone 212-967-3470. With very little money, you can support a toe shoe or give a whole year of them to a dancing child.

Powell Was Right

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Time and human disaster had already cast increasing doubt on President Bush's decision to go to war against Iraq. Now the doubts have further weight. For it appears that Gen. Colin Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opposed the President's course.
So we are told in a new book by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post. He reports that General Powell favored economic and military pressures on Iraq, arguing that they would in time force Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait without war. 
 The knowledge that a military man as universally respected as General Powell advised against the war will surely strengthen the view, held now by a minority of Americans, that the war was unwise. At a minimum it will be harder to brand opponents as unpatriotic, as some Republicans have done.
Mr. Woodward's book, "The Commanders," uses his familiar technique of describing behind-the-scenes events in a matter-of-fact narrative, without identifying his sources. Like others, I have my doubts about that method. But here it has the ring of authority. The words and views ascribed to General Powell and other high officials fit what is known otherwise and sound authentic.
President Bush set the course for war when he announced on Nov. 8 that he was doubling the number of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. Just before that, according to the book, General Powell had argued to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and then to the President himself for an alternative strategy of containment.
Why did Mr. Bush reject that advice? The book offers no definitive answer to that crucial question, and Mr. Woodward tells us that he was not able to interview the President. But he quotes the President as telling General Powell: "I don't think there's time politically for that strategy."
What that meant turns on whether Mr. Bush, if he spoke those exact words, was using "politically" in an international or domestic sense. He might have meant that he thought the international coalition against Saddam Hussein would not hold together long enough to let sanctions and other pressures work. Or he might have meant that a long-haul strategy would not be popular with American voters.
The war option proved immensely popular. It sent Mr. Bush up to record figures in the polls and dispatched the critics who had called him indecisive and weak. That result echoed the precedents of Grenada and Panama.
One unanswered question about the Persian Gulf crisis has been whether U.S. intelligence predicted the invasion of Kuwait. Mr. Woodward says the Defense Intelligence Agency did, issuing a warning on July 31. He says that Secretary of Defense Cheney rejected that and a further urgent warning the next day, saying that the Iraqi troop buildup was a bluff.
But once Iraq invaded on Aug. 2, the book says, President Bush was consistently hawkish. It says that on Aug. 3 he ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to begin planning covert operations to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and formally authorized such operations on Aug. 15.
General Powell is described as having been distressed when the President took steps toward war without consulting him or having a discussion at a National Security Council meeting. One such occasion was when Mr. Bush said on Aug. 5 that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "will not stand." That implied a sharp escalation of objective, from preventing an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia to undoing the aggression on Kuwait. The book says General Powell learned of it by watching the President on television.
Once President Bush had really made his decision for war, by late November, General Powell loyally supported the policy. He and the President will no doubt now resist efforts to divide them. But the war strategy is going to be seen in a different light.
Would a containment strategy in fact have forced Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in time? And how much time? According to the book, General Powell said it might take as long as a year or two, but it would work.
The alternative strategy looks better all the time now. The war took a dreadful human toll. It did long-lasting damage to the environment of the gulf. It has not produced new stability or security in the region. And it did not result in Saddam Hussein's fall.
General Powell was right the first time.

HEADLINE: The Start Treaty: Finish It or Lose It Richard Burt was chief negotiator in the strategic arms talks from June 1989 through last March.

BYLINE: By Richard Burt

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After nearly a decade of negotiations, the United States and Soviet Union don't seem able to finish a treaty that would reduce their arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles, submarines and bombers. Only a few technical issues still remain. But if Washington and Moscow don't complete a treaty soon, the opportunity for nuclear arms control may be lost for years to come.
The conventional wisdom is that a strategic arms treaty is a cold war relic and thus no longer a U.S. foreign policy priority. Some say arms control is unnecessary because the Soviet Union's deteriorating economy already establishes a sufficient check on its future military growth. The conventional wisdom is wrong. It assumes that the Kremlin will neither be willing nor able to continue its aggressive nuclear modernization. Given the disturbing changes in the Soviet Union, which has 30,000 nuclear weapons, that could turn out to be a dangerous illusion. Start could play a vital role in shoring up nuclear stability in an unpredictable moment in Soviet history. 
 The nearly completed accord would do three important things. First, it would accomplish the core U.S. goal, which is to focus any nuclear reductions in areas of Soviet military advantage. Thus, the Soviets would be obliged to cut ballistic-missile warheads by more than 40 percent and their highly destabilizing SS-18 missiles by 50 percent. Second, the treaty would protect advanced military technologies, which will be vital for protecting U.S. interests in future conflicts. In particular, it would not constrain the deployment of highly flexible conventional cruise missiles. Third, the accord would establish a regime for intrusive monitoring and verification, including a dozen forms of on-site inspection.
These aspects of the treaty have not gone unnoticed by the Soviet generals and the military-industrial complex. With the balance of power shifting in favor of the military hard-liners, the hard-fought U.S. victories in Start are in jeopardy. For example, there is a growing debate in the Soviet military about the vigorous inspection system, with critics charging that it would enable U.S. inspectors to engage in "legalized espionage."
For the Soviet military, Start does not sufficiently limit new high-tech systems like super-accurate U.S. conventional cruise missiles. More importantly, the Soviet high command could decide to place new emphasis on its own nuclear arsenal in a strategy designed to offset U.S. technological superiority in conventional arms.
Such a development could not come at a worse time. With the military wielding growing influence in internal politics, it could mean Mikhael Gorbachev or any other Soviet leader would have little choice but to accede to a military push for scuttling Start and preserving and modernizing the huge Soviet nuclear arsenal.
We probably still have a "window" for completing the accord, especially now that differences on carrying out last year's accord on conventional forces in Europe seem to have been resolved this week. Mr. Gorbachev still wants a nuclear agreement. But the longer the talks drag on, the easier it will be for hard-liners to reopen agreed elements of the treaty and to win support for a stronger nuclear arms posture more generally.
A delay in finishing the accord would mean that a large portion of the existing treaty would have to be renegotiated under difficult circumstances. The result would surely be an inferior accord. At worst, a delay could mean no treaty at all, together with a more militarized -- and nuclearized -- Soviet foreign policy. We should not permit the Soviet generals to get their way. We should finish Start now.

HEADLINE: Albany's Fair-Weather Foolishness Makes a Rainy Day Worse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Double Dose of Pain for the Poor" (The Week in Review, April 7) cites two causes for the budget crisis New York and most other states confront today: 
 (1) The "new federalism," which has shifted responsibility from Washington to the states, and
(2) a recession that has dried up tax revenues.
A third and equally important cause remains unmentioned. At the same time as states were having to increase their dollars to fill holes left by the withdrawal of Federal dollars, they were scrambling to decrease their own sources of dollars through policy decisions that cut state taxes or capped local taxes.
In 1987, the New York State Governor and Legislature, in the excitement to give back "the windfall" from Federal tax reform, cut personal and corporate taxes way beyond the windfall. Not only did the cuts benefit wealthier New Yorkers disproportionately, but also Albany then failed to capture the state's growth in personal and corporate income.
In the years of boom, we could have invested in our physical and service infrastructures. Instead, in these times of recession, the chickens have come home to roost, and New York State is cutting services and benefits that have, as your article points out, "a disproportionate effect on the poor."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Panel Says Reactor Can Restart, Giving Industry Lift

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Deciding that one of the most ambitious nuclear power programs in the nation has solved longstanding design and management problems, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today approved the restart of a nuclear reactor at the Browns Ferry plant in Alabama.
The decision, which could open the plant's Unit 2 reactor within 10 days, was hailed today by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns and operates the reactor in northern Alabama, and by others in the nuclear power industry as a significant vote of confidence for the utility and the industry.
The reactor has been shut for more than six years, the longest shutdown for repairs in the history of the American civilian nuclear power program.
"The restart of any plant after an extended outage is a sign of an industry where problems are corrected after they are brought to light," said Steve Unglesbee, a spokesman for the United States Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear power industry trade group in Washington.
Critics of nuclear power denounced the action, saying that the regulatory agency exempted Browns Ferry, just outside Athens, Ala., from a number of crucial safety guidelines, most having to do with the plant's ability to fight fires.
They noted that on Monday, a fire and explosion shut a nuclear power plant in Maine indefinitely. The accident occurred in a transformer and generator at the plant and did not release any radiation to the public.
Although there have been no new orders for nuclear power plants in 17 years, many operators, including the T.V.A., have indicated that they would like to build new plants this decade. The Bush Administration has begun an aggressive nuclear program within the Department of Energy aimed at designing a standard type of reactor that would be almost immune from meltdown. It also wants to streamline licensing of new plants.
The Administration has said it believes nuclear power is safe and produces less pollution than conventional power plants. The pollution argument is beginning to gain ground even among some environmentalists, who have generally opposed nuclear power but who increasingly view conventional power plants as heavy contributors to global warming and acid rain.
 
New Design Being Studied
 The Administration says one new reactor design being considered by the Energy Department for producing materials for nuclear weapons can also be applied to generating electrical power. The design under consideration would consist of four small reactors using tiny uranium pellets for fuel and would be cooled by hydrogen.
Records from the N.R.C. also show that 12 years after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., utilities have improved operations at nuclear plants. Commercial nuclear power plants are experiencing fewer unplanned shutdowns, fewer accidents and incidents, and are more reliable than ever, the agency says. The number of unplanned shutdowns dropped to an average of 1.6 per plant in 1990 from 7.4 in 1980, according to the N.R.C.
How important these improvements are in swaying public opinion in favor of nuclear power remains to be seen.
Some environmentalists say that the mining, milling, and processing of uranium for fuel is a dirty and ecologically dangerous business. The Government also has been unable to reach a safe and permanent solution for disposing of dangerous radioactive wastes.
 
Staking Their Futures
 Nevertheless, large utilities, especially the T.V.A., are again beginning to stake their futures on generating electrical power from the atom.
"The decision today was a substantial milestone for this company," said Dan A. Nauman, T.V.A.'s senior vice president for nuclear power. "We worked so hard to get here. Since 1985, people have been working seven days a week to get to this point."
Political leaders in Alabama were pleased. State Representative Bobby Denton, a Democrat who lives about 40 miles from the plant, said: "It's great news for the Tennessee Valley region to be close to seeing the plant finally begin producing electricity again. Hopefully, Browns Ferry can now become the model program it was expected to be from the start."
Mayor Eddie Frost of Florence said: "Federal regulators would not allow the unit to be started again if there was a great risk. I'm confident all the problems have been solved." Florence is about 30 miles west of Athens.
Indeed, many residents of Alabama seem unalarmed, even uninterested. "To most people it seems like a done deal," said Pat Byington, executive director of the Alabama Conservancy, an environmental group in Birmingham. "Nobody is talking about it very much."
 
Early, Heady Days Recalled
 The Browns Ferry plant was once the world's largest commercial nuclear plant, a symbol of the atom's intoxicating power. Built at a cost of $1 billion, its first reactor opened in 1974. Two more followed in 1975 and 1977, generating 1,100 megawatts each. The Browns Ferry plant was seen by T.V.A. as the cornerstone of an empire of 17 nuclear power plants the utility planned to build across the South at a cost of tens of billions of dollars.
But soon after it opened, Browns Ferry also became a symbol of the capricious perils of nuclear energy. In March 1975, while the plant was operating at peak power, a workman searching with a candle for an air leak in the plant's cable room accidentally ignited a fire that caused more than $100 million in damage. The fire, which burned below the control room and nearly led to a catastrophe, was one of the worst civilian nuclear power accidents in the United States.
Over the next decade, a series of investigations by the N.R.C. and other agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, uncovered significant weaknesses in the design, management and operation of Browns Ferry and its sister, the Sequoyah nuclear plant north of Chattanooga, Tenn., which opened in 1981.
 
Three Mile Island Shock
 The inquiries, coupled with higher operating costs and the public uneasiness prompted by the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, caused the T.V.A. nuclear program to collapse in the mid-1980's. Browns Ferry and Sequoyah were closed. Work on two other nuclear plants ceased. The adventure in nuclear power cost the T.V.A. at least $20 billion and nearly bankrupted the utility.
T.V.A. executives defended their decision to develop a nuclear power program as vital to the economic growth of the utility and the region it served. In 1988, after an expensive repair program, the T.V.A. gained permission from the N.R.C. to restart both reactors at the Sequoyah plant.
The repair program at Browns Ferry has been more expensive, costing more than $1.3 billion to date.
Unit 2 must undergo several more tests before final permission is granted by the N.R.C. administrator in Atlanta to restart it. Mr. Nauman said Unit 3 could be restarted in 1994 and Unit 1 sometime before the end of the decade. The N.R.C. said Browns Ferry was the last nuclear plant left in the United States to restart after an extended shutdown. Four others have been restarted after long shutdowns since 1985.
"It was kind of a black eye for the nuclear industry that Browns Ferry was down," said Mr. Nauman. "Bringing it back on line means it has been brought to today's standard of operation. This plant will produce electricity for a long time."
Critics of the industry said today that the N.R.C. appeared to be especially lenient in its consideration of Browns Ferry. The T.V.A. sought, and the four-member commission specifically granted, an exemption for Browns Ferry from several fire-safety requirements that were made into law as a result of the 1975 accident at the plant. For instance, the commission ordinarily requires nuclear plants to have automatic fire-suppression equipment in backup control rooms. Browns Ferry, though, will be able to use fire extinguishers.
The N.R.C. rules also ordinarily requires fire-fighting equipment for key pumps. Browns Ferry will not need to have the fire-fighting equipment, according to commission documents, because the T.V.A. felt that if a fire developed near the pumps it would not burn for very long.
"These exemptions are authorized by law and will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety," the N.R.C. wrote.
Several groups today said they were upset with the exemptions and the decision to restart Browns Ferry. "It is ironic that here is the plant that had a fire in March 1975 that led to these rules and now they are granted exemptions to fire-protection regulations," said Robert D. Pollard, the nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Marketing Executive Is New Head of Godiva

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
When David L. Albright took over as president of Godiva Chocolatier earlier this week, he brought with him more than 20 years of experience marketing greeting cards, paper towels, chocolate mousse, and most recently Pepperidge Farm cookies.
All that marketing expertise will come in handy increasing the popularity of the renowned but flagging Godiva chocolates. At $25 a pound, the chocolates cost several times more than a number of other fancy candies. 
 Mr. Albright, 43, was most recently vice president of marketing for the biscuit division of Pepperidge Farm, a unit of the Campbell Soup Company. At Godiva, also a Campbell Soup unit, he replaces Thomas H. Fey, who resigned.
"My whole career has been devoted to building brands," Mr. Albright said, "regardless of category or whether it was upscale or mass market."
Mr. Albright is still studying Godiva, so he has not decided on whether there will be any major changes there. But last year Godiva had sales of under $100 million, and Mr. Albright acknowledges that the recession has hurt sales, especially at department stores where Godiva chocolates are often sold. Mr. Albright would not discuss profits.
At Pepperidge Farm, Mr. Albright was instrumental in marketing the distinctive white packaging for Pepperidge Farm cookies. "We're very proud of that packaging," he said. "It's almost a Harvard Business School case study in signature marketing."
After majoring in marketing at Villanova University, Mr. Albright concentrated in marketing at Indiana University business school. In 1971, he got his first marketing position selling greeting cards for Hallmark. Later, he joined American Can, where he helped market Brawny paper towels and Northern bathroom tissue, and stayed when the businesses were acquired by the James River Corporation.
In 1984, Mr. Albright set off on his own and formed a frozen dessert company called Glacial Confections Inc. in Westport, Conn. He joined Pepperidge Farm in 1986.
One thing will not change in Mr. Albright's switch from cookies to candy. "Weight control is still going to be a problem," he said. "I'm going to be Wee Willie Wonka for the next couple of weeks."

HEADLINE: Colleges' Private Gifts Up 10 Percent in '90

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Private gifts to American colleges and universities totaled $9.8 billion in 1990, up 10 percent from the previous year, according to a survey by a private educational group.
The increase in donations from corporations, alumni and other private philanthropic sources followed a 9 percent rise in 1989 and a 3.5 percent drop in such giving in 1988, the organization, the Council for Aid to Education, said in issuing its annual estimate on Thursday. 
 Harvard University received the most private support of any single institution -- $213.5 million, equal to $8,743 a student, and up 15 percent from the 1989 level. Stanford University was second, attracting $202.2 million, or $14,325 a student, a gain of 7 percent from the preceding year.
Alumni giving totaled $2.54 billion, up 10 percent over the previous year. Corporate donations were up 11 percent to $2.17 billion, more than double the 5 percent increase in 1989.
Philanthropy from all sources has increased by 55 percent since 1984-85, according to the council. Adjusted for inflation, donations were up 21 percent from five years earlier.
Such giving "is a well-embedded tradition" that has consistently defied fluctuations in the economy and the stock market, said Priscilla Lewis, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit council.
"These days there is also a great deal of emphasis on education as a critical factor in national competitiveness. There is plenty going on now to sustain the tradition of giving to schools," she said.
But she noted that the latest survey covered donations received during the 1989-90 school year, slightly ahead of the recession that economists say began in July.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lifted by Job Report; Gold Prices Show Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced on world currency markets yesterday, bolstered by a better-than-expected report on United States unemployment.
Gold prices declined. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell $1.10 an ounce, to $353.90. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $353.50 an ounce, off $1.30. 
 Traders focused on the much-anticipated unemployment report for April, which showed the nation's jobless rate unexpectedly improved for the first time in nearly a year. The Labor Department said the jobless rate fell to 6.6 percent, from 6.8 percent in March.
Because traders had been positioned for more negative news, there was a flurry of technical buying of the dollar. "It was extremely busy and very volatile," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
The evidence of economic improvement led some dealers to speculate that interest rates are probably headed no lower. Earlier in the week the Federal Reserve surprised financial markets by cutting the discount rate, and major banks followed by lowering their prime lending rate, a key interest rate that serves as the basis for a host of consumer and business loans.
Higher interest rates enhance the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities more attractive to investors.
Still, there was enough skepticism about the unemployment data to prevent the dollar from extending its gains even further. "Changes in the labor market itself may have been behind the aberrational drop in the rate," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with I D E A, a financial advisory concern. He said that many Americans might not be represented by the statistics because they had either given up looking for work or considered themselves self-employed.
In Tokyo, foreign exchange markets were closed for a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 138.50 Japanese yen. In New York the dollar settled at 138.85 yen, up from 138.15 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound sank to $1.6965, from $1.7170 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.6940 to buy 1, less expensive than Thursday's $1.7193.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Drop Sharply Amid Signs of Oversupply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices settled at their lowest level in three months yesterday after briefly touching a 14-month low amid signs that stockpiles are expanding because of slack industrial demand.
On other commodity markets, precious metals also fell; oil futures rose; grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 Copper futures settled 1.30 cents to 3.40 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in May down 3.10 cents, at $1.033 a pound, the lowest daily settlement for near-term copper deliveries since Jan. 24.
The May contract price dipped to $1.0305 during the session, the lowest near-term copper price since Feb. 13, 1990. Copper last traded below $1 a pound in early February 1990.
 
Slide Started Last Year

The decline extended a slide that began late in the third quarter of 1990, when slowing industrial production translated into weakening demand for copper. The metal is widely used in the construction, automobile and electronics industries.
Traders disregarded yesterday's Government report of an improvement in the unemployment rate last month and focused instead on a 5,800-ton rise in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks and a no-strike vote by unionized workers at the Chile Copper Company's Teniente mine unit.
Steve Platt, a metals analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said further selling was prompted by the market's failure to rally on news that a producer, Gecamines of Zaire, indicated that it would not meet its delivery commitments on 1991 shipments.
Since stockpiled supplies are abundant, "many people feel it's not going to make much of a difference," Mr. Platt said.
A weekly report of declining auto sales also weighed on prices, said Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.
"The real factor is the uncertainty about the economy," she said.
Oil futures rose in thin trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped by strong chart signals and strength in the European heating oil market.
Crude oil settled 20 to 23 cents higher, with June at $21.37 a barrel; heating oil was 0.57 to 0.85 cent higher, with June at 54.73 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.30 to 0.61 cent higher, with June at 71.36 cents a gallon; natural gas was 1 cent lower to 1.1 cent higher, with June at $1.356 per 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE FELL TO 6.6% IN APRIL, REVERSING A TREND

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that payroll jobs fell in April but at a much reduced pace and that the unemployment rate edged down two-tenths of a point, to 6.6 percent. The figures point over all to an economy that while probably not yet starting to recover from recession seems to be approaching its low point, analysts said.
They cautioned, however, that the decline in the unemployment rate, the first in almost a year, was probably an aberration. 
 The bond market fell on the news, apparently because traders believed it reflected a stabilizing of the economy, implying that the Federal Reserve would see no further need to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. Although the lower unemployment number should be good for stocks because it implies economic improvement and stronger earnings, traders showed little reaction, apparently wanting to see further evidence. In a choppy day, the Dow Jones industrial average ended about where it began -- ahead 0.25 point, at 2,938.86.
 
 An Economist's Viewpoint
 For the economy at large, "the rate of decline is tapering off," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh.
Yet the labor market report, the first comprehensive survey of how the economy performed in April, had some statistics that were highly suspect, and even the White House did not speak of the recession's imminent end.
"The decline in the unemployment rate is good news," said Michael J. Boskin, the President's top economic adviser. "But you always want to see it confirmed over a span of time, not just for one month, particularly where there are some questions about the quality of the data over the past several months."
 
 Contrasting Surveys
 Mr. Boskin was referring to the Labor Department's survey of households, which showed that civilian employment soared by 644,000 last month, mostly because of increases for workers at all levels of government and for the self-employed.
This was in sharp contrast to a decline of 124,000 jobs reported in the department's survey of business and other non-farm payrolls. That survey showed that government jobs also shrank.
Eight of the 11 biggest industrial states showed improvement last month, but New York's unemployment rate showed a sizable increase -- to 7.5 percent, from 6.8. The New Jersey rate eased to 6.5 percent, from 6.8, a statistically insignificant change in light of the relatively small samples used in compiling rates for individual states.
Various analysts said the question was whether the household survey was inaccurate in February and March, when it showed the rate jumping sharply to 6.8 percent, from 6.2 percent, or whether the April decline to 6.6 percent was misleading.
Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that she found the April survey "difficult to interpret." She noted there were large sampling variabilities and urged analysts to wait for additional data. She said there should be at least two consecutive months of significant change -- more than a tenth of a point -- to signal a clear change in the direction of the unemployment rate.
Most economists had expected the rate to increase to 6.9 or 7 percent last month.
Although it is usual for the ranks of the self-employed to rise in recession, as people who lose jobs go into business for themselves, the report showed a stunning increase of 321,000 last month. In addition, 235,000 workers were recorded as going to work for governments at a time of widespread budget stringency.
 
 Breaking Down the Figures
 The household survey also showed that the number of people who had lost their last jobs, as opposed to quitting them, shrank by 175,000, after rising steadily since the summer. The newly unemployed, those without jobs for fewer than five weeks, fell 228,000, and those without jobs for 5 to 14 weeks fell 159,000.
Unemployment was down somewhat for all major population groups except blacks, whose rate rose to 12.6 percent, from 12.3 percent in March and 11.8 percent in February.
The payroll survey, which is usually considered the more reliable in depicting the state of the economy, showed that the number of goods-producing jobs fell 66,000 and service jobs fell 58,000. This 124,000 total decline was well under the revised March number of 241,000. The new March figure is 35,000 more than initially reported.
Over all, the April decline in payroll jobs was just half the average of the three preceding months.
 
 Less of a Downturn in Factories
 The diminished decline in the number of factory workers was even more pronounced: the 42,000 jobs lost in April compare with an average drop of 115,000 during the preceding five months, the department noted.
Hefty losses, however, occurred in industrial machinery and transportation equipment, even though 15,000 auto workers returned to plants that had been temporarily closed.
Construction jobs fell 20,000, as hiring was short of seasonal expectations for the second straight month, while the number of retail trade jobs fell 40,000, after a combined loss of 180,000 in February and March. The small gain of 4,000 in the financial industry was the first rise since August, and business services gained for the first time since September.
Average weekly hours worked in the private sector edged down by six minutes, but factory hours and factory overtime each gained that amount. Today's payroll report also disclosed that the index of aggregate weekly hours retreated for the second straight month -- to 121, from 121.4.
 
 Adding to Payrolls
 Reflecting large increases from depressed levels, 44.7 percent of private industries added workers last month, up from 36.9 percent, and 41.4 percent of manufacturing industries added workers, up from 30.2 in March.
Average hourly earnings rose five-tenths of 1 percent, to $10.29, the second straight substantial increase.
According to the household survey, 117,398,000 Americans had civilian jobs last month, and 8,274,000 were unemployed, a reduction of 298,000 in the ranks of those without jobs.
Counting military personnel, the jobless rate fell three-tenths of 1 percent, to 6.5 percent. A Labor Department official said that redeployments involving the Persian Gulf had no significant effect on the figures.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Plunge in Confused Day

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates soared yesterday as prices of Treasury bonds plunged in what dealers called a most confused session. The confusion stemmed from outwardly conflicting Government employment data for April.
The "household" survey, for example, showed a rise of 644,000 non-farm jobs last month. That meant the nation's unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent in April from 6.8 percent in March. This was the first decline since May 1990, when the jobless number dipped to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent. 
 Because any positive economic news hurts the market in bonds and other fixed-income securities, the price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds plunged almost a point, or $10 for each $1,000 of face value, soon after trading began.
 
 Recovery Loses Force

But the same Labor Department report said its "establishment" survey found that the number of nonfarm jobs had dropped by 144,000 in April. When this figure was culled from the report, bond prices began to recover some of their losses. But dealers said the recovery soon lost force, in large part because bond futures prices in Chicago were under pressure all day.
Late in the session the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, were being offered at 96 5/32, down a stunning 1 3/32. This caused their yield to climb to 8.22 percent, from 8.11 percent the day before and 8.20 percent a week ago.
Thus after all the sound and fury over the wave of interest rate cuts during the week, the yield on the long bonds was still up by 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, for the week.
Prices of shorter Treasury maturities posted smaller losses, while the discount rates on bills were basically unchanged on the day.
The sudden rebound in yields caused a sharp reduction in offerings of corporate debt, which had been soaring during the week as companies sought to take advantage of falling borrowing costs.
The interest rate cuts began on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve cut both its discount rate to member banks by half a point, to 5 1/2 percent, and the more important Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans, to 5 3/4 percent from 6 percent. The next day, many large commercial banks cut their prime rate to 8 1/2 percent from 9 percent.
Yesterday, the Fed moved aggressively to drain reserves from the banking system as the funds rate slipped below its presumed new target of 5 3/4 percent. As demand for the funds slackened before the weekend they traded down to 5 1/2 percent at the close.
"The confusion caused by the April employment numbers couldn't have come at a worse time because the bond market is always edgy before a Treasury refunding," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president and credit money market specialist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The market was already a bit edgy because of the record $37 billion of Treasury paper scheduled for auction at next week's refunding."
On Tuesday, the Treasury will auction $13.5 billion of three-year notes, which traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.12 percent, up from 7.05 percent the day before. On Wednesday, $11.75 billion of 10-year notes are up was sale and these traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.02 percent, compared with 7.92 percent the day before.
 
Auction Set for Thursday

The auction of $11.75 billion of what will become the Treasury's new benchmark long bonds is set for Thursday. Yesterday, these bonds were traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.21 percent, up from 8.10 percent. In all, a record $37 billion of new Treasury debt will be auctioned. At the last quarterly refunding in February, a then record $34.5 billion of Treasury paper was auctioned.
Josh K. Stiles, senior North American bond market analyst at IDEA, international economic consultants, said that "besides the confusion caused by the different household and establishment jobs numbers and the normal bearish sentiment before a refunding, there was one bit of good news for the bond market. The growth in the nation's money supply ended abruptly in April. The steady growth in the money supply was supposed to provide fuel for the economic recovery."
Although one month's data does not signal a trend, Mr. Stiles noted, the M-2 measure of the money supply dropped by $4.5 billion in April. Wall Street economists had expected $3 billion in further growth.
 
Transamerica Notes Priced
 Although the pace of corporate debt offerings slackened, some important "names" were priced. These included $300 million of 8.30 percent noncallable notes, due in 1995, of the Transamerica Finance Corporation, a unit of the Transamerica Corporation. A Goldman, Sachs & Company syndicate priced the notes at par, thus offering a yield of 93 basis points above comparable Treasury notes.
Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced $100 million of General Motors Corporation noncallable notes, due in 2003. The notes have a 8 7/8 percent coupon and were priced at 99.50 to yield investors 8.944 percent, or 94 basis points more than like Treasury maturities.
The Centex Corporation offered $100 million of 9.05 percent noncallable senior notes, due in 1996, priced at par through a group led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

HEADLINE: Stocks Seesaw; Dow Rises by 0.25

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
After three good days, Wall Street had a tough time yesterday deciding what to do; conflicting road signs kept investors guessing.
So, after a choppy day that toppled the Dow Jones industrial average 14 points, lifted it 12, brought it down again 14 and lifted it again 19, the Dow ended about where it began -- ahead 0.25, to 2,938.86. 
 Strong rate cuts from the Fed and subsequent reductions in the prime rate lifted the Dow blue chips 26.48 points for the week.
This brought the Dow within 65 points of its all-time high of 3,004.46 set a little more than two weeks ago.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to 158.2 million shares, from 187.1 million on Thursday, and the 748 advances nearly matched the 749 declines. Sixty-eight stocks climbed to 52-week highs and only five dropped to 52-week lows.
 
 Heavy Program Selling
 Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, reported heavy computerized selling near the opening and strong program buying near the close. But over all, it said, the activity clipped the Dow 8 points.
Wall Street, though, is now in a quandary whether to get in or get out.
On one hand, the Labor Department reported yesterday that the unemployment rate fell last month to 6.6 percent from 6.8 percent in March, or more than expected. That should be good for stocks because it implies economic improvement and stronger earnings. But traders want more evidence.
On the other hand, traders said the Fed drained money from the banking system yesterday to raise the Fed funds rate that banks charge each other to 5 3/4 percent, and that is bad for stocks.
Still, in their current strategy report, Steven G. Einhorn and Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairmen of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, "We do not believe that the bull market is over." They said stocks can continue to gain for these reasons:
*Foreign central banks will ease monetary policy.
*Inflation and interest rates in the United States will be held down by weak global growth, falling foreign rates and a rising dollar.
*Economic and profit recovery in the United States could be accompanied by a modest improvement in inflation.
In his weekly report, Greg A. Smith, chief investment officer for Prudential Securities, made a case for another 10 percent rise in stocks.
Without giving names, he recommended banks, insurers, financial agencies, brokerage firms and mutual fund companies.
In one of the day's best gains, Kellogg rose 5 1/2, to 96. Prudential Securities had issued a report on the company, William Blair & Company raised its earnings estimate and Business Week ran a favorable article.
I.B.M. tumbled 2 1/4, to 103 5/8, with 3.2 million shares changing hands after Rick Martin of Prudential Securities recommended its sale and Stephen Smith of Paine Webber cut his earnings estimate.
Storage Technology rose 3 1/2, to 45 1/4, in heavy trading despite the sale of 3.45 million shares at $41 apiece. Stephen Cohen of Soundview Financial, which follows technology stocks in Stamford, Conn., argued that the offering would not dilute the earnings per share because the 8 percent additional stock would be covered by interest on the money raised.

HEADLINE: Businesses in Maryland Gain Priority on Kuwait Contracts

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
The State of Maryland and the Government of Kuwait signed an agreement today to give Maryland companies an advantage in the competition to win contracts to rebuild the sheikdom.
Under the agreement, signed in Annapolis, the state will send a volunteer team of 200 medical personnel and engineers to Kuwait for at least two weeks and, in return, Kuwait will look first to Maryland manufacturers, shippers and service companies as it goes about recovery and repairing war damage. 
 "It doesn't mean we'll get all the contracts," said J. Randall Evans, the state's Secretary of Economic and Employment Development, "but it does mean that if two bids are roughly the same the Maryland manufacturer or engineer or shipping company will get the nod. It means we'll be producing more and employing more and it means more goods will be leaving from our docks and runways.
"There's a tremendous amount of business out there, maybe five years' worth, and the competition for it by companies all over the United States is very intense. We think we're the early bird and will get lots of worms."
Neither Maryland nor Kuwaiti officials could put a dollar figure on how much the agreement might eventually mean to Maryland businesses.
The agreement came about after Maryland's Governor, William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat, traveled to Washington and Kuwait offering medical and engineering volunteers to help Kuwait. He suggested that Kuwait put Maryland ports and companies at the top of their lists when post-war recovery began.
"What really touched me were the humanitarian aspects," the Kuwait Ambassador to the United States, Sheikh Saud Nasir al-Sabah, said today in the Maryland capital. He said that while his country would funnel business contracts to Maryland companies "as much as we can" it also expected to do business with companies elsewhere.
Numerous American business representatives have visited Kuwait in search of contracts, but Mr. Schaefer is the only Governor to make the journey.
"The agreement means that the people of Maryland will join with the people of Kuwait in a special relationship," he said today.

HEADLINE: Owners, Renters and Strikers Count Costs After Settlement

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Early last week, as service workers wearing red-and-white strike placards began patrolling the sidewalks in front of Manhattan apartment buildings, an official of another New York union took stock of the situation. "It's kind of refreshing," she said. "This is a conventional, old-fashioned strike. Management isn't hiring replacements; it's not trying to break the union. The issues are simply economic."
For those with a financial stake, those economic issues were of considerable importance, of course. Yesterday, with the end of the 12-day strike by doormen, elevator operators, porters and handymen Thursday night, residents and union members began calculating their losses and gains. 
 For members of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, the immediate gain was clear-cut: a wage increase averaging 4 percent a year for the next three years. But since service workers in about 1,400 Manhattan buildings were on strike for almost two weeks, their gain is somewhat undercut. Each worker lost almost $1,000 in pay during the strike, and the raise in the first year of the new contract will be a flat $832.
 
Labor's Effect on Costs Varies
 For owners of cooperative and condominium apartments, the workers' raise means higher operating costs. But for many owners, the increase in the monthly maintenance fee could be relatively low, at least this year.
No co-op is precisely like another, and a host of factors will determine how much the settlement will affect anyone's actual maintenance cost.
Labor accounts for about 25 percent of the operating expenses of most cooperatives and condominiums, several real-estate lawyers and industry executives said.
The building workers will get a $16-a-week raise in the first year of the contract, or 3.46 percent. Owners will also pay an additional 1.5 percent for workers' benefits, so the total cost in the first year will be 5 percent.
 
Increase Often Factored In
 That 5 percent rise in labor costs thus represents a 1.25 percent increase in the overall operating cost. So a co-op or condo owner who pays a $1,000 maintenance fee each month might pay $12.50 a month more.
The actual increase will depend on many things, among them whether a co-op board has already allowed for the cost of the new labor contract in its budget. Many boards estimated in their 1991 budgets that the settlement cost would be 5 percent, said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Association of New York Cooperatives. That would mean no added increase in the current maintenance fee because of the labor contract.
Many buildings also saved money during the strike because they did not have to pay their employees.
The long-term cost of the three-year contract is even more difficult to estimate. The annual increases are compounded. In addition, Ms. Rothman noted, owners will pay the cost of the first year's increase for all three years and the cost of the second year's increase for two years. She calculated that the cumulative result of the agreement on labor costs by the third year would be slightly more than 16 percent.
 
Simplicity of the Issues
 Most renters are covered by rent-stabilization laws and their maximum rent increases are set each June by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. It takes into account fluctuations in many operating costs, from water bills to taxes to labor, in setting rent guidelines.
For many union leaders, the larger significance of the strike lay in its simplicity.
There was considerable relief in having an old-fashioned strike, in which workers and owners battled over something as straightforward as the size of a raise. The building workers strike followed a decade in which many major labor disputes -- from the Federal air-traffic controllers' to Eastern Airlines' to Greyhound's to The Daily News's -- involved cataclysmic struggles between managements bent on curbing, if not destroying, the power of their unions and labor organizations that believed theywere fighting for survival.
Nothing so monumental was at stake in the discord between the apartment owners and the service workers' union.
"In normal strikes, there is often great acrimony between employers and workers, between those who have services withdrawn and workers looking to support their families," said Dennis Rivera, president of the hospital workers' union, Local 1199. But he said he was struck by "the sense of identification of the tenants with the striking porters and handymen."

HEADLINE: CS Holding Cuts Dividend; To Sell 20% of Credit Suisse

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
CS Holding has cut its dividend by nearly a third and announced plans to sell a 20 percent stake in Switzerland's third-largest bank, Credit Suisse. The harsh measures followed a 1990 loss of $587 million at CS First Boston, the New York investment bank that is a unit of CS Holding.
The losses mostly stemmed from reserves set aside to cover potentially bad "bridge" loans for leveraged buyouts. While a big loss was expected, its size prompted CS Holding to take tough steps to bolster capital levels. 
 CS Holding's earnings plunged 77 percent in 1990, to 192 million Swiss francs ($132 million), mostly because of the loss at CS First Boston.
CS Holding cut its dividend to 75 Swiss francs ($51.89), from 110 Swiss francs.
 
Improvement Is Seen
 Wall Street analysts said that CS First Boston was likely to benefit from the turnaround in global stock markets and improvement in the economy, which many economists expect later this year.
For CS First Boston, "last year must be classified as a catastrophe which cannot be repeated," Peter Kuepfer, a member of the CS Holding executive board, said at the company's annual news conference in Zurich on Thursday.
CS Holding said it was confident that profits would revive in 1991 because of improving securities markets and what it viewed as a likely early recovery from the global recession.
"The results of all group units during the first four months lead us to the conclusion that our optimistic assessment is justified," Mr. Kuepfer said.
John Keefe of the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation agreed that CS First Boston should have higher earnings this year, noting that the entire industry was rebounding.
 
'Junk' Bonds a Worry

"When it rains hard enough, everyone gets wet," Mr. Keefe said. "Trading profits are strong, and there's a buildup in equity underwriting. The entire industry should have a better year."
But he added that "junk bonds," high-yield, high-risk debt securities, might continue to be a worry for CS First Boston.
CS First Boston, 60 percent owned by CS Holding, was hard hit by the collapse of the junk bond market. It had earned $11 million in 1989.
In December, CS First Boston completed a corporate revamping that included selling an additional $300 million equity stake to CS Holding. It also sold part of its bridge-loan portfolio to CS Holding last year. In bridge loans, the investment banker provides financing while more permanent financing for a deal is obtained. But if the deal goes sour, the investment banker is left with the bad loan.
First Boston pared its staff by about 300 in 1990 and now employs 3,700.
The firm told employees last week that it was reorganizing its investment-banking operation to de-emphasize mergers and acquisitions and focus on the capital markets.
Merger activity has plunged since the 1980's as financing virtually dried up after the junk bond market collapse and banks tightened their lending.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Is Suddenly Farsighted

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Not long ago, the Wall Street definition of long-term planning was "deciding what to do after lunch." But lately, the Street's fascination with a fast buck seems to be cooling.
Brokerage houses and mutual funds are counseling patience, telling clients to invest for the long term. They are emphasizing products, like municipal unit investment trusts and securities from bankrupt companies, that take longer to ripen profitably than those that dominated the 1980's. As experiments, some firms are changing brokers' compensation to discourage hasty trading. 
 A new study from Salomon Brothers indicates that long-term investors are by far the most likely to reap dependable gains from stocks. One mutual fund is even rewarding longer-term investors with the proceeds from an "impatience tax" on those who cash out quickly.
 
 Some Call It Cant

Some on Wall Street question whether the stress on longer horizons is any more than advertising cant, coming when few investment advisers can point to impressive results in the shorter term.
"Last year was not a great year for investors in the aggregate," said Douglas Loudon, a senior vice president at the Scudder, Stevens & Clark mutual fund group. "So a cynic would say, 'Get people to focus on five-year numbers because your one-year numbers don't look very good.' "
In recent advertisements, most of the top mutual fund houses have indeed begun to emphasize long-term objectives and performance records.
"Fidelity knows that outstanding performance doesn't just happen overnight," says a recent advertisement by Fidelity Investments. "That's why we manage over $40 billion in stock fund assets for long-term results." The Twentieth Century Investors chimes in, "Guess who has two of the three top-ranked funds for long-term performance?" And the Franklin Growth Fund urges customers to "consider an investment which has the potential to grow with your long-term needs."
But some mutual fund innovations do go beyond advertising copy. The Genesis Fund, a Neuberger & Berman mutual fund specializing in the stocks of smaller companies, has recently run advertisements that warn, "We discourage short-term investments in Genesis Fund."
That discouragement comes in the only form Wall Street truly respects: a 2 percent penalty on investors who withdraw from the fund in less than a year.
The notion of an impatience tax is not new. It appeared after the 1987 crash, when some mutual-fund families imposed extra exit fees to drive away "market timers," those who try to profit from each spasm in the market by shifting their money among mutual funds. But in a novel twist, amounts taken from those who quickly cash out of the Genesis Fund are not kept as a management fee but go back into the fund for the benefit of all remaining shareholders.
Stanley Egener, president of the Neuberger & Berman Management Company, said a key reason for the penalty was that the fund's portfolio of smaller stocks lacked great liquidity or the ability to absorb sudden binges of buying or selling without sharp price movements. With small-capitalization stocks, Mr. Egener said, "you just don't want the hot money." Patience is essential if small-company investors are to avoid selling into a panic or buying during a boom, he added.
Mr. Loudon of Scudder, Stevens & Clark said his firm asked clients who too frequently zipped in and out of its funds to take their business elsewhere. The last decade rewarded debt, the fuel that fed the takeover engines, he continued; the coming decade is more likely to reward financial strength and stability.
"We're early in the development of this phenomonon," Mr. Loudon said. "But we all realize that the 1990's will be very different from the 1980's."
 
 General Illiquidity

Illiquidity affects other high-profile investments besides small stocks these days. Unlike the "rumor stocks" of the last decade, which could soar on whispers of possible takeovers, many of today's investment options simply do not offer overnight profits.
Distressed securities -- the stocks, bonds, notes and other obligations of financially weak or bankrupt companies -- are expected to be popular with money managers in the years ahead. But shaky stocks and defaulted bonds may be caught for years in the bankruptcy process before investors can reap any rewards. And the market for distressed securities remains small and illiquid, where trades must be made slowly and gracefully to avoid huge price swings.
The Wall Street professionals who are marketing these bankruptcy-based investments to pension funds and other institutional investors preach a message that differs from the quick-buck sales pitches of the past: Don't invest, they say, unless you're prepared to stay the course for years before you can collect your profits.
 
 Interest in Unit Trusts

There are some subtle shifts in the treatment of individual investors as well. Brokerage houses are seeing renewed interest in tax-exempt unit investment trusts, first marketed back in the 1960's.
Unlike a tax-exempt mutual fund, whose manager is paid a yearly fee and can alter the portfolio as he sees fit, a unit trust is essentially a fixed package of municipal bonds with a high entry fee but no continuing management expense. It appeals primarily to investors who favor a buy-and-hold strategy. In the first two months of 1991, purchases were up nearly 60 percent over the corresponding period last year, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Some firms are experimenting with new ways to pay their retail brokers, pegging compensation to the value of assets in a customer's account, rather than to the amount of the customer's trading. This approach, if widely adopted, would make Wall Street's commitment to long-term investment goals more credible, since brokers would no longer be tempted to encourage short-term strategies for the sake of higher commissions.
 
 Fewer Bargains in Stocks

The need to invest clients' money even after a run-up in stocks also moves Wall Street to take the longer view. In the last six months, portfolio managers who traditionally buy only bargain-priced stocks were flooded with fresh cash, invested by people eager to get into the booming market.
But as money flowed in, there were few bargain-priced stocks to be had. Some of these managers privately predict much longer waits to reap the kind of gains on their recent, expensive purchases than they are accustomed to getting on cheaper stocks.
Many investors have become long-term market participants by necessity, as the recession and real estate slump have put quick profits out of reach.
Those with huge sums in real estate, through mortgage bonds or shares in real estate holding companies, must either postpone their paydays or give up a chunk of their anticipated profits. Likewise, shareholders in some troubled banks now realize they must ride out the storm in the financial system before they can bail out at a profit.
The recession further reduces Wall Street's hopes for quick returns, said Richard Linowes, assistant professor of management at the Kogod College of Business Administration at the American University.
"The recession has been sobering but helpful in the long term," Professor Linowes said, referring to Wall Street firms. "It has led to revising the investment philosophy of their investors. There is a push toward more prudent investments of long-term value."
If this shift in mood turns out to be more than a matter of advertising, a recent study confirms that Wall Street could become not only more civilized but also more profitable. While it is widely held that stocks offer higher returns than less-risky investments like bonds, the study shows that short-term investors have a much lower chance of collecting these premium returns than those who are more patient.
"We've come off a period in the 80's when the returns were so fantastic, that it seems inconceivable to suggest that equities would give you lousy returns over a one-year period," said Martin Liebowitz, a managing director at Salomon Brothers. "But that is the case."
 
 Study of Investor Options

In a study he wrote with his Salomon colleague, Stanley Kogelman, Mr. Liebowitz examined the options open to investors who want to be nearly certain of earning at least 3 percent on their money.
The study showed that those with a one-year investment horizon would be ill advised to put more than 30 percent of their portfolios into stocks, which are relatively volatile. This allocation would be very low by Wall Street standards. But those willing to invest for five years could profitably place up to 85 percent in stocks, reaping higher, long-term returns.
In effect, the Salomon Brothers study found, short-term buyers of risky investments, including common stocks, are like workers who take on risky jobs but quit just before becoming vested in a generous pension plan meant to offset those risks.
"It is really kind of surprising how badly this volatility can bite you over the short term," Mr. Liebowitz said. "If you want to capture the premium returns offered by stocks, the longer the time period over which you invest, the higher the likelihood that you will realize the fruits of that investment."

A new study by Salomon Brothers shows that the stock market, which can be risky for the short-term investor, is more reliable over the long term. How much can investors allocate to stocks if they want to be 90 percent certain of earning at least 3 percent on their investments? The answer depends on investment horizons.

HEADLINE: Spending and Learning;
Money's Role Questioned in Schools Debate

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
Five years ago Samuel Billups, principal of Walbrook High School in Baltimore, took a hard look at his school and winced. Test scores were low and students, in his words, "came out not really prepared for anything."
So he created a small school within his high school, with much more teacher attention to students and a stripped-down curriculum. Now those students' test scores, grades, attendance and motivation are soaring. 
 The total price tag: $125,000 over four years to retrain and inspire teachers, plus a little more for new books.
Walbrook High's experience goes to the heart of a central issue facing American education today: Is money the key to improving schools? The answer continues to polarize those who would revamp American education.
Saying "dollar bills don't educate students," President Bush did not offer many when he outlined his strategy two weeks ago for fixing American schools. Without changes in the way schools work, his advisers argue, more money will accomplish little.
 
Advice for Budgets
 Clearly, money alone is no panacea. Spending on education has steadily risen over the last decade; scores have not. Many successful private and parochial schools pay teachers less and spend less on students than public schools. Swollen public school bureaucracies absorb money before it reaches the classroom.
But it is also evident that there are changes that money can buy. Many educators and politicians say Mr. Bush should have sought much more money to fight the poverty and family disintegration that overwhelm many schools, to help prepare poorer students for school and keep them on track once they get there, and to reduce the gap between rich and poor schools.
Those like Mr. Billups who have actually saved failing schools offer this perspective: Spend money to retrain teachers, reduce class size and buy new technology; save money by reducing educational bureaucracy and eliminating, if economy demands it, electives and extracurricular activities.
"I like to say this about school improvement," Mr. Billups said. "Design the Cadillac, although you end up buying the Ford."
Critics of American schools from President Bush down like to cite a damning statistic: Spending on education increased by 33 percent after inflation in the 1980's, without any marked improvement in American schools.
"In general the educators would have you believe that the only thing that really makes a difference is money," said Marc S. Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a research institute that advocates overhauling schools. "There's an increasing crowd of people out there who say, 'Wait a minute; we have been putting out more and more money and we don't see a change in the results.' And they're right."
But many educators argue, and Mr. Tucker agrees, that such statistics do not account for the fact that today many more students are coming to school poorer, worse-prepared and speaking less English than in the past few decades. Immigration rates soared nationwide in the 1980's, as did poverty rates.
Take the Rochester school district. The percentage of students who arrive in kindergarten testing well below average has leaped to 53 percent, from 23 percent, in 20 years, district statistics show. The number of students speaking limited English doubled from 1986 to 1990, and the number of poor children, those who qualified for free or reduced-price lunches, tripled in the 1980's.
 
<Looking for Links
 Debates on whether money helps tend to get bogged down because of the competing statistics and studies. If per-pupil expenditures are measured, the United States is among the top spenders on education internationally; yet it falls near the bottom if the studies measure education spending by a percentage of national income.
The same arguments swirl around research studies that try to trace the connection between spending and student performance. In one widely cited paper, Eric A. Hanushek of the University of Rochester reviewed 187 studies and found no consistent statistical links between teacher salaries, smaller classes and high-scoring students.
Educators reply that most studies do not factor in teachers' abilities and attitudes. Instead, they point to a study of 900 Texas school districts serving two million children by Ronald F. Ferguson of John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Mr. Ferguson factored in teacher quality, measured by how well teachers scored on required state tests. He found that higher teacher salaries attracted better-qualified teachers, who in turn produced students who scored higher in tests.
But, Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said, that means good teachers can produce dramatic results with smaller classes, while a teacher who simply uses the same methods for a small class as a large one will not.
As director of the Coalition of Essential Schools, a network of about 150 schools that aim to raise intellectual standards through innovative teaching, Theodore R. Sizer has watched schools make broad improvements, and he, too, said that regardless of how much was spent "none of that is worth a hill of beans unless teachers think differently."
 
The Budgets
Fat Public Schools, Lean Church Ones
The real question, even the severest critics of current education spending agree, is not whether money makes any difference, but where and how well it is being spent.
"This does not say that there aren't some situations in which money is very effective," Mr. Hanushek of the University of Rochester said, "because there are. This says, we can't guess beforehand whether the money will be used effectively or not. The way we run schools now, just providing more money is not going to assure us of better success."
Among the chief culprits, critics argue, are money-eating educational bureaucracies and a web of Federal, state and local regulations.
Compare the public and parochial schools. With fewer bureaucrats and lower-paid teachers, many Roman Catholic schools turn out students who often score higher than public school students on standardized tests.
In New York City, for example, Catholic schools spend about $1,200 on each pupil, as against $7,107 in the public schools. Catholic school teachers in the Bronx earn about $22,000 a year, said Nora Murphy, director of public relations for the Archdiocese of New York's education department. Public school teachers in District 11, in the northeast Bronx, earn, on average, $37,500, said the district superintendent, Frank Arricale.
One reason the salaries in the Catholic schools are lower is that teacher turnover there is higher than in the public schools, leading to more teachers who are newer and are paid less.
District 11, which serves mostly middle-class and working-class students, has one of the smallest district offices in New York, but it still has 16 officials, Dr. Arricale said. They include a budget director, a business manager, a director and assistant director of mathematics and directors of special education, language arts, early childhood programs and programs for gifted students.
 
Heavy on Bureaucracy
 And, to make sure the district obeys all the regulations from Federal, state and city governments, the superintendent has a director of compliance and a director of funded programs.
Most of the 32 school districts in New York City have similar, if not larger, staffs. And supervising them are 3,930 central Board of Education employees.
By contrast, just 33 people oversee the entire network of Catholic schools in New York City. There is no separate district office for the Bronx. Every Catholic school hires its own teachers, and every parish hires its own principal. The same types of jobs are filled as in each public school district, but with fewer layers of bureaucracy.
Private schools are not bound by the same government regulations as public schools, nor do they serve as diverse a group of students. About 100 of the 110,000 Catholic school students in New York City are in small special-education programs, Ms. Murphy said. Catholic schools lack the resources to educate the severely handicapped students whom public schools are required to serve, she added, and, therefore, they do not accept them.
On the other hand, New York City, which has nearly one million students in its public schools, spent an average of $16,746 last year on each of its 119,838 special-education students.
 
Spending Outside the Classroom
 Custodians, often among the highest-paid employees of the public school system, are not unionized in the city's Catholic schools and thus earn less. Public schools are required to provide transportation for students who live a certain distance away and to bus students to desegregate schools. For Catholic schools, providing transportation is an individual decision; some do and some do not.
"A mass educational system is expensive," Dr. Arricale said.
But it is clear that in public schools a far higher percentage of money goes to bureaucracy than it does in private ones. Almost half of all money spent in public schools goes for expenses other than those in the classroom; only 58.5 percent of their budgets in 1988-89 went directly to teacher salaries, benefits and classroom supplies, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Food services, interscholastic athletics and other non-instructional services made up 4.4 percent of school budgets. "Support services," which include attendance officers, guidance counselors, psychologists, librarians, administration, transportation, maintenance and data processing, took 33.6 percent.
"Each expenditure taken in isolation is defensible," said Chester E. Finn Jr., a critic of American schools who was a chief architect of Mr. Bush's education strategy. "But what does it say about our priorities?
"Teachers in so many classrooms spend their own money for supples. What a normal person would think to spend money on is first the teacher and then the instructional materials."
Many educators, including Mr. Shanker, the union leader, argue that schools should receive most of the education money directly and then buy various services from the central bureaucracy as needed, like advice on counseling or curriculum. In his Texas study, Mr. Ferguson found that districts that spent the most money directly on instruction produced the highest-scoring students.
Cumbersome bureaucracies are one reason a new crop of education reformers is endorsing "school-based management," where individual schools, not central bureaucracies, wield power.
 
The Wish Lists
Serving the Poor Leads Agenda
If schools pare bureaucracies and reorganize to spend money more effectively, where would money buy the most effective change?
Everyone in education has a long wish list. Mr. Finn, for example, would spend money on longer school days, a longer school year and sophisticated new tests to measure what students know. Almost everyone would buy more technology.
The most urgent and persistent calls for money come from the hard-pressed districts that serve the poorest children. Few would argue that educating disadvantaged children costs more, for services that include remedial tutoring, special education, guidance counselors, social workers and psychologists.
City schools must usually pay more for land, school construction, maintenance, discipline, attendance programs to combat truancy and busing for desgregation, said Carol Ascher of the ERIC Clearinghouse on Urban Education at Columbia University.
Many educators and politicians argue that Mr. Bush should call for dramatic increases in spending on demonstrably successful Federal programs that now only reach a fraction of eligible children. These include Head Start, which prepares needy preschoolers for kindergarten, and Chapter I, which offers tutoring and remedial education to poor children.
Others, like Arthur E. Wise, an expert on school finance, say the Federal Government must act to even the odds between rich and poor school districts. A walk into a poor school will find children using long-outdated textbooks and gymnasiums for classrooms. Wealthy suburban districts, by contrast, have well-equipped classrooms, well-paid teachers and a wide array of courses.
Critics like Mr. Finn say such arguments beg the familiar question:Without fundamental change in the schools that serve the children of the poor, will any new money be well spent?
While these debates continue, educators who have actually turned schools around can offer advice based on experience: Invest in teachers and smaller classes, be creative in reorganizing schools to spread the available money around, and cut out extras.
 
The Success Stories
Baltimore Adapts, As Does Harlem
The changes at Walbrook High in Baltimore show what money can buy, what it cannot and what happens when it runs out.
Mr. Billups, the principal, spent the money he had on retraining teachers to build a shared vision of where the school should go and to help teachers learn the best ways to get there. He used $125,000 raised from local foundations to convene summer training institutes for a core group of educators.
For inspiration, he looked to the Coalition for Essential Schools, based at Brown University. He sent teachers to Brown's campus in Providence, R.I., invited the coalition's director, Mr. Sizer, to Baltimore and brought in students so teachers could test how to apply their new ideas to actual classroom situations.
Other changes that Mr. Billups instituted cost no money at all. He established a school within a school, initially serving 125 of the school's 2,000 students. There teachers taught as teams, consulting daily about students, curriculum and teaching methods. He rearranged class schedules so teachers could have joint planning time. And he offered only one elective a year, allowing students to study a few core subjects in depth.
 
Much Still to Do
 Because of budget constraints, Mr. Billups was not able to do all he wanted to do. The mini-school grew slowly, but next year he plans to include the entire school. He could not afford to hire extra teachers to reduce the student load; instead of limiting each teacher to a total of 80 students so teachers would have more time to assign and discuss demanding homework, Mr. Billups' teachers have 116 students each. In order to buy more textbooks for academic courses, he had to reduce spending for band equipment and vocational courses.
"If you know your money is limited, you're careful of what you buy," Mr. Billups said. "Most of what I bought was teachers' time. We never would have gotten this off the ground had it not been for dedicated teachers."
While Mr. Billups is working on changing an existing school on a tight budget, Deborah Meier founded and directs three new public schools in East Harlem by adding some foundation money onto the public school money she receives.
Her Central Park East schools have won nationwide acclaim. Money is best spent, she said, on training teachers and keeping schools and classes small. She spends extra money on weekend retreats for teachers, to allow them to think about school goals and curriculum.
Ms. Meier's schools also show it costs more money to reach children who are poor or who have troubled families. She pays extra to keep schools open late so children have a quiet place to do homework and can consult with teachers. And she employs a school-family coordinator to handle family problems that hurt students' performance.
The success of Ms. Meier's approach has been seen in lower dropout rates and higher scores in reading and other tests.
Her elementary school costs no more to operate than other alternative public elementary schools, primarily because she was able to attract teachers who share her philosophy. But the high school, where she said she has had to work harder to define the school vision and train teachers, costs an additional $150,000 a year.
To compensate for the extra money spent on teachers and smaller class sizes, Mr. Sizer suggests that schools merge departments and eliminate many electives like vocational education.
In the end, educators say, the argument about spending comes down to this paradox: Spending more money without change is wasting money, but without more money can there be substantial change?
"The folks who say more money will not do the job are right, on one level," said Phillip Schlechty, an educator who is working to transform schools in Louisville, Ky.
"If all we do is give more money to the present system," he said, "we'll do what we've always done and we'll get what we've always got. Without more money committed to development, we can't change the system. So we have to find ways to target money at doing different things."

The Economy
Payroll jobs fell in April, but at a much reduced pace, the Labor Department said, and the unemployment rate edged down 0.2 point, to 6.6 percent. Over all, analysts said, the figures point to an economy that seems to be approaching its low point, while probably not yet starting to recover from recession. But they cautioned that the decline in the unemployment rate, the first in almost a year, was probably an aberration. [Page 1.] 
 Sales of vehicles made in the U.S. and Canada fell 21.4 percent in late April, deflating industry hopes for a quick rebound. [33.]
The State of Maryland and the Government of Kuwait signed an agreement to give Maryland companies an advantage in the competition to win contracts to rebuild the sheikdom. [6.]
 
Companies
The civil settlement in the Exxon Valdez disaster fell apart, and Alaskan and U.S. officials said they expected to go to court to extract even more than $1 billion from Exxon. [1.]
The Navy picked Electric Boat to build a $2 billion attack submarine. General Dynamics, Electric Boat's parent, had said that without the contract it would close the Groton, Conn., shipyard. [33.]
Philip Morris plans to introduce Marlboro Medium, a version of Marlboro cigarettes that has tar and nicotine levels between those of the regular and light versions. [33.]
RJR Nabisco Holdings is taking another big step to reduce the cost of history's most expensive leveraged buyout. It will buy back more than $1.8 billion in high-interest debt. [35.]
CS Holding has cut its dividend by nearly a third and announced plans to sell a 20 percent stake in Credit Suisse. The harsh measures followed a 1990 loss of $587 million at CS First Boston. [34.]
Most anonymous Swiss bank accounts will be abolished, the Government has decided. [34.]
Many of the world's big technology companies want to compete with Intermagnetics, the leading independent supplier of products based on superconductivity. [33.]
Tele-Communications, A.T. &T. and U S West will test whether cable subscribers want expanded pay-per-view services. [35.]
Mitsubishi will buy a one-third interest in Volvo's Dutch operations for $120 million. [35.]
Abraham & Straus will close its store in Hempstead, L.I., and will open a new one in Garden City. [26.]
 
Markets
Long-term interest rates soared as prices of Treasury bonds plunged amid confusion stemmig from outwardly conflicting Government employment data for April. The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds plunged almost a point. [33.]
Wall Street's fascination with a fast buck seems to be cooling. Brokerages and mutual funds are counseling patience, telling clients to invest for the long term. [33.]
The stock market had a tough time deciding what to do. After a choppy day that sent the Dow Jones industrial average rising and falling, the Dow ended about where it began -- ahead 0.25, to 2,938.86. It gained 26.48 for the week. [36.]
The dollar advanced on world currency markets, bolstered by the employment report. Gold prices declined. [42.]
Copper futures prices settled at their lowest level in three months amid signs of growing stockpiles. [42.]

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Upbeat or Down?

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
At home, the Bush Administration is singing one tune about the economic outlook; but abroad, it's following another melody. To Americans out of jobs or looking for customers, Washington is predicting a quick upturn; but to the the Group of Seven nations, it's pleading a need for action to stimulate economic growth.
 The optimistic domestic message is not surprising. Economic recovery is a slow process, and George Bush does not want to find himself still presiding over a recession deep into the election year 1992. The more confidence in the economy that he and his aides can instill in consumers and businessmen, the more likely they are to buy and invest and get things moving again. 
 The independent Federal Reserve obviously has been acting on the assumption that the recession is not over and that the economy still needs stimulation. It has just reduced the discount rate (what it charges banks for loans) by a half-point and the Federal funds rate (what banks charge each other for short-term loans) by a quarter-point. The major banks got the message and quickly followed with a cut from 9 to 8 1/2 percent in the prime rate.
 These concrete actions are in notable contrast to repeated statements of optimism from the Administration and from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, suggesting that the recession will be short and shallow, with recovery beginning this summer. Even on top of the Federal Reserve rate cuts, the Fed professed to see scattered signs that the low point is near.
 Despite a slight improvement in April unemployment figures, less sanguine observers may find those signs hard to discern in the decline, in March, of 7 of the 11 components in the Government's primary forecasting index. The overall index did rise slightly but only because of an increase in consumer expectations at the end of the Persian Gulf war -- an increase that later surveys showed to be short-lived.
 Some analysts are not certain, anyway, that lower interest rates will be enough to bring the economy out of a recession that is beginning to look as if it will be more severe and long-lasting than Washington, at least, has been predicting. They believe that the recession is attributable to numerous factors other than high interest rates, and that relatively minor reductions in those rates, while helpful, will not do the job.
 Unemployment, though it declined from 6.8 to 6.6 percent in the latest survey, continues to be a worrisome problem. Companies everywhere are laying off workers; General Dynamics, for instance, announced big layoffs this week, despite its participation in a new Air Force fighter plane contract.
 But unemployment is less affected by high interest rates than by low consumer demand, which in turn depresses employers' willingness to maintain, much less expand, production and work forces. The Administration appears to be relying, however, entirely on Federal Reserve rate cuts for countercyclical action.
 Treasury Secretary Brady, meanwhile, sang the Administration's overseas melody at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington. He argued that Britain, Japan, France, Italy, Canada and particularly Germany needed to cut interest rates and stimulate growth, lest the world slip into economic stagnation. Not least among his concerns, and properly so, are U.S. exports; slumping economies elsewhere would mean declining U.S. ability to sell products abroad; that, in turn, would contribute to a longer and deeper U.S. recession.
 This argument apparently was undercut, however, by Mr. Brady's contradictory singing of the Administration's domestic tune -- that the U.S. recession is coming to an end and recovery is about to begin. At least partially because of these conflicting themes, he got nowhere in his efforts to bring about lower rates in Germany and Europe -- although some experts see the possibility that the Japanese might soon lower theirs.
 But if actions speak louder than words, even in Washington, the Fed's interest-rate reductions and Mr. Brady's futile appeals to the Group of Seven can only mean that the Administration is more concerned about the economy than it's willing to admit to American voters.

Try Volunteer Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Julia Carlisle describes New York's newest subculture, the "Young, Privileged and Unemployed" (Op-Ed, April 4). The economy's dip and concurrent unemployment, particularly of those educated and trained, should be viewed as temporary, which may be of little solace to those trying to pay rent. But for those young people filled with energy, enthusiasm and work drive, a partial solution to inactivity would be involvement in volunteer work. 
 We at the Volunteer Referral Center were surprised, then delighted, to see how many young professionals come to our office to learn about volunteer opportunities. Volunteering allows individuals to keep up their skills while waiting to be re-employed and offers an opportunity to investigate a career change.

HEADLINE: Submarine Job Won by Dynamics

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
In a political and economic duel between New England and Virginia, the Navy today named Electric Boat of Connecticut to build its next $2 billion attack submarine.
 Electric Boat, a General Dynamics Corporation division in Groton, Conn., was awarded $614.7 million to build the submarine itself. The balance will go to the vessel's nuclear reactor, weapons and other components. 
General Dynamics had said that without the contract for the vessel, it would close the Groton shipyard -- the nation's largest submarine builder and Connecticut's second-largest employer -- by the late 1990's and eliminate 22,000 jobs.
 
Job Cuts Still Planned
 In a sign of declining military budgets that have sharply pared the Pentagon's weapons orders, General Dynamics said that even with today's award, 10,000 jobs would still be cut at the Electric Boat division in the next five years because of dwindling submarine business. It said earlier this week that it would eliminate 27,000 jobs companywide over four years from its total work force of 90,000.
 The high-stakes battle for the second Seawolf-class submarine -- Electric Boat is building the first -- was cast as a region's economic survival against maintaining diversity in the nation's military industrial base.
 While Electric Boat relies solely on submarine building and overhaul, its rival, the Newport News shipyard in Virginia, also builds the Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and was viewed by industry analysts as the less vulnerable of the only two shipyards that build submarines in the United States.
 
With the Aid of Experience
 Industry analysts said Electric Boat's experience in building the first Seawolf allowed it to underbid its competitor, a Tenneco Inc. subsidiary, for the same submarine design.
 The Navy made the announcement after the close of stock market trading. Earlier, on the New York Stock Exchange, General Dynamics shares had risen 62.5 cents, to $39, while Tenneco's had risen 37.5 cents, to $44.
 "General Dynamics had the edge and the bottom line was that the program went to the low-cost bidder," said Howard A. Rubel, a senior vice president at C. J. Lawrence Inc. in New York.
 A Navy spokesman, Lieut. Phillip McGuinn, said that after reviewing both proposals for technical ability, industrial base and price, "the key determinant was price."
 Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee and a former Navy Secretary, said Electic Boat's bid was $80 million to $90 million lower. But he said the award threatened to undermine what competition remained in the American submarine-building business.
 The Navy's decision stirred both euphoria and relief at the Groton yard, and at General Dynamics headquarters in St. Louis. Last month, the Air Force awarded a contract to a team including General Dynamics to build a new generation of radar-evading fighter planes.
 
'Obviously, We're Delighted'
 "Obviously, we're delighted," said a General Dynamics spokesman, Peter Connolly. "The fact we won was from a combination of the capabilities at the boatyard and the economic arguments we marshaled for our case."
 In Virginia, the mood was predictably downcast as today's award gave Electric Boat a leg up on future bids for Seawolf models.
 "I am extremely disappointed since we made our best possible bid," the chief executive of Newport News and Shipbuilding, Edward J. Campbell, said in a statement. "The loss of that contract will put us at a competitive disadvantage for any follow-on ships in the Seawolf class."
 Mr. Campbell said the shipyard's large backlog and normal attrition would not require the company to eliminate any jobs through 1992. He said the shipyard would reduce hiring immediately to reduce the possibility of layoffs in the future.
 
Review Is Requested
 Senator Warner asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to do a "detailed review of the entire acquisition process" used in the Seawolf competition.
 His actions today were just the latest salvo in what has been a bitterly partisan political fight over jobs.
 Both Electric Boat and Newport News developed the same submarine: a quieter, deeper-diving sub than the existing model, with 40 percent more missiles and torpedoes. The only question was which shipyard would build them.
 Electric Boat won a competition with Newport News several years ago to build the first Seawolf under a $726 million contract. The Navy had originally intended to buy three or four Seawolfs a year and split the business between Electric Boat and Newport News.
 Even after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney reduced the Pentagon's submarine orders to one a year, the Navy was still expected to award the second order to Newport News to promote competition and, in theory, get the best value for the taxpayer.
 But at one only ship a year, it no longer made economic sense to maintain two shipyards for the limited work.
 
A Shortage of Work
 "We need to honestly face the fact that long-term procurement of one submarine per year will not sustain both submarine construction yards," H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, the Secretary of the Navy, told a Congressional committee several weeks ago.
 With regional studies showing a virtual collapse in the southeastern Connecticut economy without the Groton work, Connecticut's Congressional delegation and Electric Boat executives had a final decision on the contract delayed to analyze the effect of a shrinking submarine fleet on the two shipyards and the competitive bidding process.
 In the meantime, Donald Yockey, the Pentagon's top civilian procurement official, ordered the Navy to award the contract on the basis of "overall cost and technical approach."
 Mr. Yockey seemed to disregard language Senator Warner had inserted last year in several military spending bills requiring the Navy to follow a "competitive acquisition strategy," even if it meant awarding the contract to a higher bidder.

HEADLINE: THE KURDS: IN FLIGHT, ONCE AGAIN

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman; Clyde Haberman, the Rome bureau chief for The Times, has covered the Kurds' flight from Iraq.

 BODY:
AMONG THE REFUGEES huddled on the mountains between Iraq and Turkey, an old saying could be heard again and again: The Kurds have no friends. It was uttered so often among the wretched thousands fleeing Iraq that it became a frayed cliche. But cliches develop because they are at least in part true: over the decades, few peoples have wound up on the short end so consistently as these champions of failed rebellions against central authority. Perhaps no ethnic group so large has gone so long without a homeland.
There are many more Kurds than Israelis and Palestinians combined, yet until now they have received only a tiny fraction of the attention on front pages and television screens. Maybe, some Kurdish leaders say bitterly, it is because they have never believed that the rest of the world had to suffer for their unhappiness. No one has ever heard of a Kurd taking Western hostages, or shooting innocent people at airports, or hijacking an airplane. 
 Now the world's attention is on the Kurds. But their hopes remain as elusive as ever. To refer to Kurdistan is to talk about a country that never existed. It is such an improbable goal that Kurdish calls for independence have become rare, except from a guerrilla band that has been fighting a nasty insurgency to carve out a separate Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Most Kurds would settle for increased autonomy and improved economic development in countries where they have sunk toward the bottom of the wage scale.
In mass exodus from Iraq, they faced the gravest crisis in their long history. This was hardly the first time that Kurds have taken flight after a lost cause. But the numbers -- an estimated 1.5 million or more -- were of Old Testament proportions, accompanied by plague and death on a scale rarely seen even in this century of endless horror.
For weeks, an appalled world watched the Kurds' ordeal and wondered if they would make it. Thousands died, many of them children and old people, and thousands more are likely to follow unless a rescue operation led by the United States succeeds quickly, an endeavor that includes the delicate decision, joined by Britain and France, to move troops into northern Iraq to build protected refugee camps there.
Ten days ago, Baghdad promised enhanced Kurdish autonomy. But many Kurds say Iraq is the last place they want to go while Saddam Hussein holds power. They do not even want to stay in Turkey, where Kurds have endured frequent repression and are among the country's poorest people. Most have their eyes on Western Europe and the United States. But the West, for all the loud clucking over the poor Kurds, is hardly throwing its doors open. The refugees are stuck. They cannot move forward, yet they cannot cling indefinitely to the inhospitable mountainsides. Before long, it would seem, a way will have to be found of luring them back to their Iraqi homes, which is one aim of the allied plan to put up guarded enclaves in northern Iraq. The Kurds' fear is that if they return now, they will be forgotten sooner or later. Probably sooner. They have experienced Western amnesia before.

WHILE NUMBERS are hazy, a widely accepted estimate is that there are 20 million Kurds, living in a territory about the size of Nebraska and cutting a wide swath across Iran, Iraq and Turkey, which by itself contains about half the Kurdish population. In each of those countries, they are in the minority. There are also smaller communities in Syria and the Soviet Union.
They are mostly Sunni Muslims of Indo-European stock, clustered into rivalrous clans and probably descended, historians say, from Aryan tribes that settled west of the Caspian Sea some 4,000 years ago. By the seventh century, the word "Kurd" had come into being to describe these people. They had their own language, although it was, and is, fragmented into so many dialects that there is no common tongue for all Kurds. They have their own poets, their own cuisine and their own heroes, who include Saladin, the great 12th-century sultan who fought nobly against Christian crusaders. It irritates more than a few Kurds that Saddam Hussein has wrapped himself in the mantle of Saladin, right down to ordering portraits of himself astride a white charger.
Over the years, the Kurds have come to be romanticized in the West as a race of noble warriors. Romantic notions are easy to come by with Kurds. One reason is that so many of them are blessed with startling good looks. And there is the understandable instinct to root for the underdog. But the Kurds have often been brigands and mercenaries, hiring themselves out to whichever regional power suited their purpose at the moment. Often they choose sides unwisely, and then must pay a terrible price when the winner comes to exact revenge.
That is what happened in one of the great Kurdish debacles of recent days; in 1988, 60,000 of them fled the Iraqi Army, claiming that their villages had been attacked with chemical weapons. That time, Hussein was paying back Iraqi pesh mergas -- the durable resistance fighters whose name means "those who face death" -- for helping Iran during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
Past Kurdish migrations after failed uprisings in Iraq tended to be top-heavy with farmers and shepherds, who form the backbone of the pesh mergas. There are plenty of pesh mergas this time, too. But there is also a heavy sprinkling of engineers, physicians, lawyers, managers and teachers -- city people who are unaccustomed to combat and even less to the harsh vagaries of the mountains that separate Iraq from Turkey. Their presence underlines the remarkable nature of this migration, for it means that nearly half of Iraq's Kurds got up and walked.

THE KURDS' DREAMS ARE anyone's dreams. "We want to send our children to school and have enough money to bring them to the doctor," a grizzled nomad told William Coupon, whose photographs of the Kurds of southeastern Turkey appear in these pages. The problem, he said, is that the Turkish military has taken over too much Kurdish land, making it difficult to grind out a living.
One shepherd was no different from young men anywhere. "I spend most of my life walking, but I prefer a Mercedes-Benz," he said. "I don't want to be a shepherd anymore." But then, in a reference to President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, he touched on a politically sensitive point: the great gaps in wealth between Kurds and the larger society. "Ozal has 10 Mercedeses," he said. "But we don't even have a donkey."
These people would not give their names. They felt that they had to trade candor for anonymity, even though they said nothing terribly provocative. Who was to say that Turkish soldiers would not knock on their doors one day to interrogate them? That sense of repression is the unhappy daily reality for Kurds in all the countries they inhabit.
Oddly enough, Turkey, the only nation in the region that can call itself a democracy, has often been least hospitable to the Kurds. The Turks do not even recognize their estimated 8 million to 10 million Kurds as an official minority, a status conferred on much smaller populations of Armenians, Greeks and Jews. Until the last few years, it was considered dangerous for newspapers even to use the word "Kurd"; instead, they spoke of "mountain Turks."
"How happy is he who calls himself a Turk," read banners stretched across the streets of Kurdish cities and towns in the southeast.
Education in any of the Kurdish dialects is banned. In 1983, as a military junta yielded to civilian rule, it passed laws forbidding Kurds to speak their language in public or to play their traditional songs. As recently as last fall, a popular singer was investigated by the police after singing a Kurdish song at a wedding.
Now many Turks call such restrictions self-defeating, especially since they are generally ignored. All they accomplish, critics say, is to make Turkey's splotchy human-rights record look even worse than it is. A few weeks ago, at Ozal's insistence, Parliament finally modified the ban on spoken Kurdish, although books and newspapers written in that language remain strictly forbidden.
Even that relatively small advance required serious arm-twisting by the Turkish President, who encountered stiff resistance from nationalist elements within his own party. Their objections were rooted less in racism than in a sincere foot-in-the-door fear that yielding on language rights today will lead inexorably to separatist demands tomorrow. That is not considered wild paranoia in Turkey, which is still seared by memories of the country's dismemberment after World War I. To many Turks, the guerrilla war waged in the southeast by the separatist Kurdish Workers Party -- an insurgency that has taken more than 2,500 lives since it began in 1984 -- presents a clear and present danger to national security.
In that regard, one could argue that the roughly four million Kurds in Iraq have fared better. At least the Iraqis can say that their Kurds have long been allowed to speak their own language. In 1970, Baghdad went so far as to offer a measure of autonomy to the Kurdish regions of northern Iraq, and did so again last week, in principle. But autonomy has always looked better on paper than in reality. The 1970 program never had teeth, and it is safe to say that, in terms of physical abuse, Iraqi Kurds have suffered more than any other.
In Iran, the dominant Shiite Muslims distrust the Kurds and their more secular approach to religion. Syria refuses to give many of its 900,000 Kurds full citizenship. In the Soviet Union, there are only about 300,000 of them, and they are considered of scant importance.
But in Iraq, the Kurds rank among the most tested victims of this brutal century, their repeated rebellions having led each time to savage suppression by Hussein's forces.
In the 1980's, Iraqi troops destroyed some 4,000 Kurdish villages in the northern oil centers of Kirkuk and Mosul, then resettled hundreds of thousands of people within the region or deported them to the south. They then moved Arabs into the north to dilute its Kurdish character.
All this was done in the name of giving Kurds new homes with plumbing and access to better schools and hospitals. In fact, it was a form of annihilation, one that was made explicit in 1988, when Hussein unleashed poison gas on Kurdish civilians, killing 5,000 of them in Halabja, near the Iranian border. That attack was to repay Kurdish guerrillas -- fighting under the rival banners of their two main leaders, Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani -- for helping Iran in its long war against Iraq. Later that year, Iraqi troops sent tens of thousands fleeing into Turkey. That time, too, the Kurds claimed they were hit with chemical weapons.

ONE PROBLEM FOR THE scattered Kurds is that they are generally seen as nuisances, except when they are useful as pawns. And they have often been willing accomplices in their own exploitation. Sometimes, all it takes to get a pesh merga to run off and fight is to put a rifle in his hands -- and even then the person he shoots may well be a fellow Kurd from an enemy clan.
A classic example of this exploitation came in the 1970's, when Iraq's Kurds put themselves at the service of the Shah of Iran. To strike at his enemy, Iraq, the Shah funneled arms and aid to pesh mergas loyal to the greatest Kurdish leader of this century, Mustafa Barzani, father of Massoud. In this clandestine operation, which began in 1974, the Shah had full support from the Nixon Administration. Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State, called the program "an instrument to dissuade Iraq from international adventurism."
But by 1975, the Shah had different priorities. He struck a deal with Iraq, agreeing to abandon the pesh mergas in exchange for a share of sovereignty over the vital Shatt al-Arab waterway leading to the Persian Gulf. Once again, nobody cared what happened to the Kurds. Suddenly defenseless against the Iraqi army, several hundred thousand of them fled to Iran for sanctuary; the Shah gave them at least that much. But when Mustafa Barzani tried to talk to Kissinger about thisbetrayal, the Secretary would not see him. Instead, he reminded intermediaries that "secret-service operations are not missionary work."
Given all the back-stabbings and self-inflicted wounds, any talk of a Kurdish state -- comparable, say, with the existing Jewish state or a future Palestinian state -- must be dismissed as a pipe dream. No country in the region would tolerate it. During the gulf war, Turkey warned that it would intervene militarily to prevent the rise of a Kurdistan. And Iraq is not about to give up Kurdish areas that account for one-third of its oil production.
Unfortunately for the Kurds, they showed up too late, and with too little firepower, when the region's maps were last redrawn, after World War I and the subsequent collapse of the Ottoman Empire. On one occasion, however, they did come tantalizingly close to winning a homeland.
That was in 1920. There had already been a series of Kurdish rebellions for nearly a century, begun when the Persians and the Ottomans tried to centralize their fading empires and squeezed the Kurds in the process. In 1920, after the Ottomans finally crumbled, Western powers agreed, in the Treaty of Sevres, to create both a Kurdistan and an independent Armenia out of territory that forms what is now eastern Turkey.
But this arrangement was flatly rejected by Kemal Ataturk, the Turkish nationalist hero, who went on to suppress several uprisings and proved himself too strong militarily to be denied. In 1923, with the birth of the modern Turkish republic, the Treaty of Sevres was superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne, which offered the Turks far more favorable terms. Gone was any mention of Kurdistan or Armenia. There the matter has rested.
Considering their history of disillusion and failure, it seems remarkable in hindsight that the most recent Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq thought they could take on Saddam Hussein after his defeat in the gulf war, when he still retained significant military power. Then the United States sealed matters by announcing that this uprising was not its concern. Looking back, it is clear that the Kurds never had a chance, no matter how many Iraqi cities they managed to hold for a while.
So they took to the mountains yet again, this time in frighteningly large numbers. There they sit, awaiting word from their leaders, wondering if they will be able to return to their homes in safety, or whether they face yet another chapter in a long history of betrayal.

Even in Pinch-Penny Times, Silver Is Holding Its Own

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Is antique silver recession-proof?
"Nothing is recession-proof," said Michael Koopman, a London dealer, following last month's highly successful silver sales at Christie's and Sotheby's in Manhattan. "But silver seems to be holding its own rather well right now." 
 Mr. Koopman's assessment was echoed by other dealers, collectors and auctioneers, who said the auctions confirmed that the finest 18th-century English tureens and candlesticks have lost none of their luster for bidders during the economic downturn.
On April 18, Christie's realized the highest total ever for a single day of auctioning silver. In a sale of 371 works, 327 were sold for a total of $5.5 million -- eclipsing the $4.9 million paid at Christie's on Jan. 10 for silver from the collection of Imelda and Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines. On April 19, Sotheby's offered 331 items, of which 288 brought a total of $3.2 million, well above expectations.
Even more significant were the dramatic increases in the prices paid for silver made before or after the 18th century and in places other than London. With the supply of the highly coveted Georgian silver shrinking, the prices for 17th- and 19th-century English pieces have now escalated to new levels, along with those fetched by French and German silver produced from the 17th century on.
Of the 10 heftiest prices paid at the two houses, only two were for London-made silver, and both were pre-18th-century examples. A Chinese-styled bowl from 1688 was sold for $198,000 at Sotheby's to a British dealer, Jonathan Norton of S. J. Phillips, and a pair of baroque sconces from 1697 were bought by an unidentified buyer for $148,500. The remaining 10 items were French.
The sale's highest price was $561,000, seven times what Christie's had estimated. The buyer of this tour de force of the rococo style -- a ewer and basin covered with shells, leaves, swans and mermaids -- was a French dealer. Made in 1761 by Louis Samson 2d of Toulouse, the set was from a Philadelphia collection formed in the 1950's and 60's.
Why are people paying higher prices for silver?
"Silver prices never became excessive," Mr. Norton said. "Some of the pieces in these sales were exceptional, and there are more people today who can still spend a certain amount of money for such silver than there were a decade ago."
Mr. Norton paid $330,000 -- more than three times Sotheby's estimate -- for a French neo-Gothic clock, a rarity that he quickly sold to an unidentified American collector. The miniature tower, exquisitely crafted in silver, gilded silver and gold embellished with diamonds, semiprecious stones and enameled pictures, was designed by the Paris jeweler Lucien Falize in 1881.
Among other gilded silver objects that commanded high prices was a pair of Louis XVI candelabra with golden leaves, berry branches, scrolls and snakes that was bought for $264,000 at Christie's. And a Regence-styled 20th-century set of 446 gilded knives, forks and spoons by Puiforcat of Paris was sold for $132,000 -- four times Christie's expectations.
The pedigree of certain pieces also spurred bidding. A Louis XIV pitcher -- undecorated save for molding on the rim and the lobes on the base -- was sold for $159,500, six times Sotheby's estimate, to Mr. Norton. Two previous owners were David David-Weill, the San Francisco-born Paris investment banker and collector, who died in 1952, and, most recently, Henry Ford 2d.
Mr. Koopman of London, who paid $154,000 for a pair of Louis XVI candelabra and $132,000 for a set of four French candlesticks from 1788 -- both at Christie's -- explained why: "There hasn't been merchandise of this quality at auction for a year."
To Kevin Tierney, who heads Sotheby's silver department in New York, much of the success of these sales must be credited to the London dealers, who bought the majority of the important offerings. "They are still as strong as ever," he said of the dealers.
Christopher Hartop, who heads silver sales at Christie's in New York, said silver continues to be collected seriously despite increased problems of security and maintenance.
"The very rich have lots of servants anyway," he said. "And I can think of several serious collectors who buy silver and clean it themselves -- it is the one way to get to know silver."
Mr. Hartop said the energetic bidding at these sales makes him optimistic about the next test of the market -- the $5.3 million worth of English silver from the estate of Hilmar Reksten, a Norwegian shipowner, that is to be auctioned at Christie's in London on May 22.
Eric Shrubsole, a British-born Manhattan dealer, who paid $82,500 for a Georgian tea kettle, said good silver has always held its value. "From the day I arrived on these shores in 1936, I have never known the price of good silver to go down."

It's Not Just a Man's World for Blake Edwards

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
Blake Edwards has once again answered Henry Higgins's question -- "Why can't a woman be more like a man?" -- in ways that make the head spin. In Mr. Edwards's "Victor/Victoria" in 1982, a female singer posed as a female impersonator and thus had the effect of throwing his/her admirers into utter confusion. Now, in "Switch," Mr. Edwards presents a ladies' man whose death becomes the occasion for a celestial prank. As punishment for his transgressions, Steve (Perry King) is sent back to earth in the form of Amanda (Ellen Barkin), a long-haired, leggy blonde.
Mr. Edwards, whose 1989 comedy "Skin Deep" is best remembered for its glow-in-the-dark condom scene, is not inclined toward undue delicacy. So "Switch," in addition to showing what a hard time Amanda has adjusting to high heels, also finds her in amorous situations with a woman (Lorraine Bracco) and with Steve's own former best friend (Jimmy Smits). Mr. Edwards does not shy away from Amanda's curiosity about her anatomy or from her not caring how she sits while wearing a dress. No wonder that, as Mr. Edwards puts it, some aspects of his screenplay "made the men who were considering financing it cringe. It nailed 'em right to the wall." 
 Making "Switch," which opens Friday, meant testing the limits of audience tolerance when it comes to gender-bending humor, but that is what interested Mr. Edwards in the first place. "The behavioral aspect of things that separate men and women has always been of interest to me," said the 68-year-old film maker, speaking from his Culver City, Calif., office. Citing "a fairly dysfunctional childhood," during which he was "raised by women in Oklahoma and had an aunt that even called me 'son,' " Mr. Edwards described a lifelong fascination with finding out what makes women tick. "They've always been a wonderful mystery for me," he said.
If "Victor/Victoria" gave him a chance to explore gender-related differences in the male and female psyches, it also made him wonder how much further he might go. And he had in mind George Axelrod's play "Goodbye, Charlie" (directed on film by Vincente Minnelli in 1964), about a ladies' man killed by a jealous husband and reincarnated in female form. "I remember thinking to myself that there are so many things you can do now that you couldn't do then," recalled Mr. Edwards. So he set out to do a few.
His early version of "Switch" included an explicitly sexual encounter between Amanda and her female suitor and a sexual assault on Amanda, after which she reverted to masculine behavior by chasing her attackers with a baseball bat. Those episodes were either greatly toned down or eliminated after preview audiences rebelled against so much sexual ambiguity. "Where I perceived that the audience would be aware that there was a guy in there," Mr. Edwards said of the bedroom scene between Ms. Barkin and Ms. Bracco, "it turned out that that area made them uncomfortable. I was surprised, because to my ear, it played."
Mr. Edwards's ear has long been attuned to the kinds of wild personality changes that have become one of his trademarks. The split personality, whether in a man with two pregnant wives ("Micki and Maude," 1984) or a demure woman who goes wild under the influence of alcohol ("Blind Date," 1987), is a favorite device. Even his relatively stable characters, like Inspector Clouseau of the "Pink Panther" films or the composer played by Dudley Moore in "10," lapse easily into bizarre behavior. So "Switch" made sense to him even when others balked at its apparent daring.
"Switch" is being distributed by Warner Brothers, but it was independently produced for a variety of reasons. Ever since making "S.O.B." (1981), an uproariously funny attack on the Hollywood establishment, Mr. Edwards has been more popular outside the major studios. "I suspect it became tougher for me to get projects off the ground, but it all depends on whether you have a hit," he said. "You can be Hitler, and if you had a hit you'd be back again."
Years ago, when he proposed making a film about Billie Holiday and was told by a Paramount executive that it might be a good idea to make Miss Holiday white, Mr. Edwards began establishing his independent streak. ("Who do you want, Doris Day?" he remembers asking sarcastically. The answer was yes.) Since then, he has even shot a film in his own house ("That's Life," 1986) as an economy measure, and he remembers what it was like for him and his wife, Julie Andrews, to watch television in bed while a film crew packed up its equipment in the next room. So when it came to making "Switch," Mr. Edwards was ready to take chances.
But finding an actress to play a man trapped in a woman's body was a problem. On Hollywood's A list of potential stars, he said, there were two or three "powerhouse ladies" interested in the material but afraid of it, too. Ms. Barkin was not then an A-list possibility, and Mr. Edwards's backers resisted doing the film without an actress who was a drawing card. "It looked like the project would be dropped for business reasons," Mr. Edwards said. But then Ms. Barkin's success in "Sea of Love" in 1989 raised her a few notches on the Hollywood totem pole. She became acceptable to the film's backers, and she was eager to take the role.
"She loved it, but she was scared to death," Mr. Edwards said. He noted that his star's worries centered not on the film's content, but on her ability to make the material work in comic terms. In preparing for the role, Ms. Barkin studied men in the crew and the director himself. "I'd see her watching and imitating, and I'd catch her at it and she'd smile," Mr. Edwards said.
If Ms. Barkin supplied some of the film's ideas about how men behave, Mr. Edwards contributed his own thoughts about women. Amanda is made terrifically uncomfortable by her long hair, Mr. Edwards said, because he has watched his own daughters and stepdaughters wrestling with their coiffures and "it would drive me nuts." One of his daughters indirectly contributed the film's funniest line, the unprintable retort of a fur coat wearer to an animal rights activist, which she drew from a conversation overheard in Aspen, Colo.
One of the hardest things Ms. Barkin does in the film is to carry her co-star, Mr. Smits, who is much larger than her. "I didn't expect her to do that, and she hurt herself," Mr. Edwards said. "For the rest of her life, she'll have a problem with her back because of that scene."
 Other films besides "Switch," among them Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot" (1959) and Sydney Pollack's "Tootsie" (1982), have shown a man learning to view the world from a woman's point of view, hed said. "But here's someone who can't go home and get out of drag at the end of the day."

A TV Set That Shapes Up Movies

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
The mutilation of movies for video presentation may finally come to an end. A new type of television set allows feature films to be shown on a wide screen with the same shape as a movie screen. As a result, it will no longer be necessary to cut off part of the picture to make it fit within the dimensions of the video screen.
The first of these sets went on sale in France in March, and their introduction in other European countries and in Japan is scheduled for September. They will eventually be available in the United States. 
 The shape of the conventional TV screen has long irritated film producers, because the aspect ratio of the TV screen -- the ratio of width to height -- is all wrong for movies. Most movie screens are nearly twice as wide as they are high, whereas television screens are nearly square. Specifically, the aspect ratio of a movie screen is about 16:9; that of a TV screen is 4:3. Thus, showing a movie on a television set is like putting a painting in a frame so small that parts of the picture must be trimmed. This can damage the film's artistic intent.
At present, transferring a feature film to video often requires that scenes shot for the full width of the theater screen be drastically altered. "If you've got two people standing so far apart that you can't see them both on the small TV screen, then we just have to pan and cut back and forth between them," says Steven Bowen of Editel, a video postproduction company that specializes in film-to-tape transfers.
Such panning can destroy the mood and visual composition of a scene, which is why some directors have not allowed their films to be televised or issued on videocassettes.
Film studios, usually more interested in subsidiary profits from video than in artistic integrity, rarely stand in the way of video alterations. On the contrary, some studios now employ video advisers to work alongside directors. Their job is to make sure that the director observes the usual guidelines for video -- that the action stays in the middle of the screen, preferably in close-up, producing images that show up better on inexpensive TV sets with a grainy picture.
Many directors have chafed at these constraints, and there have been earlier attempts to sidestep the problem. One technique, called letterboxing, retains the original screen proportions but reduces the size of the overall image so as to fit the elongated rectangle into the conventional squarish screen.
In one of the more impressive letterbox releases, the panoramic vistas in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" have been preserved, and the videodisk of Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams" does full justice to the film's bold visual concepts. Such exemplary releases prove that the letterbox method -- which can be applied to all current television sets, VCR's and videodisk players -- can preserve a director's artistic intentions.
However, there are drawbacks to letterboxing. The upper and lower areas of the screen are not used and remain blank. This may account for the limited acceptance of letterboxing in this country. As one video producer put it, "American viewers feel cheated if the picture doesn't fill up the whole screen."
On the new wide-screen sets, in contrast, the picture is spread over the whole screen and the overall size does not shrink if letterboxed programs are displayed. Moreover, the sets are compatible with programs presented in the conventional video format, and the viewer may choose alternative modes of displaying the picture: expanding the picture to fill the whole screen by cropping a bit of sky and foreground, or displaying the picture as it is, with black areas on the screen at the right and left.
The new sets also use new circuitry to improve image sharpness so that it approaches high-definition standards expected in the future. When true high-definition television (HDTV) arrives, the sets can be equipped for it by means of an adapter.
The introductory price of the new sets is about $5,000 for a model with a screen measuring 36 1/2 inches diagonally. But once the economies of mass production are applied, the price of some wide-screen models may be only about 20 percent higher than that of conventional sets of comparable size.
No date has been set for the introduction of wide-screen technology to the United States because of the current economic climate. But the French company making these sets (Thomson Consumer Electronics) owns part of RCA and therefore has access to widespread marketing facilities in this country. This corporate link stirs hope that the United States will not lag far behind in getting the new technology.

You Want Repertory? Here It Is

BYLINE: By Donal Henahan

 BODY:
Recently in this space I asked a simple question: why has so little music composed since 1950 entered the repertory? Because the problem has puzzled me, I assumed others might also be baffled. Yes and no. A few readers refused to agree that there was a problem and expressed annoyance that a critic would waste time on it. "How much more responsible it would be," protested one, "if you devoted your space to educating audiences about why new music is still being written." (I fear there could be the germ of another irresponsible column in that sentence.)
Other correspondents, however, fairly leapt at the opportunity to send along multipage replies couched in historical, cultural, economic and even psychoanalytical terms. One thesis-size, footnoted letter argued that the whole idea of a masterpiece-based repertory is outmoded: social fragmentation has been taking place at such an accelerating rate in Western societies that "any consensus about culture and masterpieces is already impossible." Other familiar villains: the "choke-hold that academic mediocrities have on their students," the "excessive freedom enjoyed by composers who no longer have to please patrons," the "expansive but disruptive effect" of the post-1950 recording boom, the failure of conductors and other performers "to champion the music they love" . . . and so on. 
 Most correspondents responded to my request for a list of works from the last 50 years that our descendants might find worth hearing again and again. Such litanies tend to be compiled from memory rather than with the aid of reference books, which may explain why the works cited were over whelmingly from the 1940's. That placed them within the required 50-year span but, significantly, before my 1950 cutoff date. Here, however, are some frequently mentioned pieces from the fruitful decade of the 40's:
Strauss's "Four Last Songs," Oboe Concerto, Horn Concerto No. 2, "Capriccio," "Metamorphosen." Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5, String Quartet No. 2, "War and Peace" (first version). Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 3, Concerto for Orchestra. Copland's "Appalachian Spring," Symphony No. 3, "Red Pony," "Rodeo." Thomson's "Louisiana Story." Hindemith's "Four Temperaments." Messaien's "Turangalila" Symphony, "Quartet for the End of Time." Bernstein's "On the Town," "Fancy Free." Barber's "Knoxville," Violin Concerto. Shostakovich's Symphonies Nos. 7, 8, 9, String Quartets Nos. 2, 3, 4. Stravinsky's "Orpheus," Concerto in D, "Danses Concertantes," "Ebony Concerto," Symphony in C. Britten's "Peter Grimes," "Albert Herring," "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra," "Ceremony of Carols," Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings.
Compare that brief, war-scarred period with the four decades since 1950, which have produced, in the opinion of my correspondents, the following repertory suspects (again, not an exhaustive tally):
Stravinsky's "Rake's Progress," "Agon." Prokofiev's "On Guard for Peace" (selections), Symphony No. 7. Messaien's "St. Francis of Assisi" (selections). Bernstein's "Prelude, Fugue and Riffs," Dances from "West Side Story," "Candide" Overture, "Chichester Psalms." Dello Joio's "Triumph of St. Joan." Britten's "Billy Budd," "War Requiem," "Noye's Fludde." Crumb's "Ancient Voices of Children," "Voice of the Whale," "Black Angels," "Eleven Echoes of Autumn." Menotti's "Saint of Bleecker Street," "Amahl and the Night Visitors." Shostakovich's Cello Concerto No. 1, "Festive Overture," Symphonies Nos. 10 through 15, String Quartets Nos. 8, 13, 14, 15. Poulenc's "Dialogues des Carmelites," Gloria in G, Sonatas for Oboe and Piano, Clarinet and Piano, Flute and Piano. Moore's "Ballad of Baby Doe." Berio's Sinfonia. Ligeti's "Atmospheres" and "Lux Aeterna." Carter's Variations for Orchestra, String Quartets Nos. 1, 2, 3. Boulez's "Pli Selon Pli."
Corigliano's Clarinet Concerto. Vaughan Williams's Tuba Concerto, Symphonies Nos. 7, 8, 9. Martin's "Concert Pour Clavecin et Petite Orchestre," Etudes for String Orchestra, Requiem. Schnittke's Requiem. Rutter's Requiem. Panufnik's "Arbor Cosmica." Gubaidulina's "Offertorium." Lutoslawski's Symphony No. 3, Concerto for Orchestra, "Funeral Music," "Chain 2." Penderecki's "Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima," "St. Luke Passion." Adams's "Harmonielehre," "Chairman Dances." Glass's "Satyagraha." Reich's "Music for 18 Musicians."
Such a scattershot listing obviously reflects only personal, perhaps even eccentric, sympathies. But in a gross way it does suggest, I think, that for whatever catalogue of reasons the flow of high-quality pieces has diminished drastically in the last 40 years. Composers continue to produce works in great quantity: according to the Central Opera Service, 1,526 American music-theater pieces alone were written or had their premieres during the 1980's, more than were counted in all foreign countries combined. The number of orchestral, nonoperatic vocal and chamber works, for which I have no figures, must be staggering.
I am chagrined to say that I still do not know the answer to my simple question. Like the purloined letter, it could be under my nose, too obvious to notice. Or as one cruel reader pointed out, there may not be any such thing as a simple question, only simple questioners.

To the Editor: Why is international travel down? It is not because of the fear of terrorism. It is not because of the recession. It is because neither travelers nor travel agents can reach an international reservations clerk at any major airline.
In setting up a trip to Florence and Venice via Paris, I have spent several hours on hold with the reservations clerks. And my agent tells me that she has had to wait up to one-half hour to get through to one. Then the reservations clerk often cannot give the final cost of tickets and refers her to the rate desk for another lengthy hold. 
 Perhaps we'll drive to Vermont.

Connecticut Revaluations Raise Hackles

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
FALLOUT from the excesses of the 80's continues drifting into some unexpected places. One example is the revaluation of real estate in Connecticut, which takes place at staggered 10-year intervals in each of the state's 169 communities.
 In effect since the 50's and designed to distribute property taxes equitably, the revaluations rarely generate more than a handful of protests from individual taxpayers, and they are disposed of expeditiously by local boards of tax review. 
 Not so this year. In Greenwich alone, there have been 3,700 householders demanding redress from a 1989 revaluation. Some 2,200 appeals were filed with the Board of Tax Review last year, and when implementation of the revaluation was postponed for a year, 1,500 more irate taxpayers filed appeals.
 "We are swamped," said Lou Caravella, chairman of the three-member board. "We've had it real good for a long time, now all of a sudden it's caught up with us." Greenwich has requested a second year's legislative grace to finish the job.
 Similar delays are cropping up throughout the state as homeowners resist high revaluations generated by the heady run-up in house prices during the 80's and the current decline in office and condominium values due to vacancies. The overall effect statewide has been a significant shifting of the tax burden from commercial to residential, in some cases creating a 30 to 50 percent tax increase.
 Rather than implement Draconian increases sooner than necessary, many towns, including Greenwich, have continued to tax at their 10-year-old revaluation rates. But that option will soon be eliminated by a law that goes into effect Oct. 1.
 Towns with overdue revaluations are now scrambling to get them done by that date or subject themselves to penalties of 10 percent of their state grants -- in some communities, amounting to millions of dollars.
 "There were no teeth in the law prior to this," said Don Zimbouski, manager of municipal assessments and taxation at the state Office of Policy and Management. "Towns could get a postponement for one year, a waiver for a second year, and then go on using their old assessments with impunity. Because of noncompliance there are approximately 40 towns with revaluations due on Oct. 1, more than I've ever seen."
 "No one remembers anything like this happening before," said Everett Smith, chairman of a selectmen's advisory committee in Greenwich appointed to investigate the basis for all the disputation. His committee submitted a report to the Board of Selectmen last month, charging flaws in the revaluation process that produced overvalued residences and undervalued commercial properties.
But James Ginnan, vice president of Sabre Systems in New Haven, a national revaluation firm that did the work, said Sabre "did a fair and equitable appraisal and we stand behind it."
 Of the 20 revaluation companies certified in the state, only 9 are equipped to handle big communities. Some towns are having difficulty finding a company to hire. "We charge per parcel and we like a large parcel count," said Mr. Ginnan. "It makes our distribution costs easier, like buying in bulk."
The firm handles 17 of the state's largest communities besides Greenwich.
 The revaluation process typically takes two years and 20 evaluators making door-to-door inspections and interpreting sales figures supplied by realtors and municipal agencies. The value of each property is then established from the collected data.
 The Town of Seymour did not implement its 1987 revaluation "because of the outcry against peak real estate values," said Anna Marks, the assessor.
"Now that the market has come down somewhat we just hired MMC of Chelmsford, Mass., to do another revaluation by Oct. 1," she said. "We couldn't get the taxpayers to pay for it any earlier."
Revaluations can cost anywhere from $600,000 to more than $1 million, depending on the size and complexity of the community.
SABRE SYSTEMS is currently working on a Stratford revaluation that was due in 1984. "The town just didn't budget for it," said the assessor, David Valente. "By not doing it, we will now have a steep increase of about 30 percent in residential taxes."
 "Connecticut is losing a lot of business," he continued, "so commercial property is not as valuable. United Technologies and its Sikorksy Aircraft subsidiary pay about 11 percent of Stratford's taxes, but we've had a loss of other businesses and a big drop in condominium values because of oversupply."
 William Bliss, Greenwich's comptroller, said he felt that "10 years is probably too long to wait."
"If you don't revalue promptly," he said, "it can get to be a nightmare, with some people keeping a low value on their properties at the expense of others."
 "Revaluations are threatening," said Robert Tuthill, the Greenwich assessor, "for retired people especially. And a lot of people who bought homes for $1 million are finding that they aren't worth a million any more. Others have multimillion-dollar houses that were grossly underassessed."
 Greenwich has taken pride in consistently having the lowest, or close to lowest, taxes of any Connecticut municipality for generations. A minor contributing factor was the practice of taxing personal property at the same rate as real estate. "It was a matter of interpretation," said Mr. Tuthill, "and we learned that it was the wrong interpretation, so we had to stop it."
 Real estate is assessed at 70 percent of market value at revaluation time, after which the percentage decreases with inflationary pressure until the next revaluation. Personal property, including cars, medical and office equipment, horses, and other items assessed at $1,000 or more, must be taxed each year at the full 70 percent of market value.
On April 25, a bill that would permit a five-year phase-in of a tax increase to lessen its pain gained final passage in the General Assembly. The measure was sponsored by Senator William Nickerson, Republican of Greenwich. The phase-in had been available through a law that expired Oct. 1, 1989.
 The old law permitted the increase to be paid in equal dollar amounts, but the Nickerson bill calls for equal percentage amounts, "making it a gentler transition," he said. Other towns with overdue revaluations are Derby, Groton, Hamden, Meriden, Manchester, Naugatuck, North Branford, Norwalk, Waterbury, West Haven and Windham.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Tax Plans Keep Falling Into Growing Budget Gap

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AT a news conference last week, State Representative Alan R. Schlesinger, a Republican from Derby, urged that the state sales tax, already the highest in the nation at 8 percent, be hiked to 10 percent. Mr. Schlesinger, whose opposition to an income tax is among the hardest of the hardcore in the General Assembly, said the beefed-up sales tax should also be extended onto previously untaxed items like bus and train tickets.
Hardly anyone, not even Mr. Schlesinger himself, seemed to think that a 10 percent sales tax had much real chance of becoming law. But as the legislator was also quick to point out, none of the other major tax plans put forward over the last two months -- including Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s plan for an income tax -- is in the rosiest of health. 
 With the size of the state's revenue shortfall continuing to grow, passing $2.7 billion for the first time last week, and with the list of ingredients considered indispensable to various legislators growing just as fast, the lawmakers are learning that no one plan has a monopoly on virtues or vices. Mr. Schlesinger, a tax lawyer and a former Congressional candidate, said that one praiseworthy facet of his proposed 2 percent sales tax surcharge is that it would be only temporary, until Connecticut's tax revenue shortfall is resolved. In addition, he said, setting the sales tax at a fat round number would have a sort of mathematical appeal. "Everyone will know what the tax is," he said. "They can calculate it in their heads."
Another voice in the tax-talk chorus was that of the Speaker of the State House of Representatives, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington. Mr. Balducci, who has maintained a firm opposition to any tax on wages during his 17-year political career, announced his conversion last week -- sort of.
Mr. Balducci, whose leanings toward an income tax had been rumored in the Capitol for several weeks, spent nearly 10 minutes prefacing his remarks by specifying the elements he needed to see in any budget bill without uttering anything about what everyone was waiting to hear and knew he would ultimately have to try to put into words.
First, he said, any plan must include some formal controls on the growth of state spending. Second, it must be an "economically responsible approach" that will not leave the state with the same old problems later on.
Mr. Balducci's third element was that any income tax plan should have a so-called sunset provision, one that will take it off the books when it is no longer needed. Yet in urging support for a sunset provision for the income tax, he had still to admit wanting a sunrise. "It isn't easy," he said in explaining the awkwardness of the moment. "To me, this is a big step."
The magnitude of the state's budget crisis and the impact of the recession were seen in two small pieces of legislation that moved forward last week in Hartford.
The first was a bill designed to catch tax cheats from other states who buy property in Connecticut, then sell it and make off without paying the 7 percent capital-gains tax on their profits. The bill would allow the state to withhold the first 2 percent of the tax at the time of the contract closing.
But as State Representative Leslie T. Young, a Republican from New Canaan, quietly pointed out, property sellers these days are just about as likely to take a loss on their sales and thus owe no taxes. In all fairness, he said, the state should promise to pay interest on the withheld money in the event it all has to be given back. Mr. Young's amendment passed without opposition.
The second bill was a measure aimed at helping dairy farmers stay in business. It would require the state to make up the difference between a farmer's costs in producing milk and the market price.
Sponsors of the bill, who said that about two-thirds of the state's full-time dairy farmers have gone out of business in just the last decade, said that the current wholesale price for milk -- about $11 per 100 pounds -- is $1 to $2 less than it costs to produce that much milk. The state would pick up the extra dollar to help a farmer break even, for a total cost of $8 million to $9 million a year, the bill said.
But no one seems to know where that money will come from in a budget that already seems squeezed, smashed and pounded beyond recognition.
"We're working to see if we can't free up some money," said Representative Jefferson B. Davis, Democrat from Pomfret, a sponsor of the dairy bill. "I'm not overly optimistic."
 
Next Stop, Fare Hike
 Sixteen months ago, Gov. William A. O'Neill made a big deal out of refusing to go along with a 15 percent fare increase for Connecticut riders of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Riders were paying enough and should not pay more, Mr. O'Neill said, in what was widely interpreted as a political move to win favor in Fairfield County for Mr. O'Neill's expected re-election campaign.
Mr. O'Neill and the railroad's parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, finally settled on a plan that increased fares 15 percent for New York riders, while keeping fares frozen in Connecticut.
Times change.
Last week, the State Department of Transportation announced that the very same 15 percent fare increase over which such a fuss was made under another Governor will finally take effect July 1. This time, department officials said, the increases were in fact prompted by the current Governor.
Mr. Weicker's proposed budget includes cuts in the state's subsidy to Metro-North that will have to made up somewhere, said James Byrnes, the department's Deputy Commissioner for Public Transportation.

HEADLINE: Growth Transforms A 'Sleepy' County

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago, the entire population of Ocean County's 33 communities was 38,000. Today, there are more students than that in the county's public elementary schools.
And 50 years ago, 821 poultry farms flourished between Great Bay to the south and Manasquan Inlet to the north, while oystermen raked almost a quarter-million bushels of oysters in a single season from Barnegat Bay. 
 Today, the poultry farms are nearly gone, replaced by rows of houses with neatly tended lawns in front and fenced-in swimming pools in back. And the oysters, their beds disturbed by ground-water runoff and the other effects of of development, have all but vanished from the bay.
The statistics underscore the sweeping changes that have accompanied Ocean County's growth. Indeed, in each of the last three decades, as hundreds of thousands of residents migrated to the county from the urban environs of New York City to the north and Philadelphia to the west, the population grew faster than in any other county in the state.
"The whole way of life here has changed," said Pauline S. Miller, director of the Ocean County Cultural and Heritage Commission. "This was just a rural little sleepy area. But when a county adds 100,000 more citizens every decade, you know that has to have an impact."
Indeed, since 1960, when Ocean County's population first topped 100,000, more than 325,000 new residents have been added to the county's population rolls. According to 1990 census figures, the population of Ocean County, the state's second-largest county in land area after Burlington, now stands at 433,203, an increase of more than 300 percent in 30 years.
In contrast, the state's most populous county, Essex, which had 923,545 residents in 1960, has seen its population decline to 778,206. And Hudson County, despite an influx of Hispanic immigrants, has steadily lost population in every decade since 1930; Hudson now has 553,099 residents.
Ocean County's growth, officials say, is attributable to several factors, including relatively affordable real estate, better-than-average school systems and proximity to three major employment markets -- New York, Philadelphia and Atlantic City -- each a little over an hour's drive away.
But Alan W. Avery Jr., assistant director of the Ocean County Planning Board, said one factor overrode all others.
"The single most important aspect of Ocean County's growth is the Garden State Parkway," he said.
In the summer of 1954, New Jersey's shore resorts were directly linked to the densely populated northeastern part of the state by the opening of the toll road, which now runs the length of the state from Montvale to Cape May.
With the parkway, Mr. Avery said, Ocean County was suddenly an easy drive from New York City and the North Jersey communities. Tourism flourished as carloads of vacationers crowded the sands that stretch from Point Pleasant Beach in the north of the county to Long Beach Township in the south.
Many of the vacationers of the 1950's, he said, eventually became the permanent residents of Ocean County in later years.
As baby boomers grew older and started families of their own, he said, the parents started looking for places to retire. Because property values in northern New Jersey had been steadily increasing, these empty nesters found themselves with large equity reserves.
 
Staying Close to Families
 Forsaking Florida for the more familiar Jersey Shore, and wanting to remain within driving distance of their children and grandchildren, many North Jersey couples headed down the parkway to Ocean County.
"They've been able to sell their homes up north, realize a profit and move down here to retire," Mr. Avery said.
And thousands did. Officials estimate that as many as 125,000 residents now live in Ocean County's 60 retirement communities -- private developments that set minimum-age requirements for residents. The communities range from sprawling tracts of small, almost identical houses to exclusive villages of custom-built homes with shared amenities like swimming pools, tennis courts and clubhouses.
According to statistics compiled by the New Jersey Department of Labor, Ocean County led every other county in the state in residential construction during the years 1980 to 1989. Nearly 50,000 building permits were issued for residential units in the county during that period.
At the same time that retirees from North Jersey were heading south, officials say, their children were finding it more and more difficult to buy first homes up north because of inflated real-estate prices. They too started looking toward Ocean County. In Dover Township, which is the county seat and located on Barnegat Bay, the average assessed value of residential property in 1988 was $114,788.
 Mr. Avery said many young couples decided to trade commuting time for bigger houses and better schools and moved to the Jersey Shore.
 
'This Was Our Only Chance'
 Wayne J. Sandberg and his wife, Joanne, who recently signed a contract to buy a house in Dover Township, present a typical example. They are purchasing a three-bedroom house for $109,000.
"We figured that if we're going to buy a house, this was our only chance," said Mr. Sandberg, who will commute to his job as a truck driver in Secaucus. "It will take me about an hour and 10 minutes to get to work," he said. "It takes my bosses who live on Long Island even longer."
The Sandbergs currently live with their children in a rented house in Franklin Lakes. "Franklin Lakes is nice," Mrs. Sandberg said, "but we could never buy a house up here. It's just too expensive."
She said she was looking forward to the move because "the air is cleaner, the schools are better and most of my friends are down there already."
 
Concentrated in Northeast
 The greatest concentration of residents in Ocean County live in its northeastern corner, on the mainland, along the upper reaches of Barnegat Bay. Brick Township, for example, with 66,473 residents, is a bustling community that is bordered on the east by Point Pleasant and on the west by the Garden State Parkway.
And Dover Township is a sprawling bayfront community with more than 76,000 residents -- a mixture of lifelong Ocean County residents, recently arrived young families and retired citizens living in adult communities like Holiday City, Greenbriar Woodlands and the Gardens of Pleasant Plains.
Despite the steady growth the county has enjoyed, some officials say the time may have come to assess whether continued development is appropriate. Mrs. Miller, of the county's Cultural and Heritage Commission, said the current economic recession and the slowdown in construction might be a good thing.
"Maybe people will use what's already been built rather than just go ahead and build more," she said. "It's sad to see how much of the county has been destroyed by growth."
 
Increased Congestion on Roads
 The impact of unchecked development on the county, she said, is apparent in increased congestion on local roadways, the destruction of historic buildings and the pollution of Barnegat Bay by "too many houses, too many sewers and too much ground water running off into the bay."
She said that "a 10-minute drive to a mall 10 years ago can take a half-hour today." And, she said, "it's a constant battle to keep houses on our Main Streets."
She cited a case in the early 80's, when an Italianate mansion built in 1868 on Washington Street overlooking the Toms River in Dover Township was demolished, despite protests by her agency. A parking lot now occupies the site.
The county's public school system is also experiencing growing pains. At least 16 of the county's 30 school districts are either building or planning to build new schools or additions to existing schools, said Joseph F. Zach, Ocean County Superintendent of Schools.
"The problem has been that the growth always stays ahead of the solution," Mr. Zach said. "As the districts grow, they build a new school, and a couple of years later, they're overcrowded again."
Mr. Zach said there were now more than 62,000 students in the county's public schools. More than 40,000 of them are in the elementary grades.
 
'Bursting at the Seams'
 The county has two colleges. Georgian Court College, in Lakewood, is private. Ocean County Community College, in Dover Township, is a public instution that offers a two-year associate's degree; it is brimming with students.
"We're bursting at the seams," said Dr. Milton Shaw, president of the community college. In the fall semester of 1990, Dr. Shaw said, 7,464 students registered for classes -- a phenomenal enrollment, considering that the college has graduated a total of 13,051 students in its 25-year history.
Dr. Shaw said he expected enrollment to continue to increase for at least the next six years, which will probably mean holding additional classes later in the day and moving some courses to off-campus classrooms in the public schools.
 Peter Schnell, chairman of the Ocean County Tourism Advisory Council, said the county's explosive growth rate of the last few decades was expected to subside, now that real-estate prices in other parts of the state had leveled off. The future, he said, is likely to see a more orderly expansion of the county's commercial sectors, coupled with a rebirth of the industry that put Ocean County on the map in the first place: tourism.
 
'Limitless Market for Tourists'
 "We have a virtually limitless market for tourists," Mr. Schnell said, referring to a study prepared for the casino industry indicating that as many as 50 million people live within a 10-hour drive of Atlantic City, which is only 50 miles down the Garden State Parkway.
<> <>
 Northern Ocean County is no longer the tourist mecca it once was, primarily because many former vacation bungalows are now year-round residences. But Mr. Schnell said the southern portion of the county was becoming increasingly popular among tourists.
He said Island Beach State Park, which is north of the Barnegat Inlet, and Long Beach Island, which is south, represent Ocean County at its best: long stretches of pristine sands and relatively uncrowded beaches.
And new development is highly restricted, Mr. Schnell said, both along the shore and within the vast interior pinelands district that covers almost half of the county's 638 square miles. The shore area, he said, is regulated by the State Coastal Area Review Board set up in 1973 under the Coastal Area Facilities Review Act. And development in the pinelands is monitored by the 15-member state Pinelands Commission, which was established in 1979.
As for northern Ocean County, Mr. Schnell said, any new development is likely to be less residential.
"It's happening already," he said. "There are office buildings being built, the hospitals are expanding, they're widening the highways."

 
Shift in Retirement Housing
 Indeed, H. Hovnanian Industries, a Tinton Falls developer that has built more than 14,000 residential units in Ocean County, is now shifting its focus from single-family retirement condominiums to commercial construction and the development of "congregate care facilities," which are blocks of efficiency apartments for elderly citizens.
Edele Hovnanian, vice president of the company, said the single-family residential market for retirees was becoming glutted, as aging residents of retirement communities moved out of their homes and into congregate-care developments or decided to live with their children.
Despite such predictions, retirement communities are still being built and retirees are still moving south.
"It's a different life altogether here," said Charles Loguidice, 66, who with his wife, Victoria, 65, recently moved to Lionshead Woods, a new retirement development in Lakewood, from their home in Brooklyn.
Mr. Loguidice, who lived in Manhattan after he arrived in this country from Sicily as a child, said that in his younger days he would never have predicted he would be living at the Jersey shore.
"When I moved out of Manhattan, I thought Brooklyn was the country and Ocean County was the boondocks," he said. "Now, when I go to New York, I can't wait to get back home."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Amid Layoffs, the Froth Is Gaining

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
FIGHTING recessions used to be a two-front war. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, and the politicians raised spending and cut taxes.
This recession is different. The Fed is battling, and seems determined to keep cutting rates until the economy notices. But governments are laying off workers -- 25,000 last month -- as they gasp for funds. 
 The evidence that the Fed is winning its war is sketchy at best. The unemployment rate of 6.6 percent in April would be greatly cheering, if anyone believed it. The trouble is that the rate, which is based on a household survey, is not supported by payroll figures, which tend to be more reliable. The best that can be said about them is that the rate of layoffs seems to be slowing.
"The economy is still in recession, but it is moving along the bottom," says Deborah Johnson, an economist at C. J. Lawrence. "It needs consumer spending to get moving again." Unfortunately, the surge of consumer confidence that greeted victory in Iraq seems to be fading.
Still, Washington and Wall Street seem to be in agreement that recovery is at hand, even if the figures don't prove it. Stock prices managed a small gain this week, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 17.82 points, to 2,938.86, in the wake of the third consecutive cut in the discount rate.
Actually, the end of recession seems to be taken for granted now among traders, if not economists. This is a rip-roaring bull market, the kind that rewards enthusiasm and punishes caution.
Last fall, for example, anything that was associated with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts was viewed with suspicion. Now, investors line up to buy Duracell shares for four times what the K.K.R. insiders paid three years ago.
For sheer stock market excitement, the tale of Conseco is instructive. Conseco is a heavily indebted insurance company that has been growing by acquisition. Sometimes it puts the debt on its balance sheet; sometimes it doesn't. There have been questions about whether it is too slow to write off the cost of acquisitions. Last October, shares in Conseco sold for $17. This week they hit $74.
The game going on now at Conseco and more than a few other stocks is known as short squeezing. As the price rises, speculators who bet that the price would go down are being forced to run for cover. Brokers are urging customers to buy the stock simply to profit from the shorts' misery.
"It's a classic battle, and the bulls are winning right now," said one Conseco short last week, admitting that he was having increasing difficulty hanging on. "It's a slaughter."
Short squeezes tend to be brief and bloody, and there often are two classes of losers. First come the shorts, then those who bought in hopes of squeezing them and held on too long.
So far, most shorts seem not to have given up. When they do, this rally may be history; bull markets often end when the short interest tumbles. It is possible that occurrence will coincide with a new fear that the recession is not ending, and a suspicion that the Fed cannot win this war by itself.

 BODY:

COMPANIES
 
So Many Auto Makers . . . and So Few Sales
 

What's wrong with Detroit? Partly the recession, but only partly. Between them, the domestic auto makers lost $1.85 billion in the first quarter because of weak sales. "Abysmal," said Lee Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. It could have been worse -- $723 million worse -- if the General Motors Corporation had not sold its building in New York. And in the final quarter of 1990, the companies lost $2.1 billion. So what's going wrong? Not technology. Since 1981, the Big Three have spent $121.9 billion upgrading plants and equipment. Not quality. Many of their cars are now world-class. "The problem is overcapacity in the industry," said Malcolm Salter, chairman of the Harvard Business School's advanced management program. "In 1989, 9.9 million cars were sold, a good year. Even so, North American plants operated at only 76 percent of capacity." In a slow year, like this one, he said overcapacity could be as high as two million units. Part of Detroit's strategy has been to shut excess plants. But then foreign companies open new ones. "Even after all the plant closings and the ones planned for this year, Detroit will still operate at just 75 percent of capacity," Mr. Salter said. It will get tougher. "They have to keep bringing out new models to differentiate themselves from the others." That takes time and even more money.
 
A Smaller General Dynamics
 
The General Dynamics Corporation will share in what could be the most lucrative military contract in history -- $95 billion over a decade to build 650 planes for the Air Force. And last week it won a $2 billion contract to build a new attack submarine. But even that is not enough to keep it whole. Over the next four years, the nation's second-largest military contractor will let 27,000 workers go. With the threat from the Soviet Union diminished, Washington is cutting back on weapons. Because it failed to diversify into the commercial market -- 87 percent of its revenue comes from the Government -- the company has no choice but to scale down. "The downsizing is not cyclical," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, in Washington. The industry is shrinking.
 
Duracell Brightens the Market
 
When Duracell International Inc. went public last week, its stock charged up the market. The initial offering was at $15, but by the end of the day, the stock had jumped $5.75 to $20.75, sparking a rally in which 20 million of the 30 million shares offered changed hands. It finished the week at $21.25. The success of the deal testifies once more to how hot Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company is right now. The buyout firm acquired Duracell in 1988 for $5 a share. Why all the fuss about Duracell? Analysts think it is one of the best-run companies in the business.
 
NBC's Shaky Success
 
For six years he kept NBC No. 1 in the ratings. But now Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of NBC's entertainment group, is going to the movies. He is becoming chairman of Paramount Pictures, the money-losing movie maker owned by Paramount Communications Inc. He may be making the move just in time. While NBC remains No. 1, with cable No. 1 means less than it used to. Viewership is off and the networks are losing money. Rumors have even been circulating -- strongly denied -- that the General Electric Corporation, NBC's parent, might put NBC up for sale.
 
A New, Improved Dow
 
It's a little like rewriting the Bible. Dow Jones & Company changed the make-up of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average to better reflect the economic importance of services and the entertainment industry. It added the Walt Disney Company, J.P. Morgan & Company and Caterpillar Inc. -- the most stocks changed since 1959 when four were replaced. It removed the Navistar International Corporation, the Primerica Corporation and the USX Corporation from the list. J.P. Morgan is the first bank to be included in the average. Even with the changes, the Dow still reflects industrial America. Most of stocks are in the manufacturing and resource sectors.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY


Bush Gets His Way on Rates
 
After weeks of shouting, the Administration has finally gotten its message across to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The nation is in a sticky recession -- the White House says -- that can only be cured if interest rates go lower. The Federal Reserve has finally complied. Last week it lowered the discount rate, the amount it charges member banks to borrow short term, from 6 percent to 5.5 percent, the lowest rate since 1987. It also lowered the funds rate, the amount banks charge each other to borrow. That rate dipped from 6 percent to 5.75 percent. Will the drop in rates work? The prime rate at banks around the country slipped half a point to 8.5 percent, the lowest since 1987. For people with loans tied to the prime, that means more money in their pockets. Now, if they would just spend.
 
Uneven Gains on Housing
 
New home sales moved up 1 percent in March -- welcome news from the Commerce Department. It follows on strong gains of 18.6 percent in February. But does it mean the end of the recession is near? To some, yes. "This confirms our judgment that the bottom of the cycle was in January," said David F. Selders, chief economist at the National Association of Homebuilders. But even with two months of gains, sales so far this year are still 21.1 percent below last year. And the gains are uneven across the country.
 
Figures on Jobs Don't Jibe
 
The numbers are confusing. Unemployment fell to 6.6 percent in April from 6.8 percent in March. That's good. But the payroll report, which records by computer how many people are actually working, fell by 125,000 for the month. That's bad. Yet the household survey, another component of the figures released last week by the Labor Department, showed an increase of 600,000 jobs, which is good. "That's a tremendous discrepancy," said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to DRI Inc., a research firm. The Labor Department says the survey is picking up the large number of people who have started businesses and are working at home. "I have trouble believing that," Mr. Chimerine said. "The payroll numbers are the reliable ones. I have to conclude we're still losing jobs."
 
Misleading Indicators
 
Judging from the way it moved, the index of leading indicators is a very murky crystal ball. On average, according to the Commerce Department, the indicators rose: 0.5 percent for March, following a 1.2 percent rise in February. But if looked at individually, 7 out of 11 fell. Curiously, they were the ones linked most closely to the economy's day-to-day performance. The gainers were stock prices, the number of new building permits issued, the size of the money supply and consumer expectations. Important, yes, but not to everyone. Among the indicators that fell were the number of hours worked, new orders for consumer goods and new orders for plants and equipment -- important all around. The result is that "we're still declining but at a slower rate," said Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York. How much longer will the economy decline? Mr. Berner expects an upturn before summer's end.
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Bad Economic News Travels
 
They call it the English-speaking recession because the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia are all in a slump. But now the recession may be learning Japanese. "The leading indicators are sharply down for the sixth month in a row and the money supply is contracting," said Madis Senner, an international money manager in New York. "Their economy could come to a dead halt." And last week the Conference Board, a business research group in New York, released a report that was equally pessimistic. "Housing is in virtual collapse, consumer confidence is down and fixed investment -- which is 25 percent of the economy -- will be up by just 1 percent," said Gail Fosler, who compiled the report. "Estimates were Japan would grow this year by 5 percent," she said. "Now they're down to 3.5 percent. It could go lower."
 
Full Speed Ahead on Mexico?
 
President Bush wants negotiations with Mexico over a proposed free-trade agreement to be put on the fast track. That would let the Administration cut a deal Congress could not negotiate, only pass or kill. But last week, a coalition of 60 organizations -- labor unions, environmentalists and border-state farmers -- told Congress to go slowly. They are worried the fast track will end in a sour deal, one that allows companies to take advantage of Mexico's lax pollution laws. Will President Bush be able to stay on the fast track? Most analysts say yes.
 
The Twilight of the Trabant
 
It looked like one of those toy cars in front of the supermarket -- 25 a ride. But for 36 years, the Trabant rattled windows, lost hubcaps and fouled the East German air. The car's two-cylinder, two-stroke engine mixed oil with gas and had no smog device. Its body -- the same design since the beginning -- was of brittle fiberglass. And it went from zero to 60 miles per hour, Germans joked, in just under 15 minutes. But they were loved. Three million were made by Volkseigener Betrieb Sachsenring in Zwickau. Last week, the final one rolled off the ramp. When the Berlin Wall fell, the Trabant met its match and lost. It could not compete with Volkswagen -- which took over its aging plant -- Mercedes-Benz, Opel or B.M.W. But then again, a Mercedes can cost more than $100,000, Trabants just $2,000.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Drug Stocks as a Global Play

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
Bolstering its reputation as recession-proof, the pharmaceutical business is prospering on both sides of the Atlantic. Demand for prescription drugs continues to be strong, although French Government agencies have cut the prices of several products this year and Germany has also started to squeeze prices.
"In a recession, the health-care industry sure beats the steel business," said Andy Markey, treasurer of Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest health-care company. Johnson & Johnson does more than half its business overseas. 
 Abby Joseph Cohen, a vice president and strategic investing adviser with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, views drug companies as attractive investments with above-average growth, whether they are based in the United States, Britain or other European countries, "and perhaps in Asia as well."
"The companies are seen as classically defensive buys, unrelated to interest rates, recession or anything else," said Jo Walton, a pharmaceuticals analyst in London with Shearson Lehman Brothers. "When people are ill and growing older, demand rises, regardless of economic conditions."
Ms. Walton said drug sales were growing worldwide by 10 to 12 percent a year, although in a recession many governments seem "less willing to allow drug prices to rise." Government agencies control drug prices in most industrial countries but not the United States. She said France, for example, sharply cut the price of three strong-selling products at the beginning of the year: Merck's cholesterol drug Zocor, Eli Lilly's antidepressant Prozac and the Hoffmann-La Roche injectible antibiotic Rocephin.
"On the flip side of this," she added, "companies are being much more aggressive about prices for new drugs." She said Glaxo recently introduced a new anti-asthma drug, Serevent, which is "10 times as expensive" as the leading older asthma drug in Britain.
Ms. Walton likes Hoffmann-La Roche, Pfizer and SmithKline Beecham. Roche's pharmaceutical sales are growing by 21 percent, she said, and the company may get Food and Drug Administration approval this year to market DDC, a new AIDS drug, in the United States. Pfizer has a "very strong pipeline, with new product launches coming through," she added. "And SmithKline is still reaping the benefits of cost savings in its merger with Beecham."
On the down side, some drug makers worry about divisions that sell candies and other consumer products, including SmithKline Beecham, Johnson & Johnson and American Home Products.
The recession can also be a problem for European drug companies like Ciba-Geigy, Bayer and Rhone-Poulenc, which also make chemicals that are hurt by the slowdown, said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta & Isaly, a New York research firm specializing in pharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, Mr. Mehta recommends Glaxo, Bayer and Ciba-Geigy.
Mr. Mehta also sees values in small European biotechnology companies. He said, "Many European companies are every bit as good as the American companies." Shares of 40 American biotechnology companies were up 55 percent in the first quarter of this year, but fell back in April, recording a gain of 49 percent for the first four months.
By contrast, Mr. Mehta said, the European biotechnology companies rose only 11.5 percent in the four months. He likes Serono, based in Geneva; Immuno, based in Vienna and listed on the Zurich Stock Exchange, and Synthelabo, based in Paris.
The moves last week by the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates are only of indirect concern to pharmaceutical companies. Drug makers typically carry little debt. Not surprisingly, they borrow in countries with low rates and park their cash where rates are high.
When the Fed acted last week, American-based companies hoped that the dollar would weaken, increasing the value of sales made in foreign currencies. But the Bundesbank refused to lower German rates. So the dollar has continued to strengthen, which may mean slower growth later this year for American companies when their foreign sales are translated into dollars.
A strong dollar is good news, however, for Glaxo P.L.C. and SmithKline Beecham. Both do much of their business in the United States but report their sales in British pounds.
SmithKline's sales, for example, were 4.5 billion last year, of which 2 billion was in the United States. "We hedge the risk by buying and selling futures and making forward contracts" in both pounds and dollars, said Philip Ward, a SmithKline spokesman in London. "We look at our budgeted profits and cover the profits we expect to make" in case of sharp swings in the exchange rates.
Mr. Markey at Johnson & Johnson said hedging activity in the industry is increasing. He said, "We do selective hedging on our cash flows." Whether the hedging operations should be included in American company financial reports is under review at the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the quasi-official body that decides such questions.

HEADLINE: Technology;
Outdoor Equipment Designers Reset Their Sights on Fanatics

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
At Marmot Mountain Works, a mountaineering store in Berkeley, Calif., Joshua Bodine has spent as much as two hours fitting a customer with a new backpack.
As often as not, the pack Mr. Bodine fine-tunes to cling to the customer's back has been created by Dana Gleason, one of an elite group of American designers creating advanced mountaineering gear. 
 Designers like Mr. Gleason are riding a new wave of interest in the environment and rugged outdoor sports, and Mr. Gleason's company, Dana Design, based in Bozeman, Mont., has in the last two years attained a reputation for building backpacks that excel in load balance and comfort.
"I'm a monomaniac," he said. "I think about packs all the time." Dana Mountaineering now employs 85 and has two factories. Its packs are selling in Japan as well as the United States.
Dana itself represents a shift back to traditional concerns in the outdoor equipment industry. After the outdoor gear boom of the 1970's, companies like Eddie Bauer and Patagonia, which had gained prominence supplying expedition and climbing gear, shifted their product lines to what are called soft goods -- apparel and fashion.
But now that is changing again. "We've had more Earth Day awareness, and with the recession people look toward muscle-powered sports for outdoor recreation," said Terri Perlman, a buyer for backpacks and climbing equipment at Recreational Equipment Inc., an outdoor-equipment cooperative headquartered in Seattle.
As a result, there is interest in top-of-the-line packs that may cost anywhere from $250 to $500 and that employ the latest in lightweight materials as both frames and fabrics.
Since pack designers must design for the most demanding users, they frequently pioneer ideas. "We have to be fanatics," said Mr. Gleason. "If things don't work right for us, we hurt physically."
Mr. Gleason has found competition from several other designers. Mike Scherer is a designer at Kelty Inc., one of the leading names in the mainstream backpack market. Mr. Scherer has revitalized the Kelty name with several unusual designs.
Another prominent rival is Wayne Gregory, who in the early 70's pioneered the first advanced designs for internal packs -- those whose frames are sewn inside the fabric. His company, Gregory Mountaineering, dominated the high end of the pack market in the first half of the 80's, but in recent years has slipped behind Dana Mountaineering.
Backpacks in the 90's use ultralight aerospace industry materials and often sport brilliant multicolored fabrics, straps and fasteners. This gear has little in common with the equipment built by the first generation of high-tech pack designers in the 60's. Those packs replaced wood frames and leather shoulder straps with frames made with braised-aluminum tubing and cotton or nylon back bands to hold the frame away from the back. Later innovations included the waistband, which permitted backpackers to shift some of the pack's load from shoulders to hips.
Today's state-of-the-art backpacks are intended for demanding users who may spend as much time on rugged cross-country traverses as they do on more civilized trails. They usually have internal frames made out of exotic materials like aluminum alloy, carbon fiber or even titanium.
Recently, the pack builders have begun experimenting with a variety of new design ideas. One change is the use of molded polyurethane for fitting the packs more closely to the back and waist. Thin sheets of polyethylene add rigidity and keep objects in the pack from poking the wearer in the back.
Compared with traditional external frames, internal-frame designs ride closer to the back and have less sway, a desirable quality for moving off trails and for back-country skiing, in which an external frame may interfere with poling.
The search for greater performance and durability has also led designers like Mr. Scherer to search for new fabrics that are more durable than pack cloth or cordura nylon. Two years ago Kelty, for example, introduced a new line of packs that use a phenomenally durable cloth made from a new fabric called Spectra.
Developed by the Allied-Signal Corporation, the material is stronger than Kevlar, the material used in bullet-proof vests, for the same weight. Spectra, which is half the weight of traditional pack materials, permits the design of packs that are as much as two pounds lighter than identical packs using conventional materials. But Spectra is very difficult to dye and the material is available only in white.
The material comes at a high price -- $35 a yard, almost 10 times the price of conventional materials. That is one reason the new packs cost $400 to $500. "It's a small market," Mr. Scherer said.
The biggest difference in design philosophy comes in suspension design, the foundation of a modern internal frame. Wayne Gregory pioneered the idea of using two thin stays of aluminum alloy that stretch from the shoulder straps to the waistband. By custom- bending the stays to the user's back he was able to get a more comfortable fit and a superior ride. "I'm the guy who started the madness of bending frames," said Mr. Gregory.
But four years ago, while he was on a long backpacking trip on the John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada, Mr. Gregory was alarmed to notice that most of his packs had not been fitted correctly in the stores. As a result, he has modified his design approach. He now uses a carbon fiber stay instead of aluminum alloy and after measuring more than 100 backs has come up with a standard design that he says works for most hikers.
Mr. Gleason of Dana and Mr. Scherer of Kelty disagree with this approach, and they still require that their packs be custom-fitted for each user.
Both Gregory and Dana now use carbon fiber stays, which they say provide greater vertical stiffness for load transfer between shoulders and hips as well as a livelier ride and better torsion than was provided by aluminum. Mr. Scherer, who is passionate in his search for ways to cut weight, has settled on extremely thin -- and more costly -- titanium stays.
Mr. Gregory acknowledges that he has lost the lead in the market to Mr. Gleason's Dana packs, but he says he is working on a new model to be introduced later this year.
"Dana is going to have to look at what I'm doing," he said, in a recent interview. "I was dormant for about five years, but I'm very inquisitive about new technologies."

HEADLINE: All About/Trucking;
A Whole Lot of Shaking Going On

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
When the trucking industry was deregulated in 1980, thousands of new companies sprang up seeking to take advantage of the new ease of entry and greater freedom to set their own prices. Hundreds of existing companies expanded quickly, adding non-union divisions and entering new markets ranging from pickup and delivery to storage.
A decade later, many of the new entrants have gone out of business and scores of established companies have also gone under, victims of fierce competition and an inability to adapt to an unregulated market. 
 The biggest winners in this new world have been the four trucking giants -- formerly dominant, now even more so.
United Parcel Service in Greenwich, Conn., which had $13.6 billion in revenues last year is by far the industry leader. Its familiar brown trucks and vans operate in all markets, from long distance hauling to pick up and delivery.
Consolidated Freightways in Palo Alto, Calif., is next with $4.2 billion in revenues last year, followed by Roadway Express Inc., in Akron, Ohio, with $2.97 billion and Yellow Freight Systems Inc. in Kansas City with $2.3 billion. Unlike the others, Yellow operates only a long-haul business.
In 1989, the latest year for which revenue comparisons are available, the top four companies accounted for 47 percent of the total revenue of the top 100 trucking companies. In 1980, the same four had had just 29 percent of the market.
"There's been a shakeout with the leading carriers grabbing a bigger and bigger piece of the pie," said Graeme Lidgerwood, a transportation analyst at CS First Boston in New York. And, she added, these giants will get stronger yet as new entrants find it more difficult to raise the capital they need to grow and take advantage of the cost savings that size can bring.

 
 
Full Loads and Not
Differing Logistics in a Split Market
 The American Trucking Associations divides the industry into two major segments: full truckload and less-than-full truckload, dropping U.P.S. totals from the broken-down segments because of the special nature of that operation.
Many companies compete in both markets although the less-than-full-truckload segment is larger by far.
The logistics of sending a fully loaded truck containing goods from a single company to a single destination are quite different from those of routing less-than-full truckloads to several destinations. In the latter case, trucks sometimes load and unload packages at depots all over the country before making it to their final stops.
As might be expected, Consolidated, Roadway and Yellow dominate the less-than-full segment of the market. Together, they control 45 percent of that market.
In the less concentrated full-truckload segment, the four leading companies, all far smaller than the less-than-full giants, together controlled just 11 percent of that segment.
Top among the full-truckload four is Schneider National Carriers Inc., which had $832 million in revenues last year, based in Green Bay, Wis. J.B. Hunt, with $580 million is in Lowell, Ark. Builders Transport Inc.,with $252 million, is in Camden, S.C. And Werner Inc., with $240 million, is in Omaha, Neb. None of these carriers were in the top 100 before the industry was deregulated.

 
 
Little-Guy Growth
Startups Proliferate Despite Failure Rate
 Unlike the airline industry, where very few new entrants have emerged to prosper since the early days of deregulation, there are still hundreds of new trucking companies, many quite small, springing up every year as bright-eyed entrepreneurs set out to seek their fortunes.
Indeed, the number of trucking companies -- in all three categories set up by the Interstate Commerce Commission -- has proliferated from 18,045 in 1980 to 33,283 in 1985 and 45,791 in 1990.
The mortality rate of these carriers remains high, as the new companies "find out the hard way that it's not easy," said Russell B. Capelle Jr., director of statistical analysis for the American Trucking Associations. "Many disappear within months."
But the actual number of failures is declining. From a high of over 1,500 companies a year shutting down between 1985 to 1986, the rate has dropped to about 1,200 failures a year, he said.

 
 
The Squeeze Ahead
Railroads, Soft Rates and Pay Hikes
 As others have stumbled, the big three -- Yellow, Roadway and Consolidated -- often found they could buy equipment and terminals at bargain prices. They also hired the pick of their ailing competitors' drivers and took over the failed companies' customers.
All helped consolidate their dominance of the industry. And Ms. Lidgerwood of CS First Boston is now wondering whether another round of shakeouts is in the making.
"I'm very disturbed that there is continuing pressure on rates," she said. An increase of 5 percent in January of 1990 by the less-than-full-truckload carriers "just about evaporated and several others were often undercut," she said. Another stab at 5.5 percent rise last month, she said, may not yield as much revenue as expected because of discounting.
Many large companies, hurting in the weak economy, are scouring the industry for low bidders, pitting trucker against trucker in an ever-rougher market.
And the industry recently negotiated a new contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that calls for an increase in wages of about 3.3 percent a year. With benefits, that increase is more like 4 percent. Obviously, the new contract adds to the squeeze on trucking profits.
The plight of the full-truckload carriers may even be tougher since many are losing business to the railroads. With the double stacking of truck containers on rail cars, the railroads have cut costs and improved service on long-haul segments -- West Coast to Chicago, for example.
So far, the trucking industry has been able to keep its share of the transportation market constant at about 78 percent. But cost pressures may cause the full-truckload segment to see some erosion against other forms of transportation.
Some companies are even conceding their long-haul routes along the major corridors to the railroads, according to Ms. Lidgerwood. For example, one major carrier, J.B. Hunt,has an agreement with the Sante Fe Pacific railroad under which it turns over its long-haul freight between Chicago-to-Los Angeles to the railroad.
And this sort of give-up could spill over into less-than-full segment, not to mention shorter hauls.
 
 
 
YELLOW FREIGHT TAKES THE HIGH ROAD
 The 10,000 orange trucks of Yellow Freight Systems Inc. have become as familiar to drivers as the McDonald's restaurants on the nation's highways. They seem to be everywhere.
It was not always so. When deregulation went into effect in 1980, Yellow Freight was a major less-than-full-truckload carrier but it did not have a strong presence in all parts of the country.
"We were transcontinental, but we had a lot of gaps," George E. Powell 3d, the president and chief executive of the company, recalled.
In 1981, the Kansas City company had 248 terminals, 13,250 employees and revenues of $936 million. But with the onset of deregulation, the firm began to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying up terminals and equipment from bankrupt competitors and building new terminals to knit together a strong nationwide route system.
The company is now the nation's largest handler of less-than-truckload freight, with 640 terminals, 28,000 employees and revenues of $2.3 billion last year.
At the height of its expansion, Yellow was spending well over $180 million a year, setting an all-time high of $193 million in 1984. Now, with that network in place, capital spending has begun to drop, totalling $162 million last year. The drop in spending has enabled Yellow to reward its stockholders. It raised their dividend last year to 23.5 cents a share, from 19 cents.
But Mr. Powell said that while the company expected to spend less, that could change if there was pressure to quickly adopt new technology like automatic freight handling systems.
Mr. Powell recalled that the conventional wisdom in the early part of deregulation was that service to smaller communities would dry up. The volume of traffic, it was believed, was not there to make it worthwhile for a carrier the size of Yellow to go there.
Instead, he said, the large carriers found that they had to reach into the smaller communities to generate the volume that would support the huge systems they were building.
During the next decade Mr. Powell said, the large companies will be looking for ways to grow in an industry where most markets have been saturated with service.
"The challenge will be find new opportunties to be profitable," he said.

HEADLINE: Israeli Economy Is Keeping Many Jews in U.S.S.R.

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 3

 BODY:
The Israeli Government is openly acknowledging for the first time that tens of thousands of Soviet Jews are postponing or canceling their moves to Israel because of the country's inability to provide jobs for those already here.
In dozens of emotional speeches over the last 18 months, Israeli leaders have tied the nation's hopes for the future to the successful absorption of the Soviet Union's Jews. Now they admit that they are failing. 
 Late last month the Government revised its official estimate, saying that no more than 200,000 Soviet Jews are now expected to move here this year rather than the 300,000 to 400,000 expected before. Some officials say the number may actually fall even lower.
"This is a real tragedy," said Michael Kleiner, head of the Parliament's Immigration and Absorption Committee. "At least half have decided that for the time being they have changed their program. We're talking about a snowball gaining speed."
The Bank of Israel, in a major report just issued, warned that unless the Government immediately carried out fundamental economic changes to create new jobs, up to 200,000 of the Soviet Jews who have just arrived would decide to leave over the next several years.
Even now, the nation's unemployment rate stands at about 11 percent, the highest rate in recent times. By the end of the year, the Bank of Israel's and other economists estimate, the rate could rise to between 13 and 18 percent. And when that happens, the bank study says, thousands of the new immigrants as well as many other Israelis will probably flee.
The study does not try to guess where these people might go. But it seems likely that many would try to move to the United States.
The financial problems causing the rising unemployment are manifold. The economy is heavily state controlled; more than 60 percent of the nation's economic activity is the result of Government-related spending. Year after year the statistics show sluggish growth, double-digit inflation and a currency that seems to be forever declining in value. Those are not conditions that promote the creation of jobs.
Time and time again over the last two decades, public and private economists have urged the Government to divest itself of its extensive, poorly managed business and industrial holdings -- to free up the economy so it can grow and create jobs.
Nonetheless, a new study published by American economists at the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies in Jerusalem says the economy is still "riddled with money-losing state-owned enterprises, a huge Government bureaucracy, dozens of official monopolies and cartels, massive taxpayer subsidies of manufacturers, price controls applied to a quarter of all consumer goods, tariff and nontariff barriers to free trade, foreign exchange controls, Government domination of the capital markets, Government ownership of 93 percent of Israel's land, oppressive levels and rates of taxation and bureaucratic hurdles to entrepreneurship."
Israeli economists acknowledge much of that. But almost every attempt at change is stifled by a Government so tied up in inter-ministerial bickering that it never seems able to carry out any of its plans. Just as important, the all-powerful national labor union representing 90 percent of the state's workers often calls strikes that shut much of the country down when it believes its interests are threatened. Under those twin pressures, little ever seems to change.
In another report, published almost two years ago when the nation's unemployment rate was first approaching 10 percent, the Bank of Israel issued an urgent warning that the Government must immediately put together "a well-thought-out, long-term economic strategy" to create new jobs. "Only a few would deny the need for a drastic reduction in the current level of Government intervention," it added.
Now, Michael Bruno, Governor of the bank, said in an interview this week: "There've been changes. But they've been very, very slow. Too slow."
 
 'Looming Disaster' In Economy Seen
 Alvin Rabushka, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University and the principal author of the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies report, draws a darker conclusion. Israel's leaders, he writes, are making no discernible effort to face up to "the looming disaster of Israel's economy, together with the squalid farce being made of the Russian immigration."
In fact, every plan offered so far to address the unemployment and immigrant absorption problems advocates greater Government intervention in the economy, not less. That is not only because of political inertia. The dozens of Government-controlled enterprises have grown to be an important vehicle for patronage appointments and other political debt-paying.
And so, the institute study says, "the Israeli vision of the future is to continue down the same failed, dismal path of more and bigger Government."
The immediate victims are the Soviet Jews.
Just over 254,000 new immigrants have moved here since January 1990, and more than 90 percent of them are from the Soviet Union.
This comes during a period when most Israelis have had little to feel good about and much to regret, including the Palestinian uprising, endemic political crises, Israel's declining image abroad and most recently the Scud attacks during the Persia Gulf war. But the mass Soviet immigration has seemed the one bright spot on an otherwise bleak horizon, an affirmation that the country was still vital and attractive.
 
 Early Welcome Is Now Fading
 A year ago Israelis were ebullient when the immigration first swelled to a rate exceeding 10,000 people a month. The nation's leaders and hundreds of other people flocked to Ben-Gurion International Airport each night to greet the newcomers with flowers and song.
Now, to many Government officials, the charts illustrating the rising monthly immigration rates last year -- 10,300 in May 1990, 15,294 in July, 35,294 in December -- seem to stand more as a threat, even a rebuke, than as a warm record of accomplishment.
The Government gives all the Soviet immigrants living subsidies -- Israelis call that the "absorption basket" -- to carry them through their first year here. During that time, they are to learn Hebrew, find a place to live and adjust to Israeli society.
Some find at least part-time work in that time. But the vast majority enter the serious job market only when their subidies run out. And with few if any new jobs available, the graphs showing last year's arrivals are now seen as predictors of this year's unemployment problem -- 10,300 more jobless Soviet Jews this month, 15,294 more in July and so on.
Already, the Government reported this week, of the 124,000 people looking for jobs in March, 40,000 were recent Soviet immigrants.
Few new jobs are being created for these people because over the last five months, the Israeli economy has shown no growth, largely because of war-related problems.
And even the predicted improvement in the year's second half seems unlikely to keep pace with the rapid rise in the population brought on by immigration. That was true last year, too. Israel's gross national product grew by about 5.5 percent; growth rates typically fluctuate over a wider range here than in the United States because Israel has a far smaller economy. But population grew by more than 6 percent in 1990, meaning that "as a measure of potential living standards," Mr. Bruno said, the economy showed a decline.
 
 Pathetic Stories About the Desperate
 As a result, the Israeli press is filled with pathetic stories about desperate, hungry, unemployed immigrants.
The cover article in last week's Jerusalem Post weekend magazine carried the headline, "Dire economic conditions drive some Russian women to the streets as prostitutes." The Jerusalem Report, a weekly news magazine, carries an article this week on "Soviet immigrants drowning their absorption troubles in alcoholism." And a spate of news reports in recent days have quoted grocery store managers nationwide who say hungry Soviet Jews are increasingly turning to shoplifting.
For a long time, many immigration officials tended to gloss over these problems, trying to focus public attention instead on the drama of the mass migration. But now they are unable to avoid talking about the dark side of the phenomenon.
"The lack of employment starts to be a problem that will bring very terrible demonstrations in the summer when tens of thousands of these people finish their absorption baskets and there won't be any work for them," warned Moshe Nativ, director general of the Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental organization largely responsible for bringing the immigrants here.
Just a few weeks ago, the most immediate problem seemed to be the crushing housing shortage. Though some new prefabricated homes are now going up, homes remain in short supply. Nevertheless, the focus of concern has now turned from housing to unemployment. As Simcha Dinitz, head of the Jewish Agency, put it, "If you have a house and you don't have a job, then all you have is a place to sit and think about the fact that you are unemployed.
"The problem here is hope," he added in an interview. "We have to try not to destroy their hope that they will eventually find a comfortable place in this society."
 
 Soviet Jews 'Waiting to See'
 Because of his job, Mr. Dinitz has usually been one of the most boosterish of Israel's immigration officials. A month ago, when Soviet immigration started picking up again after a severe drop during the gulf war, he happily predicted in an interview that the number of immigrants in March, 13,386, would nearly double in April, to 25,000. This estimate was based on the number of Soviet Jews applying for visas at the Israeli Consulate in Moscow.
In fact, the April number turned out to be 15,885. And now even Mr. Dinitz acknowledges that "many Soviet Jews are extending their Israeli visas for an additional period of time," adding, "They are postponing their departure, waiting to see what will happen here."
If the nation's economic problems are not remedied quickly, he added, "the number coming here will drop, even if the situation in the Soviet Union remains tense."
"It's already started," he said. "And even those who have already come here will start looking for a way out. They will look at Israel as a transit station, not a final destination."
To Mr. Dinitz as well as most other Israelis, this would be viewed as nothing short of a national tragedy. And to avert that, Government ministers are racing to offer plans for creating jobs. All the proposals, however, seem to share one feature -- greater Government intervention or control of the economy.
As an example, late last month Finance Minister Yitzhak Modaii suggested that Israel's large industrial concerns create new positions for 50,000 immigrants who would work as "helpers" for one to two years; the Government would pay their salaries. But Parliament scornfully rejected the idea.
Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz proposed that the Government intervene in virtually every sector of the economy to force employers to hire 85,000 Soviet Jews.
Mr. Dinitz's plan involves Government intervention, too.
"Look, I'm all for privatization and everything," he said. "But this is like a war we are fighting, and wars are not fought by private companies." With that, he called for extensive new Government-directed projects to build and improve the country's infrastructure.
 
 Top Leadership Seen as Absent
 No matter their merit, none of these or any of the other plans proposed in recent weeks or months has been put in place.
"It's not that there's no plan," said Ora Namir, head of the Parliament' s Labor Committee. "There's a whole library of plans of all the Government ministries to deal with the employment problems. The problem is the absence of the Prime Minister to direct the problem is very blatant."
On Tuesday, Mr. Dinitz led a delegation of international Jewish figures to what they described as an "urgent meeting" with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to discuss "the crisis." Mr. Dinitz said they had urged him to take over direct control of the Government's immigration policy. A participant in the meeting said Mr. Shamir had expressed sympathy and sincere interest but made no promises to take any specific new steps.
Looking over it all, Shaul Amor, a respected member of the Parliament's Finance Committee from Mr. Shamir's Likud Party, called for "an emergency plan to stop this terrible deterioration in the unemployment situation."
But then, sadly, he concluded, "I don't believe that there will be any change."

HEADLINE: The Fresh Air Fund, at 115, Seeks Families and Donations

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
For thousands of children living in the city's poorest neighborhoods, summer vacation means sitting on stoops or watching street life from fire escapes and tenement windows.
But 10,000 children will have the chance to roll in the grass, swim in a pond and gaze at a starry country sky through the efforts of the Fresh Air Fund, which today begins its 115th annual fund-raising campaign. 
 The Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency, has given poor city children summer vacations in the country since 1877, when the Rev. Willard Parsons of Sherman, Pa., asked members of his rural congregation to open their homes to children from New York's slums. Since then, more than 1.6 million children have had Fresh Air Fund vacations.
Through its "Friendly Towns" program, city children between 6 and 16 years old go live with volunteer families.
 
Picking Up Bugs
 For 9-year-old Wendy Quintanilla of the Bronx, a Fresh Air Fund summer is one of simple pleasures. It means swimming, playing on the beach and picnicking with her hosts, Kent and Laurel Morsch in Killingworth, Conn. She has spent the last two summers with them, in a neighborhood she says is filled with "pools, houses and birds." She likes to watch and pick up frogs and bugs, but lets them go "wherever they want." And last summer, she rode a "beautiful black horse" at a nearby farm, and has won the grand prize in a Fresh Air Fund drawing contest.
Last year, stemming a 20-year decline, the fund increased its number of host families, said its executive director, Jenny Morgenthau. It formed more committees to recruit families, Ms. Morgenthau said, since its traditional corps of volunteers -- homemakers -- has greatly diminished.
Now, about 7,000 families in 316 towns have a Fresh Air Fund child in their house for two weeks or more. Some live just minutes from the city; others are as far away as Vermont, Maine and Canada.
About 2,500 more children go to four Fresh Air Fund camps on a 3,000-acre site in Fishkill, N.Y., in Dutchess County. The camps include a planetarium, a wildlife refuge, a wilderness trail and a model farm. Last year, the fund began to send homeless families to camp on weekends. It also operates a "career awareness camp" in August for 100 junior high school children, and a "career awareness" program throughout the year that stresses responsibility, independence and goal-making, Ms. Morgenthau said.
This year, she said, more parents than ever want to give their children a respite from the sweltering streets.
"Given the recession and budget cuts," she said, "city parents are really dying to get their kids out. They want to give them a break."
It costs $314 for the Fund to sent a child to a family and $819 to send a child to a camp. Most of the expenses are for insurance and transportation. One-fifth of the budget is spent on administration and fund-raising. Because it is a member of United Way, which solicits donations through corporations, the fund cannot seek other corporate sponsorship. About 80 percent of its donations come from individuals.
 
Choose Age and Sex
 The Fund hopes to raise $3.7 million by October, and now has about $1.7 million.
Children are chosen based on financial need. Many come from families on public assistance, and are referred by 54 social-service agencies.
Like Wendy Quintanilla, about 60 percent of the children who stay with families are invited back again, and many stay longer than two weeks. A host can choose the age and sex of the guest. Families with a disabled child often invite children who have a similar disability.
Some Fresh Air Fund children stay in touch with their families for a long time. Ms. Morgenthau said she knows of a man in his 70's who still visits his host "father" in his 90's. And many families stay in touch with their Fresh Air Fund children throughout the year, she said, spending holidays with them and watching them grow up.
Donations may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10018. Families who wish to be hosts may call (800) 367-0003 or (212) 221-0900.

HEADLINE: Commencement;
Baker, at Rice, Hails Exploit of a Forebear

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d spoke at Rice University in Houston yesterday, 60 years after his grandfather delivered the commencement address there.
Mr. Baker did not mention his recent trip to the Middle East or the progress of peace talks in the region. 
 But he told an audience of 3,000 how his grandfather, Capt. James A. Baker, a Houston lawyer, unraveled the mystery surrounding the death of the university's founder, William Marsh Rice.
Rice was poisoned in 1900 by his valet, who forged a will and had planned to steal his money, which included the university's endowment, Mr. Baker said.
But Captain Baker uncovered the plot and saved the endowment. He was often described as "a big Texan who could not be corrupted by any means," Mr. Baker said, and is considered the university's foster father.
 
'Work Hard, Study Hard'
 "It was the captain who told me, 'Work hard, study hard and stay out of politics,' " Mr. Baker said. "Well, two out of three isn't bad."
Mr. Baker warned against the proliferation of weapons around the world and the influence of war on younger generations.
"Fragile democracies need stable economies and a secure environment in which to grow," he said. "New generations can be caught in a vicious cycle of drug use and trafficing, and terrorists can exploit the instabilities of change for their own ends."
Mr. Baker, who graduated from Princeton University, has kept close ties to Rice. In 1985, he donated his papers as former Treasury Secretary to the university's Woodson Research Center.
But it is Captain Baker's protrait that hangs in Baker College, a campus dormitory.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Continue to Rise in New York Area, Brokers Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
An upswing in home sales that began in January has been sustained in three months of active buying across New York City and its suburbs, real-estate executives and lenders say.
Although the housing market remains subdued compared to the mid-1980's, and selling prices in many cases remain more than 20 percent lower than their peak, demand has clearly strengthened since last year. Lenders report greater demand for mortgages, real-estate brokers say their sales volume has increased sharply, and people who have been looking at homes for a year or more say they have now decided to buy as sellers have become less willing to give steep discounts. 
 The recovery appears strongest for lower-priced homes, and some experts say that it may be short-lived. But as the industry is poised at the start of the traditional summer buying season, many others believe that the region's long housing slump has reached an end.
 
Waiting for Rock Bottom
 Michael Neglia, a New Jersey civil engineer, became a buyer recently with his fiancee, Christine Knack, after they made up their minds that the tide had turned. "Our strategy has been to wait until the market hit rock bottom, and I think we've succeeded," he said. They contracted early in April to buy a three-bedroom home in Westwood for $185,000, only $1,000 less than the seller had asked. One reason he bid that high, Mr. Neglia said, is that he had missed out on four other houses after bidding too low.
"Nobody can say for certain that we've bottomed out, but we sure have come down from the peak," said Charles Becker, a human-resources executive who moved to Manhattan from Chicago a year ago, rented an apartment, and last month contracted to buy a three-bedroom cooperative, in need of a new kitchen and bathrooms, on East 86th Street near Park Avenue.
"I don't see much downside risk," he added.
In a sequence that brokers say has become increasingly common recently, Mr. Becker said his first bid for the apartment was countered by someone else who offered more money. He then raised his bid, agreeing to a price that he declined to disclose, but said was in the "low-$400,000 range." It was also $23,000 more than the seller had originally asked.
 
High-End Sales Lag
 Demand appears strongest for moderately priced homes within the reach of first-time buyers. Thousands of higher-priced homes -- suburban houses priced over $300,000 and Manhattan apartments priced over $500,000 -- are languishing on the market, and some experts say the slump will continue for people trying to sell these properties.
"We may have to see prices ratchet down a little more," said Therese E. Byrne, a real-estate analyst for Salomon Brothers, the securities firm. She added that the recent sales spurt may simply be a "false bottom" in the slump that has been prompted by an exaggerated sense of consumer confidence that came with end of the Persian Gulf war.
Indeed, although no one knows for certain why the upswing began in January, experts say it corresponded to a surge in confidence that was also reflected in stock trading when the air war began in the gulf in January.
But that confidence may be eroded as employers in the New York area, struggling with the recession, announce more layoffs this year, Ms. Byrne said.
Inventories of unsold homes remain large, and there is no evidence of a return of the buying frenzy the propelled the market before 1987.
Nor will any continued upswing in sales necessarily be spread equally across the region. Suburban markets, where hundreds of new homes have been sold at auction over the last year, now have smaller excess inventories, and some experts believe that those markets will strengthen more quickly than New York City, where a spate of auctions are planned this year and serious problems continue to plague many poorly financed cooperative apartment buildings.
 
'Very Strong Demand'
 Still, applications for mortgage loans have increased sharply. Although lenders attribute part of the increase to homeowners seeking to refinance at lower rates, they say most of the demand comes from buyers.
"This has to mean very strong demand for new purchases," said Ellen Feldschreiber, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, one of the New York region's largest brokers of mortgage loans from more than 20 banks and savings and loans. She said the number of applications rose 39 percent in February, 47 percent in March, and 42 percent in the first three weeks of April, compared with last year.
Industry executives say sales increases are not yet reflected in the numbers of real-estate closings, which are normally used as a gauge of market activity, but which follow the execution of sales contracts by two months or more.
But the number of new contracts, which generally require the buyer to make a substantial down payment, is on the rise. In Manhattan, Douglas Elliman, a brokerage and management company that deals in expensive cooperatives and condominiums, said it had executed 242 sales contracts from Jan. 1 to April 25, compared with only 134 in the comparable period of 1990.
Another large Manhattan broker, the Corcoran Group, said new contracts began to increase in February, when its customers signed 35, compared with 26 a year earlier. In March and the first three weeks of April, its sales volume more than doubled, with 97 contracts signed.
In Westchester County and Bergen County, the number of new sales contracts was about the same in the first three months of the year compared to the year earlier, but brokers in both counties said sales activity picked up momentum in March and April.
"We think there is no question this market has passed bottom," said Ralph R. Ragette, a broker in Eastchester and president of the Westchester Board of Realtors. He said sales by his own company increased 15 percent in January, 7 percent in February and 25 percent in March.
In a report last month, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group in Washington, said existing home sales rose 0.6 percent across the nation in March compared with last year, the second consecutive monthly increase. It said sales in the Northeast were particularly strong, rising 4 percent.
 
Competing Bids
 With demand strongest for relatively inexpensive homes, analysts say it is too early to tell whether enough of these properties will be sold during the summer to create a fresh surge of demand for more expensive homes, as people move up to larger, newer and better located residences.
One family that has managed to move up is the Hellers -- Harvey, Debra and their 8-year-old triplets -- who in early April contracted to buy a four-bedroom home in Pomona, in Rockland County, for a price in the "mid-$200,000 range." They first had to sell a three-bedroom house in Spring Valley, which they put on the market, priced at $207,000, in January 1990.
Mrs. Heller said they grew so frustrated trying to sell the Spring Valley house by December, when their asking price had come down to $184,000, that they took it off the market. But when they listed it again on March 1 for $179,900, she said, buyers lined up.
The next day, a Saturday, two house-hunters were in her living room making competing bids, she said. The Hellers accepted $176,500 from one of the bidders; hours later, someone else arrived who offered to pay their full asking price if the sales agreement fell through.
"People still want to buy houses," Mrs. Heller said. "I just don't think this market is going any lower."

HEADLINE: Causes of Crisis: 7 Fat Years, Then Recession

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
For months a faltering economy and plummeting tax receipts have set the rhythm for the Dinkins administration as it scrambled to stay ahead of the bad news.
While Mayor David N. Dinkins may eventually be held to account for some of the confusing steps his administration has taken -- like offering pay raises the city could not afford or announcing and then not making thousands of layoffs -- many of the city's problems have far deeper roots. The Federal Government has systematically cut its commitment to cities, the state may be in worse financial straits than the city, and the city bureaucracy added 49,000 jobs during the 1980's, far more than justified by revenues. 
 But the most pressing cause of the current budget turmoil is the recession, which has already rolled through most of the economy, from Wall Street to restaurants to retailing. It slashed, by the State Comptroller's estimate, 44,000 jobs last year, the worst job loss since the 1970's. Most economists expect at least as many jobs to be lost this year -- and the taxes those wage-earners paid will be lost too.
 
'Seven Fat Years'
 This blow was especially powerful because city government grew so extraordinarily during what one fiscal analyst called "the seven fat years" -- roughly 1983 to 1990. The economy had been bubbling, and, for a while, tax revenues poured in faster than the city's bookkeepers expected, letting the city take on burdens it could not support when the economy weakened.
During those years, the number of employees in city agencies and schools soared by 49,000, a 25 percent increase, replacing virtually everyone cut during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. And, with enormous political and social pressures to expand government services to the poor and homeless, spending began growing faster than dependable tax revenues could. The difference was made up by a variety of gimmicks and one-time revenues.
During the 1980's, Federal aid to the city was slashed more than 50 percent, city officials said. When Federal subsidies for centers for the elderly and day care for children were cut, for instance, the city made up the difference instead of closing centers. If the Federal Government was paying the same share of the city budget as it was a decade ago, officials said, Washington would be sending the city $2.5 billion more, enough to solve most of the city's budget problems.
 
Bill-Paying Problems
 New York State, which provided critical aid to the city in the last crisis, is hardly in a position to help this time. Faced with his own budget deficit, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed slashing aid to the city by $600 million. An impasse between legislators and the Governor over passing a budget has undermined confidence that the city will be able to pay its bills at the end of next month.
Union leaders say the state lowered income-tax rates too much during the 1980's, resulting in deeper revenue losses than expected. "They ended up cutting taxes by billions more than they expected," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "A major mistake, big time."
When Mr. Dinkins took office last year, there were already warnings about fiscal problems. In an early symbolic decision, he delayed the hiring of one class of police officers until he was sure the city could pay for them.
But many of the administration's budget-cutting efforts remained more symbolic than real, independent fiscal analysts said. For example, to balance the current budget, Mr. Dinkins used $500 million from bond refinancings by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which sells bonds on behalf of the city.
And the work force continued to grow. Now, despite more than 1,000 layoffs and attrition at many agencies, there are still more people on the city payroll than there were a year ago. Just last week, despite the fiscal troubles, 2,000 more police officers -- paid for through special taxes -- were hired.
Fiscal analysts have repeatedly warned the Mayor that he faces years of a continuing imbalance between expected spending and revenues.
"You have to give both the Mayor and the Governor their due in recognizing national and local economic problems," said Raymond D. Horton, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a research group supported by businesses. "But when you strip all that away, there is a failure of public policy as well."
Last October, in one lurching week, Mr. Dinkins approved an unexpectedly expensive labor settlement for teachers, proposed a sweeping expansion of the police, and then, in an abrupt reversal, froze hiring and said he was considering laying off 15,000 workers.
A few months later, he announced 11,000 layoffs, but almost no one actually was let go. Teachers were spared when they agreed to defer a portion of their wage increase. Nearly all other Civil Service employees were spared when the Mayor decided to use attrition instead.
Since January, Mr. Dinkins has been unsuccessfully seeking to negotiate concessions with other unions -- wage deferrals, furloughs or reduced benefits.
But union leaders dismissed these, asking what they would get in return. They have refused to concede anything more until the Mayor develops a plan showing how the city will extricate itself from its worsening problems.
So, as the fiscal picture darkened and Mr. Dinkins faced a May 10th deadline to present his budget, he finally put together a detailed plan for deep slashes in city services and presented it yesterday to the Governor, union leaders, and city officials at Gracie Mansion.

Some of the items that would be eliminated under the budget Mayor Dinkins proposed yesterday:
 
Use of the Central Park Zoo
Drug-treatment services for women and children.
Vision and hearing examinations for public school children.
Outpatient pharmacies at city hospitals.
Dental clinics
Garbage recycling, for a year.
Light from 73,750 street lamps.
1 Staten Island ferry boat.
Use of all 32 outdoor swimming pools.
All lifeguards at beaches on Staten Island and half of those in Queens and the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Identity Becomes Central to Debate as Democrats Prepare for 1992 Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DES MOINES, May 4

 BODY:
The quest has begun yet again to define what a Democrat is and what a Democrat stands for, in a way that can attract a majority of the voters.
During the Democrats' long exile from the White House the quadrennial search for "new ideas" has often seemed a grim and bloodless exercise. But in recent weeks, even as many in the party acknowledge the long odds against them in the 1992 Presidential election, the debate over ideas, themes and messages has acquired some vigor and even drawn some blood. 
 Some broad outlines of the 1992 model of the Democratic candidate, if the party's centrists have their way, are emerging: He or she is passionately solicitous of the middle class, consumed with education and training, committed to change in social welfare programs and concerned about health care, but, of course, also fiscally responsible.
 
Nominee Will Define Party
 The national Democratic Party will be largely defined by its choice of Presidential nominee, and that race is still in its earliest stages, with the former Massachusetts Senator, Paul E. Tsongas, becoming the first official candidate this week. But other potential candidates, including Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, are testing campaign themes.
And this weekend, two groups of Democrats are adding their voices to the debate: the Coalition for Democratic Values, a liberal group meeting here today, and the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrists and conservatives who are gathering Sunday in Cleveland.
The leadership council, which is pushing hard for a redefined Democratic Party that is closer to what it sees as the nation's political center, has already engendered some friction, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a principal standard-bearer for the party's left.
Recent history is not auspicious for Democrats who hope to redefine their party. Gary Hart built his 1984 campaign for the Presidential nomination around the promise of "new ideas" and a break from the liberal orthodoxy of the past; party regulars gave the nomination to Walter F. Mondale, the candidate of organized labor and other traditional constituent groups.
Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, struggled to present himself as a new kind of Democrat, a non-ideological manager who resisted the liberal label, only to be devastatingly cast by the Republicans as a soft-on-crime, card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.
 
'A New Politics'
 Still, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, chairman of the leadership council and a potential Presidential candidate in 1992, argues that there is a growing movement among Democrats for "a new politics."
Both parties, he says, are groping for a vision beyond Reaganism in a process that should have occurred in the 1988 Presidential campaign but did not. "The steam had run out of the logic of the Reagan revolution and nobody wanted to go back to 'The Federal Government can solve all your problems and we've got the money to do it,' " Mr. Clinton said recently in Little Rock.
Most of the ferment in the party is over domestic policy; there is widespread agreement among Democrats that this is their strong suit and their best chance of returning to power. Moreover, after the war in the Persian Gulf, in which most Congressional Democrats voted against the President on the use-of-force resolution, many Democrats have little stomach for an internal review on foreign policy.
One of the most striking parts of the domestic message that is emerging is the impassioned appeal to the middle class that is being expressed in proposals including tax breaks and college scholarship programs.
The outrage that liberals long brought to the plight of the poor is now being extended to working families who, many Democrats contend, have been squeezed and buffeted in the 1980's. "Middle-class families pay more taxes than they ever have and the average weekly wage, after taxes, is lower now than it was in 1959, one year before John F. Kennedy challenged this country to get moving again," Mr. Gore said in a recent speech.
 
Dealing With the Spending Label
 There is a powerful political imperative behind this: Democrats are keenly aware that they lost much of the middle class to the tax-cutting Republicans in the 1980's and that they became increasingly viewed as a big-spending party most concerned with the poor. Republicans assert that Democrats will have a hard time changing this image because the Democratic-controlled Congress has a history of ever-fatter budgets and ever-higher taxes.
But Mr. Wilder, who has the advantage of being a Washington outsider, has put fiscal responsibility at the heart of his message. The Virginia Governor, who will speak to both Democratic groups meeting this weekend, told the liberals gathered here today that "the biggest threat to this nation's future prosperity" was "those Washington insiders who have mismanaged the American people's tax dollars for far too many years."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who is expected to embark on some national travel after reaching a state budget agreement, has been arguing that the Federal Government has been abdicating its responsibilities and foisting its burdens onto the states.
Many Democrats are also putting a new emphasis on values. For example, Mr. Clinton talks about injecting more personal responsibility into government programs. "Democrats need to say there are people who need our help, that we have to help," he said. "But we should only take money from middle-class taxpayers and give it to other people who need it if we also require them to behave responsibly with the money we give them."
 
The Theme of Competitiveness
 This would include requiring welfare recipients to pursue education, training and job placement and "cracking down on child-support violators," he said.
Democrats are also returning to the theme of economic competitiveness in the world marketplace, with a new emphasis on the importance of education and training. Mr. Tsongas, running as a pro-business liberal, is urging Democrats to reject the politics of rich-versus-poor and to focus instead on helping businesses compete.
While there is considerable consensus on many of these themes, some people on the party's left, notably Mr. Jackson, are sounding alarms. Mr. Jackson, who has a long history of friction with the leadership council, was clearly miffed at not being invited to speak in Cleveland, and particularly after Al From, the head of the council, defended the decision.
Council officials said Mr. Jackson would be welcome as a participant, but Mr. Jackson, who accuses the council of pushing the "suburbanization" of the Democratic Party, declined.
This morning's meeting of liberals, meanwhile, opened with fiery populist rhetoric, including pointed criticism of the proposed free-trade treaty with Mexico. The treaty is supported by many party centrists, but strongly opposed by much of organized labor because of its potential impact on jobs.
As the Democrats began their latest exercise in self-definition, Mr. Tsongas issued a quiet warning this morning. Democrats face two dangers, he said: heading in the path of the British Labor Party and remaining ideologically pure and out of power, or becoming "Republican wannabes" and losing their souls.

HEADLINE: Bangor Journal;
Maine Refines the Welcome Home

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGOR, Me., May 2

 BODY:
Since long before dawn, about 50 men, women and children had waited in the Bangor International Airport terminal for the next plane load of troops to arrive from the Persian Gulf.
And like any other group of adoring fans, they came offering "Welcome Home" posters, homemade cookies, beers and cheers. 
 "You're back, you're back!" called 42-year-old Valerie Bellomy to the 201 bleary-eyed members of the Army 62d and 223d transportation companies who tramped into the terminal. "I don't know any of them," she said. "But we want them to know how grateful we are for what they did for our country."
For most small towns across the country, such celebrations have happened once or twice since the Persian Gulf war ended. But here in Bangor, which has the closest American airport to Europe as well as low landing and refueling fees, jetloads of soldiers have stopped daily on their way home. The homecoming scene has taken on a life of its own.
Day after day, and often in the middle of the night, up to 1,500 Mainers have crowded into the tiny terminal here to offer hugs and back slaps to the troops.
Like many others in the crowd, Mrs. Bellomy and her two daughters, Mary Jane and Adrian, have greeted all but a few of the flights. That means crazy sleeping schedules, missed classes and hours of waiting in the airport.
More than 50,000 troops have stopped here on their way home from the gulf, making Bangor, a city of 35,000 people, the busiest port of entry in the country for homecoming soldiers.
"This is beautiful," said Specialist Thomas Gay, who grabbed a rambunctious handshake from a flannel-shirted man with long blond hair.
"Hey, man, welcome back, welcome back," said James P. Sargent, 43, of West Sullivan, Me.
Not far away, Specialist Rene Ely, whose transportation company was on its way to Fort Bliss, Tex., autographed a souvenir shirt.
"I'm just so happy to see these people here," said the 21-year-old soldier, who was returning from six months in the desert. "I figured we'd be forgotten about because you don't hear that much about us," she said, blinking back tears.
For Maine, a sparsely populated, rural state, the big welcome has seemed a bit out of step. Maine bills itself as a hospitable place, a "vacationland," but one sticker often seen on truck bumpers reads, "Welcome to Maine -- Now Go Home."
Still, in a state with a small-town state of mind, neighborliness is a way of life, residents say. The airport celebrations, which began with a small group of patriotic Bangor residents, offer the best of both worlds. The celebrations are a way to experience the happiness over the gulf victory, and to show support for the troops without long-term involvement. The troop layovers last an hour or so.
So far, enthusiasm for the homecomings has continued to mount. At a time when most other news revolves around the depressed regional economy and rising unemployment, the euphoria of the homecoming celebrations has been a welcome relief, residents say.
Daily updates on arrivals are broadcast on local radio stations and printed in The Bangor Daily News. A special telephone recording was set up to give round-the-clock troop flight information.
Military officials say news of the greetings here has been passed on to other troops soon to embark, prompting numerous requests from soldiers to return through Bangor.
Americans from as far away as Connecticut and Prince Edward Island have come to Bangor.
"I'm here because I just wanted to welcome them home," said Linda Graham, who rode a bus five hours from Boston.
"I lost my job recently, and I heard about this and just wanted to come," she said, as the troops reboarded their jet after an hour of celebrating. "This is meat for the soul."

HEADLINE: Health of Kenya Political Prisoner Seen as Perilous

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 4

 BODY:
A prominent Kenyan editor and lawyer, whose imprisonment in solitary confinement by the Government here has raised international protests, is in deteriorating health and may be suffering from a brain tumor, medical tests indicate.
The editor, Gitobu Imanyara, who is 37 years old, was taken from his prison cell to a Nairobi hospital, after having seizures during a court bail hearing. A Government physician, Dr. Paul G. Kioy, said in a medical report that there was "a real possibility of an intracranial structural abnormality." Mr. Imanyara's own physician, Dr. Gichuru Kuria, wrote a medical report for the courts that said that if Mr. Imanyara was kept in solitary confinement, he could "easily asphyxiate to death if he gets a grand mal seizure while alone in a room."
 
Decision on Bail Soon
 Mr. Imanyara faces a bail ruling on Wednesday. He has been denied bail on five occasions since being arrested more than eight weeks ago, after the publication of the February issue of the Nairobi Law Monthly. Since April 22, he has been in Kenyatta Hospital receiving treatment and undergoing tests. 
 The Government has charged him with sedition, citing an editorial that suggested that some posts were being allotted according to an individual's tribe.
Mr. Imanyara, the winner of several international journalism awards this year, had also been arrested and detained last year. He faces a second sedition charge arising from a 1990 issue of the magazine that called for a multi-party system in Kenya.
Mr. Imanyara's case and poor condition presents a difficult problem for senior Government officials who control the judiciary and in effect will decide whether the editor is granted bail.
President Daniel arap Moi and his close associate, Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott, are described by diplomats and lawyers here as hard-liners on Mr. Imanyara. The editor's magazine, with its legal articles and pro-democracy point of view, attracts a significant readership in cities and towns.
 
The Foreign Aid Factor
 Others in the Government believe that Kenya cannot afford further cuts in economic aid from Western donors, which might come if Mr. Imanyara is kept in prison. These officials, aware of Kenya's weak economy and of the popular frustration that results, expect an international outcry if anything happens to Mr. Imanyara while he is in custody.
In an unusually swift reaction from Washington, the State Department called his arrest "another denial of freedom of expression in Kenya," and called on the Government to release Mr. Imanyara without delay.
Western diplomats in Nairobi said that Kenya's major donors -- the Nordic countries, Germany and even Japan, which normally remains silent on internal political questions -- had urged the Kenya Government to free Mr. Imanyara or face the possibility of aid reductions.
In Congress, the Imanyara case has helped prompt increasing disaffection toward Kenya, which used to be a favorite African aid recipient.
The new foreign assistance bill offers no increase in aid to Kenya, in contrast to other nations, which have been designated to receive part of an overall 20 percent increase in aid to Africa.

HEADLINE: BUSH SEES THREAT TO FLOW OF IDEAS ON U.S. CAMPUSES

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., May 4

 BODY:
In a commencement address at the University of Michigan today, President Bush attacked what he called the "notion of 'political correctness,' " saying it had led to "inquisition," "censorship" and "bullying" on some college campuses.
In a speech devoted to three "freedoms" -- "enterprise, speech and spirit" -- the President joined a growing political backlash against the idea that free speech should be subordinated to the civil rights of women and minority members. 
 "Ironically, on the 200th anniversary of our Bill of Rights, we find free speech under assault throughout the United States, including on some college campuses," Mr. Bush told an audience of 8,300 graduates and more than 55,000 others gathered in the University of Michigan football stadium.
 
Old Prejudices and New
 "The notion of 'political correctness' has ignited controversy across the land," he said. "And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism, sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudices with new ones. It declares certain topics off-limits, certain expressions off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits. What began as a cause for civility has soured into a cause of conflict and even censorship."
Today's speech was Mr. Bush's first on an issue that has divided campuses around the nation.
In the first of five commencement speeches he will make over the next few weeks, the President wanted to address where America is headed domestically in the wake of the Persian Gulf war.
Believing that Americans feel a mixture of optimism and anxiety about the state of the nation, Mr. Bush sought to move his "kinder, gentler" rhetoric a step forward, exploring attitudes on racism and sexism and raising the level of the public debate on tolerance toward minorities, asking whether it can be "federalized," as he put it, or whether it is a matter of individual responsibility.
The speech to Michigan graduates reflected the influence of the President's new head speech writer, Anthony Snow, a former editorial writer for The Washington Times, who was hired to bring a harder edge and ideological spirit to Mr. Bush's speeches as he moves toward the 1992 election.
Mr. Snow is working with Dorrance Smith, the President's new assistant for media affairs, and David Demarest, the director of communications, to make Mr. Bush's speeches more pointed and topical. White House officials said the three felt that the hot topic of political correctness could be used as a vehicle to talk about the need to promote, but not legislate, tolerance on the nation's campuses.
White House officials said the speech fit into a pattern of Presidential positions on civil rights. For instance, in opposing the Congressional measure that would have made it easier to sue employers for job discrimination, Mr. Bush said the Government should fight bigotry, but not if that meant court-imposed quotas for women and minority members.
At Michigan today, Mr. Bush said that Americans should be alarmed at the rise of intolerance and bigotry but that they should also be alarmed at the "growing tendency to use intimidation rather than reason in settling disputes."
 
'Division and Derision'
 "Neighbors who disagree no longer settle matters over a cup of coffee," he said. "They hire lawyers and go to court. Political extremists roam the land, abusing the privilege of free speech, setting citizens against one another on the basis of their class or race. Such bullying is outrageous. It's not worthy of a great nation grounded in the values of tolerance and respect. Let us fight back against the boring politics of division and derision."
"Political correctness" originated as an ironic term for a broad range of generally liberal attitudes, especially in support of expanded rights for women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals. But it has been seized by many conservatives and traditionalists, on campus and off, as a term of derision for those who espouse such attitudes to the exclusion of other rights, especially free speech.
In one celebrated case this academic year, Brown University expelled a student who shouted racist slurs, touching off a debate about freedom of speech on campus. In New York in March, a City College faculty committee rebuked two professors, one black and the other white, for comments about racial superiority; the case raised the question whether academic freedom included the right to espouse inflammatory teachings and beliefs about race and culture.
In a third case, Nina Wu, a sophomore at the University of Connecticut, was ordered to move off campus after gay students protested a sign she had posted on her dorm room making fun of "preppies," "bimbos," "men without chest hair" and "homos." After a Federal lawsuit was threatened, the university let her move back on campus and revised its code of conduct.
 
Praise for Ford and King
 At Michigan today, the President said he would focus on "the nature of freedom," and he praised Americans like Henry Ford and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for having the "vision" to "transform a world."
"When governments try to improve on freedom, say by picking winners and losers in the economic market, they fail," he said. And he criticized government programs that "have tried to assume roles once reserved for families and schools and churches."
"This crusade backfired," he said of President Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" program to fight poverty. "Programs designed to insure racial harmony generated animosity. Programs intended to help people out of poverty invited dependency. We should have learned that while the ideals behind the Great Society were noble, and indeed they were, the programs weren't always up to the task.
 
Call for a 'Good Society'
 "We need a 'Good Society' built upon the deeds of the many -- a society that promotes selflessness and action. The Good Society does not demand agonizing sacrifice. It requires something within everyone's reach: common decency and commitment.
Mr. Bush has himself been attacked over the issues of free speech and divisiveness to which he devoted most of today's speech.
In 1989, critics complained that he was interfering with the Bill of Rights when he proposed a constitutional amendment against burning or destroying the American flag. And in the 1988 campaign, he and his campaign manager, Lee Atwater, were accused of practicing the politics of racial division with the campaign advertisements focusing on Willie Horton, a black convict who raped a white Maryland woman. Before Mr. Atwater died this year at the age of 40, he apologized for that campaign tactic.
Though Mr. Bush was heckled today by a small group of students who opposed the Persian Gulf war, the response was generally warm. Walter Harrison, Michigan's executive director for university relations, said the debate over "political correctness" had been "engaged here now for the last year," and he called the President's speech "helpful, to the extent that it opens the discourse on this issue."

Shooting Fish Has Become an Endangered Sport

BYLINE: By Richard D. Lyons

DATELINE: SOUTH HERO ISLAND, Vt.

 BODY:
John Roy peered out the kitchen window of his 200-year-old farmhouse atop this island in Lake Champlain, pointed with his pipestem to the neighboring marsh and ticked off the reasons why nostalgia isn't what it used to be, at least not for him.
"When I was a boy I used to catch frogs down there in the creek, but now the frogs are gone," the amiable dairy farmer said. "But what I liked to do most then and now is shoot pickerel and it looks like this might be the last year I can because they're trying to take it away." 
 On a sunny day Roy takes his Springfield .30-06 bolt action rifle out of the closet, puts on his waders, ambles across the road to the marsh, trudges through the muck to a tree stump that gives a firm footing, and peers into the shallow water waiting for a fish. The most popular are pickerel, but other targets include Northern pike, muskies and carp.
At the right movement he points the weapon down, and fires at such an angle that the slug hits the marsh bottom underneath the fish, thus sending out shock waves in the water that stuns the fish and forces it to the surface and into Roy's net.
Deer rifles are the most common, although almost any type of gun may be used, including handguns. A state hunting or fishing license is mandatory, and the law bans shooting from bridges and culverts.
This bizarre method of fishing is allowed only in Lake Champlain and parts of its main tributaries. Indeed, New York and Vermont were the only states in the country where fish shooting was popular and legal for more than a century until Albany banned the practice in 1969. It remains legal only in Vermont, for two months in the spring, but a bill in the State Legislature may be bringing an end to the sport.
"That's the point, it isn't a sport at all," said Representative Jane Mendicino of Essex Junction, one of the bill's main supporters.
 An avid angler since she was a child, Mendicino said using a rifle to catch fish during their spawning season is unsporting because they are then at their most vulnerable and have almost no chance to escape.
She, and others, also have pointed out that shooting can be dangerous because spent slugs can and do ricochet in odd directions, and most importantly, that the hunters' tramping through swamps and marshes during spring spawning season disturbs the eggs and the fry, thus eventually reducing the pool of fish available for others.
"The shooting is depleting our stocks of trophy Northern pike at a time when fishing for them has become extremely popular in Vermont, and surveys have shown a major decline in muskies as well," she said. "This is a threat to our fishing, our recreation and our tourist industry."
Any hint of harm to Vermont tourism sends shivers through a state whose struggling economy has been hit by a fall in farm income and uncertainties in its high tech industries.
Mendicino also is chairwoman of the Fish and Wildlife Committee of the Vermont House, which adopted her bill by voice vote a month ago and she is hoping her bill will be passed by the Senate, where lobbies representing fishing groups are divided on the issue.
Witnesses speaking for clubs of walleye and bass fishermen have supported the argument that shooting threatens important species of fish, a notion bolstered by studies of the State Fish and Wildlife Department.
But members of the Sporting Alliance for Vermont's Environment and the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs have opposed the bill, holding that shooting is a time-honored practice by relatively few people that has little impact.
"You wouldn't find 10 to 15 people in the state still doing it," said George McNeill of the Sporting Alliance, although others put the number in the hundreds, many shooting illegally.
John Roy helped block passage of a similar anti-shooting bill four years ago. A prosperous farmer with 250 cows, Roy has served as a South Hero selectman for 25 years and as such is attuned to the cut and thrust of local politics.
He summed up the opposition saying that if stocks of sportfish are seriously depleted other measures besides banning fish shooting should be taken, such as restricting ice fishing which usually takes place at the start of the spawning season.
"In February and early March you can see guys out on the lake, each with a dozen tip-ups," he said. "Why not restrict their fishing, too, if the stocks are down?" But it may be that which rankles Roy the most is the realization that part of his heritage is being threatened.
Roy's father and grandfather -- the family has lived on the island for more than a century -- were fish shooters and he can remember the time when "my father got 12 fish with one shot, one weighing 19 pounds."
"The kids today have cars and boats and if they want to go fishing, they just head out for the middle of the lake for salmon and trout," Roy said. He noted the drop in rabbit and squirrel hunting, the building of more homes, as well as new roads into the area and said, "The outdoors that I knew as a kid is not here anymore."
"The outdoors that was part of my life, and that of my father and grandfather, is vanishing. I think they call it 'giving way to progress,' but I'm not so sure."

Some Lessons From A Failed Assault On a Japan Inc. Fortress

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
FOR the last two years, T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who hates to be called a corporate raider, has been devoted to a colorful if quixotic effort to breach one of the strongest fortresses in Japanese business, the corporate empire built around the Toyota Motor Company.
Armed with a $1 billion, 26 percent stake in the Koito Manufacturing Company, one of Toyota's key electrical suppliers -- the kind of stake that even the richest Japanese, much less an American, rarely has a shot at obtaining -- Mr. Pickens has battled in Tokyo and on Capitol Hill for a place on the company's board. He acknowledged that he was more interested in making a point than in making headlights: Only from the inside, he contended, could he strip bare how "Japan's cozy system of corporate relationships stops competition, harms consumers, and ultimately spells doom" for American communities when Japanese competition arrives. 
 Last week, just as J. R. Ewing was packing it in on "Dallas," Mr. Pickens said his real-life show, too, had run out of fresh episodes. Koito, and by extension Toyota, had made it clear that no amount of political pressure would force it to allow an unwanted intruder into the tent --- especially one with a reputation as a takeover artist. But his fight shined a bright light on a lot of myths about how a new age of "mutual interdependence" is leading to an inexorable convergence of American and Japanese styles of capitalism. And it has begun to focus the American business community more than ever on the question: Is America wiser in the long term to battle the anti-competitive but highly efficient way Japan organizes its corporate life, or is it wiser to learn from it?
 For years Americans have said that much of the blame for their failures in the Japanese market falls on what the Japanese call "keiretsu," the loose grouping of "family" companies that own chunks of each other's stock, finance each other's operations, supply each other with parts and technology and keep unwanted outsiders at arm's length. Almost every major Japanese company belongs to one; the leaders of the most famous keiretsu, the heads of Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Bank, and numerous other Mitsubishis, meet for a monthly lunch in Tokyo that, if held in New York, would probably land them in Federal court on collusion charges.
 
A Challenge in America>
 Indeed, keiretsu are facing their first real challenge in America: the Federal Trade Commission has begun investigating whether the "American-made" parts for the cars the Japanese are building in the Midwest are really American, or are coming from the subsidiaries of old Japanese suppliers who are following their parents -- and, some charge, freezing out American competitors.
Mr. Pickens encouraged the examination of such practices, though his battle with Koito ultimately failed because there were many unanswered questions about his own dealings. He bought the stock from a Japanese entrepreneur who, after failing to get Toyota to buy it at a premium, took it to Mr. Pickens in hopes that an international incident would arise. He also lent him the money to buy the shares, apparently guaranteeing him against risk.
 That allowed Koito to claim that Mr. Pickens was not the true controller of the stock. So every time Mr. Pickens demanded that Toyota come clean, the Japanese demanded that he do the same.
No one laments the oilman's departure more than the Japanese press, which tried to dress him in cowboy suits, gladly repeated charges about corporate Japan they dared not make themselves, and reveled in the annual-meeting faceoffs between the drawling Texan, the stony-faced Koito management and Japanese gangsters who would fill the meeting room and hurl epithets.
Few doubt what Mr. Pickens would have discovered if he had succeeded in getting onto Koito's board. While the company is publicly held -- Toyota has only a 19 percent share -- its loyalties are solely to Toyota. The firm is run by ex-Toyota executives. When times are tough in Toyota City, Koito agrees to absorb more than its share of the pain. When times are good, Toyota and Koito effectively negotiate over the profits Koito gets.
In short, life for a Japanese supplier like Koito is sometimes uncomfortable, and only marginally profitable. Why do they do it?
In an article in The Harvard Business Review late last year, Kuniyasu Sakai, the owner of several small electronics companies, likened the relationship to that between a daimyo, one of the landholders who commanded Japan's castle towns, and his loyal samurai. "From the day a subcontractor accepts the first contract -- probably from a small subsidiary of one of the giant companies -- it has given up its freedom, it is told what to make, when to put it on line, and how much it will get for it on delivery," Mr. Sakai wrote. Moreover, there is no thought of doing business with others: Nissan would almost never buy from a Toyota supplier, unless ordered to by the government -- as the United States demanded as part of negotiations last year about "structural impediments" to trade.
 
Lessons for America
 Indeed, there is some evidence that the keiretsu system is starting to fray at the edges, partly because of trade pressure and partly because companies further down the food chain are growing more independent. But some Americans say the system has its advantages, for those on the inside.
"There is reliance on one long-term supplier, there is commitment, there is trust, there is technological help early on and there is much lower transaction costs," Joseph Gorman, the head of TRW, a major auto supplier that has struck gold in Japan, said last year.
Keiretsu also means never having to say you are bankrupt: Nissan last year took virtual control over Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subarus, without firing anyone or mounting a takeover. One question now is whether that applies to distant members of a family: Chrysler bought a big stake in Mitsubishi Motors two decades ago and Lee Iacocca is now negotiating for the Japanese company to come to its rescue.
Indeed, the Japanese look at their own economy, and at America's, and say it is a poor time for Washington to be lecturing them about how to organize corporate enterprise.
"General Motors has had all the makings of an integrated system like ours," a senior Toyota executive said recently. "It has a huge network of captive suppliers. It has its own financing system. It just never learned to use it right."

Rome's 100-Year Hunt For a Middle Ground

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
AN aura of secrecy has long surrounded the Vatican. But one of its best-kept secrets has been entirely unintentional. For a century popes have been elaborating a systematic body of social thought that attempts to steer a path between capitalism and socialism. Whatever the importance of this teaching to Catholic leaders dealing with social problems, most of the laity has been scarcely aware of it. Now the word is spreading, helped last week by Pope John Paul II's important encyclical on the economic and moral lessons of the collapse of Communism.
The encyclical, "Centesimus Annus" ("The Hundredth Year") commemorated the centenary of "Rerum Novarum," the 1891 document by Pope Leo XIII that was the first in a long series of statements by popes and other church authorities on modern economic and social problems. The new encyclical gives a qualified blessing to market economies, while warning capitalist nations not to ignore their own serious failings. 
 "Centesimus Annus" is only the centerpiece for what sometimes looks like a year-long floating seminar on Catholic social teaching. Dioceses and over 60 Catholic colleges and universities are sponsoring conferences on the subject. Teaching materials have been sent by the American bishops' conference to every parish in the United States. The interest seems to have been encouraged by the bishops' pastoral letters on war and peace in 1983 and on the economy in 1986. It also reflects a growing local awareness of poverty and homelessness.
 "I have seen more discussion of Catholic social teaching this year alone than in my entire lifetime," said Msgr. George G. Higgins, one of a small group of priests who have tried to use social teaching to resolve problems of labor relations and poverty.
Coming more than a century after Adam Smith and almost half a century after the Communist Manifesto, Leo XIII's "Rerum Novarum" was a belated response to capitalist industrialization and to the socialist challenge that it stirred. From Leo's time on, the Church has tried to chart a path between unregulated free enterprise and socialism.
 
Variations on a Theme
 Thus the popes defended private property and the authority of social units like families, communities and unions against centralized state power, but they endorsed government intervention to assure that workers were protected from exploitation and poverty. They rejected the doctrine of class conflict but defended the right of workers to organize and condemned the concentration of wealth.
In fact, from decade to decade and pope to pope, these themes were recast in distinctly different ways. Leo XIII was a conservative reformer whose defense of private property as an inalienable right was considerably modified by later popes. In 1931, Pope Pius XI put forth a plan for organizing economic life according to joint employer-employee associations. But tainted by association with the schemes of dictators like Salazar in Portugal and Franco in Spain, the idea quietly disappeared from papal writings.
Pope John XXIII's encyclicals in the 1960's widened the grounds for government economic intervention and reversed a ban on forming alliances even with moderate socialists. Social doctrine broadened its focus to take in international problems, and it endorsed concepts of human rights that the 19th-century papacy had shunned.
These shifts have led some critics to deny that Catholic social teaching really constitutes a coherent tradition. Complicating the problem, most documents include many qualifications, as a consequence of papal caution and a desire to conciliate different viewpoints within the church.
But the qualifiers have not been sufficient to fend off critics from both left and right. Catholic social teaching has consistently recommended measures that temper economic competition, disappointing capitalists, and has called for class harmony rather than conflict, disappointing socialists and revolutionaries.
In "Centesimus Annus," Pope John Paul II has added a new chapter. Where previous encyclicals have tended to treat market competition as a form of economic anarchy and economic self-interest as simple greed, he hails the market's efficiency and approves of its capacity to harness self-interest. The encyclical also focuses on the need to develop productive forces like scientific and technological know-how, organizational skills and entrepreneurial risk-taking.
Alongside these departures from past teachings, however, the Pope sets a devastating picture of impoverishment and demoralization in the Third World and even in the rich nations that is as brutal as anything Pope Leo XIII denounced a century ago.
 
Market Mechanisms
 Because the Pope clearly looks to a form of market economy to deal with these problems, some conservatives believe that Catholic social teaching is now firmly in the capitalist camp and must concentrate on how a country's culture can promote personal and public morality.
"The Pope is suggesting that the structural arguments are pretty well resolved," said George Weigel, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington. "He is concerned now with the third leg of the triad -- a moral culture capable of sustaining the free economy so that politics and economics can serve the common good."
Others believe that questions of economics and questions of morality cannot be so neatly detached. They suspect that remedying the evils the Pope highlights may still require considerable political and economic reform. "The message that markets work is a message the United States has absorbed," said John Carr, secretary for the bishops' office on Social Development and World Peace at the United States Catholic Conference. "The message for us is that the workings of the markets still have to be guided and restrained so that human participation and dignity is protected."
But that debate is only one among many opened up in this centenary year: How can Catholic social teaching be cross-fertilized with the traditions of other religious groups? Will this teaching say more about the situation of women, mentioned only fleetingly in "Centesimus Annus"? Why is papal teaching evolving and empirical in regard to economics but much less so in areas like sexual morality or reproductive technologies?
And for Mr. Carr, the centenary means something else, that this body of teaching is "no longer just for a few dedicated people but for the whole church," integrated into education, preaching and worship.

Learning Economics

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
THE protest that crippled the City University of New York campuses for more than three weeks unraveled last week, with protesters apparently failing to block plans for a yearly $500 tuition increase and a $92 million reduction in the university's budget.
The defeat, a contrast to the conclusion of a 1989 protest that brought a reversal of a tuition hike, suggests that when fiscal times are tough, a strike over financial issues will squander much of its force. 
 Even many of the university's 200,000 students, concerned about graduation and professional credentials, tired of the drama. In the case of Borough of Manhattan Community College, they took matters into their own hands and recaptured an occupied building.
But the strike did paradoxically draw attention to an issue that has hovered over the university for more than 20 years, since it began a policy of admitting all high school graduates. How much longer can the university -- and the state government that largely funds it -- afford to keep tuition low and continue to admit all comers, including many who are not prepared to do college work?
Most policymakers believe the university, like its counterparts in other states, may have no choice, since it produces a portion of the well-educated workforce necessary to keep the city's economy competitive. But clearly it is becoming more difficult to pay for skilled faculty, modern laboratories and up-to-date libraries while at the same time expending enormous resources educating students who stand only a 50 percent chance of graduating.
Choices have to be made, and for now, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is choosing both to trim the university's budget and raise tuition.

The City Strains to Hit A Financial Target That May Be Too Small

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
IMAGINE a huge 747 jetliner trying to land on a dirt strip that ends abruptly after 200 feet and you will have some idea of the financial exercise the Dinkins administration is currently engaged in.
One of the provisions of a state law that was passed in 1975 in response to the city's last fiscal crisis was that New York must have no more than a $100 million deficit at the end of each fiscal year. If it exceeds that target, the Financial Control Board automatically assumes responsibility for overseeing the city's finances, with powers that are Draconian compared with those the Mayor normally has. 
 This provision was one of several designed to encourage financial discipline on the part of the city. However, some leading political figures are beginning to question whether it is having that effect. At the time the law was passed, New York City's budget was about $13 billion, and the $100 million target encouraged strict discipline. Today, with the budget just under $30 billion, it tends to produce wild fiscal contortions as the June 30 end of each fiscal year approaches.
Not all of these contortions can be attributed to poor financial planning. The city is only now getting a reading on how much personal income tax to expect from the raft of filings that were sent in on April 15, and the tax is one of its largest sources of revenue for this period. The city won't know how much it will receive in bank and corporation taxes until June 25, and the state won't distribute the final sales tax revenue for the fiscal year until July 12 -- after the all-important fiscal-year cutoff has passed. There are few steps the city can take so late in the fiscal year to make up for any unexpected shortfalls.
"It's going to be close right to the end," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Control Board, which is made up of the Governor, the Mayor, the City and State Controllers, and three private members.
Of course the city tries to anticipate these final payments by making projections based on revenues from previous periods and its outlook for the economy. But with the economy still sinking, such projections are even more perilous than usual. The Dinkins administration set aside a $150 million reserve fund in anticipation of potential year-end problems. But that fund was quickly earmarked for shortfalls that had already arisen. In the last few weeks as the estimate of the budget deficit has grown from about $340 million to $465 million the city has had to scramble to find other ways to end the year with a balanced budget.
Several weeks ago the city shut down some of the computers that generate its checks in order to see what purchases were in the pipeline. It then canceled $90 million worth of those purchase orders and will submit another $200 million to a committee that is to decide which ones are truly essential. Since the city's target of $100 million is based on generally accepted accounting principles, products or services not received before July 1 don't have to be counted as expenses in the current fiscal year. It is also considering issuing new bonds to pay interest on old ones, a proposal that the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, has not yet approved.
For the city to be taking steps that may only worsen next year's fiscal picture in order to meet an artificially set target strikes some as a questionable exercise. On April 16, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo suggested that perhaps the $100 million target should be raised. Bond investors promptly registered their lack of enthusiasm for the idea by forcing yields on New York City bonds higher, an indication that they thought such a change would make New York City more of an investment risk.
The Governor quickly withdrew his suggestion. But some other political leaders are saying quietly that they think the idea is a legitimate one deserving more consideration.
Ms. Holtzman points out that $100 million is now equal to less than one-third of 1 percent of the budget, a target that is unrealistic for even the nimblest of financial managers. "It's too small a margin of error," she said. "The number ought to be changed to reflect modern-day facts."
Ms. Holtzman has suggested that the target be based on a reasonable percentage of the budget, rather than a specific dollar figure. She has not said what that percentage figure should be.
The frequent rejoinder is that nothing can be done about this problem because bond covenants would prohibit it. However, Mr. Proctor of the Control Board says the purpose of the law was to provide a package of measures that reassure bond investors. Changes can be made, he said, as long as the sum of the measures enhances bondholder protection. If there is further review, he said, another issue that deserves reconsideration is the Financial Control Act's prohibition of stabilization, or rainy-day, funds, a financial tool he considers essential at the local governmental level. As part of a broader package, he said, "bond covenants would be a surmountable issue," although the law would have to be amended.
One group that would have no problem with changes to the workings of the Financial Control Board is labor. Barry Feinstein, the influential leader and president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, thinks it would be appropriate to amend the law. But then, he added, "I think it would be a good idea if there was no Control Board at all." He noted that a "sunset" provision calls for it to expire of its own accord by the year 2008. And that, he said, taking the long view, "is just around the corner."

HEADLINE: Easier Money;
Who Benefits As the U.S. Cuts Interest Rates to Fight Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE American recession, now nine months old, reached a turning point of sorts last week. Weeks of optimism that it will end soon gave way to doubts, not only among the naturally melancholy but even at the Federal Reserve, which is often the last to admit that a recession might be more severe than was initially predicted.
So the Fed applied its standard remedy. Noting that industrial production is still falling because people aren't buying much of the products that factories make -- or enough of anything else -- it cut two pivotal interest rates in hopes that easier credit would lead to a livelier economy. 
 The great goal of the policy makers trying to reverse this recession is to get consumers to spend more, much more. The new interest-rate reduction, the fourth by the Federal Reserve this year, is in line with that goal, and was applauded by President Bush and Democrats like Speaker Thomas S. Foley with more than the usual vigor.
But where does that leave things?
On the big question -- when will the recession end -- the prevailing view remains that it will be over by late summer, though some who hold that position are less certain of it than before. "I have become a bit less optimistic that the recession will end on schedule," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank, who welcomed the Federal Reserve's action. In the meantime, the effects of interest-rate cuts seem certain to be much more complex than the theory behind them. The idea is to end the recession as quickly as possible by making loans more attractive for all sorts of people: As the borrowers spend, the economy expands. The reality is that just as recessions don't hurt everyone equally, the Fed's remedy helps some more than others.
The biggest winners are corporations, banks and the Federal Government itself. Much of the benefit to consumers trickles down to them slowly, if it arrives at all.
"The consumer is not yet benefiting greatly from all the Fed's actions," said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a research organization supported by corporations.
What the Fed did on Tuesday was to reduce the banks' cost of funds, so they can then charge less to lend out this money. The panel reduced two benchmark interest rates under its control, the discount rate, which went down to 5.5 percent from 6 percent, and the misnamed Federal funds rate, which fell to 5.75 percent, from 6 percent. The discount rate is what the Fed charges to lend money to banks and the Federal funds rate the interest that banks charge each other for short-term loans.
Discount rate lending is minuscule and interbank lending relatively small, but together the two interest rates serve as a benchmark for what commercial banks like Morgan Guaranty or Chase Manhattan pay on savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other forms of borrowing. Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities -- what the Government pays when it borrows money -- also decline in tandem with the Federal funds rate.
As the Fed allows the banks to reduce the interest they pay, the banks should pass along some of the savings by reducing the interest they charge. That is what they have done in past recessions, but in this one the banks have held back until recently, keeping most of the savings for themselves, as higher profits, to recoup some of the tens of billions of dollars they lost in shaky real estate loans in the 1980's.
The Fed has endorsed this behavior as necessary to restore the banks to good health, although the tactic can prolong the recession. Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, argues that with this policy, the Fed is short-changing consumers.
The banks have relented noticeably only in the last few months. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages, for example, have fallen from an average of 10.25 percent last October to just over 9.25 percent today, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
That is about one-third of the decline in the rate that banks paid for funds over the same period, but it is a boon to consumers -- probably the best break they are getting on rates in this recession, economists say.
Payments on a $100,000 mortgage -- either a new one or one that a family refinances -- drop by about $60 a month, to roughly $820, when interest rates decline by a percentage point. And that $60 is money that consumers can spend on other purchases.
The biggest beneficiaries of the Fed's current rate reductions are commercial borrowers, as they always are in recessions. One victory came last Wednesday, when major banks lowered their prime lending rate by half a percentage point, to 8.5 percent.
The rate had been 10 percent on Jan. 1, and the decline since then should have gone hand-in-hand with the decline in rates for certificates of deposit, said Nancy R. Lazar, an economist at ISI Group Inc., a Wall Street brokerage house. If it had, the prime would be 7 percent today, she said. But even at 8.5 percent, corporate America gets what amounts to an infusion of cash.
The prime is another benchmark rate, in this case a benchmark for business. When companies take out short-term loans for office buildings, factories, machinery, raw materials or what have you, they usually pay floating interest rates that rise and fall with the prime and are either a percentage point or two over or under the prime.
When the prime drops by half of a percentage point, as it did last week, the result is a reduction of nearly $5 billion a year in installment payments on the $1 trillion in commercial loans outstanding today. Since January the savings have been $12 billion to $15 billion at an annual rate, which can be diverted into new machinery, or can trickle down to consumers as salaries for new jobs, more overtime pay, bigger raises or higher dividends on stock.
The trickle down is not very evident yet. The Labor Department, for example, announced on Friday that while jobs disappeared in April at a slower pace than in March, 125,000 jobs nevertheless disappeared, mostly as a result of layoffs. And both wages and overtime have been more or less stagnant this year.
Not that there haven't been some benefits for consumers. Home equity loans and some personal loans issued by banks are also often tied to the prime rate or to the rates on Treasury securities that respond to Fed rate cuts. But these total only $150 billion. Installments on mortgages with variable interest rates also can be refinanced periodically at lower rates, although most of the $3 trillion in outstanding home mortgages has been borrowed at fixed rates.
But most consumer loan rates have not declined. The rate paid on the nation's $280 billion in auto loans has remained at about 12 percent, on average. And the cost of owing $750 billion in credit card debt, department store charges and similar revolving loans has risen slightly, to the 18 to 19 percent range.
"Just as we have seen interest rate cuts passed through to the prime, we should see them passed through to the consumer, on things like auto loans and credit cards," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman designate of the Federal Reserve. "As the spreads widen, banks will begin to give. What you have to have is consumers running around looking for lower rates."
But because of the rise in defaults and personal bankruptcies, consumer rates won't decline until a recovery begins, said Robert Dugger, chief economist at the American Bankers Association. "The decline in the cost of funds for banks has been more than offset by the increase in bankruptcy costs," he said.
Mr. Brobeck of the Consumer Federation agrees that rates won't drop, but for a different reason. "The market pressure on the banks is not there," he said. "Consumers are irritated by the high rates, but they are not sufficiently upset to tear up their credit cards."
But neither are they buying much with them, which leads Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, to say, "The end of the recession keeps getting pushed ahead month after month, and it is becoming a sure thing that 1991 will be a negative year for the economy."

Getting the Royal Treatment, Tabloid Style

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
"SEPARATE HOMES," screamed the front-page headline in The Sun two weeks ago. The story -- "an extraordinary series of disclosures," in the tabloid's understated prose -- was presented as an inside account of prickly and distant relations between Prince Charles and Diana, the Princess of Wales, provided by a former security policeman, whose post was outside the gates of Charles's country house in Gloucestershire. The story included the kind of intrusive details, real or invented, about separate households, the bedroom decor, waking hours, eating habits, likes and dislikes of Charles and Diana, that feed the public obsession with the British Royal Soap Opera. The Sun ran the security guard's tale for a few days ("Tomorrow: More Amazing Revelations"), while the other Fleet Street tabloids scrambled to follow.
Last week, the royal road show was off to Brazil for an official visit and upbeat headlines. The image polishers at Buckingham Palace concede that these appearances are stage managed. The most popular set piece in the royal repertoire is Diana hugging children, "preferably black or AIDS victims or both, to put it cynically," says John Haslam, a palace press officer. And Diana did precisely that at a hospital in Sao Paulo. Again, the Royals were plastered all over the front pages of the tabloids for another solid week. 
 On May 14, the head of the House of Windsor, Queen Elizabeth, or "The Boss," as the tabloids sometimes call her, will arrive in Washington for a state visit. For Britain's mass-circulation tabloids, the Queen's trip to America should be something of a breather since the sovereign is the least-controversial member of the royal family and treated reverently by the press.
But this is shaping up as a rigorous year for the reporters the palace refers to as the "royal rat pack," and The Sun's security-guard saga was just an early salvo in the fight for stories and readers. Royal milestones loom: the family's biggest star, Diana, turns 30 on July 1; and the 10th wedding anniversary of Charles and Diana is on July 29. Other subjects with the ability to rouse readers look scarce. Now that the gulf war is over, the "salute to our heroes" genre of tabloid pieces is gone. And with Margaret Thatcher gone from 10 Downing Street, the political story is less colorful and spirited.
Much of the royals coverage seems little more than trivial gossip. But to the big London tabloids, it is a grimly serious business, journalistically and financially. Stories on the royals are a crucial element in the tabloid formula. Michael Shea, the former palace press secretary, recalled that he was once asked if he kept clippings of the tabloid stories. "I said that if you clipped out the royals stories, there would be nothing left of the tabloids," he said. And for all the fabrication, there are old-fashioned scoops: advance word of engagements, pregnancies, divorces or family traumas like Prince Edward's decision in 1987 to drop out of the Royal Marines.
The financial stakes in the royal rat race are high. Despite the recession, Rupert Murdoch's paper The Sun (circulation 3.7 million) makes an operating profit estimated at more than $100 million a year, and the Sunday tabloid News of the World (circulation 4.8 million) is another moneyspinner that depends on royals stories. Robert Maxwell, the new owner of The Daily News in New York, is the other big tabloid proprietor on Fleet Street. His leading titles -- The Daily Mirror (circulation 3 million), The Sunday Mirror (circulation 2.8 million) and The People (circulation 2.4 million), also a Sunday paper -- serve up a steady stream of royals stories.
The royals press includes not only newspapers but also a corps of authors and magazines, both specialized titles like "Royalty" and "Majesty" and general magazines like Time Warner's "People." Diana holds the all-time record for People cover appearances at 44, eight more than her closest rival, Elizabeth Taylor.
But the real cutting edge of royals coverage is the "rat pack," the 30 or so reporters and photographers who do the shoe-leather work. They scoff at the kind of "whither the monarchy" pieces that the grayer, broadsheet newspapers occasionally run. They regard most book and magazine writers as parasites who feed off the tabloids, clipping their stories and rewriting them. Come rain or shine, when the royal roadshow is in motion the rat pack is there, often jockeying for position behind police barricades. The veterans have traveled the world, from the Australian Outback to the White House. They cover the daily stories and stalk the manifold layers of palace sources, armed with guile and cash. (The tabloids have been known to pay tens of thousands of dollars to palace employees for information.)
For a decade, the acknowledged master of the craft was Harry Arnold, the senior royals reporter for The Sun, who last year jumped to The Daily Mirror. Mr. Arnold's credits include a string of exclusive stories dating to the days when Charles started going out with Diana. One scoop was about the conversation that led up to the wedding kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace watched by millions: Prince Andrew encouraging Charles to do it to please the half-million people assembled below, Charles resisting, then asking the Queen's permission, and finally . . . Competing tabloids hired lip readers to review the video, hoping to discredit the Arnold story. But they merely confirmed its accuracy. "My mole was on the balcony with them," Mr. Arnold confided. "But I'll never say who it was."
In late 1987, when the Duchess of York was pregnant with her first child, Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, the story ran in The Sun more than a week before the palace confirmed it. Later, the Duchess saw Mr. Arnold at an official function and said his sources must be well-placed since only five people had known she was pregnant. "Six, ma'am," he replied.
The palace tends to regard the press with upper-class disdain. But the royals also recognize that the monarchy must be accessible and seen to be serving the public or it could be dissolved. So with a carefully calculated blend of mystery and accessibility, the royal family poses, performs and keeps the soap opera going. "They're helping us to help them -- there's no question of that," said Mr. Arnold of The Mirror.

HEADLINE: Public & Private;
Citizen As Consumer

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Here in our town, municipal elections are greeted by many with a feeling of resignation and despair. Across the river in Manhattan, up in Albany, down in Trenton the chief executives are like alligator wrestlers as they tussle with their budgets, trying to get a hold on something mean, slippery, and obviously more powerful than they are.
Here in our town it is much the same, except that many of us who meet on street corners to compare our astronomical tax bills accept that the alligator has already eaten us all.There is a kind of municipal inertia, part machine politics, part union clout, part historical mandate. "The more things change, the more they stay the same," say the newcomers. "Ah, they're all bums," says one old sailor who has seen it all, seen the factories close and the port sicken and die. 
 At no time is this feeling greater than during school board elections, which took place last week. And so it came as a great surprise to some of us when the reformers won. Now we will sit back and see if they can do any good, or if inertia is inexorable. In our town, the school system is spending just over $12,000 a pupil. That should make it roughly the elementary equivalent of Stanford. Instead, people who are able to send their children to private and parochial schools because they believe the public schools are substandard.
This makes us like many other urban residents in the country.
The cupboard is bare, and taxpayers everywhere are looking around to see where the money has gone. And the answer, in so many cases, is that it has been badly spent. The laboratory in which we've learned this most convincingly is our schools. It is harder to get a handle on waste and malfeasance at the Department of General Services. But schools are somewhat quantifiable.
Are children reading at grade level?
Is the teacher-pupil ratio reasonable?
How many of the high school graduates go on to further schooling? Where do they go?
Would you send your kids there? Do the teachers?
There is a national consensus building that there needs to be radical change in our public schools. But it seems to me that it is a consensus built around a larger agenda, a feeling that the pain of taxation has become so great that we must be absolutely convinced that we are paying only for what makes sense. We do not want to discover, as we did in our town, that a Board of Education carpenter made almost $70,000, $40,000 of it in overtime.
Elected officials talk about hard choices. But what we really need are the right choices. More cops on the street, fewer behind desks. More dollars in the classroom, not in administrative offices. More street sweepers, not more special assistants to the deputy commissioner. Every manager who proposes economies should be forced to justify each director, associate director and assistant director in his department before he lays off a single social worker, sanitation man or secretary.
But the converse must apply, too. At a rally of municipal employees in lower Manhattan last week, there was a rallying cry: Tax the rich! Along with that demand should come a pledge: that union leaders will devote themselves as conspicuously to shortcomings among their members as they have to the shortcomings of management. That would improve their public image.
I think many of us still believe in trade unionism. We're simply not sure we can afford any union if it protects inept workers, outmoded perks and the well-being of the union leadership at the expense of the consumer.
The teachers here in our town have negotiated a 30 percent salary increase over three years. There are just more than 330 teachers in the system, and only about 3,300 kids.
We can't afford that.
And in this also we are like so many towns across America. The boom has gone bust. The citizens have become consumers. And what we want is simple: we want value for money. There aren't any heroes or villains; there are only the people who deliver, rank and file and managers alike, and the people who don't. In these times, we can't carry the latter on our backs any longer. That's money from our pockets, and our pockets are empty. We are as irascible and fierce as any alligator. Man bites budget: that will be the story, in our towns.

Gen. Powell's Lament

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Gen. Colin Powell favored strangulating Iraq by economic and defensive military means and opposed President Bush's emerging war strategy, as late as October. That's what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and/or his aides told Bob Woodward for his new book.
 Does the revelation of this brief apostasy vindicate the war critics? Why did the general tell such an explosive story? What does the Woodward account suggest about the workings of the Bush Presidency? 
 The answers are: 1. No vindication, but the Powell position shows the critics had strong arguments shared by many in the Bush Administration. 2. The leaking of the story points to the general's concern for his posterity and the deepest worries of the military establishment. 3. Bushville, like most recent Administrations, is not a good place for open and honest discussions in which "the players" take long, hard looks at the facts and options.
A jovial, ill-disciplined lot. Too bad for us.
 War critics will certainly welcome the company of General Powell. They made a legitimate case for giving economic sanctions a longer run before going to war, and they deserve the respectability imparted by the general's shadow.
 Mr. Bush, however, chose the right course. Neither General Powell's early qualms nor the bloody mess of postwar Iraq derogates from this central point: President Bush correctly set out to destroy Iraq as a military threat to its neighbors and to the West's oil lifeline -- and he did it. It's doubtful that the world would have been able to sustain long-term military presence and sanctions. But even had that proved possible, Saddam Hussein's military superiority over his neighbors would have remained intact, and he still would have been able to murder his own people.
 As for the general telling tales out of school, he can be forgiven. He looked at the size of Iraqi forces and the messiness of war, and trembled at the potential costs -- like any sane person. If the war went sour, he wanted his marker of dissent on record. He is, after all, an outstanding man, a black man and a leader of men who could and would be President.
 But the general also reflected the scars inflicted on the military by the Vietnam war and wanted to protect his cherished institution. Vietnam destroyed public faith in the military, and the Pentagon struggled for years to re-establish public trust. Rightly, General Powell was not eager to throw all away again, perhaps irrevocably, in an impetuous Persian Gulf war of highly uncertain popularity.
 Mr. Woodward, an editor at The Washington Post, makes much of General Powell's bureaucratic somersaults. He recounts how the general feared to tell the President of his preference for continued sanctions, how he meekly had to package the sanctions option alongside the Bush war option and pretend that both were equally plausible.
 But, alas, that's what it's like talking to the boss in the capital city, or almost anywhere else. Presidents unfortunately take dissent for disloyalty. Most of them have got to be surrounded and cajoled -- as Clark Clifford, the ultimate master of counseling presidents, relates in his forthcoming memoir, which includes hair-raising stories about trying to walk Lyndon Johnson out of Vietnam.
 General Powell was also described by Mr. Woodward as unhappy about sloppy White House meetings where alternatives "were not completely discussed" and where "clear decisions rarely emerged." It is hard to believe, however, that the amorphousness of government meetings deranged such an experienced warrior. He served as N.S.C. adviser to President Reagan and knows that the real meetings usually take place later in the Oval Office, among the innermost intimates.
 Perhaps the most striking feature of the Woodward book is that many of these Bush intimates are now beginning to nibble away at each other with nasty little stories. Until a couple of weeks ago, Bushville had been the very model of a discreet and self-satisfied bunch of moderate-conservatives who seemed to be getting along quite well.
 Their civility was a pleasant change for Washington. But apart from the bold stroke against Iraq, it was purchased at the price of doing nothing. Maybe if the Bush team enjoyed a little less conviviality, they might look outside their windows and do something for the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Good Sense on Mexican Trade

 BODY:
President Bush has responded constructively to critics of his proposed free-trade pact with Mexico by pledging to protect U.S. workers and the environment. In a 70-page statement, the White House promises to retrain dislocated workers, preserve existing U.S. environmental standards and incorporate environmental reviews into the negotiating process.
These assurances are not airtight and establish some troubling precedents. But the response answers legitimate fears and paves the way for Congress to approve fast-track legislation, committing it to vote on trade pacts promptly and without amendments. As a matter of economics, free trade with Mexico is not all that important. But as a matter of politics, it could provide pivotal endorsement of market reforms under way in Mexico, Chile and the rest of Latin America. 
 The Bush pledges will, however, create some knotty problems. They promise generous assistance to workers laid off by the pact. But why do these workers deserve help any more than, say, construction workers who are laid off because of recession? And why do environmentalists warrant a place at the negotiating table rather than, say, human-rights activists? If trade pacts become hostage to single-issue pleaders, efforts to knock down trade barriers and spur growth will be sabotaged.
The Administration has made intelligent compromises. It emphasizes training assistance, rather than cash grants, for dislocated workers in order not to blunt incentives to find new jobs. The plan would reimpose tariffs if Mexican exports in a particular industry surged; but the backtracking would only be temporary. And all potentially disruptive provisions would be phased in slowly.
On the environment, Mr. Bush is equally sensible. He guarantees that no U.S. standard will be negotiated away. But he refuses to guarantee, as some demand, that the Mexican environment go unscathed. Environmentalists are upset that the Bush plan doesn't promise a complete environmental analysis of the trade pact before negotiations are complete; and U.S. standards appear vulnerable to the process of settling disputes. Here, the Bush plan might be usefully amended.
In the present case, free trade makes economic and political sense for both Mexico and the United States. But some workers will lose their jobs. Mr. Bush's obligation was to construct a safety net for them, while securing the greater economic gain for everyone else. The Bush plan isn't ideal. And environmentalists have proposed some useful changes. But it's a well-constructed foundation.

HEADLINE: Rethink Railroads Before It's Too Late

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Congress Votes to Halt Rail Strike" (news article, April 18) states that "Except for the business of a few small regional railroads, all freight service stopped moving" during the strike's less than 24 hours. This passing reference to the only growing sector of a shrinking industry misses a key point. Regional and short-line railroads, more than 200 of which have been formed since industry deregulation in 1980, now operate 22 percent of the country's rail mileage. 
 Those that are unionized typically function under locally negotiated work rules, avoiding the tired old issues of 108 miles a day and five men in a crew. Their safety record is exemplary (ask the insurers) and service generally superior (ask the customers).
With the major rail carriers continuing to lose market share and to disinvest in physical plant, and union membership in a state of steady decline, isn't it time for management and labor to get together and formulate an enlightened new vision for this industry -- one that will stimulate traffic growth, create new jobs, improve profitability, attract investment capital, reduce highway congestion and benefit the environment?
The real transportation crisis we face is not the threat of a strike now, but the longer-range danger of continued downsizing of our railroad system because of Congressional refusal to recognize economic reality: that an industry burdened by archaic laws that raise its costs of doing business cannot compete effectively in an economy driven by price and service.
Sooner or later, the public must realize that Government policy should encourage stabilization of the remaining rail network before many more communities lose their access to it.

HEADLINE: Why Not Child-Care Loans on Same Terms as Student Loans?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
My husband and I fairly well fit the New York City family portrait in your article on two-paycheck families (The Week in Review, April 21), but we have two children under kindergarten age, a boy who just turned 5, a girl at 20 months. Our annual child care costs about $20,000. For the reasons you state, I work full time -- economic necessity, protection against financial dependence on my husband, as well as the feeling of self-worth a paycheck brings and the respect from others (husbands included) that a professional salary brings. 
 But after looking at the finances, I've had my doubts. I believe child care is a family expense. Both parents are responsible for the care of the children, and men should not be let off the hook. What's the answer? Look to the model of student loans for college-age kids. Preschool child-care expenses are concentrated in a five-year span. Why not offer long-term, low-interest financing for preschool child care?
The alternative is the route my husband and I have been forced to take -- pay for child care from disposable income, while accumulating credit-card debt at 20 percent interest, based on three-year payback (that has paid for clothing, car repair and other routine expenses). I wish we had been able to borrow on the terms of my husband's student loans -- 10-year payback at 7 percent to 12 percent, with no penalty for early payment on more of the principal.
We would finish off the debt, just in time for college tuition. But perhaps we would have managed to sock away savings for that if our child-care costs in the early years had been spread over a longer period.
I would add that I see this as a model only because we have free public school available for kindergarten to 12th grade but not for earlier preschool years, at least not in most places.

HEADLINE: Why Not Child-Care Loans on Same Terms as Student Loans?;
Stereotypes and Saving

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"For Some Two-Paycheck Families, the Economics Don't Add Up" (The Week in Review, April 21) perpetuates the worst stereotypes of the working mother. It's she who is responsible for the baby, the sitter and, of course, dinner. 
 And if that wasn't enough, I find truly ludicrous your suggestion that it may not be a significant financial benefit to have $6,000 more a year in income after expenses (not anticipating raises or promotions in the short term).
That paltry $6,000 can be invested for college. With a zero-coupon Treasury bond, $27,000 would be available.
I'm a freelance marketing writer-creative consultant and the mother of a 10-month-old daughter. I worked from a home office before she was born and continue to do so. My husband works for a Fortune 500 company. Since self-employment leads to erratic cash flow, we learned how to economize before the baby. Most of the time my husband takes his lunch to work. I eat at home.
The money your hypothetical couple spends on food taken out or eaten in is profligate. They could probably shave some from their clothes budget too, shopping sales and discount stores. With more left over, maybe the wife's work would become more financially significant.

HEADLINE: Escape From Tiananmen Square: A Chinese Odyssey

BYLINE: By Nicholas D. Kristof ;Nicholas D. Kristof is chief of the Beijing bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
WERE YOU FOLLOWED?" LIU XIANG ASKED anxiously, by way of greeting. It was a bright September day last year when we met for dinner at a restaurant in the center of Beijing. He hardly touched his food, spending much of his time looking over his shoulder. A fugitive from the law, Liu was very different from the easygoing physics student who, the year before, was at the center of the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square.
"They're closing in," he said in a whisper. "The police have been asking around town about me, and I've got to leave very soon. But this time I've got to get to Hong Kong safely. Otherwise, it's all over." 
 Liu Xiang (pronounced lee-o shahng) was haunted by the memories of the prison from which he had just escaped. Each night he had the same nightmare. "In my dream, they beat me, and I try to explain that I didn't really mean to escape, and they just keep on beating me and beating me." Each night he would wake, his body in a cold sweat, his heart pumping wildly.

IT ALL BEGAN WITH A MIDNIGHT SNACK. LATE ON THE evening of April 18, 1989, Liu Xiang went out with some friends to eat and ran into a crowd of Beijing University students marching toward Tiananmen Square. Caught up in the excitement, Liu joined the march. That decision changed his life.
Gangly, with close-cropped hair, Liu was then a 23-year-old senior at Qinghua University, one of China's premier colleges. A member of the Communist Youth League, he was at the time a firm supporter of the Communist Party. He remained a supporter even as the democracy movement sucked him in, as it did millions of others around the country. But then came the crackdown, and Liu found to his horror that the Communist Party had no compunctions about declaring war on him and his fellow students.
Fleeing to southern China, Liu entered a world he scarcely knew existed -- a free-for-all zone of bribery, smuggling and criminal gangs. He escaped to Hong Kong in April 1990, requesting asylum from the British authorities. Instead, he was returned to China some days later. Thrown into prison, he learned to rely on his fists as well as his brains. He managed to escape and make his way back to Beijing. By then it was summer and the police were on his heels. He fled south once more and again sneaked across the border to Hong Kong. Last month, he arrived in New York to start a new life.
Liu Xiang's two-year odyssey affords an unusual glimpse of China's underside, where the regime's repressive apparatus is sometimes more pathetic than terrifying. Corruption, greed and passive resistance conspire to frustrate the hard-liners' ability to capture democracy movement fugitives like Liu Xiang.
In Maoist times, it probably would have been impossible for a political fugitive to escape China once, let alone twice. In past campaigns of repression, the party was able to mobilize the masses to turn in their neighbors, even their family. This time, ordinary Chinese sided with the fugitives.
Escape stories of the democracy movement activists may differ in the details but they all share one point: none of the activists would have been able to escape if it were not for the assistance of a range of people along the way, from peasants to Communist Party officials. Liu Xiang found that acquaintances everywhere were willing to lie for him, bribe for him and forge identity papers for him. These acquaintances showed him that, particularly in southern China, the security network is tattered. Liu found his way out through the holes.
What Liu's two-year ordeal also underscores is the way the British overseers of Hong Kong sometimes seem to be doing Beijing's bidding. Sending a democracy movement activist back to China, to face the possibility of a long prison sentence, is hardly in keeping with the professed British ideals of fair play and common decency. However, the British authorities hold the view that the best way to manage Hong Kong is not to vex China but to maintain stability and allow for a graceful exit in 1997. Liu seems to have been a victim of that policy.
It was in Hong Kong, while hiding as an illegal immigrant after his second escape, in December 1990, that Liu recounted details of his life after the June 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square. Speaking mostly in Mandarin, his words punctuated here and there with prison jargon, sometimes drifting into the functional English he learned in school, Liu Xiang gave a Dantean account of his journey through the many circles of a Chinese Communist hell.

QINGHUA UNIVERSITY, A SPRAWLING CAMPUS nestled in the northwestern outskirts of Beijing, is the M.I.T. of China. In China, only a tiny elite pass the examinations to get into any university, and those who succeed tend to find higher education a liberating experience.
After slaving away in high school and struggling to pass college entrance examinations, they finally have the chance to fall in love (romance is banned in high schools) as well as the time to reflect on life and politics. One of the few burdens foisted on them is that of history: students have played an important role during China's major upheavals of the last 100 years, and they sometimes hold themselves responsible for the direction of their nation.
My wife and fellow New York Times correspondent, Sheryl WuDunn, met Liu Xiang while she was interviewing students at Tiananmen Square shortly after the democracy movement began. Liu was bright and articulate, one of a handful who would phone us with information about plans for demonstrations and other student activities. We met with him often, and he impressed us as courteous, gentle and eager to be helpful. Without appearing manipulative, Liu Xiang charms those around him.
One of his greatest skills is in cultivating guanxi (connections) -- a critical talent in China. China is not so much a market economy or a socialist economy as a guanxi economy. Everything from jobs to cars to videos is distributed largely on the basis of guanxi. Knowing this is how the system works, Liu would collect guanxi the way some people collect postage stamps.
Back in the spring of 1989, in his ramshackle dorm, with books and clothing strewn about, Liu and his five roommates complained about hard-line policies, but not about the system itself. On one visit, I asked Liu if he was anti-Communist. "Of course not," he said, a bit horrified. "We all support the Communist Party. We want to reform it."
Liu Xiang's father, an officer of the People's Liberation Army, had been killed during a gun battle in the Cultural Revolution and was later declared a martyr by the Government. Liu grew up in the ancient city of Xian, in north-central China, and was raised as a believer in Communism.
When the 1989 student democracy movement began, he didn't want to get involved. "It's very tough to get into Qinghua University," he explained, "and if you get in trouble then it's all down the drain." Yet it was impossible to stay away from Tiananmen Square. First he watched from the sidelines. Then he helped carry to waiting ambulances those classmates who had gone on hunger strikes and had fainted. He stayed with them as they were revived, and he saw them pull the IV tubes from their arms to resume their fast. Liu was moved in a way he had never been before.
A radio buff, Liu was asked by several of his friends -- student leaders -- to help set up a loudspeaker system at Tiananmen Square to air news about their movement. Liu helped run the "broadcast station," as they called it, and also served as a liaison with a number of foreign journalists.
Then, in the early morning hours of June 4, his world was shattered. "We had expected tear gas that evening, but nobody thought the soldiers would fire on the people," Liu Xiang recalls. "We were shocked, and that was when my attitude toward the Communist Party changed. Everything we believed in suddenly collapsed."
At 4 A.M., heading with some friends for the area around Tiananmen Square, Liu found tanks burning and the People's Liberation Army behaving like an invading force. The students spent much of the next few days harassing troops and playing a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with them along the alleys around the main roads. Twice, bullets narrowly missed Liu, and once, he says, he helped set fire to an armored personnel carrier -- a capital offense in itself.
The Army quickly consolidated its control over the capital. Many students and workers were detained, and the security forces began daily interrogations of Liu Xiang on the Qinghua campus. Obliged to write day-by-day accounts of his activities during the democracy movement, Liu omitted any mention of his involvement in the broadcast station or his role in setting fire to the personnel carrier. The authorities knew nothing about those matters, and grilled him instead on his contacts with student leaders and with me and Sheryl.
The university refused to allow Liu to graduate, and the questionings continued all summer. The authorities were sure he wasn't telling the complete truth, but he had one advantage over them: they didn't know what he had actually done.
"I figured if I lied, I'd be able to get a diploma and resume a normal life," he says, and so he lied about almost everything. He denied any role at Tiananmen and insisted he had met my wife and me only casually and briefly. Yet even during that terrifying time, he managed to outwit the police, who were keeping us under partial surveillance, to meet with Sheryl and to brief her on the crackdown and the interrogations on the campuses. Beneath his affable exterior was clearly an iron resolve, a courage that sometimes bordered on the reckless.
As in almost every part of the country, the investigations at Qinghua were subverted by a massive cover-up by students, professors and even Communist Party officials. At the risk of their careers and their freedom, officials intervened and lied to protect those involved in the Tiananmen movement.
At Qinghua, some well-placed individuals secretly met with Liu and other students who were under investigation. "They would tell us, 'The authorities know this much, so tell them that, and no more,' " Liu says. One sympathizer helped Liu obtain a photocopy of his university diploma, so that he could pretend to have graduated.
There was, however, no sign that the investigation was drawing to a close. As the summer wore on, Liu Xiang began to worry that time was running out. When the regular Qinghua students returned to campus for the fall semester, the authorities would be able to question more people and might learn that he had been lying about his democracy movement activities.
After a number of student acquaintances were arrested, he became even more nervous and finally obtained some false documents from a friendly official. He then secretly arranged to flee to the southern city of Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong.

TWELVE YEARS AGO, Shenzhen was little more than a farming community. But as soon as it was declared a special economic zone -- an area modeled on the frenetically capitalistic Hong Kong -- it was transformed almost overnight into a boom town. Hong Kong entrepreneurs found that they could save on labor costs by transferring their garment and toy factories across the border. Today, Hong Kong companies employ some 2 million Chinese workers in Shenzhen, which has a population of 1.9 million, and the surrounding towns of Guangdong Province.
In most of China, jobs and apartments are assigned. In Shenzhen, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in Guangdong, it is possible to find a job and rent an apartment on one's own. This has corroded the Government's control mechanisms and created a wealth of new opportunities -- for criminals as well as more conventional entrepreneurs. Among the concrete-block apartment houses and thriving shops are people who will supply ID cards to those who want a new identity. In Maoist China, there was nowhere to hide; now there is Guangdong.
Criminal gangs have also moved in. The gangs, known as Triads (derived from the Cantonese name for the Three in Accord Society, the "three" being heaven, earth and man), have a long history in China. Triads fled after the 1949 revolution to Hong Kong and Taiwan; there, in close proximity to China, they have remained powerful, providing "protection" to nightclubs, for example, and periodically getting into terrifying turf battles in which hoods go after one another with cleavers.
With the weakening of Communist controls over the last dozen years, the Triads set up branches in Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong, running smuggling, gambling and prostitution rackets. (According to the Shenzhen authorities, in just the last five months of 1990 more than 60 criminal gangs were broken up.)
Liu Xiang thought that in such a free-for-all he could get a job with no questions asked. Ordinary Chinese are not allowed to enter Shenzhen without a special certificate, but Liu was able to go through guanxi and get the necessary documentation. Liu's new papers, which were under his own name, proclaimed him a worker who had never participated in the democracy movement and who was going to Shenzhen as a buyer for a factory.
Shortly after arriving in Shenzhen, in September 1989, Liu Xiang found a temporary position in an office assigning Chinese sailors to jobs on foreign ships. Liu told his employer he had not taken part in the democracy movement, showing the bootleg photocopy of his diploma as evidence. "If I had been involved," he declared, "how would I have the diploma?"
Struggling to rebuild his future, Liu systematically went about cultivating guanxi in Shenzhen. Through a network of new friends, he found someone with connections to the Public Security Bureau, and he managed to extend his length of stay in Shenzhen.
He also made connections with the criminal underworld. Those gangsters whom he met were not caricatures out of a kung fu movie. Some were well-educated and ambitious young people alienated from the system and were drawn to the easy money to be had from smuggling and other illegal activities.
As a final backup, in case the authorities caught up with him, Liu used his job to obtain an ID card in the name of a sailor whose papers he was handling for the agency.
Unfortunately, Liu Xiang did his job so well that his boss decided to hire him permanently. While on a trip to Beijing in early 1990, the boss dropped by Qinghua University to check Liu's file (all Chinese have a personnel file, whose contents they are not allowed to see) and was horrified to learn that his star employee was being sought by the university authorities for fleeing in the middle of investigations.
Upon returning to Shenzhen, the boss promptly dismissed Liu Xiang. Liu then joined the gangs, helping them trade currencies on the black market. "We made a lot of money in a short period," he says, grinning at the memory.
Meanwhile, Qinghua officials had informed the Public Security Bureau in Beijing that Liu was working in Shenzhen. Soon, two Beijing policemen were in Shenzhen, questioning people about Liu's whereabouts. Liu Xiang felt the net tightening around him. It was time to leave for Hong Kong.

OVER THE NEXT FEW weeks, Liu borrowed maps of Hong Kong, memorizing the street names and geography of the border area. He got Hong Kong currency, and he went to places frequented by Hong Kong tourists, to see what set them apart from mainland Chinese.
"I decided that the head and feet were most important," he says. "Hong Kong people have fancy haircuts and they wear imported shoes. Plus a lot of them wear blue jeans."
So Liu invested in a pair of imported athletic shoes and an expensive haircut. The only giveaway was a chipped and rotten front tooth, an obvious product of Chinese dentistry.
Hiring a boat to take him all the way to Hong Kong was too expensive, so Liu arranged to make his escape on Zhong-Ying Street, a shopping district straddling the border. One side of the street is China; the other, Hong Kong. It is an area crammed with shops selling everything imaginable, from gold jewelry to traditional medicines to pornographic magazines.
Residents of China need special permission to visit the street, but Liu and two friends used their guanxi to pay a bribe equivalent to $106 (several months' salary for a factory worker) so that the Chinese People's Armed Police would look the other way. Hong Kong police are stationed along the street to prevent residents of China from slipping into the British territory, and Liu and his friends sneaked through back entrances and alleys until they got to a gulf of water separating them from Hong Kong.
"We found a private boat that would take us across the water," Liu says. "When the marine police were changing shifts, we crossed the channel." On April 22, 1990, after being dropped off on shore, Liu and his companions hiked across some hills and then flagged a minibus. They went immediately to Chinese University, whose student union had sent delegates to Tiananmen Square during the democracy movement.
Liu Xiang's problems seemed to be over. At Chinese University, he was treated as a hero, and he and his friends were put in touch with the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China. The three subsequently turned themselves in to the Hong Kong Government and requested asylum.
Although Liu and his friends were kept at a detention center, they were treated courteously, and there seemed to be no problems. Liu had documents, including photographs and testimonials, confirming his role at Tiananmen.
On their seventh day in Hong Kong, immigration officers told the three to get their belongings ready, shook their hands and wished them well. Liu was elated. But then a long bus pulled up, and he froze. It was not the van used to take people back to the center of Hong Kong. Instead, it was the bus used to repatriate illegal immigrants to China.
"There must be some mistake," Liu protested, but the police forced him and his friends on the bus. Liu's voice hardens as he speaks of the Hong Kong Government's decision.
"It was contemptible," he says. "We'd been betrayed by the Hong Kong Government. We were so shocked and angry, and we figured we'd be sentenced to 10 years in prison."
The Hong Kong Government declines to discuss specific cases. The territory's British overseers have briefly, and as secretly as possible, provided refuge to some prominent democracy activists from China before sending them on to Europe or the United States. But the Hong Kong authorities have done this unenthusiastically, worried about the reaction from Beijing, and have systematically moved to curb criticisms about China that would upset its leadership. Hong Kong has not allowed some prominent Chinese dissidents living abroad to visit the territory. Films critical of China are censored.
In most parts of its former empire, from India to Africa, Britain tried to nurture democratic governments in the territories it was leaving. In Hong Kong, it appears to have done the reverse, and democracy forces in Hong Kong charge that British officials have done this so that London can maintain smooth diplomatic and trade relations with Beijing.
British and Hong Kong Government officials dispute such charges. They assert that Hong Kong cannot survive without China, and that openly supporting a small number of democracy activists would only hurt the great majority of Hong Kong residents in the long run.

THE FEW MINUTES on the bus as it returned to China were among the worst in Liu's life.
He knew that the Hong Kong authorities provide a list of all the illegal immigrants they repatriate. He also knew that the papers and photos he was carrying -- intended to document his involvement in the democracy movement and therefore win him asylum -- would get him swift punishment from China. He hid these under the bus seat, knowing that he was riding in a Hong Kong bus that probably would not be searched.
As many as 100 people are repatriated each day from Hong Kong. Most are illegal immigrants from Guangdong Province and are released, on payment of a small fine, once they can prove they are from the local area and have no criminal record. Those from distant provinces, like Liu Xiang, are interrogated to make sure they are not wanted for some crime. Sometimes they are sent back to the Public Security Bureaus in their hometowns, a process that can take months.
From the list provided by Hong Kong, the Chinese knew Liu's name, but he lied about his identity, claiming to be a worker from Xian and giving a false address. Eventually, of course, the police would realize that he had given a phony address and might beat the truth out of him, but he hoped to be free by then. He asked a detainee who was about to be released to phone a friend in Shenzhen and explain the situation. The Shenzhen friend promptly went to great lengths to bribe the guards to release Liu.
"The guards took the 'gifts,' but said that to release me they needed proof that I didn't have a criminal record," Liu says. "My friend tried to get that, but it was very difficult to get the necessary paper forged. In Guangdong, it's usually easy to get things done with money, but in this case we had some difficulties." The friend did get one such forged document, but it didn't look authentic and the friend decided not to run the risk of using it.
Liu was transferred first to Zhangmutou Detention Center and then to Yangcun Detention Center, both in central Guangdong. The conditions were similar: up to 40 prisoners to a cell and up to 10 sleeping in a single, oversized bed. In addition to the beds, the cell contained a basin of water and a hole in the floor for a toilet.
Meals consisted of cold rice with warmed-over vegetables. "The biggest problem was that there wasn't enough food," Liu says. "If somebody spat out a rotten or disgusting vegetable on the floor, someone else would pick it up and put it in his mouth, even though the guards would beat us if they saw us doing that."
Liu, who is 5 foot 11, weighed 172 pounds when he entered prison and just 147 pounds seven weeks later. In addition to hunger, the prisoners constantly suffered from mosquito bites and a particularly ferocious kind of bedbug that left their legs covered with angry red welts.
At the detention centers, as in all Chinese prisons, order was established in each cell by the "boss" -- a prisoner who bullied his way to the top of the heap and ordered the other prisoners around. Liu felt frighteningly out of place, but he was lucky enough to be physically larger than most of the other prisoners.
At Yangcun, in another bit of good fortune, the boss in his cell was a fellow northerner and Mandarin speaker. "Big Brother, please take my watch," Liu told the boss as soon as he was in the cell. The boss warmed to such flattery (and no doubt would have taken the wristwatch in any case), and soon Liu became one of his strongmen. They would rough up new arrivals, looking for money hidden from the guards. The money would be used to buy cigarettes, food and clothing.
When the boss was moved to another prison, Liu Xiang took over. As though he had taken on the coloration of the jungle, the college boy was now a gang leader, forcing other prisoners to wash his underwear and give up their money and sometimes even their food. When they disobeyed, he ordered his strongmen to beat them up. One might expect Liu, formerly an advocate of democracy, to be embarrassed about his activities as a boss, but he is unapologetic.
"Originally, I didn't want to do it, but then I realized that in prison everything depends on this," he says, clenching a fist. "If you don't beat them up, then you'll get beaten up. And then you'll end up washing their underwear. In there, the only thing that matters is violence. There's no morality, just power."
That attitude reflects a general moral uncertainty of recent years. China's main sources of moral values -- traditional Confucianism and revolutionary Communism -- have largely collapsed, and many young people today speak of a crisis of faith. Some have turned to religion, others to drugs or various cults, to give their lives meaning. Even the outpouring of support for the 1989 democracy movement seemed to have stemmed partly from a popular yearning for a noble cause to believe in.
That student movement has given rise, in turn, to a new and powerful imperative: protect the student participants. Thus, while many young people are complaining about their nation's spiritual vacuum, there have been countless cases of ordinary people displaying enormous moral courage in protecting student dissidents. Even as Liu is matter-of-fact when he talks about beating people in prison, he is scrupulous about not getting anyone in trouble for helping him.
Ironically, it was Liu's assertion of brute force, not his principles, that got him in trouble in prison. Liu had ordered his henchmen to beat a newcomer suspected of hiding his money, but the guards broke up the fight and then decided to teach Liu a lesson. They beat him and locked him in a separate cell, with his wrists handcuffed tightly behind his back.
"I was left lying on the wet cement floor," he says. "There was nothing inside, just a hole for a toilet, and it was clogged and the floor was very wet. The handcuffs were terribly tight, and after 15 minutes I was sweating and my blood couldn't circulate. I called the guards, but they didn't come. I kicked the door, and kept kicking for an hour or so. Finally, a guard came and loosened the handcuffs a bit, but by that time I couldn't use my hands. There was no feeling in them."
After 20 agonizing hours, Liu was returned to his regular cell.

WHILE IN PRISON, Liu Xiang spent his time humming a popular Chinese rock song -- "I Have Nothing" -- and searching for a solution to his problems. "What I thought of most was getting out," he says. "What I worried about most was my Mom. If she heard I was in prison " -- he pauses and shivers -- "it would be terrible."
He thought his best opportunity to escape would be while working on the prison farm. "I decided the best time was when it rained, because then it's harder for them to drive their motorcycles around looking for you, and they won't try as hard to find you." So on June 12, 1990, after a thunderstorm, Liu made his move.
He was working in a large vegetable field with seven other prisoners. Security is relatively lax in Chinese labor camps, because traditionally there is no place for an escaped prisoner to run. On that day, only three guards were on duty, and the prisoners were scattered about the field. Liu began to work near the guard who was paying the least attention.
"When the guard wasn't looking, I slipped behind a hedge," he says. "I was ready to say that I needed to relieve myself." But the guard didn't notice and Liu crawled to the edge of the field and then through another hedge functioning as a kind of fence. Since Liu had not been convicted of any offense, he was wearing civilian clothes and was able to hurry along the road and hitch a ride on a truck. A sympathizer had smuggled a small amount of money to Liu, which enabled him to make his way to Canton, where he hid with friends.
He then made his way back to Beijing by train -- using tickets purchased by a friend -- and even though he was a fugitive from the law, he was welcomed by his buddies. Almost no one had qualms about seeing him or helping him. Yet to his friends, Liu seemed a changed man. He was no longer an idealistic university student but a prison-hardened young man who had had a taste of the fast life in Guangdong. He boasted of his underworld connections and of the invitations to join the gangs.
By late summer, Liu had regained some of his weight and had had his bedbug bites treated. But he also was getting increasingly edgy, terrified that the police were closing in on him. He decided to escape once more to Hong Kong.
Having jettisoned his documents while being repatriated to China in April, Liu Xiang had to spend $42 on a bribe to get a new pass to go in and out of Shenzhen. He arrived in Shenzhen in the fall of 1990 and renewed his underworld guanxi to see if they could help him flee to Hong Kong. But this time he found himself running into one obstacle after another. Some smugglers were willing to take him by boat to Hong Kong, but then they were arrested. His friends who had arranged the bribe for him to get to Zhong-Ying Street had also been arrested.
While waiting to work out a solution, Liu had his hair permed to look more like a Hong Kong resident. The best time to cross the border, he decided, was on a public holiday, when few Hong Kong police are on duty. He selected Christmas Day, which is a holiday in the British colony.
Working through his guanxi, Liu was able to join a group of Shenzhen residents visiting Zhong-Ying Street on Dec. 25. As the other tour members gawked, Liu slipped through the back doors and alleys on the Hong Kong side of the street and made his way to the water. With his usual aplomb, he offered to help a group of elderly Hong Kong people carry their bags onto a ferryboat. He had a terrible moment when he saw that Hong Kong police were beside the ramp, looking for Chinese illegal immigrants, but he marched brazenly toward them. The police recognized the elderly people Liu Xiang was helping and let the group pass.
On the other side of the bay, Liu Xiang took a taxi to meet some friends, who gave him refuge. But inquiries to the Hong Kong Government ran into a stone wall. The highest levels were advised of his situation in detail, but they refused once more to grant him asylum. This left him an illegal immigrant in Hong Kong, subject to arrest and repatriation at any time.
Liu considered various ways to reach the United States, including smuggling himself on a freighter, but in the end another method was found (details of which cannot be revealed here). On April 12, Liu Xiang arrived in the United States and was admitted by the immigration authorities because of his political background. As this article goes to press, Asia Watch -- the human rights organization -- is trying to find a university to take Liu for the next academic year.
"I think I will love New York," Liu Xiang says exuberantly, a few days after arriving. "It's great. And after seeing police all over the streets in Hong Kong and China, and being afraid of them, I notice that there are very few police on the streets of New York. That leaves a very favorable impression."

HEADLINE: Grace Pastiak's 'Web of Inclusion'

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: LISLE, Ill.

 BODY:
Last fall, Tellabs Inc., a maker of sophisticated telephone equipment, received an important order that would have to be completed by the end of the year. Instead of simply posting overtime notices, as would happen in many factories, Grace Pastiak called a meeting of the plant's workers.
"I knew that it was getting into the holiday season and many of the people would have family demands," said Mrs. Pastiak, director of manufacturing for one of three operating divisions. 
 Standing on a ladder in the middle of the plant, she spoke to the workers. "I gave them some choices," she said. "I said we could tell marketing we could only do half. We could bring in contract labor, or we could shift some production outside. After we talked about it, they said, 'Go for it' and that's what we did." The workers readily put in overtime to get the job done on time.
Mrs. Pastiak appears to be not just another plant manager. Instead of writing memos or limiting her discussions to one or two lieutenants, she prefers a more personal approach. She communicates directly with her people on the plant floor, trying to infect them with a zeal for producing high-quality products. And she fiddles endlessly in search of a better production set-up.
It is a style that Judy B. Rosener, a professor at the University of California at Irvine, calls "interactive leadership" and that some researchers have suggested is distinctive to women. The female managers who exhibit it, Professor Rosener wrote in a December article in the Harvard Business Review, "encourage participation, share power and information, enhance other people's self-worth, and get others excited about their work."
Sally Helgesen, a journalist and author of the book "The Female Advantage -- Women's Ways of Leadership" says the phenomenon affects the configurations of their staffs. She concludes that women tend to form flat organizations, rather than hierarchies, that emphasize frequent contacts among staff members and the sharing of information. She calls these networks "webs of inclusion."
 
An Evolving Role
The developments, these researchers say, are an outgrowth of women's evolving role in the work force. While earlier generations of female executives seemed to delight in proving they were tougher than any man, "a second wave of women," Professor Rosener wrote, "is making its way into top management not by adopting the style and habits that have proved successful for men, but by drawing on the skills and attitudes they developed from their shared experience as women."
Grace Pastiak, who, at the age of 35 is one of the rare female managers in manufacturing, may be representative of this new generation. But she says her style stems from reading and courses rather than from her orientation as a woman. "I don't think it is gender-specific," she said.
"I have the bias that people do better when they are happy," said Mrs. Pastiak, who attributes her style in part to her education in sociology and early jobs in social work. "The old style of beating on people to get things done does not work."
In fact, whether this more nurturing management style is more distinctive to women than to men is a controversial issue. Indeed, Professor Rosener's article touched off a spirited discussion in a subsequent issue of the Harvard Business Review. (Box, page 6.)
One woman who is free to run a business as she chooses, Barbara Grogan, the owner of Western Industrial Contractors, a heavy-equipment moving company in Denver, said: "Women do lead and manage differently. There is no real hierarchy in my office, and we never have meetings. Nobody controls information and power. We just make it happen."
Ross Webber, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, thinks there is a general drift away from a hierarchical, military-style management style. "In the broadest-brush terms, the decline of the hierarchy as a source of power, and an emphasis on the ability to build coalitions, is the central management trend of the past 25 years," he said. "As such, it has been a helpful trend for women managers."
For her part, Mrs. Pastiak, as the supervisor of a work force of 170 people, provides a test case of whether the factories can work effectively without relying on the traditional rigid command structure.
Although high-ranking women are found in abundance in the professions and in important staff positions in large corporations, fewer have moved into jobs of authority in manufacturing. "It may be a supply-side problem," Professor Webber observed. "Women do not want to manage in blue-collar, union situations."
There is a culture of flexibility and innovation at Tellabs that has probably permitted Mrs. Pastiak to go further with soft management methods than might have been possible in more tradition-bound companies.
Founded in 1974, Tellabs employs 2,100 in a nonunion shop and has annual sales of about $200 million, which means it is still tiny to be competing with the likes of A.T.&T., Northern Telecom, Siemens, NEC and Fujitsu.
The company operates at the intersection of the communications and computer industries. It produces products for the big long-distance and regional telephone companies as well as concerns that have their own telephone and data communications systems. A typical product is an echo canceler, which blocks out the mysterious third voice that can be a nuisance during long distance calls.
 
Committed to Training
 Mrs. Pastiak is regarded by bothher bosses and subordinates as an effective manager, and the numbers seem to back this up. She meets production targets 98 percent of the time, compared with an industry standard that she puts near 90 percent. And it is a record she keeps without seeming to be preoccupied with the output, attendance and cost reports that are the production manager's staples.
Instead, she is a champion of worker empowerment, worker education and Japanese quality methods. She takes two full days each month, for example, to teach a course in what the company calls Total Quality Commitment -- a task that she believes most male managers in her position would assign a subordinate.
Speaking to factory workers gathered in a conference room, she bubbles with enthusiasm as she goes over her personal formula for improving quality by systematic problem solving. An astute instructorm making sure her students get the message, she repeatedly focuses their attention: "What is the purpose? What is the process? And what is the payoff?"
About a dozen workers are taken at a time from their usual task of assembling circuit boards to attend the hourlong sessions. Mrs. Pastiak considers it time well spent, despite the loss of production time. "I cannot think of anything more important that I should be doing than empowering people," she said in the flat twang of a native of northern Illinois. "I want people to have a sense of accomplishment."
Not that production is neglected. Sitting in her corner office, Mrs. Pastiak reaches for a thick red binder filled with documents listing output by shift. "I get daily reports on what we shipped and weekly reports on other key measures," she said.
But she says the staff's development means she does not need to spend as much time studying reports. "The stronger the teams become, the less they need you," she said.
 
Worker Self-Reliance
 That throws more of the problem-solving to workers on the factory floor, said Tom Sharpe and Tim Murphy, two of her subordinates. "We get daily reports on why things did not ship," said Mr. Sharpe. "Usually it is for a reason out of our control. If it is within our control, we fix it and then cut the boss in on what we have done."
The proof of the production line's self-reliance: its ability to fill 98 percent of its orders. "In another plant, something may need to be done, but people say, 'That's not my job' and the order goes unfilled," Mrs. Pastiak said. "Around here the attitude is 'what do we have to do to get the order to the customer.' "
Mrs. Pastiak said it helps if top management reinforces this every-person-matters mentality. Even though the recession has cut orders, no production workers have been laid off. Instead, workes have shifted to four-day weeks until orders picked up. (The company reported a loss of $968,000 for the first quarter, compared with a profit of $2.54 million last year.)
 Most of Mrs. Pastiak's subordinate managers are men, many of whom say she manages differently than men in senior roles. Duane Dhamen, a project manager, said in referring to the head of another division, "he talks to one or two key people and lets the information filter down to the ranks." By contrast, Mrs. Pastiak "puts a stronger focus on the team and open communications," he said.
Another manager, David Gladstein, said: "If Grace left tomorrow, we would still be a team, at least for a while. But with a different individual, it could change."
Mrs. Pastiak did not know a capacitor from a resistor when she came to work at Tellabs as a buyer in 1977.
At that time, recalls Michael J. Birck, a former Bell Laboratories engineer who was one of the founders of Tellabs and remains its president, sales growth was rapid, but it was clear the company's manufacturing operations were dragging it down. "We had a 35.8 percent gross margin in 1985, which is no way to survive," he said. "At that level we could not invest enough in new products to grow." The aim was at least 45 percent before taxes and depreciation and interest costs.
In addition, there were serious quality problems, a significant threat in an industry that emphasizes reliability. "Mike Birck went into one of our stockrooms and checked some of our products," recalled Edward McDevitt, a vice president. "Only 70 percent of the samples he chose performed to specs."
Rather than try to solve the problems by shifting production overseas, as some companies have done, Mr. Birck asked Mr. McDevitt to start applying Japanese manufacturing methods, like just-in-time inventory control and statistical quality control. Mr. McDevitt, in turn, chose Mrs. Pastiak to lead a pilot project in the Lisle factory in mid-1986.
"I knew that Grace was good at teaching and training, and I knew she would move any roadblocks in her way," he said.
Under the new process, individual workers were trained to inspect their own work and given the right to shut down production until errors were corrected. Rather than working on parts of a product, like welders on an automobile assembly line, workers were organized into teams. Each team assembles a product from beginning to end, and each member of a team is trained to do multiple jobs.
The pilot project was successful. Work-in-process inventory went down 80 percent. The time it took to fill an order went from 22 days to two. Financial margins improved as well. Last year the company, whose shares are traded over-the-counter, reported that its gross margin had widened to 44.9 percent.
While the project was under way, Mrs. Pastiak spent most of her days on the factory floor, changing the way the circuit boards were assembled, soldered and tested. She rearranged so many machines that the maintenance crews would try to hide when she came around. "They would say, 'That woman is moving furniture again,' " Mrs. Pastiak recalled.
The success of the pilot led to companywide use of the technique and to Mrs. Pastiak's promotion to director of manufacturing in 1987, making her the highest-ranking woman line executive in the company. (Among staff jobs, women hold the titles of general counsel and the head of a software development project.)
 
A Few More Hurdles
 Grace Swanson met Robert Pastiak at Tellabs. "He actually worked for me for a while, which was interesting," she said.
They have two small children: Annie who is 2 1/2 years old and Brian, 17 months. Mrs. Pastiak said she drops the children at a day care center in the morning and picks them up in the evening. She concedes it is a less-than-ideal arrangement.
Nevertheless, being part of a two-income couple may also have given her more latitude to act than her male peers. "I may have more freedom to innovate, because my paycheck is not the sole support of the family," she said.
Still, even at Tellabs, some of her female colleagues doubt that a woman can go to the very top. They said that in general the men who control manufacturing companies need to become more comfortable with women as colleagues -- and their styles -- before they begin bestowing vice presidential titles on women.
"It is a comfort-level thing," said Diana Kreitling, a former manufacturing supervisor who is now in marketing. "Most of the male managers are in their mid-40's to 60's, which is about half a generation ahead of us. Their real concern is, 'Can I tell this joke? Can I go golfing with her? What about business trips?' "
 
 
The Pay Lag Persists, Whatever the Reasons
 Despite women's progress in the corporate world, there is still a long way to go, according to Wendy Reed-Crisp, director of the National Association for Female Executives in New York.
"As women get into a field, salaries go down because women are willing to work for less," she said. "It has happened in public relations, real estate and some parts of advertising. Women are desperate for the opportunity, so they undersell themselves."
Ms. Reed-Crisp said her organization includes about 250,000 women in middle to upper management, entrepreneurial roles and the professions. Membership has increased by 90,000 in the last two years, as the recession has prompted women fearful of losing their jobs to try to build networks.
According to Ms. Reed-Crisp, statistics comparing women's pay with men's tend to understate the disparity because they include union contracts, which mandate equal pay for women members. "If you take the 60 or 65 cents we earn to the man's dollar and take the union women out, then we would probably drop to 38 to 40 cents," she said. "I told the women who thought they were doing so well during the 80's that it looked good because of the Teamsters."
Arline Easley, an economist in the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor noted, however, that this comparison left higher-paid union members on the men's side of the equation. The trend for the last decade, she said, has been a closing gap between pay rates, although a difference certainly remains.
Women tend to spend less time on the job because of family obligations and have historically had less opportunity for on-the-job training and advanced education, she said. These factors have tended to hold down women's pay scales.
The unvarnished truth? Unlikely to surface, given the sensitivity of all pay issues. At Tellabs Inc. spokesman, asked about Grace Pastiak's situation, said she is paid the same as the men in like jobs. But he would not disclose her pay.

 
 
HOW WOMAN LEAD
 Excerpts from Judy Rosener's article "Ways Women Lead," printed in the December 1990 issue of the Harvard Business Review, and some of the responses it generated.
 
"I call their leadership style 'interactive leadership' because these women actively work to make their interactions with subordinates positive for everyone involved. More specifically, the women encourage participation, share power and information, enhance other people's self-worth and get others excited about their work."
 JUDY B. ROSENER, University of California, Irvine.
 
"Most people are oriented toward finding differences between men and women and tend to downplay the similarities they show. Judy Rosener falls into the same trap. ... Instead of observing men and women at work to ascertain whether they indeed act differently, she asked them to discribe their styles."
 CYNTHIA FUCHS EPSTEIN, City University of New York
 
"Our data also found women were somewhat more likely to be described as charismatic leaders, leaders with whom subordinates want to identify, leaders with whom they could form strong, emotional attachments."
 BERNARD BASS, State University of New York, Binghamton.
 
Judy Rosener's "findings show that top women succeed because they are women, not in spite of it."
 MONIQUE R. SIEGAL, Management Related Services, Zurich.
 
"I do agree that this participative style comes more naturally to women. But the Japanese, a very male-oriented culture, seem to have perfected the art of
participatory management.
 CAROL R. GOLDBERG, Avcar Group, Boston.
 
"I would like to remind the 'New Age' feminists that Athena, the Greek goddess of war, was just as much a woman as was Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love."
 JEFFERY A. SONNENFELD, Emory Business School, Atlanta

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Making Money by Printing It

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Perhaps it was an odd move for Martin Ferenczi to leave the button-down world of corporate banking to run a rough-and-tumble start-up in a business he barely knew. But as he begins his second year at the Banknote Corporation of America, a printer of currency and other high-security documents, he doesn't seem to be suffering from anything other than creative chaos.
Banknote is the offspring of two giants in the $200 million industry -- the United States Banknote Company and the American Banknote Company -- that established it last year when they sought approval to merge. 
 "The Justice Department said there must be a competitor and the competitor had to be credible," said Mr. Ferenczi.
The merged entity, the United States Banknote Company, enlisted a venerable Paris-based currency printer, Francois-Charles Oberthur, which had been looking for entree into the American market. Oberthur acquired assets of American Banknote. It also hired Mr. Ferenczi away from Chase Manhattan Bank, where he was a managing director.
In a year, says Mr. Ferenczi, Banknote has reached sales of about $10 million. Banknote's part of the pie includes visas, car titles, Federal food coupons and stock certificates.
Mr. Ferenczi, who is 36 years old, recognizes opportunities where some see only criminal behavior. Technical advances make it is easier to forge "unsecuritized" documents like gift certificates, for example.
The volatile state of the modern world is also good for currency printers. "Changes in regimes help; inflation helps," Mr. Ferenczi said.

 BODY:

THE EDGE OF PARADISE
America in Micronesia.
By P. F. Kluge.
244 pp. New York:
Random House.
$21.95. 
 Micronesia is the littlest and least known of the -nesias. It is a smaller place than Polynesia, and though it has had its Captain Cooks, Fletcher Christians and Paul Gauguins, they seem scaled down somehow -- miniheroes who have failed to capture world attention. Micronesia has also had its Margaret Meads and Bronislaw Malinowskis, only more anonymous ones -- ethnographers who have failed to titillate quite as Melanesia's have.
The world is vaguely aware of Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, which was ruined by H-bomb testing; of Truk, in the central Carolines, where a Japanese fleet lies sunk in the lagoon; of Tinian in the Marianas, from which the Enola Gay took off with the Hiroshima bomb; and of Peleliu, in the western Carolines, the site of one of the bloodiest and least necessary battles of the Pacific war. But that's about it. The oldest joke about the former United States Trust Territory is "Mike who?"
Micronesia's small islands and coral atolls are scattered over three million square miles of the western Pacific. Since their discovery by Magellan in 1521, the islands have been ruled in turn by the Spanish, Germans, Japanese and Americans. They are diverse, lovely, troubled places now trying to find their own way.
P. F. Kluge, the author of "Eddie and the Cruisers" and a former correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, was sent to the islands by the Peace Corps in 1967. He arrived during the American epoch, when Micronesia was called the United States Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. He was what he calls a "high-caste" volunteer, his job not to build latrines but to edit a quarterly called The Micronesian Reporter. He traveled widely. He got the big picture.
One of Mr. Kluge's sidelines was writing speeches and manifestoes for island diplomats negotiating Micronesia's future. Among those diplomats was Lazarus Salii of the Palau archipelago. In 1985, Salii, years after Mr. Kluge's departure, became the second president of the new republic of Palau (one of the four entities that emerged from the old Trust Territory) and he was its second president to die by the gun. (The first one was murdered.) Troubled by Salii's death, apparently a suicide, Mr. Kluge traveled back to the islands in 1989. "The Edge of Paradise" is his account of that trip from the Marshall Islands in the east to Palau in the west, his hunt for clues about Salii's death and for clues about his own ambivalent love for the islands.
No one has better captured the face and the feel of Micronesia in transition. Describing an atoll in the Marshall Islands, Mr. Kluge writes, "The houses are few and far between, tin and wood shacks with carefully swept crushed coral yards, the day's laundry spread out, like a bright carpet, or hung on washlines, like paintings at an outdoor gallery. . . . Odd blend of K mart and Gauguin."
Mr. Kluge's details are sharp and so are his summary evaluations: "It isn't the beauty of Palau. There are lots of beautiful places, postcard pretty. It's not the friendliness of the people, that's for sure, because there are many people more hospitable than Palauans. Not the climate, hot and funky, not the food, not the culture. It's Palau's sense of itself, its pride, malice, opportunism, mystery."
The United States has been roundly criticized for neglecting the obligations of its trusteeship and not preparing the islands well for independence, but Mr. Kluge does not paint the Americans as villains and the islanders as victims. That is the easy path taken by most of the journalists and documentary film makers who spend two or three weeks in Micronesia before doing their exposes. Indeed, the view that the islanders have been helpless pawns of American strategic planners is more patronizing than any stance colonial bureaucrats ever took there. Reality is more complicated. And Mr. Kluge, in describing the present unhappy state of island society and economy -- its crumbling infrastructure and its crippling debt, for instance -- shows there is plenty of blame to go around.
I first came to Micronesia in 1971, four years after Mr. Kluge. And my experience there paralleled his in an eerie number of ways. I can vouch for everything he says about island heat, island sunsets, island women, island fever, the sweet-sad ambiance of ramshackle island capitals. I have had to deal, as he has, with the certainty of islanders that my note-taking was for the C.I.A., and then with the bafflement of editors over my obsession with these insignificant bits of real estate.
"The Edge of Paradise" is a stream of observation and recollection that is almost always acute, but I'm not sure Mr. Kluge has fashioned a suitable frame for it. His story line follows the search for clues about Lazarus Salii's life and death, but that often seems more a device than a genuine quest.
Mr. Kluge's Micronesia is a Micronesia of provincial capitals. His characters are the movers and shakers of the various archipelagoes. "The essence of Palau," he writes, is "beer, conspiracy, and cha-cha music." Certainly, the Palau of brown-skinned Machiavellis in white Gucci shoes is real. It is the arena in which Palauan history, such as it is, is being made. It is probably where a Micronesian reporter ought to be. And Mr. Kluge describes it better than anyone.
But there is another Palau where Mr. Kluge spends little time: an island of coral reefs, rain forests, small villages, outer islands, of wide, square-toed feet that have never known Guccis. Those bare feet have propelled divers down to some of the richest coral reefs in the world.
A persistent melancholy runs through this book, a you-can't-go-home-again theme. There might have been less of this had Mr. Kluge spent more time on the actual edges of paradise, in places where things change less -- out on the reef, with a polychromatic string of reef fish on his belt. If you linger in its towns, Micronesia can indeed be a depressing place. If you get away from them, Micronesia is still something like paradise.
"The Edge of Paradise" is a good book, true to its reality. Occasionally, though, I found myself wishing Mr. Kluge had written it 20 years ago, when his love for the islands was simpler.
Still, as a guide to the new Micronesia, Mr. Kluge is peerless. In a restaurant on Majuro Atoll he notes, for example, "that certain way waitresses have of not walking but slouch-sliding across the floor, arms swinging, thighs a-swish, but zori-clad feet never leaving the floor. Forward progress is barely measurable, ultimate arrival punctuated by a bored, sighing collapse into an empty chair, followed by a bemused scrutiny of the customer reading the menu. The steak? We don't have. Cheeseburg? We don't have."
This is not the sort of ballet that would drive most people to tears, but I almost cried when I read it. This young woman has waited on me on half a dozen archipelagoes. In her, I think, more than in Lazarus Salii, Mr. Kluge has found the real essence of his Micronesia.

A Big Drive to Bring Back Better Times

BYLINE: By KENT SHAW

DATELINE: NEWPORT, VT.

 BODY:
HARD times are no stranger to this city of 4,400 residents at the confluence of two major rail lines just south of the Canadian border.
City officials, however, hope to bring back the good times by attracting Canadian manufacturers and other commercial ventures through incentives and by developing the waterfront with business and commerce, entertainment and housing. 
 As late as the 1960's, passenger trains roared daily into Newport, which lies at the southern end of Lake Memphremagog. In those days, the pristine 30-mile-long glacial lake was crowded with fishermen taking advantage of legendary spawning runs of salmon and rainbow trout.
Only the occasional freight train arrives here now, and the lake's stock of fish is so depleted that even modest catches make the daily newspaper.
The dairy industry that was the basis of Newport's rural economy for as long as anyone can recall is gasping for breath, and milk prices have fallen below the cost of production. And the city's long-vibrant garment and logging industries are in decline, the former from foreign competition, the latter from the drop in housing construction.
To make matters worse, a snow drought has left nearby Jay Peak wanting for ski customers for the last several years.
Unemployment in Orleans County, with a population of 24,500, has soared past 14 percent -- to 14.4 near the end of last month -- by far the worst in Vermont.
 Most promising for turning matters around, city officials say, is bolstering longstanding ties with the neighboring province of Quebec, where interest in finding a gateway to United States markets is keener than ever. Many Canadian manufacturers have taken advantage of Newport's status as one of three job zones created in the mid-80's by the Vermont Legislature.
Codet Inc., a Quebec outdoor apparel maker, leased state-subsidized space to get a foothold south of the border. The company recently announced that it had outgrown its space and would buy a warehouse from the Slalom Corporation, a skiwear maker that went out of business in February.
Although the state has proposed cutting the job zone budget of $56,000 by as much as $40,000, local officials say the pursuit of Canadian business is going to remain a high priority in northern Vermont. The Greater Newport Area Chamber of Commerce has begun joint ventures with its Canadian counterparts, touting Newport's large population of French-speaking residents.
Development of the waterfront is another key, city officials say, although they admit that a difficult permit process, the clash of environmental and development interests and financing all present obstacles.
MOST recently, the city became one of eight finalists in a bid for state funds for a $187,000 bicycle and pedestrian pathway around the bay that would connect the waterfront, city parks and downtown. State officials are expected to announce the winner -- all eight projects involve bicycle or other alternative transportation projects -- before summer.
Jobs were foremost on the minds of the City Council when it announced support for a 150-bed correctional center in Newport, a state proposal that drew fierce opposition in at least two other towns. Planners say the $16.5 million center would generate about 125 jobs and bring more than $2 million a year into the area's economy.
A challenge by environmental groups was turned down by state environmental officials, who issued the final state permit in mid-April. The state has appropriated the funds and all that is needed for construction to start is an Army Corps of Engineers permit.
Mayor Douglas Spates, who operates a florer and landscaping business and whose rental apartments make him probably the city's biggest landlord, said the center would be a significant component of revival.
"We looked at it and saw 100 or 125 very stable jobs," he said.
 Along the waterfront, at least two large development projects are on hold under circumstances that illustrate some of the problems of Newport's economy. Although they have all the necessary permits, developers of both properties, citing financial uncertainty, have backed off for now.
One of the developers, Chet Greenwood, president of the local Prouty and Miller lumberyard, says he hopes to find a buyer for his 7,000-square-foot Landing Restaurant and an expansive development plan that goes with it. Mr. Greenwood had planned a 74-room hotel atop the restaurant and 44 condominium units next door. The project, which he estimates would cost $4.5 million, would offer the only overnight accommodations other than private cottages for visitors to the 30-mile-long lake.
Each of the condominium apartments, whose size and layout are undecided, would be offered at $125,000 and would come with a reserved boat slip. An additional 64 slips would be available to the public on a first come first served basis.
Mr. Greenwood spent $60,000 on planning and permits, but the project is in limbo because of doubts about financing.
Another potential obstacle to the project is Vermont's public trust doctrine, under which all bodies of water must be open to the public and which could make any private use of public waters subject to challenge. Last year, the Chittenden County Superior Court invoked the doctrine in striking down a marina project on Lake Champlain, although it involved only private slips.
IN 1989, the state's Supreme Court ruled that only the Legislature had the power to define public trust. Despite wrangling over how it should be construed, no clear picture has emerged from the Statehouse, except for one special-interest law approving a large waterfront project in Burlington involving commercial construction and a park.
Mr. Greenwood said a development like the one he planned could benefit the local economy by attracting, not only as tourists but also as potential investors, the many Canadians who visit each summer in expensive yachts.
"But I don't know how long I can just sit on a piece of property like this," he said. "That's why I've put it on the market."
He is asking $1.2 million for the 300-seat restaurant, seven acres of waterfront property, all necessary permits and the architectural plans.
The other developer, John W. Stevens, a realtor and a member of the City Planning Commission, is also concerned about running afoul of the public-trust doctrine if he goes ahead with plans for a $600,000 restaurant-marina across the broad bay from Mr. Greenwood's land. He also has all needed permits.
Rather than build permanent docking space, Mr. Stevens has proposed installing floating moorings and ferrying visitors ashore by dinghy. He said he would go ahead if he can get financing.
"Actually, all that's holding it up now is money," Mr. Stevens said. "The banks are all in an upheaval."
His restaurant would be the third on the lake. Besides the Landing, there is a McDonald's in Magog, on the northern tip of the lake, 15 miles into Quebec.
Mayor Spates says he is intent on energizing a city government that he feels has been complacent about trying to shape the city's future. "We've been asleep at the wheel for a long time," he said.

A Vermont City Acts to Bring Back Happier Times

BYLINE: By KENT SHAW

DATELINE: NEWPORT, VT.

 BODY:
Hard times are no stranger to this city of 4,400 residents at the confluence of two major rail lines just south of the Canadian border.
City officials, however, hope to bring back the good times by attracting Canadian manufacturers and other commercial ventures through incentives and by developing the waterfront with business and commerce, entertainment and housing. 
 As late as the 1960's, passenger trains roared daily into Newport, which lies at the southern end of Lake Memphremagog. In those days, the pristine 30-mile-long glacial lake was crowded with fishermen taking advantage of legendary spawning runs of salmon and rainbow trout. Only occasional freight trains arrive here now, and the lake's stock of fish is so depleted that even modest catches make the daily newspaper.
The dairy industry that was the basis of Newport's rural economy for as long as anyone can recall is gasping for breath, and milk prices have fallen below the cost of production. And the city's long-vibrant garment and logging industries are in decline, the former from foreign competition, the latter from the drop in housing construction.
To make matters worse, a snow drought has left nearby Jay Peak wanting for ski customers for the last several years.
Unemployment in Orleans County, with a population of 24,500, has soared past 14 percent -- to 14.4 near the end of last month -- by far the worst in Vermont.

HEADLINE: Women in Business Expand a Network

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
HAVING "a business of one's own" has become a reality for increasing numbers of women, as was clear from the record turnout at this year's Showcasing Expo sponsored by the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners.
The seventh annual Expo, held late last month at the Marriott here, provided a marketing and professional networking opportunity for the 250 association members as well as 195 nonmember business people from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. 
 This year, 94 companies in 75 business categories showed their products and services. The diversity encompassed everything from A. R. Budget Pest Control in Yonkers, owned by M. Darroux Palmoze, to Lois B. Cook, a high-tech Henry Higgins in White Plains who helps foreign-born executives lose their accents.
The recession, with its layoffs, has forced more women to become entrepreneurs, said Myra Packman, a lawyer and the association's president. "Others," she said, "are motivated by a desire for the independence that comes from being your own boss."
 
Founded 12 Years Ago
 The association was founded 12 years ago by a dozen female business owners, and it has grown steadily, Ms. Packman said. Members find that by banding together, she said, they can more readily obtain insurance, credit and financing for their businesses.
"As a trade association, we have more clout than any of us has individually," said Peggy Tomarkin Greenawalt, the association's president-elect. Ms. Greenawalt, who started her marketing-communications company, Tomarkin/ Greenawalt, five years ago after two decades in advertising, said hers was the "story of our times."
"After the agency I was working for was merged into a larger one," she said, "I was literally propelled into starting my own business. After I left the agency, several former clients called me at home and offered me various assignments. Eventually, I had enough business to warrant opening an office in Hartsdale, and then another one in Manhattan."
Ms. Greenawalt, who displayed some of her agency's work at the show, continued: "Unlike other professional organizations I belong to, we're not in hot competition with one another. There is so much diversity in our businesses that we're able to buy goods and services from one another."
 Six years ago, Ms. Cook saw an opportunity in the influx of international business people in Westchester. She left her job as a speech pathologist in the public schools and started her own business, Speech and Communications Professionals. While executives with accents are her speciality, she serves a diverse clientele whose ages range from 1 to 91.
"I stuttered as a child, which is why I got into speech pathology as an adult," Ms. Cook said. "I know firsthand how confidence can be gained when you get rid of speech problems."
At the Expo, viewers were intrigued by the black box Ms. Cook uses to track voice pitch on the screen, much like an EKG shows heartbeat patterns. After Ms. Cook described her program to eliminate foreign accents, she was asked if she could get rid of a New York accent.
"Many people, not just New Yorkers, want to lose their regional accents," Ms. Cook said. "Besides accent reduction, we also use other techniques to combat mumbling, nasal tones and sloppy speech."
 
Competence and Control
 Good speech, she added, suggests competence and control, "which is very important in today's competitive marketplace."
Ms. Cook said her membership in the association had been helpful in allowing her to develop her own business skills. "A lot of valuable information, hands-on information, is available to us in meetings and seminars," she said. "Listening to the experts talk about such things as how to develop a market plan and how to publicize your company has helped me."
Seasoned business owners, Ms. Packman said, take fledgling entrepreneurs under their wing.
"We have the kind of support group I haven't found in any other professional organizations I belong to," she said. "Our members are generous in giving their time and sharing their knowledge."
Erika Krieger, a new member, has an architectural practice in Dobbs Ferry. Her display at the Expo featured many of her blueprints. "I've made good contacts," she said. "In my profession, I've found that advertising is not enough. The Expo gave me a chance to get my name in front of a lot of people and helped me get my foot in the door of a couple of prospective clients."
Ms. Palmoze, a former nurse from the Sudan who is now a United States citizen, started A. R. Budget Pest Control in Yonkers a year ago with a partner.
 
'I Like the Work'
 "We began with a small apartment complex and moved into institutional and commercial buildings," she said. "Many of our clients are in the fast-food business. I like the work. I think of it as sanitation.
"I've met other women in business through the association. I find it very useful since most members give generous discounts to other members, which includes things that I need, such as accounting and legal services."
Dr. Ellen Cohen Lewis and Dr. Donna -DeRosa are chiropractors. Dr. Lewis is a partner in the Family Chiropractic Office in Larchmont. Dr. DeRosa practices in Yonkers. Although they are in the same profession, each said she did not feel threatened by the other's membership in the group.
"We know there is room for both of us," Dr. Cohen said. "The competition here isn't the same as you'd find at a meeting of chiropractors. I have several patients who came to me through my membership" in the association.
"I've found the Expo is a good place to talk to people," Dr. DeRosa said. "Many people who came to my booth were surprised to find that there are women chiropractors. As a matter of fact, the numbers of women in the profession are growing."
Andrea Lublinski runs a video company, which produces advertising programs that air weekly on local cable channels. Her real estate series, "House Hunters," shows interiors and exteriors of houses on the market. Mrs. Lublinski said she made it a practice to buy the goods and services she needs in her business from other association members.
 
195 Nonmember Exhibitors
 "We help each other," she said. "We support each other. That's what we're all about."
Anne Cahalane of the Marine Midland Bank in New Rochelle had a display table at the Expo to market the bank's services.
"Every business needs a bank," she said. "The Expo is a good place for us to pick up customers for our special services geared for small businesses. Business owners who work alone, for instance, don't have to come in to the bank. We'll send someone out to them."
Sharlet Brennan, who heads her own public relations agency in Katonah said that the 195 nonmember visitors to the Expo were "a strong indication that the goods and services our members have are valued by the business community at large."
In past Expos most of the activity was generated by members selling to one another, Ms. Brennan said. "That's still an important part of the Expo," she said. "But this year, we also had several exhibitors who weren't members, including some men who were eager to reach our markets."

PRESIDENT REAGAN
The Role of a Lifetime.
By Lou Cannon.
Illustrated. 948 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $24.95. 
 Lou Cannon's latest portrait of Ronald Reagan, his third, is the best study of that enigmatic Presidency yet available. The tone is judicious, the hyperbole limited and the coverage compre hensive.
In "President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime," Mr. Cannon of The Washington Post -- one of the few reporters who have covered Mr. Reagan's entire political career from the Governor's house in Sacramento to Washington -- describes a mostly stage-managed Administration. Ronald Reagan, as virtually every report illustrates, was the most inattentive and indifferent of Presidents, largely following the "scripts" that led him through his eight years in the White House. Ultimately, however, his greatest strength was his ability to sell, to utilize his considerable gifts for mass leadership. Less an ideologue than an idealist, even a dreamer, Mr. Reagan believed "that he was not really a politician at all," Mr. Cannon says, "but simply an actor on loan from Hollywood who had entered politics because he wanted to restrain the power of an increasingly intrusive government." He acted upon inspiration and inspired in return.
Handlers usually protected Mr. Reagan from himself and from the press. Their man was at once intellectually lazy and intuitively shrewd. The scripts were followed as long as they were convenient as he went through "the role of a lifetime." Mr. Reagan, Mr. Cannon writes, "may have been the one president in the history of the republic who saw his election as a chance to get some rest."
Mr. Cannon depicts Mr. Reagan's fantasy world, one that "had been created in Hollywood, out of material he brought with him from the Middle West." His unshakable optimism forever seemed to deny the realities of a boyhood blighted by his alcoholic and frequently unemployed father. He was also a self-serving visionary with faith in a mythic America, one who, at the end, "succeeded in reviving national confidence at a time when there was a great need for inspiration."
Above all, Ronald Reagan was also a natural politician. Virtually every new account demonstrates that the stage and not the Statehouse or Capitol Hill may be the most effective launching pad for power in a picture culture. The Iran-contra travesty was a perfect example of how a politically astute actor finessed what Mr. Cannon does not doubt was his personal involvement. A President with poorer survival talents could well have been impeached.
Foreign leaders, even his ideological kin, were astounded, as Mr. Cannon puts it, by "how a man of his background could become president of the world's most powerful democracy." Whatever it was, they wanted to touch it, "bottle it and take it home and use it themselves." To Mr. Reagan himself, neither that nor much else seemed mysterious. As Mr. Cannon stresses at every chance, he believed in what he wanted to believe. "There's nothing wrong with that," the President said to a columnist at a dinner party. "I do it all the time." Following White House disasters dating back some two decades, Mr. Reagan, ironically, revitalized faith in Government itself. The office, he demonstrated, could function after all. Under him, the "impossible Presidency" seemed easy. He set the pace and the national agenda.
He made the American left appear hapless. He gave power and respectability to the modern conservative movement, which had been smoldering ever since the early post-World War II years. It was Mr. Reagan and not his staff, albeit he was the most managed President in history, who, according to Mr. Cannon, "established the priorities for the major accomplishments and debacles of his presidency."
The President who had called the Soviet Union an "evil empire" finally supped with the villains themselves. The unrelenting Cold Warrior, the alleged anti-Soviet ideologue, dipped pens with Mikhail Gorbachev. Rapprochement with the "evil empire," writes Mr. Cannon, may have been Mr. Reagan's major achievement. "But," Mr. Cannon later adds, "his greatest service was in restoring the respect of Americans for themselves and their own government after the traumas of Vietnam and Watergate, the frustration of the Iran hostage crisis and a succession of seemingly failed presidencies."
Mr. Cannon's portrait is paradoxical. Not for a long time, perhaps never, will the contradictions be fully understood. Ronald Reagan's characteristic detachment frustrated those who tried to gain his attention and verged on a dereliction of duty. On the day of the 1983 economic summit, James A. Baker 3d, then chief of staff, realized Mr. Reagan had not read his briefing book. When Mr. Baker asked why, Mr. Reagan responded, "Well, Jim, The Sound of Music was on last night."
He nevertheless took what happened at Chernobyl as a warning about the potential of nuclear disaster, and responded. Not once, when implementing his Reaganomics, did he consider the obvious inability of the "rising tide" to "lift all the boats." He remained the idealistic nationalist, and that was where he functioned best. Mr. Cannon covers all this and much more. His Gipper often seems like Knute Rockne himself.

THE DISNEY TOUCH
How a Daring Management Team
Revived an Entertainment Empire.
By Ron Grover.
Illustrated. 315 pp. Homewood, Ill.:
Business One Irwin. $22.95.  
 I took my 7-year-old daughter to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., last fall. We were among the millions who help make the Walt Disney Company's huge theme park the most popular tourist attraction in the world. For three days, in addition to visiting the various Disney attractions, we lived in a Disney hotel, ate in Disney restaurants and shopped in Disney stores, often using Disney scrip. When my daughter wanted to spend a day at the nearby Universal Studios theme park, I persuaded her that the Disney/M-G-M park would be just as much fun (Disney's practice of selling multiple-day tickets gave me compelling reason to do so).
We both came away dazzled by the experience, though for different reasons. Like children the world over, my daughter found Disney World thoroughly enchanting. I, on the other hand, found myself admiring what Ron Grover calls "The Disney Touch." To spend time, as an adult, at a Disney theme park is to be impressed by the company's extraordinary marketing abilities, its obsessiveness about getting the little details right, its shrewd talents as a land developer. Even when you know you are being manipulated -- when you realize that every time you exchange a real dollar for a Disney dollar you are giving the company a short-term, non-interest-bearing loan -- it's hard not to stand in awe of the Disney operation.
It was not always thus, as Mr. Grover points out early and often in this straightforward account of the modern Disney juggernaut. In 1984, 18 years after the death of Walt Disney, the company was in obvious decline, its theme parks lackluster, its movie division bereft of ideas, its profits dwindling. Corporate raiders were swarming. To ward off the raiders, the company hired the president of Paramount Pictures, Michael Eisner, to run Disney. This book is, essentially, a paean to the business skills of Mr. Eisner, whom Mr. Grover calls "one of America's most creative executives."
Mr. Grover is the Los Angeles bureau chief of Business Week, and his brief on behalf of Mr. Eisner and "Team Disney," as he calls the people Mr. Eisner brought in to effect the turnaround, is persuasive. They revived the fortunes not just of the company's theme parks and movies, but also of its television arm, its once-fabled animation division, its home video unit and on and on.
In Mr. Grover's view, Team Disney succeeded largely by being smart, hardheaded businessmen. They understood that "Walt's classic characters -- Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto, Goofy -- [were] the asset base on which the company prospered," and they knew how to exploit those assets commercially. They had a flair for marketing. They cut the toughest deals in Hollywood; Mr. Grover recounts the oft-told story of how Disney, with such films as "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," revived the careers of fading movie stars like Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler, whom it preferred to bigger-name stars because they would work cheap. Indeed, if the author has one criticism of Team Disney, it is that the group's hardheadedness can veer toward ruthlessness. In a recent incident, for instance, Peggy Lee, the singer who co-wrote the songs and provided the voices for four of the characters in the 1955 Disney animated film "Lady and the Tramp," won a $2.3 million judgment against the company because it refused to negotiate with her when the movie was released on videocasette. As Mr. Grover dryly points out, no division at Disney has flourished more during the Eisner revival than the litigation department.
Still, as impressive as this tale is, one comes away from "The Disney Touch" feeling that the author has told only half the story. My own sense of Mr. Eisner is that for all his concentration on the bottom line, he has always had a feel for what made the Walt Disney Company so magical. Mickey and Minnie Mouse are economic assets, without question. But to stop there, as Mr. Grover does, is to diminish them. They are also wonderful characters who, for over 50 years, have managed to capture the imagination of successive generations of children. That, ultimately, is what Mr. Eisner understands. Is it any accident that under his direction the company has created its first memorable cartoon characters since Walt Disney died -- the characters who populate the 1989 hit film "The Little Mermaid"? I don't think it is, though you wouldn't know it from reading "The Disney Touch." Practically the only thing Mr. Grover tells us about this movie is how much money it grossed.
Of course, it did gross $84 million.

HEADLINE: Japan Shouldn't Cut Off North Korean Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a doctoral candidate writing a dissertation on Japanese-Korean relations, I was not wholly satisfied with "The Next Renegade State," Leslie H. Gelb's April 10 column on North Korea.
I agree that North Korea and its not-yet-inspected nuclear facilities at Yongbyon present a potentially destabilizing threat to the region and that Tokyo should make International Atomic Energy Agency inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities and the end of North Korean arms sales a condition for normalization of relations and Japanese economic aid. 
 Mr. Gelb also argues that in the meantime, Tokyo should cut off all trade with Pyongyang. I fail to see what this would achieve.
The global collapse of Communism, coupled with the success of South Korea's policy toward Moscow and Beijing, has placed Kim Il Sung's regime in its greatest diplomatic isolation. And an all but collapsed economy, combined with an imminent power transition after Mr. Kim's death, make North Korea a potential powder keg. Thus, it hardly seems wise to call on Tokyo to take an intransigent attitude in talks with Pyongyang. A Japanese trade embargo on North Korea would further isolate a desperate and aging dictator.
Such isolation might lend credence to Pyongyang's hard-liners, who are waiting to overthrow Mr. Kim's less-than-competent son once he inherits power. This would destroy any chances that the country's younger generation of more rational and pragmatic technocrats would have at reviving North Korea's economy with Western credits and aid.
Japanese sources do not see a normalization settlement for at least five years. United States intelligence analysts predict that North Korea will be able to produce a nuclear explosion within that same period. The most plausible way of getting Pyongyang to sign a full-scope nuclear safeguards agreement is for Tokyo to continue whetting North Korea's appetite for normalization with Japanese trade.

HEADLINE: Decline in Taxi Ridership Has to Do With Decline in Cabbies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The recession is not the only reason for decline in taxi ridership (news article, April 25). During a lifetime in New York City, I have never seen cab drivers so ill suited to their work.
The archetype for generations of cabbies was a streetwise, schmoozy native who got you there quickly and threw in colorful chat. They had no fear of driving to the Bronx or Brooklyn and didn't need directions.
 The drivers we hail today have trouble communicating or are stone silent. In a cab I hailed recently, two men sat in the front seat. When I got in, the man next to the driver explained he was the translator. The driver spoke no English.
Add to that getting a driver in Manhattan to go to Brooklyn and other boroughs. I started writing down drivers' names and filing complaints at the Taxi and Limousine Commission. I won my cases. The drivers had to pay $150 fines, and the offenses went on their records.
Anyone traveling outside Manhattan should be prepared to copy name and hack-license number of a driver who refuses to take you. Once you've got the driver's license number, you'll be surprised how cooperative he gets. A licensed driver is required to take you anywhere in the five boroughs.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
British Publisher Enters the U.S., Forgoing Its Past Noms de Plume

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
After more than 15 years of conceiving, editing and producing books for Alfred A. Knopf, Random House, Little, Brown and other publishers, Dorling Kindersley Ltd. of London has decided to publish books under its own name in the United States.
Backed by an investment of about $500,000 and an eight-person office in Manhattan, the American arm of Dorling Kindersley plans to publish 22 books this fall and another 35 to 40 next spring. 
 In the fall of 1992, it expects to publish 70 titles and it is aiming for sales of $25 million within three years. In keeping with Dorling Kindersley tradition, all the books will be nonfiction, most will be reference works and all will be heavily illustrated.
 
'Absolutely Unique' Product
 If those aims sound unrealistic, given the depressed state of publishing, there are few doubters among rival publishers. And some publishers think Dorling Kindersley, with its emphasis on illustrated reference books, cannot miss. "Their product is absolutely unique in the marketplace," said Joseph A. Kanon, the head of the Houghton Mifflin Company's trade and reference division.
Despite an informal policy of not distributing books of other publishers, Houghton Mifflin recently agreed to take on those of Dorling Kindersley, largely because of Houghton Mifflin's success in publishing under its imprint books produced by the British house. These include "The Way Things Work" by David Macaulay, which has sold more than a million copies worldwide.
In fact, the 300 or more titles that Dorling Kindersley has produced for publishers in about 20 countries have sold more than 80 million copies -- and no title, its executives contend, has sold fewer than 100,000. As a result, revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30 are projected at $70 million. And its future revenues could grow sharply if the company prospers in the American market.
In relative terms, at least, Dorling Kindersley already prospers in the United States, where it derives 28 percent of its sales. But having successfully evolved in Britain from packager (or book producer) to publisher, it wants to do the same thing here.
 
'Next Stage in Our Growth'
 "We take a global view of publishing, and we view the American market as the next stage in our growth," said Peter Kindersley, the chairman, who co-founded the company in 1974 to produce books for other publishers.
Christopher Davis, the deputy chairman, added: "This is not a matter of vanity. It's a move that's market-driven."
Dorling Kindersley's reasons for wanting to publish here, instead of continuing merely to produce books for others, is not hard to understand: A publisher stands to make more money -- often several times more -- than the packager. That's because a publisher derives the revenue from the sale of the book (minus author's royalty, production costs, overhead, etc.), while packagers usually earn what is essentially a royalty on each sale. On a big-selling book, the difference can be substantial.
Publishers buy books from packagers for a variety of reasons, including to help fill their lists or to enable them to publish in areas in which their own editors lack interest or experience. They also buy very expensive illustrated books from packagers, who are able to keep retail prices from soaring by selling them to publishers in many countries. While packagers sometimes pay royalties to their authors, most packaged books are produced by their salaried staffs or by authors who are are paid a flat fee.
Dorling Kindersley Inc., the American company, will preview its fall list of 7 adult and 15 children titles at the convention of the American Booksellers Association, beginning June 1.
Steven Sussman, who heads the American company, can hardly wait. 'We'll have our first books out in September," he said, "and we'll begin seeing revenue by December. We want to be the pre-eminent publisher of reference books."
Two months ago, the Microsoft Corporation bought a 26 percent stake in Dorling Kindersley for an undisclosed price, giving the company the right to create software from existing Dorling Kindersley books.
 
Valuable Arrangement
 Starting from scratch, many publishers would be at a disadvantage, at least with booksellers, who are more likely to buy books from publishers they know than from those they do not. That is why Dorling Kindersley's distribution arrangement with Houghton Mifflin is valuable for the new American house -- and potentially valuable for Houghton Mifflin, because distributors typically receive a percentage of each book sold.
Also valuable is Dorling Kindersley's record of producing best sellers. These include "The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide," published by Random House, with worldwide sales exceeding five million; "The Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook," published by William Morrow, with more than 2.8 million copies sold; a series of gift books published by Bantam Books, with more than 1.2 million copies sold, and the Eyewitness Books series for children, published by Knopf, with more than 7.5 million copies sold.
 
Investment inReference Books
 Mr. Kindersley explains his company's success by saying that no other publisher will invest so heavily in reference books. "And if they are prepared," he said, "they have no worldwide system for selling them."
That may be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. As for why the large publishers allowed Dorling Kindersley to fill that niche practically uncontested, Mr. Kanon of Houghton Mifflin explained: "For economic reasons, they have had to think globally in a way American publishers did not, until now. In order to make these books work over the years, they had to publish worldwide."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Auctions Expected to Draw Buyers

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The credit markets face a record volume of Treasury debt issues at the quarterly refunding auctions this week, but analysts expect the sales to attract buyers because of the recent rise in yields.
The markets ended last week in confusion, amid conflicting readings of the Government's economic data for April. After several important interest rates were lowered by the Federal Reserve and big commercial banks, the Government on Friday issued contradictory data on employment trends last month. 
 The Labor Department's survey of American households showed a sharp rise of 644,000 non-farm jobs. The increase was the first reported since May 1990. But in the same report, a survey of businesses showed the number of non-farm jobs fell 124,000 in April.
 
Revision of Data Expected
 "Although the confusion that swept the bond market Friday was understandable, it should have been obvious that something was wrong with the April employment data," Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview during the weekend. "The jobs data have rarely been so contradictory, and we are sure the numbers will be revised in the next report."
But Professor Siegel also saw a positive side in the drop of Treasury securities prices on Friday. "The sharp price declines that raised the yields on Treasury notes and bonds on Friday should help the market absorb the record refunding," he said. "In fact, we think the auctions will attract many foreign buyers, as well as the dealers who wound up absorbing much of the Treasury paper at great cost after the last refunding in February. At the moment, the yields are quite attractive relative to other investments."
 
Confusion Reigns
 Yields tumbled last Tuesday when the Fed cut its discount rate for member banks to 5.5 percent, from 6 percent. More important, it caused the Federal funds rate -- which banks charge each other for temporary loans -- to fall to 5.75 percent, from 6 percent. The next day, commercial banks began cutting their prime lending rate to 8.5 percent, from 9 percent. But confusion over the unemployment data caused rates to bounce back. By late Friday, the Treasury's 30-year bonds closed with a yield of 8.22 percent, up from 8.20 a week earlier, thus eliminating the large gains made earlier in the week when interest rates were falling.
The $37 billion refunding will begin tomorrow when the Treasury auctions $13.5 billion of three-year notes. Based on when-issued trading late Friday, this normally popular maturity is expected to yield 7.12 perent. On Wednesday, $11.75 billion of 10-year notes go on sale; these yielded 8.02 percent at the end of last week, The auctions will end on Thursday with the sale of $11.75 billion of 30-year bonds, which traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.21 percent.
 
Positive Yield Curve
 Norman Robertson, senior vice president and chief economist of the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, also expects the auctions to go well, largely because of the uncommonly positive yield curve between the 30-year bonds and the discount rate on 90-day bills, which was 5.47 percent late Friday.
Another reason for his optimism, he said in a telephone interview, was that "these yields may not last long and the market knows this because there are ample signs that the recession is bottoming out." Mr. Robertson added that this view was not based on the "strange employment statistics," which he considered an aberration.
But the flood of corporate debt issues that has inundated the market could slow the decline in interest rates, Mr. Robertson said. Most top corporate borrowers price their debt offerings off comparable Treasury maturities, and as yields on Treasury bonds fell early last week many companies seized the occasion to sell debt issues.
 
Close to a Record Volume
 Statisticians at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei said $5.9 billion of corporate debt came to market last week, which they said could be close to a record volume for a week.
Far less optimistic about an economic revival is S. Jay Levy, chairman of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. "Because private fixed investments, which are the major source of profits and economic growth, will remain depressed well beyond 1991, the economic recovery will be largely invisible for quite a long time," Mr. Levy said.
He cited several reasons for his pessimism. For one, "the economy is still overleveraged, overpriced, redundant in fixed assets and the market value of its services," he said.
 
Intensified Problems Seen
 He added that he also expected financial problems to intensify as corporate and private debtors depleted their cash and faced defaults. Another problem is that it may take years before the battered commercial banks are able to relax their tight lending policies.
Economic recovery will also be retarded by continued Government deficits that force it to compete with the private sector for available credit, Mr. Levy said. The current practice of state and local governments of raising taxes or reducing services will also stall a recovery, he added.
Mr. Levy said that "the revival in residential real estate is over-ballyhooed and won't soon stop the decline in housing construction outlays."
"Although consumer confidence soared after the Persian Gulf war," he added, "consumer spending, the major engine in any economic recovery, shows no vigor to jump-start the recovery."

With surveys showing a sharp rebound in consumer confidence after the Persian Gulf war, one might assume that it would not be long before the economy itself started to pull out of recession. The nation's households, after all, account for two-thirds of economic activity -- half of this at retail counters and half in paying for things like sailing lessons, subway tokens, boarding-school tuition and the monthly mortgage.
But the improvement in consumer psychology, now ebbing a bit, is not quickly translating into a spending surge, for reasons ranging from debt to demography. 
 An obviously concerned Federal Reserve moved last Tuesday to spur the economy by making another round of cuts in interest rates.
 
The Only Resort
 Right now, the consumer sector "is the only place that you could get a significant demand gain that could pull the economy out of decline," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.
One reason consumers loom so large is that they are responsible for a bigger-than-usual share of the contraction in the current recession. Another is that there does not seem much likelihood of getting such a boost elsewhere, either from spending by government or from the stimulus of business investment or exports, both of which show signs of faltering.
The main problem seems to be that the consumer, like the nation President Bush described at his inauguration, may well have more will than wallet.
There are various possible explanations for this situation, some of them at variance with what consumers sometimes tell pollsters, some not seeming to square with one or another set of figures.
One prominent theory, ostensibly supported by daily headlines as well as anecdotal evidence, is that American society, from the Federal Government to the ordinary worker, is overwhelmed with debt. Companies default on bonds, individuals in record numbers resort to bankruptcy, and ever-fewer states command triple-A credit ratings.
But experts disagree sharply about indebtedness. Should it be measured against assets that have also increased -- assuming that debtors have, say, healthy stock portfolios -- or against income that would normally be called upon to service it?
Relatedly, some maintain that consumers are reeling from declines in the value of homes or other real estate, an almost unheard-of situation for decades and a psychological depressant on top of a financial one.
Yet if people were really worried about excessive debt and deflation of assets, economic theory suggests they would be raising their savings and paying off some loans. But the meager personal savings rate in this country, 4.1 percent for the first quarter of 1991, is half a point lower than in 1989 and 1990. Is the consumer simply unable to save?
 
Shrunken Incomes
 Another explanation for at least part of the reduced consumer spending is that the baby-boom generation has entered middle age and, with houses furnished and college expenses looming, is realizing that the time has come to cut out the $100 designer jeans and other extravagances. Perhaps this shift will show up before long in higher savings rates.
But the dominant view is that the consumer is mainly restrained not by debt or demographics but by shrunken income -- a painful inability, after inflation and taxes, to make ends meet.
"At work has been a classic compression of household purchasing power," asserted Stephen S. Roach, a top economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. He finds an exceptionally tight link between income and spending in recent years, the two falling since the third quarter of 1989 at "virtually identical" rates of five-tenths of 1 percent and seven-tenths of 1 percent, respectively.
Last summer, real disposable personal income turned negative and then accelerated during the autumn quarter to a 3.5 percent rate of decline. Last month, the Government reported some moderation in the slide, to a rate of 1.6 percent.
 
Taxes Rise; Inflation Worsens
 Susan M. Sterne, president of Economic Analysis Associates in Stowe, Vt., called these figures dismal. She noted that recessions typically bring tax cuts but that this time taxes, mainly excise taxes, have been raised. Inflation, meanwhile, has worsened instead of eased as measured by the three-month core rate that leaves out energy and food.
Policy makers expected a brisk rebound after the gulf war, "and we are not getting it," Ms. Sterne said, adding, "The consumer's income has just eroded too far."
Incomes, of course, depend largely on employment, and the number of people without jobs is 1.4 million above what it was last July, when the recession officially began. Thus, aggregate as well as individual buying power has been cut. And while lower interest rates act as a general spur to the economy, rate cuts tend to shrink the investment incomes of retired people and others with savings.
 
A Chicken-and-Egg Issue
 Indeed, incomes are both causes and effects in the economic firmament, and whether they rebound or not depends on a complex interplay of the forces of demand, production and employment.
Henry Ford, for one, discovered that by raising his workers' pay to the then unheard-of level of $5 a day in 1914, he was enabling them to buy his company's cars, fresh stimulus for the circle of business activity.
So whether or when the consumer obtains the means -- as opposed to the desire -- to help lift the economy out of recession is sort of a chicken-and-egg issue, Mr. Rippe said, one not lending itself to precise analysis. An end to job shrinkage, however, would be a good beginning.
 
'A Relatively Subdued Rebound'
 Mr. Roach finds a resumption of income growth already "in the cards," aided by the reversal of war-related jumps in oil prices that should increase disposable income by about half a percent over the coming year. He said business inventories have now been "decisively" liquidated, so that even a small pickup in demand would lift production and extend working hours.
But he, along with Ms. Sterne and others, fret about the apparently permanent loss of service jobs in recent years, many of them high paying.
"Tempering the income rebound," Mr. Roach said, "will be a slowdown of white-collar hiring in the 1990's -- a by-product of a dramatic restructuring of America's service sector that is already having an impact on banks, securities firms, insurance, telecommunications, airlines, retail trade, accounting and advertising. The net result is a relatively subdued rebound of income, limiting consumption gains to 2.8 percent from mid-1991 to mid-1992, well below the nearly 5 percent rebounds of the past recoveries."

HEADLINE: White House in Shift on Job Relief

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
The White House, in offering enticements to win approval for trade legislation it sorely wants, has abandoned a position that has been held dear by the Bush Administration -- and earlier by the Reagan Administration. It has also revived a debate over whether the Government should give special help to workers who lose their jobs because of competition from imports.
To win labor backing for trade expansion in the 1960's, the Kennedy Administration came up with a plan to provide payments and retraining benefits to workers hurt by imports. In recent years, the Reagan and Bush Administrations have tried to kill the program. 
 But to court support for the authority to negotiate a Mexican trade pact, President Bush has agreed to consider benefits specifically related to labor problems that are likely to arise from trade expansion with Mexico. Through its about-face, the Administration hopes to undermine a powerful coalition of labor, textile, environmental and other interests, all of whom fear that an agreement with Mexico will cost jobs and hurt the environment because of looser Mexican standards.
 
Evolved Over 3 Decades
 In a letter to Congress last Wednesday, Mr. Bush agreed, among other things, to consider "adequate assistance and effective retraining for dislocated workers."
The pledge means the Administration will work with Congress to shape a new or improved package of worker services. It represents a shift in the longstanding position of both the Reagan and Bush Administrations that special import adjustment programs are unnecessary.
Such assistance has evolved through several pieces of legislation over three decades. But some members of Congress and union officials say current assistance is not adequate to deal with the possible employment shocks that could result from a Mexican accord.
The Administration has different expectations. Instead of shocks, it sees a net gain in the employment rolls, reflecting trade and economic growth spurred by the lowering of tariff walls.
Yet even the Administration's studies acknowledge that Mexican imports could hurt certain sectors, like the fruit and vegetable industries of Florida, Texas and California and the glass and cement industries elsewhere.
Perceptions of this vulnerability and the anxiety on Capitol Hill were behind the policy change announced on Wednesday, Administration officials said.
"Obviously, we're hoping to work out an acceptable compromise with the Hill," one senior trade official said.
 
Prefer Current System
 While Administration officials state their willingness to bargain on trade adjustment, they stress their preference for the system already in place under the 1988 Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act, which provides retraining services and needs-related payments to all laid-off workers, not just those forced out by imports.
In its first three years, the act served some 700,000 workers in such industries as autos, timber, electronics, copper, food processing, aerospace, military and steel.
But many Democratic members of Congress prefer the trade adjustment assistance concept originated by John F. Kennedy in 1962 and amended in 1974 in connection with another bid for trade expansion.
The main differences are that the Kennedy approach relates specifically to job losses from imports and provides much larger entitlements. Workers certified as displaced by trade compeition get up to an additional 26 weeks of unemployment insurance.
Critics say this is unfair, providing greater benefits to a worker who loses a job because of international competition than to one displaced by domestic competition. And with the globalization of the United States economy, it is often difficult to make the distinction between the domestic and international competitive forces that may be the cause.
Yet another significant difference between the two programs is that services under the Kennedy approach are distributed at the Federal level, while economic dislocation services are delivered by the states and local bodies. Critics say the latter approach creates disparities in the distribution of benefits.
Over the last three years, the Administration has unsuccessfully tried to terminate the trade adjustment assistance program.
 
Higher Appropriations
 But the Democratic-controlled Congress refuses to let it die. This year's appropriations for the trade adjustment program are $191 million, compared with $100 million in 1990. Appropriations for the economic dislocation program are $527 million, compared with $514 million in 1990.
According to Labor Department statistics, the economic dislocation program costs $1,200 a worker, and its training programs succeed in placing 70 percent of those enrolled; trade adjustment costs $7,000 a worker and has a 35 percent placement rate.
"Given the choice of the two, we opt for the one with the higher success rate," the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said last week.
 
New Aid From Congress
 Recent legislation suggests that Congress has taken an increased interest in stepping into situations in which workers are affected by Federal programs, a development that could strongly influence the trade adjustment debate, said Howard F. Rosen, a senior official in the Carter Administration's Labor Department who is now a research associate at the Institute for International Economics.
Under the Clean Air Act and the Defense Department Reauthorization Bill, both enacted last year, Congress insisted on compensating workers hurt by its own legislation.
Under the Clean Air legislation, Congress allocated an additional $50 million a year for the next five years to assist coal miners who might lose their jobs as a result of that law's proscriptions against acid rain. The Defense Department legislation similarly provides compensation for those who lose their jobs because of the closing of military bases.

Wilder Cancels at Bridgeport Day Before He Was to Speak

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
The University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, besieged by a yearlong faculty strike and financial problems, held its graduation exercises yesterday -- but its featured speaker and honorary degree recipient stayed home in Virginia.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who was supposed to deliver the main address at the private university's commencement, told university officials Saturday afternoon that he would stay away because the bitterly contested faculty strike had not been resolved. 
 Governor Wilder was replaced as the keynote speaker by another honorary degree recipient, Lee Salomon, a senior vice president of the William Morris talent agency, and the ceremonies were held without disturbance, a university police spokesman said. Walter Wager, a university spokesman, said that while Mr. Wilder's name was never mentioned during the graduation exercises, there were several oblique references to his decision.
"The general feeling was that he had every right to decline to come, but that it would have been appropriate to do so 120 days ago, 90 days ago. Not the day before," Mr. Wager said.
 
'Inappropriate to Attend'
 Janet D. Greenwood, the university's president, issued a statement yesterday that the cancellation was "extremely disappointing and disturbing to all of us, especially the students, to whom commencement is the climax of their higher education."
Laura Dillard, Mr. Wilder's press secretary, said yesterday that "given the circumstances, the Governor felt it would be inappropriate to attend." She said he had waited until Saturday before deciding because "he was hoping that there would be movement that would enable him to attend."
In February, Ms. Greenwood invited Mr. Wilder to the ceremonies, which marked the 30th anniversary of the school's granting an honorary degree to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Ms. Greenwood had become a friend of Mr. Wilder's when she was president of Longwood College in Virginia.
Ms. Dillard said Governor Wilder's staff had previously indicated to university officials that the faculty strike might prevent his appearing. But university officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Mr. Wilder's decision came as a surprise, particularly because a member of his security team had arrived in Bridgeport on Friday. Mr. Wilder was scheduled to arrive Saturday in time for a fund-raising dinner.
A spokesman for striking faculty members at the university and a spokeswoman for the major national association of university faculty members, which has vigorously supported the dissident teachers, said their groups had urged Mr. Wilder not to attend.
The Governor has been prominently mentioned as a contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Crossing a faculty picket line, particularly in a dispute as fractious as that at Bridgeport, could have harmed his standing with education associations and organized labor.
Richard Tino, a striking professor of communications, said yesterday that the strike by the local chapter of the American Association of University Professors began on Sept. 1, when 120 faculty members walked off their jobs in a contract dispute.
The striking faculty members objected to the university's insistence that nearly a third of the 158 faculty positions at the institution be eliminated, that the salaries of those remaining be cut by up to 30 percent and that the teachers give up academic privileges long accepted as standard, like choosing what books to use and what courses to teach.
Mr. Tino said some professors have returned to work. But 70 faculty members, most of them tenured, remain on strike.
 
Syracuse University
John Naisbitt, author of "Megatrends," the best-selling book that made global finance sexy, told the 4,680 graduates of Syracuse University yesterday that the United States will be the major player in the coming "single-market world" and therefore their opportunities will be great.
Mr. Naisbitt and his wife, Patricia Aburdene, the authors of "Re-inventing the Corporation," and "Megatrends 2000," received honorary doctoral degrees in humane letters during the school's 137th commencement.
"As we globalize we are moving toward a single-market world," Mr. Naisbitt said. "That's the larger, emerging trend, a world where there is free trade amongst all nations. Single-market Europe 1992 is but a step to single-market world and as we continue our trend during the 90's to a single-market world the U.S. will continue to be by far the largest free-market economy in the world."
Ms. Aburdene was the keynote speaker at the School of Information Studies' commencement on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Plans For Economy Drawing Fire

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA

 BODY:
Without fanfare, the central bank here has quietly placed into circulation Brazil's latest and highest-denomination bank note, the 10,000 cruzeiro bill.
Engraved with Amazon snakes, the new note is worth $34. A year ago, when Fernando Collor de Mello became President and promised to end inflation, 10,000 cruzeiros amounted to $134. 
 For many Brazilian and foreign business people, the new note symbolizes a widespread loss of faith in the team that dictates economic policies here. It is a loss of credibility that is bound to hang over Mr. Collor when he makes his first state visit to the United States in June.
Brazil's economic press has taken to referring to this capital artificially planted in Brazil's central savannah as "Fantasy Island."
 
Virtually Ignored in Cities
 A price freeze, decreed in January, is virtually ignored in Brazil's coastal cities, where 80 percent of the population lives. In the first four months of this year, prices jumped by 75 percent. "The price freeze has already become a joke outside of Brasilia, which continues to insist on treating it with a seriousness that is touching," the O Globo newspaper in Rio de Janeiro wrote, after listing local price rises in items from blue jeans to freezers.
The centerpiece of last year's anti-inflation program -- the freezing for 18 months of most checking and saving accounts -- has generated revolt among Brazil's increasingly skeptical middle class. Many people doubt the Government will repay the money with full interest.
Using such blunt terms as theft and larceny, judges up and down Brazil's coast -- from Sao Paulo to Recife -- have ordered the unfreezing of bank accounts. In lines snaking around courthouses, as many as 150,000 people filed petitions in March and April to get their money back.
Fearing a sudden avalanche of $20 billion into the hands of people who no longer trust banks, economic officials are fighting to persuade the Supreme Court to declare the actions of the lower courts invalid.
[In another assertion of judicial independence, a judge here on Thursday ordered the arrest of Ibrahim Eris, president of Brazil's central bank. Mr. Eris hid for six hours in the bank's headquarters, until the bank's lawyers won a stay.]
 
Jump in Unemployment
 Further weakening support for Mr. Collor, the number of unemployed in Sao Paulo continues to grow, topping the one million mark in April. The current unemployment rate in Brazil's largest city is 12 percent, double the rate of recent years.
"The Government took away all the savings, put a lot of people into the street, and for what?" asked Costa Ferreira, a Congressman from a political party that backs the Government. "The gross national product fell and inflation continued."
Indeed, economists fear that Brazil is approaching another price explosion. "The public deficit is not under control; prices will probably explode by August," predicted Cesar Maia, an opposition Congressman who last February offered a rare voice of support for the price freeze.
In an unusual flash of frankness from Government economic officials, Mr. Eris, the president of the central bank, recently said: "There are still doubts over the true intentions of the Collor Government's economic policy -- if it is free market or interventionist." Many people here read his comments as a prelude to resignation.
Last year, Brazilian companies invested more money overseas than foreign companies invested here. Brazil, traditionally among the top five beneficiaries of Japanese investment, slipped to 23d place.
According to a recent study by a British bank, Brazil was the only one of Latin America's five largest debtors to suffer from net capital flight last year. While $1 billion left Brazil in 1990, capital repatriation topped capital flight in Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela.
"The bottom line is that the Government does not have any credibility," said Riordan Roett, an American bank consultant who organized a meeting in Sao Paulo this month of the World Economic Forum. In one yardstick of Brazil's stock overseas, the forum last year drew 280 business executives. This year, attendance was 135, virtually all of them from Brazil.
"There is no confidence in the team," Mr. Roett said. "There is no dialogue. There are no consultations. They treat businessmen like children."
Indeed, the mixture of petulance and arrogance that Brazilian business executives often attribute to the nation's Economy Minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, could be seen during an interview here.
Asked to list her team's first-year successes, Ms. Cardoso groaned. "I've answered that so many times that just to think of answering yet one more time really bores me," she responded with irritation. "I don't know how actors manage every night to repeat the same line."
Some of Brazil's poor international image stems from the Government's glacial progress in renegotiating payment terms for its $60 billion foreign debt with private banks. After six months of talks, Brazil and the bankers in April reached an agreement in principle on the repayment of $8 billion in unpaid interest.
Brazil not only has the world's largest arrears with private banks, it has the fastest-growing arrears, according to the Institute of International Finance. Figures compiled by this Washington-based bank group show Brazil's arrears almost tripled in two years, to $9.5 billion in March from $3.4 billion in 1989.
After a year of diplomacy, tension between Brazil and its creditors flared into the open in April. In Nagoya, Japan, at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, Japanese officials avoided scheduling meetings with the Brazilians. At a dinner, Ms. Cardoso exchanged sharp words with David C. Mulford, the United States Under Secretary of the Treasury.
In her speech to the delegates, Ms. Cardoso branded as "illegitimate and unacceptable" a move by the United States, Europe and Japan to suspend approval of a $350 million loan for Brazil until progress was made on the interest arrears. With the loan suspended, the Brazilians quickly reached an agreement and the loan was approved.

HEADLINE: Texas Dome: Haven or Hazard? - A Special Report;
Site for Toxic-Waste Cave Stirs Texas Political Fight

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAYTON, Tex.

 BODY:
Here on the verdant coastal lowlands of Texas, a little-known company is pursuing one of the most risky, politically sensitive and potentially lucrative goals in American business today -- a permit from Federal and state authorities to build a huge hazardous-waste disposal site.
Beneath the rice fields, 30 miles from Houston, Hunter Environmental Services Inc. wants to bury toxic waste in mammoth caverns carved into a salt dome more than 60 million years old; the subterranean salt formation is so large that were it above ground it would dwarf Mount Everest; the length of each proposed waste-storage cavern would be taller than the Empire State Building. Regulatory clearance for a large project like Hunter's is the holy grail of the $25-billion-a-year waste services industry. Only a couple of such permits have been granted in the last few years, none for salt-dome sites. 
 Hunter's story is partly that of an extraordinary corporate gamble, of a company that two years ago had a consulting business with 2,000 employees and annual revenues of more than $100 million yet sold everything to pursue the salt-dome project.
 
Enormous Potential Reward
 The reward for Hunter could be enormous. Analysts place the value of the permit the company is seeking at perhaps $500 million, given the size of the proposed project and its potential profitability. By contrast, the total value of Hunter's shares today is roughly $50 million. "If you make it, the payoff on this project is very, very large indeed," said J. Anthony Forstmann, a professional investor and a Hunter backer.
The Hunter case also deals with an issue crucial to the national debate over disposing of hazardous waste in a way that does not damage the environment or pose health risks to people living near disposal sites. And finally it is a story of the rough and tumble of local politics as seen in a costly campaign to try to influence state politicians and government officials. The company has spent nearly $5 million in two years on lawyers and lobbyists alone, and the costs are mounting.
Nowhere is the toxic-waste issue more sharply drawn than in Texas. Because of its big oil and chemical industries, the state is by far the biggest producer of toxic waste, generating more than 20 percent of the annual nationwide total of 270 million tons. Most states have become more reluctant to allow new toxic waste sites in recent years, and several have tried to curb imports of out-of-state waste. Such attitudes are scarcely surprising given the toxic-waste industry's history of problems, both unforeseen and ignored. Indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency is concerned that the "not in my backyard" policies adopted by states raise the prospect of sharp conflicts between states.
"Siting new disposal facilities is one of the most difficult challenges politically," said William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator. "But for the sake of the environment, we must face up to siting decisions. Each state must be proportionately responsible for assuring safe, high-quality disposal capacity."
 
The Politics
 
A Sudden Change In the Climate
The political climate in Texas, a state with a reputation for giving business a free hand, shifted abruptly in November when Ann Richards, a Democrat, was elected Governor, promising a 'new Texas" with tougher environmental standards.
Until then, Hunter seemed well on its way toward getting its permit. It had begun the process more than two years earlier, preparing roomfuls of technical documents, meeting with citizens' groups in high school gymnasiums, and lobbying politicians and officials. Now, the Governor's office is occupied by a person who twice during her campaign stumped in Dayton, attacking the Hunter plan.
She has harshly criticized the Texas Water Commission, which would grant the state permits, saying the commission is too lenient, and she has pledged that things will change under her stewardship. "No more will hazardous-waste facilities be rammed through the permit process over the objections of local communities," she declared.
Hunter's permit application is set to go before the commission this summer in hearings that amount to a public trial. Testimony and deliberations will probably take months. The Hunter proposal has also been caught up in a legislative fight in Austin, the state capital.
The Governor is pushing legislation that would result in a moratorium on toxic-waste permits for a year or so until strict rules are developed. The company's lobbyists have pressed hard to change phrasing in the bill so that Hunter's permit hearing could go ahead unless the E.P.A. or the Water Commission decides that new rules tailored for salt domes are required. Hunter succeeded in getting the wording of the bill changed in the State Senate, and the House will make its decision soon.
Hunter has hired a small army of well-connected lobbyists, lawyers and image polishers. They include Robert S. Strauss, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and his Austin law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; Lee Biggart, the former chairman of the Water Commission, and Hill & Knowlton Inc., one of the nation's largest public relations firms.
The lobbyists and lawyers declined to discuss specific tasks they have performed in return for their $5 million in fees, for fear of "giving away our strategy," explained Paul Seals, an Akin, Gump partner and former regional counsel for the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas. Some of the money was for legal fees for the permit application. Mr. Biggart said the lobbying efforts were mainly individual meetings with state legislators and government officials; he said these sessions were usually carefully orchestrated and time consuming.
"A lot of politicians wish the hazardous-waste problem would simply go away," Mr. Biggart said. "But when we present Hunter's case to people one by one, they come away convinced that this is a solution to the problem."
The company's executives say they have not made any financial contributions to politicians. "This is a permit business for us now," said Oliver A. Kimberly Jr., Hunter's chairman. "And the risk we face is 100 percent political."
The project's opponents say they are not unimpressed by the scope and the expense of Hunter's campaign of persuasion. "They haven't missed a political move," said James Blackburn of Blackburn & Carter, a Houston environmental law firm opposing the project. "And they have deep pockets."
 
The Advocates
 
Single-Minded Missionaries
Keith Price, an environmental consultant, was attending a municipal utility trade show in San Antonio in the summer of 1983 when he wandered by the stand of a company that specialized in fashioning caverns in underground salt domes for the storage of oil and gas, like the Government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve along the Gulf Coast. He chatted, picked up some leaflets and began pondering the notion of burying hazardous wastes in domes. His curiosity grew into a belief and then a mission. "It's become a kind of religious commitment for me," he said.
But one that has been severely tested. In the mid-1980's, he sought approval for a salt-dome venture near Palestine, Tex., north of Dayton. It ran into local resistance and was abandoned when, after a bit of legislative sleight of hand, the proposed site was declared a groundwater conservation district in 1987. The lesson, he said: "Get more involved with the community. And tell your story to everyone who will listen because it's a darn good story."
It was a story that certainly impressed Mr. Kimberly in 1988, when Hunter bought Environmental Science and Engineering Inc., where Mr. Price was working. "Everyone who has touched this project has become a missionary," said Mr. Kimberly, who is 57 years old and an investment banker by training.
Yet by the summer of 1989, the high costs of pursuing a hazardous-waste permit were apparent. To help accomplish the task, the company moved to sell its consulting operations. Hunter was an environmental consulting firm with 2,000 workers and more than $100 million in revenues; in 1990, it made Inc. magazine's yearly list of the fastest-growing small public companies in America. Now, it is down to a staff of 15 people. And in the nine months ended in December, it reported revenues of just $1.7 million. Today, the principal asset of the company, based in Southport, Conn., is a $19 million holding of shares of Cilcorp that it took in payment for its consultancy business. Its current revenues derive mainly from the dividends on those shares.
 
The Theory
 
Idea Bolstered By Nuclear Tests
Using salt domes for storage has proved to be generally successful for oil and gas, with more than 1,500 storage caverns in the United States. Leakage has not been a problem, with the handful of accidents coming from blowouts of corroded pipes.
As part of their argument for the domes' impermeability, enthusiasts point to the nuclear bomb tests conducted in the Tatum salt dome in Mississippi in the mid-1960's.
The Government was suspicious that the Soviets were cheating on the test-ban treaty by detonating atomic bombs deep in Siberian salt caverns, beyond detection.
To see if such blasts could go undetected, the Atomic Energy Commission set off a five-kiloton nuclear device in the Tatum dome in 1964. The bomb was small beside today's 1,000 kiloton bombs but still mighty enough to do what one might expect to be a fair amount of damage to the salt walls of a hole in the ground; the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was 15 kilotons.
The explosion showed up on seismic monitors and created a cavity 100 feet in diameter. But the salt formation, the testers said, did not leak radiation. Later, the Government set off a second bomb in the Tatum dome. Since 1972, the Federal Government and Mississippi authorities have conducted yearly tests of the drinking water in the area and found no indication of radioactive leakage from the dome, the Energy Department says. The Soviets, it was later determined, were not testing in salt domes.
Many experts say the domes should be equally resistant to leakage of hazardous wastes. And the Tatum dome example is what convinced several Hunter executives and investors of the advantages of salt dome storage. "That's what really sold me," Mr. Kimberly said.
So far, however, salt domes have not been used for holding toxic industrial waste, which in the United States includes arsenic, lead, mercury, benzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, vinyl chloride and dozens of others.
Some geologists and toxic-waste experts caution that a safe atomic test in one salt dome does not necessarily prove that another dome would be ideal for storing hazardous waste. Salt domes -- the dried remains of a sea that existed in the Mesozoic Era and covered much of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi -- vary in purity, with some having pockets of gypsum, water or gas. "Not all salt domes are created equal," said H. C. Clark, an emeritus professor of geology at Rice University, who is advising the City of Houston.
These experts warn that a salt dome could be susceptible to leaching or leakage over time, especially if the hazardous chemicals react with one another. Under the Hunter plan, the waste would be mixed with ash, solidified, crushed into pea-sized gravel and dropped into the caverns. But the toxic materials would not be treated chemically to neutralize them, an expensive process. "Hunter says that containment alone is enough," said Richard Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, a trade association. "But experience has shown us that containment alone is not enough."
 
The Deals
 
Promises to Allay Community Fears
A graying 48-year-old Louisiana native, Mr. Price is president of the company's Texas subsidiary, Hunter Industrial Facilities Inc., the corporate name on the permit application. He directs the company's campaign from a two-story home converted into an office in Dayton. Adversaries acknowledge that he is a skilled advocate, equally at home discussing the technical features of the project or trading bass-fishing stories with the locals.
In two years, he has appeared before dozens of community meetings with local people and has had his home picketed by protesters. To allay fears and win converts, Hunter has pledged to guarantee the value of home prices within three miles of the site, to avoid trucking hazardous wastes during hours that school buses make their rounds, and to donate $100,000 a year in college scholarships for local high school graduates once the operation is up and running. Hunter's consultants say the big waste project and accompanying industrial park could eventually create 12,000 jobs in a rural area of high unemployment.
The company has won some local support. C. Scott Parker, the Mayor of Liberty, the county seat, which is six miles from Dayton, has fought for seven years against a proposal to put a hazardous-waste landfill nearby. But after studying the Hunter plan, he said he had found no real flaws, calling it "probably the best solution we have to storing hazardous waste."
 
The Opponents
 
A Local Group With Dedication
Hunter's opponents appear every bit as committed and dedicated as the company. Since Governor Richards's election, they also have gained a good deal of political power. The Houston City Council and several community groups oppose the project.
In addition, a telephone survey of 439 people in the adjacent region found 73 percent opposed to the Hunter project even if it would help the local economy, said C. Bruce Stratton, chairman of a local citizens review committee, which does not plan to take a position on the Hunter proposal.
The opponents say the salt dome plan involves too many uncertainties: the safety of transporting hazardous waste, drainage from the site during heavy rainfall and the possible danger of slow leaching from unforeseen chemical reactions. They point out that the site is less than 10 miles from Lake Houston. "We're left with an experimental facility that would be awfully close to the water supply of a major city," said Professor Clark of Rice University.
Much opposition comes from a group called Friends Insist Stop Toxic Waste, or FIST, founded in 1989 by Chris Sagstetter, a 38-year-old homemaker from Huffman, a small town near Lake Houston. She has opposed the plan with a single-minded passion. The battle has consumed her time, eaten into her household finances and, she acknowledges, clearly contributed to the recent breakup of her marriage.
"This is a war of attrition," said Ms. Sagstetter, who last month began work as an environmental specialist for Houston's health department.
 
The Next Move
 
A Difficult Vote For the State
The Environmental Protection Agency sets national waste-disposal standards, but most states, Texas included, are delegated the authority for approving or rejecting hazardous-waste projects.
And the Texas decision rests with the Texas Water Commission, unless the Legislature passes the special moratorium. Each of the commission's three members is a political appointee of former Gov. William Clements Jr., a pro-business Republican who was once an oil industry executive. They will not say how they are going to vote, but the odds seem to favor a pro-Hunter decision.
Yet, the chairman, B. J. Wynne 3d, a 35-year-old former counsel to Governor Clements, acknowledges the double pressures of having to deal with the state's hazardous-waste problems and the political opposition to the granting of permits: "I'm sitting at the leading edge of this problem, and we're overwhelmed by it. You can't make these decisions based on public opinion, but I ain't a potted plant."
And the commissioners' ruling may be challenged. "If they are going to approve a salt dome, we'll take them to court," said Jacqueline Warren, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization.
Hunter is confident that it will win the salt dome permit and, if then challenged in court, that the E.P.A. would stand by the state ruling and that the challenge would be beaten.
For Hunter, each new delay means that it keeps spending money at a rapid rate with little to show for it, except increasingly edgy investors. "It's been torture," said Arthur Samberg, president of Dawson Samberg Capital Management, which holds a stake.
Mr. Kimberly said: "What keeps me going is my belief in the project, that this will be good not just for the shareholders but also for Texas and the nation. And sure, it's fun to make money."

HEADLINE: There's No Place Like Chittenango

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHITTENANGO, N.Y., May 4

 BODY:
When corporate sponsors suddenly pulled out of a plan to bring Munchkins back to the Land of Oz, people here were distraught. Unless help came from somewhere over the rainbow, they joked morosely to one another, the plan was dead.
But Chittenango, the birthplace of L. Frank Baum, the creator of Oz, decided to press ahead on its own. With bake sales and door-to-door pleas, it scraped together enough money to fly three Munchkins from the cast of "The Wizard of Oz" to the Oz Festival on Saturday. Now the village is hoping to bring even more. 
 All of those who played the main characters in the 52-year-old M.G.M. classic are dead. But about two dozen of the 124 Munchkins are alive, and many would be honored to come to Chittenango, said 75-year-old Meinhardt Raabe, who officially pronounced the Wicked Witch of the East dead ("As coroner, I must aver, I've thoroughly examined her."), and is the unofficial Munchkin patriarch.
"It's a thrill, really," Mr. Raabe, who lives in a retirement community in Florida, said in a telephone interview. "I'll come in costume. I'll march in the parade. I'll speak to the Rotary Club and various other organizations. I guess if you want to get down to brass tacks, you could say it's an ego trip."
 
Auntie Em's and Oz Ice Cream
 To people in Chittenango, the Munchkins would add living history to their celebration.
"They were there; they were in the movie," said Tom Cooney, a festival organizer. "Someday they'll go, and then that's it. All you'll have is celluloid."
The 13-year-old annual festival fulfills a passion in this community of 4,700, which lies 15 miles east of Syracuse but seems to fancy itself as part of a different world altogether.
There is an Auntie Em's Pantry here, which serves Oz Cream Cones; a Tinman Hardware Store; an End of the Rainbow Gift Shop, and an Emerald City Lanes Bowling. There is even a yellow brick road in the center of town, though it is closer in size to a sidewalk and the color of the bricks has faded over the years to shopping-bag brown, a point of some local controversy.
 
Not Even in the Credits
 Chittenango has raised enough money to pay the air fare of two of the Munchkins -- Jerry Maren, who handed the welcoming lollipop to Dorothy, and Margaret Pellegrini, a sleepy-head Munchkin. And two newspapers in Syracuse have kicked in for Mr. Raabe and his wife.
There are Munchkins in other parts of the country who would like to come, though some of them would probably demand fees, Mr. Raabe said.
This is a legacy of the unfair treatment that many Munchkins believe they received in making the movie, for which they received nominal pay, no royalties and not even credits by name at the end of the movie: It just says, ". . .and the Munchkins."
"Fifty years ago, there was terrible prejudice against little people, and we just accepted it," Mr. Raabe said. "A lot of the Munchkins have wised up since then."
But Mr. Raabe, who spent 30 years after the movie as a public relations executive for Oscar Mayer and Company, is not looking for anything from Chittenango other than his travel expenses.
"Looking back, I'd say being in 'The Wizard of Oz' was one of the proudest accomplishments of my life."
Many other Munchkins seemed to agree. "How many movies are there that a great-grandmother like me can sit down with a great-grandchild and enjoy today?" said Mrs. Pellegrini, who lives in Glendale, Ariz.
The uproar in the town arose two weeks ago when a group of Syracuse-area businesses, which had pledged to pay for the air fares and hotel rooms of at least four Munchkins, said they had to back out because of the recession.
 
3-Year-Old Knows All the Words
 Festival organizers at first feared they were sunk, but then vowed to push ahead, and now are thinking of trying to bring in other Munchkins and perhaps two of Mr. Baum's relatives: a 75-year-old granddaughter and an 82-year-old niece.
In Chittenango, where last year's festival drew 12,000 people, the influence of the movie seems almost pervasive.
"My 2-year-old watched it twice the other morning," said Barbara Evans, an organizer of the festival.
Kathy Daviau, the festival's co-chairwoman, said, "My 3-year-old can lip-sync the whole movie."
Proceeds from this year's Oz Festival are being set aside for a Museum of Oz, which residents hope to build to honor Mr. Baum and his 14 Oz books. The first, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," published in 1900, was the basis of the movie by the slightly shorter name.
Organizers have added an educational note to the festival, whose theme will be "We're Off to Read the Wizard and the Wonderful Books of Oz."
"We're telling our kids that reading books can help you develop the important qualities in life," Mr. Cooney said, "like brains, courage and a heart."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Seeks Ways to Save Some Services

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Having proposed budget cuts that would darken New York City's streets and dry up its swimming pools, Mayor David N. Dinkins will embark this week on negotiations with municipal unions and state officials intended to avoid such severe service cuts and to preserve the city's traditional broad-shouldered mission.
"I don't want to lose shelters and playgrounds and pools and beaches, and losing some of those things would be counterproductive anyway," Mr. Dinkins said in an interview yesterday, 24 hours after holding elaborately choreographed meetings with state and city officials and union leaders to outline his plans for coping with New York's enormous fiscal problems. 
The cuts, carefully calculated to seem unpalatable if not unbearable to the public, would eliminate a range of social programs for which the Mayor campaigned -- like drug treatment for women and children -- and essential services -- like road-cleaning and garbage recycling. The plan calls for laying off more than 27,000 full- and part-time workers starting in July.
 
'It's So Painful'
 But at a time when some of his own business advisers have said the scope of municipal government must shrink, and days before he must submit his plan to the City Council for review, Mr. Dinkins likened the deepest cuts to a train he hopes to derail by pressuring the unions and the state for help until the local economy turns around. He made clear that he had no intention of willingly presiding over a scaling back of the city's mandate.
"I think it is good that we take care of those who are vulnerable and I would hope that we continue to," he said, adding that he hoped to find ways to perform services more efficiently or get the state and Federal governments to pay more of the cost. "There's all kinds of flowery language about how a civilization is measured by how they treat their young and their elderly," the Mayor said. "That's why it's so painful as we do these cuts." Mr. Dinkins wants to avoid the worst of the cuts he proposed, and his aides said there were some other possibilities that he refused even to wave as red flags, like proposals to eliminate 6,000 day-care spots or drop-in shelters for the homeless. "There are just some things he doesn't even want to be associated with," one senior aide said.
The Mayor, under intense pressure to show how he would keep the city's $29 billion budget balanced in the face of huge gaps in the current and coming fiscal years, staked out his position in a daylong series of meetings on Saturday with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo; Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, and others.
"Everybody we talked to was helpful from the Governor on down," Mr. Dinkins said, but added, "I understand there's a difference between saying nice and helpful things and deliverance."
Participants in the meetings said city officials did not make specific demands of the unions or hold detailed discussions of the proposed cuts, but gave all the parties the bad news at once in the hope of moving beyond the recriminations and jockeying that have stalled any meaningful negotations for weeks.
"It was basically show," one city official said. "But on the bright side, nothing fell apart. The unions did admit they were willing to help the city."
Mayoral aides said they now expected union leaders to begin specific individual discussions about what concessions in wages, work rules and benefits they can make. City officials say they hope such concessions will save at least $600 million. That would go a long way toward offsetting the more than $1 billion in the latest round of cuts Mr. Dinkins outlined Saturday. Those cuts came on top of $1 billion in cuts and more than $1 billion in taxes he had already proposed to help close a budget gap of nearly $3.5 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1.
"There's going to have to be a lot of back and forth," one senior city official said. "They're going to have strings attached to a lot of their money and there are going to be ways that we're not going to want to spend it, and out of that will come a number. They won't get all their jobs back and we won't get all that we want."
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said yesterday that in the coming days he and other union leaders "will sit down quietly and start to determine what chunks of money might be available -- we've got to look at where the money is."
But even if the unions made concessions like deferring wages or changing health benefits, city officials said, there would undoubtedly still be some layoffs since some of the programs Mr. Dinkins would want to restore do not require more workers but money for supplies and services.
The plan Mr. Dinkins sketched on Saturday did not address how the city would close a budget gap of $465 million in the rest of this fiscal year. City officials have said they believe they can solve that problem but so far have only frozen spending for supplies and suggested possible options.
 
Sole Approval Power
 Mayoral aides said they did not expect any big breakthroughs before Mr. Dinkins is required to submit his proposed budget to the City Council on Friday.
Since the Council has the sole power to approve or modify the Mayor's plan, that means the political dance will grow even more complex, with Mr. Dinkins, the Council, the unions, the Governor and others all maneuvering to reflect their own priorities in the budget that has to be passed by June 30.
Mr. Cuomo, who has repeatedly expressed skepticism at the city's fiscal management and reluctance to offer the city help unless unions agreed to concessions, met privately with the Mayor at Gracie Mansion on Saturday and, aides to both officials said, pledged to do what he could to assure that the city received at least $250 million in additional help from the state.
City officials said that could take the form of direct revenue sharing or relief from state mandates on things like class size for special education programs. But with the State Legislature deadlocked for weeks over how to close a $6 billion gap in the state budget, aides said Mr. Cuomo had cautioned that there were no guarantees.
"The Governor was very upbeat about the whole thing," said one aide to Mr. Cuomo.
One of the biggest uncertainties in the budget mix is how much help Mr. Rohatyn and the Municipal Assistance Corporation will offer and when. The watchdog agency was set up to borrow money on the city's behalf when it was shut out of the credit markets in the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, and city officials hope to tap its financing powers for $200 million to $300 million in aid.
But Mr. Rohatyn, a strong critic of Mr. Dinkins's decision to grant substantial wage increases to municipal unions, has said the corporation would "have to be the caboose, not the engine" of any rescue plan and could only help after seeing a comprehensive plan for dealing with the city's problems over the next several years.
On Saturday, Mr. Rohatyn, a close adviser to the Governor, said he would study the plan and give some indication of how the assistance corporation might help within a couple of weeks. He also issued a stern warning that if the state did not pass a budget soon, depriving the city of aid it has been counting on, it could set in motion a series of events that would severely limit the ability of the state, city and the corporation itself to borrow money in the bond markets.
Senior Dinkins administration officials said they took both comments as a positive sign. Without a convincing plan to solve the city's budget problems, city officials have worried that they might not be able to sell $600 million of bonds on time next month, a failing that could trigger a takeover of the city's finances by a state panel, the Financial Control Board, and possiblly leave the city short of cash to pay its bills.
 
Wide Range of Cuts
 Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the control board, said last night that he had not yet seen a copy of Mr. Dinkins's proposal and could not comment on the plan until he did.
Besides proposing to shut off one-quarter of the city's street lamps and close all 32 public swimming pools, Mr. Dinkins warned of a wide range of cuts likely to meet fierce resistance from community and advocacy groups and distaste from his own commissioners.
Among the proposed cuts sure to generate controversy was the suggestion to suspend entirely for one year the city's garbage recycling program. That would send 1,000 more pounds of trash a day into the city's last-remaining and fast-filling landfill, Fresh Kills on Staten Island.
"It is not the type of program you can turn on and off," said Sanitation Commissioner Steve M. Polan. "It would be a tragedy in terms of eliminating the gains we've made in reducing the amount of garbage going into Fresh Kills."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Iraq Christian Minority Begins to Look for Door

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 5

 BODY:
In the northern Iraqi town of Dohuk the other day, three middle-aged women, enveloped from head to toe in long black veils, did something that is very unusual in this part of the world.
They walked straight up to a Western male correspondent, and one of them, pulling back her veil, said in English, "We are Christians, and we want to go to America." 
 "America, America," her two companions chanted. Then all three crossed themselves fervently several times before scuttling back into the crowd, where they were soon indistinguishable from all the other veiled Muslim women, moving like black cones along the street.
With the end of the Persian Gulf war and an announcement that Iraqis will be allowed to travel abroad again next month after a nearly nine-year ban, a wave of restlessness is sweeping through this country's roughly 800,000-member Christian minority, with many saying they want to leave for good.
 
Invitation to Leave
 This restlessness attracted at least semi-official attention last week when a magazine called Babil -- the Arabic for Babylon -- that is owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Udai, published an article suggesting that those disloyal enough to want to leave should do so now. Good riddance to them was the implication.
The article never mentioned Iraq's Christians by name. But Christians have been quick to see themselves as the target of a rebuke.
To judge by external signs, Christians here seem as ostentatiously loyal to the present Government in public as everyone else in this country.
At the Virgin Mary Church, the Rev. Afran Rassam of the Chaldean Catholic Church, an Eastern Rite of Roman Catholicism, keeps a large color picture of President Hussein on his office wall, alongside an even gaudier lithograph depicting the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
On the living room wall of his house at St. Joseph's Church, the Rev. Louis Shabi, another Chaldean priest, has hung a painted plate carrying a picture of the President in Arab headdress, staring out at the ivory crucifix on the wall opposite.
 
Many Have No Complaints
 Many Christians say they have no complaints about the way the Government has treated them, although they add that they have suffered persecution under earlier regimes.
Iraq's ruling Baath Party has always been a secular political movement, interested in material goals and with no time for Islamic fundamentalism.
"This Government has been good to us," Father Shabi says. "We do not complain."
But he acknowledged that there are "ignorant people" who sometimes accuse the Christians of being Europeans, not Iraqis, although the Chaldeans claim descent from the disciples of the Apostle Thomas, who came here from Jerusalem in the first century, long before the rise of Islam.
In fact, it is the gulf war more than anything else that has unsettled Christians here. During the conflict, many say, they were identified with the American-led coalition forces attacking the country and were discriminated against.
A Christian translator recounts how his wife was thrown out of the local shop when she went to collect the family's monthly ration of low-priced food. "They told her, 'If you want food, go and ask Bush for it,' " he said.
Many other Christians tell of being called Crusaders or "members of the coalition" because of their religion.
While Iraq's 600,000 Chaldean Catholics are by far the largest Christian group in this predominantly Muslim country of more than 18 million people, there are also smaller numbers of Syrian and Armenian Catholics as well as members of the Orthodox Greek and Armenian faiths and some Protestants.
For many Christians, the urge to leave stems not only from a sense of oppression resulting from the gulf war but also from a complex mixture of economic and social factors.
Prospects in general do not seem bright in a country that will probably be shackled with reparation repayments to Kuwait for years. And some Christians fear discrimination against minorities if conditions worsen.
 
Hurt by Economic Slowdown
 Some Christians say the postwar economic slowdown is already hitting them hard. Often better educated than Muslims and fluent in English or French, many had taken jobs with foreign concerns that have now departed or at embassies that are closed.
Past waves of immigration also mean that Iraqi Christians often have relatives in countries like the United States, Australia and Canada who can help them start a new life abroad. Sometimes foreign branches of their churches help them to emigrate.
"The young see this as their chance to go," said an Armenian Christian woman who was visiting the Virgin Mary Church today and whose son lives in San Francisco.
However much they support the Government in public, Iraqi Christians sometimes give the impression that they regard themselves as a beleaguered group by the very piety with which they practice their religion.
At evening High Mass at the Virgin Mary Church last Sunday, there was barely standing room inside.
 
Rituals Carefully Observed
 A packed congregation sang hymns in Chaldean and Arabic to Arab rhythms thumped out on an electric organ with the gusto of Bible Belt gospelers.
The finest points of ritual were meticulously observed, with everyone genuflecting and crossing themselves on entering and leaving.
During the service a steady stream of congregants briefly left their places to kiss the feet of a statue of St. Francis. The entire congregation appeared to take communion.
Asked to explain such fervor later, Father Shabi smiled gently and recited an ancient Chaldean proverb that says those who have been bitten by a snake always fear the sight of its skin.
"It means we remember that we have known difficult times," he said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S. GENERALS SEEK BIGGER IRAQ HAVEN

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SILOPI, Turkey, May 5

 BODY:
Senior American military commanders here said today that they wanted to extend the allied safe-haven area in northern Iraq to include the city of Dohuk in an effort to draw hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees down from their perilous mountain camps.
The commanders said Kurdish leaders had told them that if the area was not extended to Dohuk, a major center about 50 miles south of the Turkish border, several hundred thousand refugees, or half the total in the border area, might stay in the camps. The refugees were said to prefer risking death from summer heat and disease rather than return to homes and villages still under the control of President Saddam Hussein's army. 
 "If we go into Dohuk and secure Dohuk, the bulk of the refugees in the mountain can go right home," said Dayton Maxwell, the State Department's disaster assistance coordinator here. "You don't need camps. We could take care of the bulk of the refugees just by securing Dohuk."
"If we don't go into Dohuk," he said, "then we have to plan on winterized shelters for over 300,000 refugees."
The American commanders have made what one described as strong recommendations that Dohuk be taken, but thus far there has been no permission from Washington to move south.
"It is a highly sensitive political decision being made in the United States," a senior American official here said. "I can categorically say no decision has been taken."
While more than 40,000 Kurds have come down from the nearby mountains in the last week to their old homes across the Iraqi border in the area of Zakho, about 300,000 more are taking shelter in the remote eastern mountains. Zakho is safely under the control of American, British, French and Dutch troops.
Many other Kurdish refugees are from villages razed by Mr. Hussein's forces and from other areas to the east and south, outside allied control.
Kurdish tribal leaders in the Cukurca and Uzumlu camps, where most of the refugees are from the Dohuk area, have insisted in meetings in recent days with Brig. Gen. Richard Potter, the United States Special Forces commander whose men are in the Turkish mountain camps, that they will not come down until the area is under the protection of allied troops.
There are indications that the Iraqis are pulling back from Dohuk and also suggestions of widespread looting by Iraqi soldiers. Journalists driving down the highway have seen abandoned posts and individual soldiers waving sheepish salutes, but have been stopped by roadblocks outside the city.
"They seem to have reduced their presence there something on the order of 20 percent in the last 12 hours," said Col. James Jones, commander of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, adding that an Iraqi infantry battalion and eight tanks from forward positions had been withdrawn.
About 400 American marines, with armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles, moved down to the southern slope of the plains today, positioning themselves closer to Dohuk. American paratroopers to the east also moved closer to the town. American planes and helicopters have been conducting reconnaissance flights over the area.
 
Broadening Questions
 The Dohuk issue illustrates how the Administration's decision to aid the Kurdish refugees by a swift military deployment -- spurred by televised coverage of their suffering -- has quickly broadened into other questions. These include how long American troops will stay, how the Kurds are to be protected from Baghdad's wrath in the future, and whether protection will create the nucleus of an independent nation long sought by the Kurds.
But American commanders are more immediately concerned with the coming hot weather, believing that snow-fed streams in the mountains will dry up within a month and that disease could spread. There have been reports of cholera in the Cukurca camp.
"Dohuk is key," Colonel Jones said, pointing out that the city contains a large reservoir, controls the major highways in the region and is surrounded by rich farmland and valleys. It also contains a hydro-electric generating plant in an area largely without electricity.
"Dohuk is not only militarily significant," he said. "It is also economically significant and the administrative center of the northern area. If you poll people on the mountain, three-quarters will say Dohuk. Dohuk is on the tip of their tongues."
 
Many Bypassing Zakho
 Experience with the emergency relief effort, which is still being improvised, indicates that the Kurds are largely bypassing the refugee transit camp being built at Zakho. There are now about 6,000 people living there, military officials said today.
The initial plan to build a second refugee camp near Amadiya in the newly opened eastern sector of the security zone is being reconsidered. One possibility is building a series of way stations to help refugees make their way back home.
"Look at the statistics," said Maj. Jim La Fleur, the civil affairs staff officer for Task Force Bravo, the military operation on the Iraqi side of the border. "If we open up Dohuk, it's going to take the place of building a hell of a lot of camps."
But an expansion south, while driven by realities on the ground, could raise other problems, some officials said.
"It could enmesh us deeper," an American official said, "and create further aggravation with the Iraqi regime."
Mentioning Kurdish areas farther to the east and south, a Western diplomat asked, "Once you are in Dohuk, does that force you to go to Mosul, and once in Mosul, then to Erbil?"
 
How, and How Long, to Protect
 Further, setting up such a zone could raise the question of how, and how long, it could be protected.
"If you were Saddam, wouldn't you just wait?" a diplomat asked. "Whatever presence there is has to be limited in time."
The idea of an expanded zone protected by Western troops is also appealing to the Kurdish Pesh Merga guerrillas, emerging in numbers from their hideouts in the hills.
"I think the creation of Kurdistan is now closer than ever before," said a guerrilla commander known as General Ali, who controls the zone around Zakho.
Surrounded by his men, armed with AK-47 rifles and grenade launchers, in a new base in a schoolhouse in the Iraqi mountain village of Begova, a dirt-poor place of stony roads and corrugated-tin shacks, the guerrilla leader said:
"We want the zone to make up all of Kurdistan in Iraq only. We want the United States Army to take over all of Kurdistan in Iraq. When the Iraqi army leaves Dohuk, we will go to Dohuk. All of the refugees from Dohuk city who are in the mountains will return back to their homes when the Iraqis are gone."
Fear of the Iraqi troops is widespread among the Kurdish refugees; the security cordon of Western troops that encouraged refugees from the Zakho area to return does not exist in Dohuk. About 15,000 mainly middle-class refugees from the Zakho area, in what the Turks have set up as a camp for Muslim pilgrims just over the Turkish border, are refusing to go back, saying Iraqi secret and plainclothes police are still in evidence.
Still, American officials are worried about the increase in the last two days of refugees coming into the Zakho camp.
"They can see that conditions in the mountains are not good," said Mr. Maxwell of the State Department. "We're a little afraid the floodgates are starting to open, and we're not quite ready."
"This is the most complicated refugee problem in the world," Mr. Maxwell added, worrying about the relief effort dragging on, perhaps as long as the winter. "We're talking megabucks. Megabucks and megaproblems."

Kurds to Resume Baghdad Talks
 NICOSIA, Cyprus, May 5 (Reuters) -- Iraqi Kurdish leaders will return to Baghdad on Monday for a second round of autonomy talks with President Hussein's Government, a spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdistan Front said today.
In a telephone call to Reuters in Nicosia, the spokesman said the delegation would carry to Baghdad a set of ideas for a political settlement of the Kurdish issue "within the framework of a united, democratic Iraq."
The front is an umbrella group of the main parties seeking self-rule for their region in northern Iraq. Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party, will lead the delegation, the spokesman said. The talks had been scheduled for last week but were postponed.

HEADLINE: Guilty Plea in '88 Theft Of a Rodin Sculpture

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 5

 BODY:
An unemployed truck driver has pleaded guilty to an armed robbery in which a 12-inch bronze sculpture was taken from the Rodin Museum here on Nov. 23, 1988.
The truck driver, Stephen Shih, 27 years old, pleaded guilty on Friday to taking the 127-year-old sculpture, "The Mask of the Man with the Broken Nose" by Rodin. During the robbery, three museum guards were handcuffed.
 A plea agreement, in which Mr. Shih also pleaded guilty to the robbery of a supermarket, called for a sentence of 7 1/2 to 15 years in prison. The bust, valued at $75,000, was found undamaged on March 10, 1989, in the basement of an apartment building partly owned by Mr. Shih's mother.

HEADLINE: Tartikoff's TV Valedictory: It's Tougher Now Than Ever

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
NBC was still the No. 1 network last week when the chief architect of its six years of prime-time leadership, Brandon Tartikoff, announced that he was leaving network television to run a movie studio.
Eleven years earlier, when Mr. Tartikoff began running the NBC entertainment division, the network was in a shambles -- a distant, hopeless third in the ratings, the joke of the television industry. 
 The punchline is that NBC's ratings in the 1979-80 television season were 40 percent higher than what the network scored when it won the ratings race this season.
No television executive has ever enjoyed the reputation that Mr. Tartikoff fashioned for himself in pulling NBC out of the ratings cellar in the early 1980's -- and none is likely to have it ever again, several industry executives said after Mr. Tartikoff's appointment as the new chairman of Paramount Pictures.
Although that lofty assessment of Mr. Tartikoff's abilities is widely held in Hollywood, NBC has seen its ratings plunge in the last two seasons even as Mr. Tartikoff was continuing to choose the programs. "Brandon is a brilliant guy," said one senior NBC executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "but we've been going down the past two years with the same guy flying the plane."
Still, the television business -- especially the power and position of the broadcast networks -- has so fundamentally changed that most executives believe no network programmer can ever again have as much long-term impact as Mr. Tartikoff had. Indeed, although Mr. Tartikoff said last week that "someone with vision could still have impact," he added that "they would have to have the resources and support I got."
When Mr. Tartikoff took charge of NBC's programming in January 1980, the only limits on his prospects were his own creative abilities.
Now, Mr. Tartikoff said, the job is defined by its limits. These include limited ratings expectations because of all the new channels competing for viewers; limited margin for error because of the diminished network reach; limited patience from new corporate managers with no broadcasting background, and limited profits, leading to limited budgets.
 
No Longer a Shock
 "Think about this," Mr. Tartikoff said in a telephone interview from his NBC office in Burbank, Calif. "In my first year as president of entertainment, NBC had only $48 million in profits. That was considered shocking, that a network could be that close to breaking even. Now it is commonplace to think that two networks could get through a year and not make any money."
Indeed, CBS lost money last year and expects to post a loss for the current television year.
The changes have mainly to do with two factors, Mr. Tartikoff said: the "power shift" away from the networks and the overall economics of the business.
The television landscape has been reconfigured in the last decade, he said. "In 1980, cable had not hit criticial mass; neither had VCR's. There was no Fox network."
The last decade saw the emergence of cable stations like the ESPN sports channel and Turner Network Television as the percentage of households with cable television roughly tripled to about 60 percent. In addition, syndicated programs proliferated on independent broadcast stations.
 
'Last Colossus of Programming'
 Even in the less-crowded television arena of 1980, Mr. Tartikoff was not an overnight success.
"Tartikoff was the last colossus of programming," a senior industry executive said. "That's gone forever. There's no patience left in the business. Brandon had two and a half rough years. Nobody could afford to be that patient with a program executive now."
Indeed, NBC's slide in the ratings grew so steep between Mr. Tartikoff's first season and 1983 that managers for NBC's affiliated stations pressed for him to be discharged. But Grant Tinker, then NBC's chairman, had complete faith in Mr. Tartikoff's talent and complete patience with the difficult situation he was then facing. Mr. Tinker shrugged off the complaints of the affiliates.
Mr. Tartikoff said, "I had Grant Tinker supporting me and Fred Silverman teaching me." Mr. Silverman had been the original giant of network programming, having pushed first CBS and then ABC to the top of the ratings before he became corporate president of NBC.
But that quality of talent is not evident at the networks today. Instead, Mr. Tartikoff said, "The networks have all these numbers-crunchers considering how to save money by cutting back on the network service in prime time." He added, "That was unheard of 10 years ago."
So was putting on programs purely because they are cheap to produce, as the networks do now with the spate of so-called reality shows moving into prime time. "Does the world really need 'True Detective' and 'American Detective' in the same season?" Mr. Tartikoff asked.
With programs now costing so much more to produce, some formats are all but closed to programmers, he said.
"Nobody makes 'The A-Team' anymore," Mr. Tartikoff said. "Nobody makes action-adventure anymore because it costs too much and it doesn't sell in syndication. Producers don't want to do an hour show for you anymore. The diversity is not what it used to be."
 
Best Writers and Producers
 Mr. Tartikoff revived NBC's fortunes in the 1980's by recruiting the best writing and producing talent, and giving them good time periods and plenty of time to make a program work.
"That strategy is commonplace now, too," Mr. Tartikoff said. And it has helped drive the costs up. The best writer-producers -- like Steven Bochco ("Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law") and James Brooks ("The Simpsons") -- now make long-term expensive deals, which include commitments for shows to get on the air.
"People get commitments for three or five series on the air," Mr. Tartikoff said. He noted that Linda Bloodworth, the writer of "Designing Women," received five commitments from CBS.
"She's good, but that means she's crowding out somebody else," he said. "Maybe she's going to crowd out the next Steven Bochco from getting an opportunity on your schedule. ABC has made a lot of these commitments. They are almost in the position we found ourselves in at NBC when we had all this heavy-hitting talent lined up. You start locking yourself in, and then you start cutting loose other talented people."
 
New Economic Realities
 Later this month, Mr. Tartikoff will give a speech that lays out his strategy for dealing with the new economic realities facing television programmers. "We can't keep doing business the way we did 10 years ago," he said. "Instead of letting the corporate bean-counters come up with ideas like cutting the budget for developing series by 20 percent, we have to start asking ourselves if we can do the same programming job with 10 people instead of 30."
Mr. Tartikoff said he would have moved NBC in that direction if he had stayed. Last year, he said he hoped that before he left the network, he would have restored NBC to dominance in the 1990's as he had in the 1980's, retiring "undefeated."
"I guess I'm not quite going out like Sandy Koufax," he said last week. "This is more like Koufax going out with a 15-14 season."

HEADLINE: Perils on the Mountaintop

 BODY:
President Bush's irregular heartbeat may not be tied to the pressures of his job and those he visits on himself. But the news that he suffered atrial fibrillation while jogging near Camp David surely serves as a reminder of the uncertainties of life, not least life at the top of the mountain.
You can catch a lot of lightning up there. No man in this country is more exposed politically to sudden runs in the economy, the whims of foreign policy and rapid shifts in public opinion. 
 A mere two months ago, Mr. Bush was riding the crest of a decisive military victory. His approval rating reached an astonishing 90 percent, and even his opponents seemed to have conceded him the 1992 Presidential election. Now the news is filled with the sad plight of the Kurdish refugees, dismal unemployment statistics and depressing evidence that turmoil in the Soviet Union has slowed progress toward arms control.
Reversals of Presidential fortune are hardly new. President Reagan's popularity plunged 20 points when it was learned that he had tried to trade arms for hostages. But Mr. Bush brings to the normal worries of his job an almost abnormal faith in the virtues of perpetual motion. He plays tennis, throws horseshoes and fishes, often one right after another. He virtually lives on Air Force One.
This pace has not always served him well. Late last summer, after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Mr. Bush refused to abandon a scheduled vacation in Maine so that he would not be a prisoner in the White House, as Jimmy Carter appeared to be during the hostage crisis. So he played golf in the rain, every day, literally running from tee to green, and when he got back to Washington he soon lost control of the budget debate and began saying silly things like "read my hips."
Mr. Bush's irregular heartbeat has already inspired renewed interest in Vice President Quayle's qualifications. This could become even more of an issue if Mr. Bush receives anesthesia and the 25th Amendment is invoked. Yet those worries are only part of a larger concern about vulnerability -- not the vulnerability of the Presidency itself, but of those mortals who occupy it.
The White House, as usual, has tried to be reassuring, and one aide went to great lengths to tell reporters that Mr. Bush busily worked on his briefcase materials in the helicopter that took him to the hospital. But it would be even more reassuring if Mr. Bush heard a different refrain, the one about moderation in all things.

'To See Oursels . . .'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The American press takes pride in courageous scrutiny of those who hold power in our society. Today the press should be summoning up the courage to look at itself.
Self-examination is urgently needed in our business after our performance in the Persian Gulf war. Most of the press was not a detached observer of the war, much less a critical one. It was a claque applauding the American generals and politicians in charge. 
 In the press I include television, its most powerful component now and the most egregious official lap dog during the war. For the most part the broadcast networks simply transmitted official images of a neat, painless war. Or worse: put a gloss of independent corroboration on those false images.
And they were false. The officials told us belatedly that only a tiny percentage of all those explosives rained on Iraq were actually like the images we saw: bombs neatly zipping down the chimneys of military targets. No one could have guessed that from the utterly unskeptical press.
Nor could most Americans have understood, from their press, that the allied bombs were destroying the civilian infrastructure of a modern society. Early on reports from Baghdad said that city of four million was without electricity, running water, sewage. But our press hardly noticed.
There was scarcely a mention either of Iraqi deaths. The only American journalist I saw who wrote consistently about those casualties was Colin Campbell of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution. To most of the press it was as if Iraqis did not matter -- as if they were not fully human.
But perhaps the most dangerous shortcoming of the press was its failure to keep asking whether the war was necessary or wise. Once the bombing started, that fundamental political question was mostly put aside.
A savage attack on the performance of the press in the war appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine. It is by the editor, Lewis H. Lapham, and is entitled "Trained seals and sitting ducks."
"The bombardment of Baghdad began on Jan. 17," Mr. Lapham writes, "and within a matter of hours the newspaper and television correspondents abandoned any claim or pretension to the power of independent thought . . .
"The televised images defined the war as a game, and the military command in Riyadh was careful to approve only those bits and pieces of film that sustained the illusion of a playing field (safe, bloodless and abstract) . . ."
Mr. Lapham takes a conspiratorial view of President Bush's whole performance from the time Iraq invaded Kuwait last August. He suggests that the President decided almost at once to go to war, in order to control oil prices, revive the U.S. military budget and divert attention from economic recession at home.
"But none of these happy events could be brought to pass," he writes, "unless a credulous and jingoistic press could convince the American people that Hussein was a villain as monstrous as Adolf Hitler, that his army was all but invincible, that the fate of nations (not to mention the destiny of mankind) trembled in the balance."
And that is what the press did, Mr. Lapham charges. "The Administration well understood that the media couldn't afford to offend the profoundly conservative sympathies of their prime-time audience, and so it knew that it could rely on the media's complicity in almost any deception dressed up in patriotic costume."
The Lapham article is hyperbolic. But it includes much that should make editors and reporters and columnists think about what they did during the war -- and consider whether it was indeed credulous and jingoistic.
Of course the press was at a terrible disadvantage in its on-site coverage of the war. The military, breaking with long American tradition, barred correspondents from the front except for small, controlled pools. Moreover, the public was in no mood to hear complaints from the press.
But the control and the censorship, outrageous as they were, cannot excuse the compliant, unquestioning attitude of the American press. We glorified war and accepted its political premise, forsaking the independence and skepticism that justify freedom of the press.

HEADLINE: Hatcher Begins Battle to Regain Spotlight in Gary

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., May 5

 BODY:
On the streets of this faded steel city, many people still refer to Richard G. Hatcher as Mayor, almost four years after he was voted out of office, and they pronounce the title and name as one word: "MayorHatcher."
For some, it sounds like a curse, for others a password to a proud past. 
 Mr. Hatcher, 57 years old, became one of the country's first black mayors of a major city when he was elected in 1967, and held office for two sometimes stormy decades until he was defeated in what some say was a referendum on his combative personality. It was a style forged in the civil rights movment.
 
Seeking the Spotlight
 Now, like a former boxing champion eager to recapture the glory of the spotlight, Mr. Hatcher is running for his old job in the election on Tuesday.
"He likes being Mayor," said Ronald Cohen, a history professor at Indiana University Northwest here. "It gives him an identity, a platform, which he hasn't had for the last several years."
It was a shaky platform. Mr. Hatcher presided over the city at a time when much of urban America was undergoing painful and profound change: disappearing factory jobs, fewer Federal dollars, rising crime and disease, dying steel mills and middle-class flight, black and white.
Today, much of Gary's business district is lined with boarded buildings and out-of-work people. And opinions have remained divided.
"People were tired of Hatcher; that's why he lost," said Jacqueline Jones, a 37-year-old businesswoman. "They were tired of the city going down, down, down. They were tired of him blaming his problems on somebody else. We don't want to go back."
 
Hatcher's Core Support
 But Mr. Hatcher has retained a core of intensely loyal followers, many of whom remember when life in Gary was heavily segregated and politics was "just for white folks," in the words of an elderly man who was waiting to hear "MayorHatcher" speak at a church last week.
To them, Gary's problems in Mr. Hatcher's five terms were part of a nationwide decline of the inner city. They said Gary suffered more, perhaps because it relied so much on one industry: steel. Steel was why Gary was founded in 1906, they say, and steel was why it was suffering now.
In his early days Mr. Hatcher was a symbol of progress, of black people's getting a piece of the pie, even as the pie began to crumble. He became a bright star in the national movement for black political empowerment.
"I think the people of Gary see him as a historical figure," said James Lane, the author of a city history. "The question is whether they think his time has passed and it's time for new strategies or whether we need to revive some of that spirit of the 60's."
Many people said they thought that question was answered in 1987 when Mr. Hatcher was ousted by a low-key, nonconfrontational black politician, Thomas V. Barnes, in the Democratic primary. Mr. Barnes is running for a second four-year term.
Since Mr. Hatcher's defeat, there has been a wave of black politicians, like Mr. Barnes, who won high office and headlines for their philosophy and their politics, which are perceived to be more moderate. These include Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York.
 
'Crossover Politicians'
 "I call them crossover politicians," Mr. Hatcher said in a recent interview. "In an effort to be more acceptable to the white majority, they are unwilling to address, at least publicly, those issues that are considered as black issues: poverty, racial and economic justice, housing, adequate health care. Those are fairly universal issues, but they are still afraid to address them."
He added, "My question is, how dear is the price they are willing to pay?"
Mr. Hatcher, in his shirt sleeves and loosened tie, was sitting in his Gary home as he discussed his comeback campaign and his life out of office. He has spent the time teaching at a university and practicing law.
On a nearby wall was a photograph of the fiery Indiana basketball coach, Bobby Knight, whom Mr. Hatcher said he "loves and respects" for standing firmly for his beliefs, popular or not. It is a picture of the well-known incident in which Mr. Knight flung a chair across the court during a game.
"I believe there is some indication that the country is ready for more progressive politics than that which we've seen during most of the 1980's," Mr. Hatcher said. "There are people who represent progressive politics and their presence seems to be growing."
He smiled and said, "We'll soon find out whether that trend is evident here in Gary."
On Tuesday the voters will choose among nine candidates in the Democratic primary. In this city, winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to being elected.
 
The Field for the Race
 Aside from Mayor Barnes and Mr. Hatcher, only two other candidates are thought to be contenders: Dozier T. Allen, the head of the area's welfare office, and Scott King, a lawyer and the only white in the race in this city that is more than 80 percent black.
Gary's problems are numerous and entrenched. Many banks and businesses abandoned the city over the last 20 years for suburban shopping malls.
White flight, already a steady stream to the suburbs, became a flood soon after Mr. Hatcher's first mayoral victory. After he won the Democratic primary, hundreds of white voters switched parties and voted for the Republican in the general election. After Mr. Hatcher won that race, too, more "For Sale" signs went up.
Thirty years ago, Gary's population flirted with 180,000; today it is 116,000.
Much like Detroit, Gary is now a mostly black city surrounded by mostly white suburbs and towns and the relationship between the city and the surrounding communities has often been strained, especially while Mr. Hatcher was Mayor, his critics contend. Mr. Hatcher often feuded with Gary's neighbors over the operation and improvement of an airport and other development issues. Sometimes the feuding took on racial overtones.
"He chased a lot of people away with all that black power talk," said Jesse Pruitt, 63, who said he used to support Mr. Hatcher.
John Key, 33, who supports Mr. Hatcher, said, "If there were confrontations with the suburbs, Mayor Hatcher didn't initiate them. He only told the truth."
 
The Confrontational Image
 Mr. Hatcher said he does not deserve his image as militant and confrontational.
"I'm very mild-mannered," he said. "I never raise my voice. I don't scream at people. But I say what I believe."
Mr. Barnes built much of his successful campaign around a pledge to reach out to the surrounding communities. The theme of his administration has been "stressing the positive."
It was the decline of the steel industry that hit Gary the hardest. The city's biggest employer is the USX Corporation, formerly United States Steel. About 7,500 people work there now; in the early 1980's, there were 25,000, and in the early 1970's, about 35,000.
Beyond the ghostly business district, the scene is far from bleak in this city on the southern end of Lake Michigan. The working-class neighborhoods are filled with neat bungalows and lawns. White-collar workers, many from Chicago, a 30-minute drive away, have begun buying up the large homes that overlook the beach and lake.
But Gary's heart remains sick, and it is divided over Mr. Hatcher's campaign.
"I wish he'd go away," Mrs. Jones said. "We don't need him. His day is over."
But Claudia Terry, a secretary, said: "I love MayorHatcher. If I could, I'd vote for the man three times. He supports his people. What's wrong with that?"

HEADLINE: BUSINESS SCENE;
Recovery Awaits Housing Revival

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AS the recession enters its 10th month, all eyes are on home construction. When Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, talks of a recovery, he is counting on new-home construction, particularly the building of single-family houses, to give the economy its first lift. Other economists share his view that without the stimulus of home building, the recession could drag on.
Will home construction revive soon, as Mr. Greenspan hopes? No one is in hotter pursuit of the answer to this question than David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, and he says, "The demand may be there for new homes, but the builders may not be able to get the financing to build them." 
 In sum, a bullish forecast -- even from a trade association yearning for an upturn in construction -- is hard to come by, although some hopeful statistics have appeared. Sales of older single-family houses have risen sharply in recent weeks, and so have purchases of newly built houses that had gone unsold for a while.
As sales pick up, the inventory of homes awaiting buyers shrinks and the day approaches when builders will sense enough demand to resume building. Perhaps the inventory is low enough now. It totals 2.76 million single-family houses, down from three million last year. By comparison, the inventory averaged 2.25 million in the mid-1980's, when housing construction was robust.
"What we have is a housing sector going from being a drag on the economy to being somewhat of a positive," said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
That's the good news. The bad news is that housing construction itself -- that is, the number of groundbreakings for single-family houses and apartments -- has declined steadily from 1.1 million units at an annual rate last September to 900,000 in March, the most recent figure. Permits to build houses soon have risen slightly in the last two months, but construction has not.
When the turnaround does come, changing demographics will make the potential for a residential construction boom less than in the 1980's, because fewer households are being formed. Residential construction groundbreakings, or starts, hit 1.8 million in 1986, but the upper limit in the early 1990's is likely to be only 1.4 million units a year, said Robert Murray, an economist at the F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill. which collects such data.
What's more, while the inventory of unsold single-family homes is shrinking, the vacancy rate in apartments is quite high, discouraging construction. And multifamily buildings represent roughly 20 percent of total residential construction starts.
Beyond these obstacles, the biggest one is the difficulty builders are having when they apply for a construction loan. During the 1980's, when home prices kept rising across the country, lenders considered almost any builder a good risk because they were confident the house being built could be sold for more than enough to cover the loan.
Now, with price trends uncertain, banks are demanding that builders have enough spare savings to pay off construction loans if the houses they finance cannot be sold at high enough prices. Many potential builders cannot meet the new requirements, no matter what the demand might be for their projects, said Robert Dugger, chief economist for the American Bankers Association.
"It used to be that there was so much demand for housing that it did not matter what the builder's net worth was," Mr. Dugger said. "The house would sell, and the bank knew it."
Still, an upturn in home construction -- with single-family houses leading the way -- has often marked the beginning of the end of American recessions. Such construction is not by itself enough to reverse a recession, accounting as it does for only about 5 percent of the nation's annual economic activity. But home sales and construction, dependent as they are on lending, usually respond more quickly than other industries to the Fed's efforts to push down interest rates, a traditional recession remedy.
As construction rebounds, so do orders for the appliances and furnishings that go into new homes and, if all goes according to past scripts, purchasing agents at hundreds of companies outside the construction industry will regain confidence that business at their companies will also pick up.
So they will begin to stockpile goods, and production everywhere will rise. "That's the real kicker in a recovery," said Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board. "And home construction is the leader in this process."
It is the visible signal of a new willingness to purchase -- a signal that has not blossomed yet.

HEADLINE: Small-Business Ownership Poll

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Despite an increase recently in the number of women who own businesses, most small businesses formed in the 1980's were owned by middle-aged men, a survey released today said.
The nationwide telephone survey, conducted in mid- March for I.B.M., polled 400 companies, each with fewer than 50 employees. 
 In addition to finding that 81 percent of the businesses were owned by men, the survey found that the owners' average age was 43. It also said 72 percent of the owners had started their business instead of purchasing an existing company and that 38 percent of the owners had been dismissed or laid off from their previous jobs.
Thirty-eight percent had college degrees, and nearly 70 percent started or bought their businesses alone.
The survey found that 44 percent were Republicans, 20 percent independents and 20 percent Democrats.

M.B.A.'s Told To Look Into 'Green' Jobs

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
WITH jobs harder to find for new M.B.A.'s, placement directors work harder to find spots for them, and some are looking at environmental organizations.
"I can show them many opportunities in the environmental field," Susan Cohn, an assistant placement officer at New York University's Stern Graduate School of Business, said last week. She said she might be among the first counselors at leading graduate business schools to focus on opportunities in the "green" area. 
 The environment is a niche many M.B.A.'s do not think about, she explained, because there has been so much emphasis on engineers and scientists in the field.
It is obvious that environmental organizations, ranging from Federal and state governments to public service organizations to private companies, need the help of environmental specialists including lawyers. Less obvious, she contends, is that environmental organizations need business school graduates to do administrative work -- accounting, finance, marketing, public relations, personnel and other functions where skilled management can make a difference.
Furthermore, top management attitudes and actions in the environnmental area "can make or break companies," she believes, explaining that many top managers today are not knowledgeable about environmental problems and need advice. The bottom line can often be affected, she said, mentioning the Exxon Valdez oil spill as an example.
Miss Cohn, a 1982 graduate of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., majored in environmental studies. She also obtained certificates in organic gardening and livestock management from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Armed with these credentials she found a job in Alaska. "It involved economic development related to agriculture and fisheries," she said. "I spent three years in a town called Shungnak, on the Kobuk River, near Kotzebue. The aim was to teach people how to handle their jobs, giving consideration to the environment, as well as to develop job opportunities for Eskimos."
Then she returned East for a master's degree in career counseling at New York University.
"I got a job at the N.Y.U. graduate school of business to work on career development last April," she said, "and I looked at niches where jobs might be found for M.B.A.'s. Students desperately need to explore new job areas."
She has been finding opportunities in the environmental area, and at the same time she has been compiling what she calls the first "Green Directory" for M.B.A.'s, naming companies and advocacy groups interested in the environment.
The timing was ripe, she said. Already some future M.B.A.'s at N.Y.U. are gaining experience. One has joined Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, where she will do marketing projects for its environmental consulting group from now until next fall. Another is working at Earth Work magazine to develop marketing strategy.
Salomon Inc., the investment firm, has hired one business-school student to do environmental research while he continues to take courses at night.
Miss Cohn said also that five students were interning this summer in New York at J. Ottman Consulting Inc., which specializes in environmental marketing.
Procter & Gamble recently hired a student partly because of his environmental interest and knowledge, she said. His summer internship will be in Hong Kong.
"Renew America, an advocacy group in Washington, is looking for an executive director," she said. "That could be a good job for an M.B.A."
Many large companies, she said, already have vice presidents in charge of environmental affairs, like Robert Holland at Colgate-Palmolive. Small and mid-sized companies probably need better trained staff members with a knowledge of the environment, and they are beginning to hire a few experts, she said. Many business-school graduates already have a scientific or engineering background to which they could quickly add some environmental expertise -- an idea for currently unemployed M.B.A.'s.
At N.Y.U.'s graduate business school, Prof. Michael Darling has added study about the environment into both a basic marketing course and a product development course. Also, Prof. Thomas Gladwin will teach a course called global environmental resource management in the fall.
As in other relatively new career fields, there are few environmental textbooks for business schools, Miss Cohn said. This summer she plans to teach a course on careers and the environment at N.Y.U.'s School of Continuing Education, relying on expert outsiders as speakers.
She contends that in a generation or so, top business managers -- vice presidents and chief executives -- will need some background in environmental problems to lead companies more effectively. Young M.B.A. candidates getting environmental knowlege now will have an advantage.

HEADLINE: TEHERAN COURTING WESTERN EUROPE

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, May 5

 BODY:
The slogan at Teheran's main airport that was coined by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini proclaims "No East, No West," meaning that revolutionary Iran does not need either. A parade of Western European ministers trooping by it on their way to town these days seems to offer a different message.
Since the Ayatollah's death and the decline of Soviet power, diplomats here say, the less strident Government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani has come to acknowledge that there is no apparent alternative to the West as Iran seeks money and expertise to rebuild after its 1980-88 war with Iraq. 
 Shortly after Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France left here over the weekend, officials began preparing to receive his West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Britain has restored relations that were broken because of the Ayatollah's death sentence on the author Salman Rushdie.
But there are caveats to the opening. "Iran still does not have a certificate of approval by Western credit agencies," a diplomat said, so investment is hampered.
 
Line Is Drawn With U.S.
 As Iran courts Western Europe, it draws a line at overtures toward the United States, still viewed by revolutionaries and in the official propaganda as the Great Satan. "Down With Israel, Down With U.S.A.," says a slogan at the entrance to the Foreign Ministry.
"They see Western Europe as much less politically sensitive," a Western diplomat said. "They see they have to go to the West for the large-scale investment they need for internal regeneration. They cannot afford to have it from the U.S., so they go to Western Europe and Japan."
Teheran lays the blame for continued hostility at Washington's door.
"The policy of the United States toward us has not changed," Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a news conference on Saturday. "So we do not think there is any different climate in our relations."
"Iran," President Rafsanjani told university students recently, "is not thinking of restoring relations with the United States, which keeps on talking about it and creating problems."
 
Hostage Issue Cited
 The view contrasts with that of the United States and officials of other Western nations, who say Teheran itself is creating the problems by refusing to put pressure on the forces it controls in Lebanon to release American and other Western hostages.
But here, where radical opponents of the Government hold to Ayatollah Khomeini's xenophobic view, the relationship with Washington is infused with complex issues and demands by both sides that seem to preclude rapid improvement.
Teheran sees Washington as fundamentally hostile to the idea of Islamic revolutionary rule, Diplomats and analysts here say the United States maintains its categorization of Iran as a supporter of international terrorism and refuses to press Israel to release Shiite Muslim prisoners.
 
Stand During Gulf War
 The relationship has other shadings, the diplomats and analysts said. "During the gulf war, Iran really wanted the Americans to their dirty work for them by getting rid of Saddam Hussein," one envoy said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
While protesting the foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf region, Iran gave assurances that it would support economic sanctions against Iraq -- and implicitly support the American-led coalition against Baghdad -- while the authorities dismissed calls by Islamic hard-liners for a holy war against the United States and its allies.
Moreover, Washington's huge display of military power and the certainty with which it destroyed Iraq's regional might "produced a different awareness of what America can do," the envoy said.
He said that "the perception changed from the bumbling incompetence" of the failed effort to rescue American hostages during the Carter Administration and the Iran-contra scandal "to something that demanded more respect."
 
Hostage Issue an Obstacle
 The immediate obstacle to any new cordiality is the continued captivity of Western hostages. Iranian officials have made clear that they are not prepared to order the Western hostages released until their Iranian-backed militia captors in Lebanon secure the face-saving freedom of Shiite Muslims held by Israel. In both Iran and Syria -- the two nations with the greatest influence on the hostage-takers -- officials believe that the United States can easily press Israel to release the Shiite prisoners but has not done so.
Iran, Mr. Velayati said, believes "that all hostages should be released from Lebanon or any country."
The significance of the Iranian stance, a Western diplomat said, is that "the price is now established: the Western hostages will get out if there is a properly arranged release" of Shiite Muslims from Israel, which holds them partly in an effort to secure the freedom of Israeli pilots held in Lebanon.
Here and in other parts of the region, officials believe that the release of the hostages would lead to a deal on Iranian assets held by the United States since the 1979 takeover of the American Embassy here and to other steps toward normalization. "It could all happen quickly," an envoy said, "but I wouldn't hold my breath."

HEADLINE: To Cantonese, A Little Graft Is Forgivable

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CANTON

 BODY:
Lei Yu charges into the room, his extraordinary energy a fitting reflection of one of China's fastest-changing cities.
Mr. Lei, the Deputy Mayor of this frenetic and prosperous city, is one of a growing number of sharp and shrewd local officials who shun the Communist bureaucrat's life of long lunches and snoozes. Some people see him as a local hero who bucks the system; others accuse him of glaringly corrupt practices. 
 Guangdong province, of which Canton is the capital, is famous both for bucking the system and for its corruption, so it is not surprising that after being removed from a senior post for violating regulations, Mr. Lei has been able to climb his way back into one of the most powerful and busiest jobs in town.
"Compared with us, the life of New York's Mayor is light and easy," said Mr. Lei, 56 years old, who typically leaves home at 7 A.M. and returns about midnight.
 
Local Booster
 Mr. Lei does not campaign for election, but he lobbies for Canton's needs -- like a new stock market, foreign bank branches, greater efficiency in enterprises, higher exports and more economic restructuring. Leaders like him are rare in China, and he seems highly regarded and popular.
"He's very clearly a reformist, full of ideas of what he wants to do," a foreign analyst here said. "He's someone who is a real activist for getting things done."
It is a tribute to his ability and political skills that Mr. Lei has been able to return to power after being disgraced and dismissed from his post as administrator of Hainan Island in 1985. Mr. Lei and his assistant had taken advantage of the island's special privileges to import foreign cars duty-free and resell them at a high profit on the mainland. They ultimately approved the import of nearly 80,000 cars, in what became one of the biggest scandals of China's reform era.
The scheme was widely denounced as an example of corruption at the time, but Mr. Lei apparently did not benefit personally. On Hainan Island, which has since split away from the rest of Guangdong and been made a province by itself, Mr. Lei is remembered as a folk hero who took advantage of every loophole to buoy the local economy and paid with his job for his dedication to his constituency.
"All men are fallible," Mr. Lei said, dismissing the incident. "I'm not a saint. When I make a mistake, I correct it."
 
A Pragmatic Decision
 But early in 1988, less than three years after the car scandal, the province government decided that Mr. Lei's talent was more important than the tarnish of his recent past. Guangdong, which is not necessarily bothered by an official flouting the rules from the capital, welcomed him back to the fold.
"The mountain is high and the emperor is far away" goes a saying that many people say explains why Guangdong province has been able to shape a freewheeling economy -- it is simply too far from Beijing for the national Government to maintain close scrutiny. Guangdong is already China's economic showcase with growth of about 10 percent last year, twice the national rate.
But Mr. Lei denies that the province's leaders scurry around the guidelines set down by Beijing.
"It is not that we don't respond to the call of the party Central Committee, but that our cadres should not be the kind who blindly obey," Mr. Lei said. "If our cadres are not resourceful and they appear helpless in the face of something, would you call them good cadres? If they can't do anything, would you like to have them? I wouldnot."
Guangdong, however, still has a great deal of catching up to do if it wants to move beyond the level of a developing country. Although per-capita income in Guangdong was more than 40 percent higher than the national figure last year, it was only $430.
 
Progress, Not Perfection
 Not everything here moves as fast as Mr. Lei and his colleagues would like, and many economic changes, for example in prices and housing, have been adopted only slowly in Canton.
Moreover, hard-liners say that negative Western influences, like pornography, prostitution and other crimes, are much more evident in Guangdong than elsewhere in China. Prostitutes linger at the city's best hotels looking for customers, and taxis now have gratings to protect drivers from robbers.
As problems like these irritate local leaders, Canton continues to compete with nearby cities, such as Huizhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, for foreign investments. Mr. Lei adds that the entire province is battling with Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines for consumer markets in the United States and other prosperous countries.
"There is a Chinese saying: Sailing against the current, you must forge ahead or be driven back," Mr. Lei said, his eyes dancing about. "The present reality is just like this. Aside from stopping, if you drop your speed, you will fall behind."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Concern on Bush and Rates Helps Send the Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday after fluctuating in a session driven by concerns about President Bush's health and interest rates.
Analysts said worries about President Bush's weekend hospitalization for an irregular heartbeat after jogging put a damper on the dollar at its opening in Europe and in domestic trading. But after the President returned to the White House yesterday and was reported to be doing well, the currency rebounded. 
 The dollar, seen as a haven in times of international strife, was helped by reports of unrest in the Soviet Union. But concerns about interest rates drove the currency back down.
Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with Bank of New York, said the German mark started to climb as the market speculated that interest rates in Germany would remain stable while rates in other countries would decline.
Mr. Ryan called the dollar's finish "an overreaction on the downside."
High interest rates lend support to a currency, so rising rates in Germany would be a positive sign for the mark and falling rates elsewhere would undermine other currencies.
The dollar fell to 1.7325 marks in New York, from 1.74825 marks late on Friday.
The financial markets were closed yesterday in Tokyo for a national holiday, but the Japanese yen was traded in the United States and Europe. The dollar fell to 138.19 yen in New York, from 138.85 yen late on Friday, and in European trading, the dollar was quoted at 138.70 yen.
Markets were also closed for a holiday in London. The British pound gained ground in United States and European trading, rising to $1.7100 in New York, from $1.6940 late on Friday. On the Continent, sterling was quoted at $1.6990, compared with $1.6965 in London late on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Friday, included: 1.4675 Swiss francs, down from 1.4760; 5.8625 Swiss francs, down from 5.9125; 1,282.25 Italian lire, down from 1,294.75, and 1.15055 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15125.

HEADLINE: Big Deal That Poses Little Threat

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
The acquisition of NCR finally seems to give A.T.& T. the chance for success in the computer business that it has long craved. With its huge size, vast telephone network and the technological resources of its Bell Laboratories, A.T.& T. would seem to have the potential to become one of the successful information technology companies of the next century.
But most competitors say they do not fear the phone company's thrusts into computers and see the merger as merely providing a new owner for NCR. 
 Many computer-industry executives and analysts say the $7.4 billion acquisition of the NCR Corporation by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company is of more interest for its Wall Street maneuvering.
"It's not a big event," said William N. Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems Inc. "It just means there's one less computer company."
NCR, while profitable, solidly managed and strong in certain areas, is not usually considered one of the companies that shape the industry, like I.B.M., Digital Equipment, Apple Computer and Sun.
NCR, the nation's fifth-largest computer company, could become somewhat stronger with access to A.T.& T.'s financial resources and technology. But many analysts say NCR will be destroyed because the task of merging the two companies will divert its attention from computers and cause its best talent to go elsewhere. The five months that have elapsed since A.T.& T. made its bid may already have scared off potential customers.
"Every single computer executive I talk to that competes with NCR is dying for this to happen," said George Colony, president of Forrester Research, a consulting concern in Cambridge, Mass. "Nobody fears the combined entity at all."
Indeed, electronics industry mergers are notorious for their lack of success. The merger of Burroughs and Sperry into the Unisys Corporation was supposed to create a company with the critical mass to challenge I.B.M. Unisys has lost money.
The Hewlett-Packard Company's acquisition of Apollo gave it the leading market share in engineering work stations -- but only for a year. Hewlett then stumbled while trying to digest Apollo, and Sun retook the lead.
Similarly, the International Business Machines Corporation's acquisition of the Rolm Corporation was supposed to make Big Blue a force in telecommunications. It did not work out; I.B.M. eventually sold Rolm's development and production operations to the German electronics giant Siemens-Nixdorf, though I.B.M. still has an interest in the telecommunications company.
Robert M. Kavner, head of A.T.& T.'s computer operations, and the person behind the NCR acquisition, realizes that history is against him. After a speech at a computer conference in San Francisco in December, he was asked to name some high-technology mergers that have worked. Mr. Kavner acknowledged that he could not name one.
But the merger makes sense for A.T.& T. After losing as much as $3 billion in the last decade in the computer business, the company realized it was not going to succeed in computers on its own.
Buying NCR seems a more acceptable solution than pulling out of the industry altogether. With the acquisition, A.T.& T. obtains a profitable $6 billion computer business with a management team that will be allowed to run the combined computer business after the merger.
In A.T.& T.'s strategic vision, telecommunications and computers are merging, with a few large companies likely to provide complete information systems to large corporations in the next century. If it does not succeed in computers, A.T.& T. fears, it could become a second-rate company.
The computer industry is already undergoing a consolidation, and some analysts predict that it will wind up with only a dozen or so large companies. Despite NCR's protests that it would have been better off on its own, some analysts say the Dayton, Ohio, company might have had to find a partner eventually.
The combination "recognizes the realities of what's going on in the industry," said Ulric Weil of Weil & Associates, a Washington consulting firm. He called the merger positive for both companies.
 
Based on Unix
 A.T.& T. officials also argue that NCR is perhaps the best match for the telephone company. NCR's computer strategy is based on the phone company's Unix operating system, a basic set of commands for controlling computers. NCR also has strong sales overseas, where A.T.& T. has virtually no presence.
And NCR is heavily involved in the type of computer business in which A.T.& T. wants to specialize, one that can take advantage of the phone company's strengths in communications. NCR is a leader in supermarket point-of-sale systems and automated teller machines. Both involve networks of communicating computers.
"They're in the right kind of computer business," said Ian M. Ross, president of Bell Laboratories. "They are not in the standard box business; they are in the transaction business."
Dr. Ross said A.T.& T. could provide technologies for NCR to incorporate into its point-of-sale and automated teller networks, like speech recognition, image manipulation and wireless communications.
 
Successful on Its Own
 NCR has been one of the most successful of the old-line mainframe companies in shifting to the use of computers based on microprocessors and standard software. The company is developing a product line that will range from tiny notebook computers to multimillion-dollar supercomputers, all based on the Intel Corporation's microprocessors.
Executives say this line will give the company a chance to become an even larger force in this decade.
"NCR doesn't need A.T.& T.; it's the other way around," said Morris C. Enfield, a former research manager at NCR.
There is concern that many of NCR's best salesmen and engineers will leave if things go sour. NCR's chief executive, Charles E. Exley Jr., who is credited with much of the company's success, plans to retire after the merger is completed but will stay on as a consultant.
A.T.& T. has had a transition committee planning ways to avoid such disruptions. The company has said that NCR would remain fairly autonomous and that its executives would run the computer business. It is expected that NCR will have a separate board, made up of NCR and A.T.& T. executives.
NCR will be able to take whatever pieces of A.T.& T.'s computer business it wants and jettison the rest. Some A.T.& T. computer division employees have been moved to other parts of the company in preparation for substantial cutbacks. Still, some A.T.& T. managers will be moved into the NCR management team, and some A.T.& T. products are expected to be carried forward by NCR.

HEADLINE: Productivity Down, Then Up, as U.S. Errs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
In one of the most embarrassing statistical mistakes in recent memory, the Labor Department announced late today that American business productivity was up, not down, as it had said in the morning.
Productivity advanced at a 1 percent annual pace in the first quarter of the year, the agency said, instead of dropping nine-tenths of 1 percent as it reported originally. 
 The mistake, which the Labor Department said it could not fully correct until Wednesday, occurred when a single figure was mistransmitted and in effect poisoned much of a detailed 20-page statistical release on the efficiency of the nation's economy.
"This has never happened before," said an analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics this evening. "It's caused quite a to-do."
He added that the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a Commerce Department unit that collects the basic data, "gave us the wrong number" in sending it on to the statistics bureau, which makes productivity estimates. However, a statistics bureau spokeswoman, Constance DiCesare, insisted that it was not the fault of the Commerce Department unit.
Although productivity is the ultimate determinant of a nation's standard of living, these figures are not of high importance to Wall Street bond traders, and the statistics bureau's personnel said they had had no complaints about the figures. It was not clear why. The bureau did not formally disclose the error until after the New York markets had closed for the day.
The figures for manufacturing, which cover 20 percent of the economy, were not affected by the error, the statistics bureau said. These showed that productivity in factories generally and in durable goods manufacturing both fell at a pace of nine-tenths of 1 percent and that productivity in factories producing nondurables fell four-tenths.
The fundamental error, a statistics bureau expert said, involved the valuation for owner-occupied housing, an imputation made for purposes of assembling the gross national product that needs to be subtracted out to make productivity calculations. "We pulled out too much" as a result of the mistake, he added.
This expert said he did not know whether the breakdown came in a telephone conversation or by facsimile machine, but he added that "people are already thinking of another level of checks" that might need to be introduced.
At the same time, however, it appeared odd to some economists that overall business activity outside farms could have climbed as much as 1 percent, the revised and assertedly correct figure, when manufacturing was so weak. This implied, one said, that productivity in services had soared when there was no evidence that this had occurred.
 
Statistical Quirk Seen
 The most likely explanation, said H. Erich Heinemann, an economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, was a statistical quirk mainly involving the Persian Gulf war combined with a huge $4.3 billion annualized jump in brokerage commissions.
He said that during the war foreign travel to the United States dropped more than overseas travel by Americans, shrinking the nation's net travel surplus at a rate of $3.7 billion. Lower net foreign spending raises consumption of services.
Today's mistake came on the first business day after Janet L. Norwood, Commissioner of Labor Statistics for the last 12 years, told a Congressional panel that she had informed the Bush Administration that she would not accept reappointment to another term.

HEADLINE: Footnote in Dinkins's Plan: $1 Billion Property Tax Rise

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Even as he proposes huge service cuts and tax increases to balance New York City's budget next year, Mayor David N. Dinkins is planning on the financial help of annual property tax increases in the years after that.
The increases total $1 billion in the two fiscal years from July 1992 through June 1994. They are in a footnote of a plan Mr. Dinkins distributed at Gracie Mansion on Saturday, as he met with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, union leaders and state and local officials to head off the most painful measures to balance his budget in the fiscal year that begins on July 1. 
 Business leaders said that the new proposals for tax increases were devastating, coming at the same time as proposals for extraordinary service cuts like turning off one in four street lights, reducing street cleaning and cutting money for libraries.
"They are proposing service cuts and tax increases at the same time they are trying to keep business in the city during a recession," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, a business advisory group. "It is a very mixed message."
 
No Holding the Line
 Mr. Dinkins already plans to raise taxes more than $1 billion this coming fiscal year, including as much as $800 million in property taxes, despite an outcry from the real-estate industry, homeowners, and the leaders of the City Council, which can reject them.
The administration first proposed tax increases in January. After intensive lobbying by business leaders -- including some of Mr. Dinkins's own economic advisers -- he said he would hold the line on taxes next year, despite worsening economic conditions.
But while some of his advisers suggested a moratorium on property tax increases in years after that, the footnote in the financial plan said that the administration's planning assumed a $527 million property tax increase in the fiscal year beginning in July 1992, and another $546 million increase the following year. In 1994, the tax would go up $243 million more.
Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Finance Director, said that the tax increases were being disclosed now to give businesses a clear picture of the city's finances.
 
'Hope It Doesn't Come to Pass'
 "The business people have used us for some kind of certainty," she said. "Unless the property market turns around, this is the best estimate we can make at this time. We certainly hope it doesn't come to pass."
Mark V. Shaw, the finance director of the City Council, said that each annual increase roughly meant a $100-a-year tax increase on a $220,000 house.
"To talk about tax increases in the out years only sends the wrong message," Mr. Shaw said. He said the Council favored continued "downsizing" of city government.
According to the real-estate industry, the proposed rates of increase would be 7 percent in the year starting July 1992, 6 percent the following year and 2 percent the year after that.
Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said that next year, when assessment increases are combined with rate increases, property taxes would go up between 15 and 25 percent.
Business officials said that nearly $3 billion in city and state taxes had been imposed in the last two years and could cost the city tens of thousands of jobs.
Rather than listing the increases as new taxes, city budget officials counted them as regular tax revenue, and put them in a footnote. This enabled Mr. Dinkins to present a financial plan that showed the city's budget being close to balanced in 1992 and 1993. Previous estimates had showed gaps of more than $1 billion in both those years.
Earlier this year, the administration was widely criticized for including "implicit" property tax increases without fully disclosing them, except in technical support documents. The numbers were included in a footnote this time, after a debate within the administration, one city official said.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Warns Against Chill in Ties

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 6

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned Washington that a new cold war could emerge if the Bush Administration continues to pursue political and economic steps that appear to undermine the Soviet Government, the official press agency Tass reported today.
Mr. Gorbachev also denied reports in the Western press that he was retreating from the far-reaching programs of political and economic change that he initiated when he came to power six years ago. He asked foreign countries to refrain from drawing "hasty conclusions about a 'change of course' " by the Soviet leadership. 
 The Government has been criticized lately both at home and abroad for yielding to pressure from orthodox forces like the army, the K.G.B. and Communist Party bureaucrats. Mr. Gorbachev has been offering steady rebuttals to his critics.
In his latest remarks, during a Kremlin meeting on Sunday with Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born media executive, Mr. Gorbachev did not specify what actions Washington had taken that signaled, according to Tass, "that the U.S. is readjusting its attitude to the Soviet Union."
 
Feeling Let Down by Bush
 But Western diplomats and Soviet officials said Mr. Gorbachev and his closest advisers were dismayed by President Bush's reluctance to grant a personal request from the Soviet President for the extension of further credits for grain purchases. Mr. Bush cited the Soviet Union's failure to repay its foreign debts.
Moreover, they said, Mr. Bush's plan to meet with the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, in the White House on Wednesday deepens one of Mr. Gorbachev's worst political worries: the campaigns by many Soviet republics to break away from the Soviet Union. And today Mr. Bush met with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, who resigned from Mr. Gorbachev's Government while warning of approaching dictatorship.
Commenting on Mr. Gorbachev's remarks, a Western diplomat said: "We don't see this as a threat. We see this as an appeal.
"Let's face it," the diplomat added, "the guy is in a lot of trouble at home. Bush is saying, 'Whoa, not so fast,' when Gorbachev asks for a bigger agricultural loan. He didn't seem to make much headway when he was in Japan convincing those guys that the Soviet Union was a safe investment. And so it's only natural for him to use whatever outlet he has to get across an S.O.S."
In his meeting with Mr. Murdoch, who holds American citizenship, Mr. Gorbachev sought to underscore "the special value of relations" between the United States and the Soviet Union, Tass said. And he appealed to Washington to avoid subjecting the relationship to "unnecessary tests."
Mr. Gorbachev expressed hope that a summit meeting with Mr. Bush would take place as planned this spring in Moscow. "If what has been gained at the end of the term of the previous Administration and under President George Bush is undermined," he warned, "the world will again plunge into a 'cold' or 'semi-cold' war, into an atmosphere of political dampness that will negatively affect the health of international life as a whole."
Mr. Gorbachev implicitly acknowledged that his perestroika program may have slid momentarily backward on its path toward invigorating the moribund Soviet economy. Given the overwhelming nature of the task, he said, it is impossible to predict what pitfalls may yet await the country.
In an apparent response to charges that he has abandoned his original goals, Mr. Gorbachev said his Administration's most pressing need was "to prevent elements of chaos from escalating to catastrophic proportions."
"It is very important for the foreign public, and primarily the mass media, to understand correctly what is really happening and not to draw hasty conclusion about a 'change of course' from any new step taken by the Soviet leadership," he was quoted as saying. "It is hard to predict how many surprises life will spring on us."
But, seeking to offer reassurance, he said, "The general political choice has not changed."

HEADLINE: Shevardnadze Asks U.S. Food Credits

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister, appealed to the Bush Administration today to extend new food credits to the Soviet Union, asserting that the fate of democratic change in Moscow may be at stake.
As Mr. Shevardnadze made his remarks in his first appearance in the United States since resigning his post in December, President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania offered the opposite advice only a few blocks away during the first day of his own visit to Washington. 
 The presence of the two Soviet political figures and their conflicting views underscored a difficult choice the Administration is facing.
The Administration is nearing a decision whether to guarantee $1.5 billion in additional commercial bank loans for Soviet purchases of American grain. Mr. Bush said last week he was not inclined to authorize the guarantees, but officials said Mr. Shevardnadze might have helped sway Mr. Bush during their talks at the White House today.
The new loans would supplement $1 billion in credits guaranteed by the Commodity Credit Corporation last December when the Administration waived the restrictions prohibiting preferential trade treatment with nations that restrict emigration. Moscow has already spent nearly all of the original credits.
 
$1.5 Billion Credits Asked
 Mr. Shevardnadze linked the future of Soviet politics to the uncertain economic situation and the possibilities for increased cooperation with the West. He echoed a request that the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, made in a recent letter to the Agriculture Department for $1.5 billion in new credit guarantees.
"This is a very acute issue with us now," Mr. Shevardnadze said, "and I want to say quite straightforwardly that a decision which will be taken in Washington will to a large extent determine the fate of reform and democracy in the Soviet Union. I want to stress this, that we have very little time."
Mr. Shevardnadze, in an interview after his meeting at the White House with Mr. Bush, said he had consulted with Mr. Gorbachev before visiting Washington, but he insisted that he was not carrying a message from the Soviet leader. Mr. Shevardnadze said Mr. Bush listened attentively to his appeal but did not commit himself one way or the other.
"But I had the impression he understands how acute this question is with us," he added.
But Mr. Landsbergis said he would counsel Mr. Bush against extending new loan guarantees until Moscow liberalizes its policies. "It shouldn't be given to the Soviet Union to prevent it from adopting a path of dictatorship," he said in an interview. "It should only be given after it demonstrates that it is going down the road of democratization."
 
U.S. Recognition Urged
 Mr. Landsbergis said he would tell Mr. Bush when they meet on Wednesday that Lithuania needs Washington's formal diplomatic recognition to prevent another Soviet military crackdown against his breakaway republic. The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 1940 as a result of a secret pact with Nazi Germany.
Prime Ministers Edgar Savisaar of Estonia and Ivars Godmanis of Latvia are also scheduled to meet with Mr. Bush this week, even as American officials began analyzing the meaning of a meeting that Mr. Gorbachev had with Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media executive, in which he upbraided the Administration for pursuing policies that seemed to undercut his authority. Mr. Gorbachev's comments were carried by the Soviet press agency Tass.
A State Department official said: "There is a sensitive, delicate political balance here between supporting Baltic aspirations for independence and keeping our lines open to the Soviet leadership. That's not always easy to do."
Administration officials have said they are undecided on the latest plea for grain credits, expressing concerns that it would be unwise to extend them to Moscow at a time when its creditworthiness is questionable. "We are not helping them by creating another Poland financially," the State Department official said. But he acknowledged that Mr. Shevardnadze's advice could strengthen Mr. Gorbachev's case.

HEADLINE: A.I.D. Is Criticized on Population Control

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
The Agency for International Development, a primary force in shaping the world's favorable attitude toward population control, is now in disarray on population matters, a private organization says in a new report.
The group, the Population Crisis Committee, said in a report issued Sunday that "over the past decade the U.S. population assistance program has been battered by ideological controversies and constrained by the creeping bureacratization which now characterizes most U.S. foreign aid efforts." 
 The group said that in four of the last five years, the Reagan and Bush Aadministrations have proposed spending less money on the program than the Congress had appropriated the previous year.
A spokesman for A.I.D., James Kunder, said in response: "Budget priorities limit a lot of worthwhile programs, both domestic and international. As the Population Crisis Committee report itself indicates, the A.I.D. population program is the leader in the world in size, quality and creativity."
The A.I.D. program provides contraceptives, technical training, research and other support for national programs around the world. The report recommended that A.I.D. broaden its approach to include injectable contraceptives, safe abortion services, adolescent education and sex education programs.
The report may be obtained from the Population Crisis Committee at 1120 19th St., N.W., Suite 550, Washington, D.C. 20036

HEADLINE: Iacocca Is Offered, but Rejects, Heinz's Seat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 6

 BODY:
Under pressure to appoint a strong Democrat to replace the late Senator John Heinz, the Governor of Pennsylvania offered the post to Lee A. Iacocca, a political independent. But Mr. Iacocca, who has never held political office and lives in a Detroit suburb, turned it down.
An aide to Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania said today that the offer had been made and that Mr. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive officer of the Chrysler Corporation, "would have been a strong advocate for jobs and economic growth in Pennsylvania." The aide, David M. Stone, the Governor's chief of staff, said Mr. Casey would soon announce an alternative. 
 William J. Green, a former mayor of Philadelphia, is reportedly leading the list of candidates. But Mr. Stone would say only that Mr. Green, now a lobbyist, was on the list to succeed Senator Heinz, who was killed when the small plane in which he was a passenger collided with a helicopter near Philadelphia last month.
The Governor's offer was made earlier last week but it was not made public until today when Mr. Iacocca released a statement in Detroit.
Mr. Iacocca said that Governor Casey, a Democrat, offered him the seven-month interim appointment with the understanding that Mr. Iococca would start campaigning as a Democrat to run in the November special election, which would determine who completes the remaining three years of Senator Heinz's term. In declining the offer, Mr. Iacocca cited his age, family and corporate obligations.
"After 45 years of hard work, my family and I are looking forward to what I'll simply call a more 'normal' life," said the 66-year-old executive.
Governor Casey has been criticized for taking more than a month to make the appointment. But political analysts say he has had a hard time finding a strong candidate to run against the likely Republican contender, Dick Thornburgh, the United States Attorney General who is a former two-term governor of Pennsylvania.
"Who is Governor Casey going to offer the Senate to next? Bob Hope?" said State Senator Robert C. Jubelirer, a Republican.
Mr. Iacocca, who was born in Allentown, Pa., does not have to be a resident of the state to accept an interim appointment, but he would have had to move to Pennsylvania were he to win an election for a full term. He left Pennsylvania more than 35 years ago.
"I am depressed," said State Senator Vincent J. Fumo, a Philadelphia Democrat. "Iacocca has such national prominence I don't think Thornburgh would have dared to run against him."

HEADLINE: Landlords Plan To File Lawsuit On Rent Control

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
New York City's largest landlords' association said it will file a suit today to lift rent controls on the city's most expensive rent-controlled apartments.
The association will attempt to overturn part of the 44-year-old rent-stabilization law on the ground that the city failed to conduct its usual analysis of apartment vacancy rates to justify continued control of rent rates. 
 The rent law, established to prevent landlords from charging excessive rents on scarce housing, was to expire on April 1. The city needed to show a vacancy rate of 5 percent or less to prove that housing was still scarce enough for an emergency to be declared and to extend the law.
But because the city was unable to conduct the analysis of vacancies it usually performs every three years, it submitted the results of a much smaller analysis showing a vacancy rate of 4.2 percent in the first three months of last year.
 
After the April 1 Deadline
 In its complaint, the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords, argues that the survey did not cover housing quality, as the law requires, was of doubtful accuracy and was submitted after the April 1 deadline. A copy of the suit was made available by the association.
The landlords' suit also says that later surveys showed a vacancy rate of 5.2 percent for the last six months of last year, and argued that the most recent results should be used.
City housing officials said they had not yet seen the pending suit, and would not comment on it further.
John J. Gilbert 3d, who heads the landlords' group, said that his aim was to create classes of regulated apartments according to rental prices and decontrol only the most expensive ones, where the vacancy rate is already higher than 5 percent. The landlords have generally referred to such apartments as those that rent for $900 a month or more.
 
The Plaintiff of Record
 Mr. Gilbert said that no current occupant of a regulated apartment would be affected, and that no assault on tenant protections, which are also covered in the law, was intended.
The suit is to be filed in State Supreme Court in Queens, Mr. Gilbert said. It names Mayor David N. Dinkins, the City Council and the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which administers the rent law. George Stavroulakis, a Queens landlord, is the plaintiff of record, along with the Rent Stabilization Association.
"The focus of this suit is truly on where the benefit of rent regulations should go, and isn't it time that we re-evaluate the sacred cow called rent control?" Mr. Gilbert said yesterday.
The landlords' suit seeks to take advantage of a jam the city got into last year, when the 1990 Census coincided with the city's Housing and Vacancy Survey, last conducted in 1987. The raw data for the housing survey, which is based on 18,000 rental apartments, is provided by the Census Bureau.
The bureau asked the city to postpone the survey until the census was complete, but when the city asked the State Legislature for permission to do that, the Senate refused.
Felice Michetti, the Housing Commissioner, then asked the Census Bureau to extract the city's rental vacancy rate from information based on just 2,000 apartments. The City Council used that information to certify that a housing emergency still exists in the city, and on April 1, Mayor Dinkins signed a three-year extension of the law.

HEADLINE: Reagan Guest Stars Before the California Assembly

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 6

 BODY:
In his first appearance at the Capitol since his terms as California Governor, a nostalgic Ronald Reagan today stepped lightly over the state's budget deficit and instead celebrated the California that "encourages the dreamer in us all."
The 80-year-old former President addressed a rare joint session of the state Legislature, at the invitation of the Democratic leadership of the Assembly, and used the occasion to tell self-deprecating jokes, campaign for the gun-control bill that is before Congress and commiserate without offering advice about the state's $12.6 billion budget deficit. 
 The day had more ceremony than substance for Mr. Reagan, who was accompanied by his wife, Nancy. It was a time for proclamations and plaques, toasts from the lawmakers and small talk with the current Governor, Pete Wilson, who was a cub assemblyman here in 1967 when a former actor took leadership of the nation's most populous state. Mr. Reagan was mellow and platitudinous throughout his 15-minute speech, stumbling from time to time as he read from a printed text, but winning laughs with jokes about his age and current status of unemployment.
In the weeks leading up to the speech, political observers here said, Governor Wilson was concerned that Mr. Reagan would fan the partisan fires in the capital just as budget talks reached a critical juncture.
While Mr. Wilson fretted, some lawmakers here speculated that Mr. Reagan, who began his tenure as Governor with a record $1 billion tax increase, might endorse Mr. Wilson's call for a $6.7 billon rise in taxes. Such a move would offer Mr. Wilson, a moderate Republican, the necessary political cover.
Those hopes were dashed by Mr. Reagan's innocuous reference to the state's budget crisis. First he tweaked Mr. Wilson for the heap of problems he inherited on taking office in January, including "a continuing drought and an exploding deficit."
"What's next, Pete?" he asked. "A swarm of locusts?"
Later, in a more serious vein, Mr. Reagan said that while the state's budget was California's most pressing challenge, "I'm not here to tell either the Governor or the Legislature how to do their work."
Mr. Reagan was more forceful about the gun-control bill named for James S. Brady, his former press secretary who was wounded in an assassination attempt on the President in 1981. Mr. Reagan recently reversed course and endorsed the bill, making it easier for Republican lawmakers to buck the right wing of the party and support it.
Except for endorsing the Brady bill, Mr. Reagan took no stands and stirred no controversy, choosing instead to reminisce about his tenure as Governor, to quote Winston Churchill and to speak fondly of his "friends" Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev.
That, apparently, was what the Assembly leaders had in mind when they invited Mr. Reagan, an invitation that was tendered during a golfing outing with Mike Roos, who recently quit the Assembly to run an education organization in Los Angeles.
"In terms of the institution of state government," Mr. Roos said, "it is a healthy and appropriate courtesy that he revisit the place where he launched his career."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Newly Confident Hussein Takes Show on the Road

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 6

 BODY:
After waving silently for several minutes to an enthusiastic but organized crowd in the northern city of Mosul over the weekend, President Saddam Hussein performed his new trick.
In the televised appearance, he suddenly took out his pistol and began firing shots over the heads of the people. The crowd went wild, leaping up and down as they chanted a rhythmic Arabic refrain: "Bush, Bush listen carefully. We all love Saddam Hussein." 
 The shots-in-the-air routine is a recent twist in the President's public relations style. It was noted for the first time on Wednesday when Iraqi television showed him drawing his pistol in the western city of Ramadi and again on Friday when he started shooting on a visit to the town of Baguba.
Iraqis say the shots are a gesture of defiance toward the United States and its allies, a reminder of the President's claim that he has resisted the forces of imperialism and Zionism, a part of the Orwellian rewriting of history under way here as Iraq -- and indeed the world -- comes to terms with the fact that Mr. Hussein has survived the Persian Gulf war and seems almost as firmly in power as ever.
As allied forces continue to occupy parts of the country, newspapers, television and loyal officials present Iraq as the aggrieved rather than the aggressor, never mentioning Kuwait but claiming that the country successfully resisted the American-led attack because Mr. Hussein is still there to prove it. Even the manifest damage Iraq has suffered is presented as a worthwhile price for defending a just cause.
Prime Minister Saadun Hamadi said recently on television, "Iraq has paid a price for a just and noble aim -- resisting imperialism, Zionism and the old system."
 
Atmosphere Grows Heavier
 Middle-class Iraqis are not taken in by such assertions. But as the President recovers his self-confidence and appears more frequently in public, foreigners who have been here since the war say the atmosphere is growing heavy again, with people no longer willing to talk as freely as they did just after the fighting.
Soviet diplomats, who were here throughout the war, say they are not surprised. There was a brief "Baghdad spring" when people voiced dissent openly on the capital's streets, but that is disappearing now after the crushing of the Shiite uprising in the south last month and another rebellion in the Kurdish north.
The President remains firmly in control through his tight family lock on the army and security services, though aided, Soviet diplomats say, by the essentially unpolitical nature of many Iraqis whose primary demand from their leaders is that they provide them with a tolerable life.
And that is clearly the Government's first priority. Nothing did more for Iraqi morale than the lifting of gasoline rationing on the President's birthday last month. Electricity and clean water are returning rapidly. And even the heavily bombed telephone system is starting to work again.
The pace of recovery here is astonishing United Nations relief officials who have been planning assistance on a scale that they now say will probably be unnecessary.
 
Censorship Is Eased
 A major factor, these officials believe, is a Iraq's policy of manufacturing at least part of many sophisticated Western machines it imports. This has allowed it to repair much of the damage done by the allied bombardment without the need to import goods from abroad.
Another sign of a return to normalcy came on Sunday with the lifting of censorship and many other restrictions imposed on visiting journalists during the gulf war.
Yet it is hard to believe the future is going to be quite like the past, for Mr. Hussein's Government clearly faces challenges that were not there before.
The President's three outings last week, his first attempts to mobilize large-scale public support since the war, were all to cities in Iraq's Sunni heartland, his power base. He has yet to try anything similar in the less loyal north and south, although before the war such demonstrations were arranged regularly in those regions.
 
Bush's Call Exploited
 Paradoxically, President Bush may have helped consolidate Mr. Hussein's position, Iraqi officials say, when he called on the Iraqi people to remove their leader. Iran exploited the call by helping to stir up rebellion in the south and the north, which rallied the country's Sunni center to the President's flag.
By moving swiftly to make peace with the rebellious Kurds, as Mr. Hussein did in talks last month that produced the tentative outline of a peace accord, the Iraqi President has shown that he does not want to face insurrection on two fronts again and that he is anxious to get sanctions lifted and start the petro dollars flowing again.
Yet the sudden hesitancy of major Kurdish opposition groups to attend follow-up peace talks is seen by many here as a sign they are in no hurry to strike a deal with a Government that they believe is weaker than it pretends to be.
While sanctions remain, inflation is likely to continue and unemployment seems set to rise. The volume of complaints carried in the Government-controlled press about the pace of price increases suggests that this is the consuming worry of most people.
In a televised pep talk he gave to a group of leading Mosul citizens on Saturday, President Hussein seemed to concede the sensitivity of the issue. Picking up a glass ashtray, he noted that it came from France and had to be paid for in francs. But Iraq has no francs because it cannot sell oil, so it cannot import and shortages develop, pushing prices skyward.
In the past, the President recalled, he and the ruling Baath Party had "interfered" in economic policy. But no more. Inflation, he said, is "a technical matter" that should be left to the relevant technocrats, the Cabinet ministers in charge of the economy.
In effect, President Hussein was excusing himself and his party from any responsibility for economic problems resulting from the crisis precipitated by his forces' occupation of Kuwait.
While inflation is visible and rampant, unemployment looks like a sleeper about the wake up. "Where there were five employees we now have three," a Government clerk said recently. Correspondents flying over northern Iraq last week noted no sign of activity at several large factories untouched by allied bombing.
 
Changing National Interests
 With no oil money to hand out, the Iraqi Government is tacitly admitting past mistakes and offering the people more democracy and better administration instead. A new constitution, a multiparty system, free elections and a free press are all promised for this year.
The few middle-class Iraqis with whom a foreigner is able to speak at length about such matters seem unimpressed, usually saying that they doubt the power structure will change significantly.
This cynicism, while understandable, might just prove exaggerated. Iraq's national interests seem about to change as a result of the difficult terms the United Nations Security Council is imposing in return for lifting sanctions.
In the past, President Hussein presided over a country that was the strongest military power in the region and also one of the richest. But burdened by a continuing military embargo and reparation payments to Kuwait, the Government may find it expedient to strike up some new and more cooperative relationship with its own people as well as with its neighbors.
This is probably what Prime Minister Hamadi had in mind at a recent press conference when he admitted that "a debate" was under way within the leadership about the long-term consequences of the lost Persian Gulf war for Iraq.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Change at Top of Publishers Group

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 6

 BODY:
The American Newspaper Publishers Association announced today that Cathleen Black would leave her position as publisher of USA Today to become the association's president and chief executive.
Hard economic times in the newspaper business have turned the annual convention of the association into a call to arms for sweeping change that many publishers say is long overdue. The appointment of Ms. Black, who is 47 years old and considered one of the industry's savviest figures, is emblematic of this new thinking. 
 The job of chief executive is a new position, and the association's top leaders said that when she assumes her duties on June 17 they expect Ms. Black to function as a very visible advocate for the industry and to reflect a new marketing sophistication.
 
New Publisher at USA Today
 Thomas Curley, 42, the chief operating officer of USA Today, will succeed Ms. Black as president and publisher.
John Morton, a newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, said USA Today would miss Ms. Black's strong standing on Madison Avenue, which is particularly important because USA Today publishes almost all national advertising in competition with magazines. "Tom does not have that background," Mr. Morton said, "but that doesn't mean he won't do well."
Widespread declines in advertising and earnings at many papers have prompted what many here describe as an unprecedented determination to rethink every aspect of the newspaper business and to come to grips with a new marketplace of very demanding advertisers and increasingly elusive readers. Ms. Black has taken a leading role in this rethinking.
"This recession has been a blessing that forced us to focus on a new world," Lloyd G. Schermer, the association's chairman, said in his keynote speech today at the opening of the publishers convention here.
Mr. Schermer, who is chairman of Lee Enterprises Inc., a newspaper chain based in Davenport, Iowa, added that newspapers could cling to "the old world of our memory" only at their peril.
The association's 1,400 members include most of the daily papers in the United States and Canada.
 
Strengthening Trade Groups
 The appointment of Ms. Black is part of a far-reaching effort by the nation's newspaper publishers to strengthen and integrate the industry's plethora of specialized support and trade organizations.
Traditionally, there have been separate -- and often overlapping -- organizations that served both as fraternal bodies and industry research groups. For instance, the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, the International Newspaper Advertising and Marketing Executives, the International Newspaper Marketing Association and the International Circulation Managers Association are separate organizations, each with membership fees and a specialized agenda.
Many publishers have been critical of the arrangement both because it was expensive and because the organizations tended not to pool their expertise for maximum results.
A study by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, the management consultants, has prompted an effort by the publishers to consolidate all the marketing-related organizations into the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. This group, in turn, would work with the publishers association, which the study said should be headed by a strong chief executive who could speak for the entire industry.
 
Vision of New Role
 Ms. Black, who has spent several years on the board of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, said her new job was "to try to give a sense of energy and vitality and direction" to the industry.
She said her role would range from active lobbying in Congress on behalf of newspapers to pushing for greater representation for women and ethnic minorities in the industry.
Indeed, Ms. Black said she was "totally committed" to diversity. About half the nation's newspapers have no minorities working in newsrooms.
Mr. Morton, the newspaper analyst, said he was somewhat surprised that the association had chosen Ms. Black, most of whose career has been spent in magazine publishing, over James Hoge, who, he added, was her principal competition for the position.
 
Other Candidates Not Named
 The association did not divulge other candidates' names but Mr. Hoge, who is the publisher of The Daily News in New York, is said by people who know him to be interested in taking another position after the 21-week strike by Daily News unions that ended in March with the sale of the paper to Robert Maxwell. Mr. Hoge was previously publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times. Attempts to contact Mr. Hoge, including a phone call to his home, were unsuccessful. A Daily News spokeswoman said at the end of April that he was on a six-week vacation.
Jerry W. Friedheim, who was the association's president for 16 years and is being replaced by Ms. Black, will become a general executive at the Gannett Foundation, a philanthropic organization founded by the Gannett Company that promotes First Amendment values.
Ms. Black began her career with USA Today when it was just starting up. In 1983, when she was publisher of New York magazine, she was hired by Allen H. Neuharth, then chairman of Gannett, to be president of the newspaper. She had been the first woman to be publisher of a weekly consumer magazine.
 
Promoted to Publisher in 1984
 Ms. Black was promoted to publisher of USA Today in 1984 and one year later became a member of the Gannett board, which she will now leave.
Although USA Today has become a popular success, with circulation of 1.8 million, it has never made an annual profit. A USA Today spokesman said advertising pages declined in 1990 by 9 percent, although advertising revenue increased slightly. Ad pages also declined in 1989.
Thomas Curley, Ms. Black's replacement at USA Today, is the brother of John J. Curley, who replaced Mr. Neuharth as chairman in 1989. Ms. Black and Thomas Curley reported separately to John Curley.
Relations between John Curley and Mr. Neuharth, who is now chairman of the Gannett Foundation, have been strained in the last year because of Mr. Neuharth's decision to sell the foundation's 10 percent stake in Gannett to the highest bidder.
In late April, an agreement was announced that subject to Government approval, Gannett itself would acquire the foundation's stock and right to its name for $670 million.
 
Gannett Statement
 In a statement today, John Curley said that the company would miss Ms. Black and that her "intelligence, enthusiasm and vitality are exactly what the newspaper industry needs."
His brother, Thomas Curley, joined USA Today in June 1985 as assistant to the president and became executive vice president and general manager in December 1985. Four months later he became president of the paper and, two years after that, its chief operating officer as well.
He was director of research at Gannett in 1979, when Mr. Neuharth asked him and three other executives to figure out whether a national newspaper was a viable idea. That research project provided the data on newspaper reading habits that formed the cornerstone on which USA Today was based.
 
USA Today's New Structure
 He recently delegated primary responsibility for advertising at USA Today to Carolyn F. Vester, whom he appointed to a new position of senior vice president and associate publisher. But, since Ms. Vester will report to him, Mr. Curley now pretty much runs everything at USA Today but the news room.
To him, that represents the rationalization of a badly fragmented structure. "Finally we are setting up a structure that is normal for a newspaper," Mr. Curley said. "No longer will advertising and circulation people, say, call on the same customers because they are just not communicating."

More Green For Less Gold

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
AS many a candidate for public office has discovered, green is beautiful: Voters much prefer their air pristine, their water potable and their garbage somewhere else. What elected officials are also discovering is that green can be expensive: According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend $100 billion annually to comply with Federal environmental rules.
That is why Washington now seems almost as interested in how to clean up as what to clean up -- and why the initial Project 88 report, released on the eve of President Bush's inauguration, caught the political wave. 
 The brainchild of two ambitious Senators, Tim Wirth of Colorado and the late John Heinz of Pennsylvania, Project 88 made a case for market-based incentives as a cheaper, less intrusive alternative to traditional pollution regulation. Round 2 of the project, released this week, offers more specific advice for environmentalists eager to tame the capitalist beast without rendering it lame.
Before the mid-1980's, environmental politics was about us versus them. They were chopping down our rain forests, poisoning our rivers and coating our sea otters in crude oil. Government's job was to stop them.
Now the battle lines are blurred. Companies are scrambling to become greener-than-thou: products once touted as "new and improved" are now "recyclable" or "biodegradable." By the same token, there is greater public recognition that the environmental lunch is not free; sometimes the price of clean is higher taxes and higher prices.
Political momentum for environmental change has not ebbed. But it is dawning on Democrats, as well as Republicans, that the greatest political rewards may well be reaped by those who worry about the costs as well as the benefits.
The first Project 88 report, written by Robert Stavins of the Kennedy School of Public Policy at Harvard, offered ways to think about a laundry list of problems from radon pollution to wetland conservation. The message, that market-linked financial incentives could be a cheap, effective alternative to "command" regulation, was no revelation to economists. But it did impress the target audience, environmental professionals and lawmakers who want the job done with minimal disruption to business, consumers and the Government budget.
One area where the report apparently influenced votes was in the acid-rain provisions in last year's amendments to the Clean Air Act. The "get the bad guys" approach of the original act set standards for sulfur emissions from power plants. Rather than merely tightening those standards, forcing older plants to be rebuilt at great expense, the new law limited total sulfur emissions and gave polluters discretion in how to comply collectively.
Rights to pollute can now be traded, giving polluters an incentive to close exceptionally dirty plants and sell their emissions rights to those who value them more. In some cases, it may even pay utilities to subsidize customer conservation rather than build cleaner plants or buy the right to pollute from someone else. The estimated savings to utility stockholders and electricity consumers will run to about $1 billion a year.
Round 2, again drafted by Mr. Stavins, digs a little deeper than the original report. The chapter on greenhouse warming, drawn largely from the work of Dan Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund, Lawrence Goulder of Stanford University and Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council, is particularly intriguing.
International limits on greenhouse gases, it suggests, would be more cheaply carried out if emissions rights could be traded among nations. This would allow countries to buy rights from others that are prepared, say, to switch to nuclear power or to plant trees. Poor countries might be compensated with a disproportionate share of rights in the initial allocation, giving them the choice of polluting more or raising capital by selling their permits.
The report makes a case for fuel taxes in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide the fuels put into the air. The revenue, the report suggests, could be used dollar-for-dollar to reduce other taxes, offsetting the regressive nature of carbon taxes and perhaps reducing market distortions that impair economic efficiency.
There is too little detail here to weigh the merits of these policy prescriptions. But it would be a mistake to think of Round 2 as simply a cookbook, to be judged by the completeness of the recipes. Project 88 is a sign of the growing economic savvy of the environmental movement, recognition that there is more to good environmental policy than just saying no.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds and C.D.'s Fall In Yield for the 10th Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts plunged in the week ended yesterday for the 10th consecutive decline.
The size of the weekly declines had been getting smaller until last week, when banks cut their prime rates in response to a cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve the week before. 
 Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor said that consequently only a few banks and savings institutions cut deposit yields. Many did not have an opportunity to change rates between the two cuts, and thus, the sharp drop in yields this week.
 
Plunge in Discount Rate
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction held Monday, the average discount rate fell sharply, to the lowest levels in three years. The results of these bill auctions often indicate what many banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The three-month bill fell by 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent, while the six-month bill fell seven basis points, to 5.61 percent.
In The Bank Rate Monitor's weekly survey of New York area banks, declines reported at commercial banks and savings insitutions were moderate to sharper.
The largest yield changes in the New York area this week were recorded at the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, which cut its money market account by 53 basis points, to 5.39 percent, and the People's Bank in Connecticut, which cut its three-month certificate by 37 basis points, to 5.92 percent, and six-month certificate by 26 basis points, to 6.08 percent.
Commercial banks, which cut their deposit yields deeper than savings institutions, lowered the average money market account by 11 basis points, to 5.27 percent, lowering three-month certificates by 10 basis points, to 5.68 percent, and six-month ceritificates by 11 basis points, to 5.82 percent.
Savings institutions did litle to change money market yields, and left the average unchanged at 5.74 percent. However, they did cut C.D. yields. A three-month certificate fell 9 basis points, to 6.06 percent, while a six-month certificate fell 10 basis points, to 6.28 percent.
At 20 large banks around the country, but outside the New York area, the average money market account yield fell by four basis points, to 5.32 percent, while the average yield for a six-month certificate, dropped by nine basis points, to 5.88 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Amid Concerns About an Interest Rate Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday, nudged downward by lingering concerns about President Bush's health and a possible decline in interest rates.
Gold prices rose in overseas and domestic trading. In New York, gold picked up $1.10 on the Commodity Exchange, to close at $356.50 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356.30, up $1.05. 
 Although President Bush's heart rhythm was normal for a second day, traders remained uneasy after the President's weekend hospitalization, said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Mr. Bush went to Bethesda Naval Hospital on Saturday with an irregular heartbeat, which doctors stabilized on Monday with drugs.
The dollar was also depressed by talk of interest rate increases in Germany that helped lift the German mark, analysts said.
The mark, like all currencies, is supported by higher rates, which make a country's investments more attractive. An increase in German rates would be a positive sign for the mark, and a negative for the dollar and other currencies backed by lower rates.
The dollar fell to 1.7175 marks in New York, from 1.7325 marks late on Monday. In earlier European trading, the dollar slumped to 1.7210 marks from 1.7430 marks.
The dollar was further hurt by the belief that United States rates would continue to fall because of the recession. Although the unemployment rate declined last month to 6.6 percent from 6.8 percent in March, the economy remains weak and traders fear the Federal Reserve will push interest rates lower, Mr. Johnson said.
Traders were waiting for the next economic report on Friday, when the Labor Department will release producer price figures for April.
The dollar fell to 137.80 Japanese yen in New York from late Monday's 138.19. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to a closing 138.42 Japanese yen, from 137.68 yen at the close Thursday, the last day of trading before a holiday weekend. Later in London, it fell to 137.90 yen.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7275 in New York, from $1.7100 late Monday. In earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.7205, from $1.6990 at Monday's close in Europe. London markets were closed for a holiday on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Monday, included: 1.4530 Swiss francs, down from 1.4675; 5.8155 French francs, down from 5.8625; 1,2700.50 Italian lire, down from 1,282.25, and 1.15105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15055.

HEADLINE: Reynolds Grant to School: A Pilot Program or a Peril?

 BODY:
A proposed North Carolina public school that was hailed recently as a winner in the RJR Nabisco Foundation's Next Century Schools competition for innovative school proposals is now being criticized for its plan to set aside up to 60 percent of its seats for children of employees of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
At issue is the Integrated Learning Center, an elementary school that will open in Winston-Salem this fall in an old factory building that Reynolds sold to the county last year. The plan is to have a year-round, 11-hour-a-day school that will serve people who work in a nearby business. Over the next three years the foundation will provide $750,000 and Reynolds Tobacco an additional $250,000 of the school's $3.6 million budget. 
 The foundation is the philanthropic division of RJR Nabisco, the conglomerate that owns Reynolds Tobacco. The foundation's Next Century Schools awards are intended to give substantial grants to public schools that develop innovative "risk-taking" programs. This year, the second for the contest, $9.7 million in grants was distributed to 15 public schools nationwide.
This year the contest drew more than 1,600 entries, and critics questionwhether it is merely coincidence, as the foundation contends, that one of 15 winning proposals will directly benefit its employees.
 
Dangerous Precedent Feared
 More fundamentally, the critics fear that as school districts take up President Bush's call to expand partnerships with business, it may set a dangerous precedent of exchanging benefits for support.
At issue is the concept that public schools should offer equal access and equal opportunity to every student, said James C. Shields, executive director of the North Carolina Civil Liberties Union. "If Reynolds wants to set up its own school, it should go ahead and do that," he said. "It seems to be using a public school to provide an employee benefit."
Colleen O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union, added that the plan could create inequalities, with the children of employees of major companies receiving a better education than those whose parents work for smaller companies or who are unemployed.
But officials of the Forsyth County School District where the school will be situated scoffed at the idea that the school amounts to a private institution for Reynolds employees. Susan Carson, a spokeswoman for the district, said the school would only serve 360 students, as many as 216 from Reynolds and the rest chosen by lottery from throughout the county.
"Reynolds has 8,000 employees," she said, "so this could actually create problems for them among all those whose children can't get in."
 
Link With Working Parents
 Ms. Carson said a principal aim of the school was to provide a closer connection between students and their working parents. The Integrated Learning Center will be within five blocks of the Reynolds headquarters, and the company has agreed to release employees to attend school functions, meet with teachers or even have lunch with their children.
"This plan would not work if we opened up to all 38,000 children in the district and got very few Reynolds kids," said Ms. Carson.
Noting that from 70 to 80 percent of the mothers in Forsyth County work, Ms. Carson said the new school would be a response to fundamental changes in American society. "The home used to be the center of family life," she said. "But now both parents usually work and so we should begin thinking of building schools near workplaces and assigning kids not based on where they live but where their parents work."
The school will also try to provide a closer link between the classroom and the Reynolds workplace, she said. Reynolds employees are to serve as "coaches" and meet with a group of 15 students once a week. People from the advertising department, for example, can explain how they use writing skills in their work; chemists can discuss practical applications of science, and people from the graphics department can show how they use computers.
"We still have to see if this concept works," Ms. Carson said. "But we fully expect it will and we already have another site in mind where we can replicate it."

HEADLINE: Fed Nominee Discusses Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Lawrence Lindsey, nominated to be a Federal Reserve Board governor, suggested to the Senate Banking Committee today that he would have cut interest rates more than the Fed did last fall. But he also endorsed the Fed's most recent rate cuts as adequate for the moment, and he hesitated to say the economy was now in recession.
"Certainly it was in recession in the first quarter," and it "probably" is now, although recovery appears near, Mr. Lindsey said at a two-and-a-half-hour confirmation hearing. 
 Committee members, Republicans and Democrats alike, were not so optimistic. They used the hearing to criticize the Fed for letting a slowdown turn into a recession out of reluctance to lower rates more quickly.
 
Pondering a Vote
 After the hearing, Donald W. Riegle, the Michigan Democrat who is the committee's chairman, said he was not yet persuaded to favor the nomination. "I want to think about what he said," Mr. Riegle said.
Two Republicans, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and John W. Warner of Virginia, said they favored the nomination.
Mr. Riegle and Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, also noted that Mr. Lindsey, a Harvard economics professor on leave to serve as an adviser to President Bush, was nominated to the Fed from the Richmond district, although he has lived in Richmond only in the last five years.
"I don't see how you, by any stretch of the imagination, could say that you participated in the economic life of Richmond," Mr. Sarbanes said. Mr. Lindsey, 36 years old, had just acknowledged that his Virginia participation was mainly as a homeowner and payer of property taxes.
Mr. Riegle said the hearing was especially important because of the recession. Indeed, concern over the recession, and what the Fed might have done to provoke it, dominated the hearing.
 
Adjusting Interest Rates
 The Fed deals with inflation by raising interest rates, or holding them steady, to dampen demand and with it economic activity. Only since December has it been pushing rates down sharply to stimulate borrowing and purchases, and reverse the recession that began in July.
"It became obvious to me in the middle of last year that we had a serious problem, and I admonished Greenspan that the danger was a recession, not inflation," said Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, referring to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman
Mr. Domenici charged that the Fed's governors and regional bank presidents "are like the Germans; they have an almost total fear of inflation."
Mr. Lindsey declined, on several occasions, to say inflation should not be a prime concern of Fed policy makers. He said that in the short term, he would react to such things as growth in the money supply and the growth rate of the overall economy. Weak money supply growth last year would have prompted him to lower rates more than the Fed actually did in the fall, Mr. Lindsey suggested.
 
Examining Past Policy
 "In hindsight," he said, "money growth was too slow in the last three quarters of 1990 and to some extent this problem has been rectified."
But he repeatedly invoked an argument often heard from Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials: that the Fed must concern itself with long-term growth free of inflation. He talked, as Fed officials often do, of achieving a balance in which growth is not so rapid and inflationary that it drives up long-term interest rates. In the end, he said, long-term rates govern corporate America's willingness to invest in new factories and equipment and make the economy grow.
Mr. Lindsey is an advocate of supply-side economics, which holds among other things that tax cuts stimulate investment and economic growth. His recent book, "The Growth Experiment," argues the supply-side case. Senator Riegle took issue with some of the assertions in the book, declaring that if Mr. Lindsey still believed them, then "I would be inclined to vote against you." One assertion, for example, was that the Reagan tax cuts contributed only "trivially" to the budget deficits of the 1980's.
Mr. Lindsey assured the committee that as a Bush official he operates with an open mind and as a Fed governor he would also be open to many viewpoints.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
3-Year Notes Sell Well, but Rates Go Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The first leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions was fairly well received yesterday, but Wall Street traders, fearing that coming sales of more speculative securities might not go well, sold outstanding issues of Treasury securities, pushing down prices and raising interest rates.
As expected, demand was good for the $13.5 billion worth of three-year notes auctioned yesterday. The securities were sold at an average yield of 7.09 percent, up from an average yield of 6.98 percent at the last three-year note sale on Feb. 5. 
 The average yield was about what had been expected, but in when-issued trading after the results were announced, yields on the new three-year notes moved a bit higher. By late in the day, the issue was offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.11 percent.
 
'A Sense of Concern'
 "The sheer magnitude of the issue dragged it down," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. "Once it became clear that the market was going to have some trouble distributing the three-year, that dragged the rest of the market down, and created a sense of concern."
Indeed, credit market participants said the outlook for today's sale of $11.75 billion of new 10-year notes and an auction tomorrow of $11.75 billion of 30-year bonds was far more problematic.
"These rate levels are very attractive," a government bond dealer said. "But the Street will need to see customers show up and buy the 10-year before it feels more comfortable."
However, some money managers said rates would probably have to move a bit higher to attract buyers to the 10-year and 30-year auctions.
"After this auction, I think those securities will have to move a few more basis points higher," one portfolio manager said. "I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the 10-year go at a yield of 8 1/8 percent, and a yield of at least 8.25 percent for the bond."
By late yesterday, the 10-year notes to be sold today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.05 percent. The 30-year bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.22 percent.
 
Consumer Credit Declines
 A Government report showing that consumer credit outstanding fell by just under $1 billion in March, the fourth straight monthly drop, had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Despite the lack of a reaction, analysts at Stone & McCarthy noted that it was the first time since the spring of 1980, when President Jimmy Carter imposed credit controls, that consumer credit had declined for four consecutive months. The only other previous period when that occurred was during the recession of 1958, the analysts said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 95 30/32 late yesterday, down 10/ 32, to yield 8.24 percent, up from 8.21 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 7 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 26/ 32, down 1/8 point, to yield 7.67 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, down 1/32, to yield 6.81 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.50 percent, up two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.63 percent.
 
Offering by Harsco
 In deference to the huge volume of new Treasury debt, only a smattering of investment-grade corporates and municipal debt offerings were priced yesterday.
Among the corporate deals was a $100 million offering of five-year notes for the Harsco Corporation. The 8 3/4 percent notes were priced at $99.92 to yield 8.77 percent, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 5/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by a competitive sale of $320 million worth of securities issued by the State of Pennsylvania. A bid by an investor group led by Goldman, Sachs won the securities. The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2011. The bonds were reoffered with yields from 4.50 percent in 1992 to 6.85 percent in 2011.
Investment bankers involved in the transaction said that as of late yesterday only $66 million of the bonds remained unsold. The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and AA-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In addition, Paine Webber Inc. acted as lead manager on a negotiated sale of $98.45 million worth of bonds for the Connecticut Housing Authority. The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1996 to 2003, and term bonds maturing in 2008 and 2009.
The serial bonds, which are subject to alternative minimum tax provisions, carry yields from 5.90 percent in 1993 to 6.75 percent in 2003. The term bond maturing in 2008 is also subject to alternative minimum tax provisions. It was priced to yield 7.20 percent. The term bond in 2009, which is not subject to the alternative minimum tax, was priced to yield 7 percent.
The issue is rated AA by Moody's and AA-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues fell by about 1/8 of a point in quiet trading.
Prices of widely quoted tax-exempt municipal securities rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point, traders said.

HEADLINE: A Union Agrees To a Times Plan To Reduce Staff

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The New York Times and the Newspaper Guild reached an agreement yesterday in which the company will offer cash incentives to employees who are over age 55 with 15 years' experience and who agree to retire.
Times officials said that 300 employees were eligible under the program but that the company intended to limit the number who accept the incentives, known as buyouts, to 125. They work in departments in the guild's jurisdiction, which covers the newspaper's clerical, commercial, news and editorial staffs. 
 John M. O'Brien, the senior vice president for finance and human resources, said the company had offered the buyouts because poor economic conditions had made it necessary to reduce the newspaper's staff.
 
Layoffs Announced in March
 The agreement comes seven weeks after The Times announced a layoff of 61 employees, all guild members. Times officials said that no reporters or editors were in that group.
Of the 61, Mr. O'Brien said yesterday, four have been rehired for other jobs. The rest, guild officials said, are on a waiting list to be rehired if jobs became available.
The layoffs, which were announced March 21, came after the paper and the guild failed to reach an accord in earlier negotiations aimed at arranging buyouts. At the time the publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, said that if the guild did not reconsider and agree to a buyout program, "additional layoffs will have to be considered."
A sticking point in the March talks was how much the company would contribute in benefits for employees who agreed to buyouts. Yesterday both sides said that the company had agreed to make payments in advance to the health, welfare and pension funds for workers who accept a buyout.
The payments will be based on how much the company would have contributed for each of the employees if they had stayed with the company for five years or until they reached age 65, whichever comes first. The buyout offer provides three weeks' pay for every year's service up to 78 weeks, which means a maximum of one and a half year's salary.
 
Union 'Very Pleased'
 Barry Lipton, president of Local 3 of the Newspaper Guild, said the union had tried and failed to persuade The Times to cancel the 61 layoffs or convert them to buyouts. But he added, "We're very pleased that we'll be able to use this voluntary buyout in an effort to avoid any more involuntary layoffs."
Mr. O'Brien said that if the sign-up exceeded the company's limit, the buyouts would go to employees with the longest service on the paper.
Times officials said they expected that some news department employees would elect to leave under the buyout plan. But the officials said they did not know how many might do so. They said that they had tried to set some limits in specific areas of the newsgathering operation that would let workers who are eligible take a buyout but also insure that the quality of the newsgathering operation would not be affected.
In March, the paper went ahead with a buyout offer to managers and other guild-exempt employees. Mr. O'Brien said yesterday that 80 such workers were eligible. But he added that he would not know how many had decided to accept the buyouts until a sign-up period ends later in the month.
