Treasuries Dip As Durables Top Estimates

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities slipped yesterday, in response to an unexpectedly strong manufacturing report and the weight of a fresh supply of Treasury debt.
The 30-year Treasury bond, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, fell 5/32, to 95 18/32, for a yield of 6.98 percent, up from 6.96 percent on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve raised its Federal funds target rate, or the overnight loan rate banks charge each other, to 5.50 percent, from 5.25 percent. 
 For the second consecutive month, durable goods orders exceeded expectations, a sign that manufacturing activity is humming along. Durable goods orders were up 1.5 percent in February after a revised 4.1 percent rise in January. Analyst forecasts had ranged from no change at allto a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "After appearing to falter in both November and December, new orders for durable goods rebounded with a vengeance in January and February, which noticeably diminishes the possibility of any imminent slowdown in the durable goods sector."
That, he added, "further verifies the upside risks" that prompted the Fed "to adopt a less accommodative monetary posture."
Mr. Fine noted that the rise in durable goods -- items intended to last three years or more -- came despite declines in both civilian aircraft and motor vehicle orders, reflecting in part gains in communications equipment and electronics components. And equally important was the strong 1.1 percent February jump in the unfilled orders backlog on the heels of a similar one in January. He said that provided a base for continued growth in the output of durable goods.
Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc., said: "More solid economic reports such as this one will surely build on fears of further Fed tightening in the months ahead. Indeed, it is unlikely that a mere 25-basis-point hike in the Federal funds rate will be enough to slow a fully employed U.S. economy, which is clearly expanding at an above-potential rate of growth."
In yesterday's auction, the Treasury sold more than $26 billion in new one-year bills and five-year notes, with the results as expected. The average rate for a one-year bill was 5.66 percent, up from 5.36 percent last month, and the highest since April 27, 1995, when the yield was 5.90 percent.
Traders said the five-year note auction went well, with 6.660 percent the awarded high yield, up from 6.359 percent last month, and the highest since June 26, 1996, when it was 6.674 percent. While the bid-to-cover ratio -- the number of bids compared with the size of the sale -- was about average at 2.54 to 1, noncompetitive bidding was better than expected. It gave some support to the market, but sellers are using the gains as selling opportunities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rebuffed in Global Proposal For Eavesdropping on the Internet

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
In a setback for the Clinton Administration that demonstrates the difficulty of setting global policies for the Internet, the leading industrial nations have declined to embrace a United States proposal to allow computer eavesdropping by the world's law enforcement agencies.
The United States proposal, backed by Britain and France, was an attempt to restrict the private use of increasingly advanced data-scrambling technology that can protect the privacy of electronic mail and other forms of computer communication. The equipment can make it difficult for law enforcement officials to crack a code when they suspect it is masking criminal or terrorist activities. 
 The proposal called for international endorsement of a system in which mathematical keys to computer-security codes would be held by escrow agents from whom law enforcement officials could obtain the keys once they have a court's wiretapping warrant.
But policy guidelines scheduled to be released in Paris today by the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fail to endorse the United States proposal. And they leave such leeway for members to regulate data-scrambling technology -- or not -- that computer security experts say any uniform international policy remains elusive.
"The difficulty with the guidelines is that anybody can interpret parts of them in their own way," said Konstantine Papanikdaw, a policy analyst for information security at the European Commission in Brussels.
Indeed, the industrial world seems to be deeply divided on whether governments can ever legitimately eavesdrop on the electronic communication of their citizens. Because messages on the Internet are easy to intercept, a growing number of individuals and corporations are protecting the privacy of their communications and the security of their commercial transactions by scrambling such information.
Some O.E.C.D. nations, including Britain and France, have either outlawed or are in the process of tightly regulating the private use of data-scrambling systems. But other nations -- including Australia, Canada, Denmark and Finland -- have policies that protect individual privacy. Among other member nations, Japan had initially resisted the United States proposal but was said to be moving closer to it, while Germany remained deeply divided.
Most other countries, inside or outside the O.E.C.D., have yet to confront the data-scrambling issue. And even the United States has a somewhat contradictory national policy that permits citizens to use whatever data-scrambling software they wish within the nation's borders, but restricts the export of the most up-to-date computer-coding technology.
That seeming contradiction, however, did not prevent the Clinton Administration in recent months from waging a vigorous behind-the-scenes effort for its proposal. And hoping to resolve some of the policy conflicts, the Administration is now circulating draft legislation on Capitol Hill which would attempt to control even the domestic use of data-scrambling software and establish a key-escrow system for the United States.
While the O.E.C.D. has no authority to set international policy, its recommendations are frequently used by member nations in setting their own foreign and trade policies. And the privacy and law-enforcement aspects of the Internet are issues on which member governments have been desperate for guidance.
But even though most of the O.E.C.D. discussions involved law enforcement officials, who have been the main advocates for measures that would insure their ability to crack codes, European officials say that there was never much agreement on what to do.
And so the primary recommendation in the report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, simply gives O.E.C.D. member nations the latitude to do as they see fit when it comes to data scrambling, which is formally known as cryptography.
"National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to plain text, or cryptographic keys, or encrypted data," the report says.
Privacy-rights advocates see the O.E.C.D. guidelines as a critical setback for the Clinton Administration. "The U.S. proposal to endorse lawful access to private keys was explicitly rejected by the O.E.C.D. member countries," said Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center and a member of the O.E.C.D.'s advisory group. "The O.E.C.D. chose instead a policy based on voluntary, market-driven development of cryptography products."
And even supporters of the United States position acknowledged that guidelines were a disappointment.
"The United States probably had more success raising consciousness then getting language that could be treated as an endorsement for key recovery," said Stewart Baker, a former National Security Agency official who participated on the American delegation to the O.E.C.D.
Meanwhile, executives for the United States computer industry were critical of the O.E.C.D. for even leaving the door open for governments to set national policies on data scrambling.
"We think that markets, not governments, should be the primary determinants of technology solutions," said Jon Englund, a vice president at the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group.
Many experts question whether governments can ever hope to insure law enforcement access to electronic messages or to restrict the spread of super-strong coding software, because new, more powerful versions can always be developed and easily transmitted over the Internet in the blink of an eye.
And any international effort is almost certainly doomed if some countries refuse to go along with a common approach, because people looking for strong encryption can simply acquire it wherever the laws are lax.
In fact, the big German company Siemens A.G. recently introduced an encryption system that it advertises as being much more powerful than American companies can export under United States law.
Besides the United States, France and Britain both support a system for enabling law enforcement officials to obtain keys to data-scrambling codes. France has already passed a stringent law that requires participation in such a system, although the rules to carry out the law have not yet been worked out.
And in recent days, Britain has quietly circulated the most restrictive proposal of any nation, a domestic policy under which the Government would allow private use only of cryptography that was officially licensed, to make sure that the software uses code that law enforcement officials can crack.
Under such laws, of course, criminals and terrorists might logically choose to use unauthorized encryption software. But the mere fact that such use would be a crime may be a deterrent -- or give the police grounds to arrest anyone whose communications were indecipherable.
In Germany, encryption remains a deeply divisive issue. The Interior Ministry has supported the need for encryption restrictions of some sort, but the Justice Ministry and the Economics Ministry have both signaled their opposition. And German businesses have been outspoken opponents against any new restrictions on data scrambling.
Meanwhile, United States export restrictions have been a boon for Brokat Informationssysteme G.m.b.H., a two-year-old start-up company in Boblingen, Germany. Brokat supplies secure electronic transaction software for banks like Deutsche Bank and on-line services like America Online in Europe.
One of Brokat's hottest products is the Expresso Security Package, which essentially adds strong encryption to the World Wide Web browsers and Internet server software sold by two of the largest American software companies -- Microsoft and Netscape Communications.

HEADLINE: Huge Indonesia Gold Strike May Have Been Exaggerated

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, March 26

 BODY:
In a stunning reversal of fortune, a tiny Canadian company that once said it had made the world's richest gold strike in the jungles of Indonesia conceded today that it had probably overestimated the size of its find.
The company, Bre-X Minerals of Calgary, Alberta, told its prospective American partner in developing the site, Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold of New Orleans, that estimates ranging from 70 million ounces of gold to as much as 200 million ounces at the Busang area of Indonesia may have been inflated because of invalid geologic sampling. 
 Last month, Freeport entered an agreement to become a partner of Bre-X and to build a $400 million mining complex, contingent on the results of its own analysis. Today the company said that it had drilled seven test holes and found "insignificant amounts of gold."
The announcements represent yet another twist in a tale with high political intrigue, fierce corporate power struggles, a mysterious fire and the strange death a week ago of the Bre-X executive directly responsible for estimating the amount of gold at Busang.
The expected reduction of gold estimates is considered evidence by some analysts that big mining companies, which had jockeyed for position to develop the Indonesian find with Bre-X, may have been taken in by a seemingly irresistible pitch.
Bre-X was not available to comment today, but as recently as Monday it stood behind its estimates.
The interest in Bre-X and its apparent gold strike went beyond just companies like Freeport-McMoran, Barrick Gold and Placer Dome to stock market investors, who have sent the value of Bre-X shares on a dizzying rise since the company began exploring at the Busang site, in the Indonesian region of Borneo, in 1993.
At that time, Bre-X shares sold for 30 cents, and the estimated amount of gold was one million ounces. The company's only real asset was its claim to Busang. But as the amount of gold thought to be there rose sharply, so did the value of the shares. At the height, Bre-X sold for $250. It was then split 10 for 1 and the value rose and fell on revised estimates of gold and continuing turmoil in securing the drilling rights from the Indonesian Government.
Today, trading of Bre-X stock was suspended on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and in the United States, where it is traded on Nasdaq. The shares closed on Tuesday at $15.50 (Canadian) in Toronto, and are expected to sink whenever trading resumes. On Nasdaq Tuesday, Bre-X shares closed at $11.375 (United States).
Trading in Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold was suspended today on the New York Stock Exchange for more than four hours. When it resumed, those shares fell $2.25, or 7.1 percent, to $29.625.
Freeport, whose stock listing is FCX, said in a statement today that the analysis of the core samples was not yet complete and that it would continue to study the site. But while the company was not immediately walking away from the project, it expressed clear doubts.
"FCX will elect to participate in the development of the Busang project only if development is, in FCX's opinion, economically feasible," the company said.
Trying to determine how much gold lies underground by drilling holes only a few inches wide is one of the riskiest parts of mineral exploration, and discrepancies often occur, experts said. Still, the possibility that what last month had been considered one of the greatest gold finds in history may now not be even economically feasible has left mining analysts shaking their heads in disbelief.
But the other companies involved in the contest to win a deal to develop the find denied they had been tricked. "We never discovered an evidence of wrongdoing," said Vincent Borg, a spokesman for Barrick Gold, the world's second-largest producer, which attempted a hostile takeover of Bre-X by aligning itself with members of the Indonesian ruling family before its efforts collapsed. "Having said that, we never completed our due diligence."
Hugh Leggatt, a spokesman for Placer Dome of Vancouver, which also struggled for a piece of Busang, said: "If we had had the opportunity to be involved, we would have insisted on our own due diligence. But we never got to visit the property."
After a struggle between the companies lasting months, Freeport and Bre-X in February worked out a deal. Freeport, which has 30 years' experience mining in Indonesia, was to control 15 percent of the Busang project and be sole operator of the mine, upon satisfactory completion of its own site examination.
Bre-X retained 45 percent of the project and the rest went to the Indonesian Government and local companies aligned with President Suharto and his associates.
Indications of Freeport's wariness became evident last week in an Indonesian business publication, which reported that after drilling its own test holes, Freeport discovered serious discrepancies with Bre-X findings from core samples taken over the last few years.
At the same time, the Bre-X geologist who had been one of the principal discoverers of the Indonesian field died in what seemed to be suspicious circumstances when he fell from a helicopter in an area near the Busang site.
Last week, trading in Bre-X stock was suspended for a time. Company officials vehemently denied there was any doubt about the authenticity of its gold strike and threatened to sue publications that reported unsubstantiated allegations.
Company officials also said the geologist who had died, Michael de Guzman, had taken his own life by jumping out of the helicopter because he had recently been told that he was suffering from an incurable disease. There were also reports from Indonesia that a fire in January destroyed much of his work.
"The company's board of directors has absolute confidence in the integrity and accuracy of assay results," Bre-X's chairman, David G. Walsh, said in a statement on Tuesday. "Unfortunately, when the first ounce of gold is poured at Busang, I am sure naysayers will complain about the color."
In apparent response to the doubts raised, Bre-X hired an independent Canadian mining consultant last week to scrutinize the company's findings. Today, that consultant, Strathcona Mineral Services, notified Bre-X that some of the existing samples were invalid, and recommended an extensive audit. Such an audit will take about a month, Bre-X officials said.
Despite all this, Bre-X continued to have its supporters. As late as Tuesday, a Toronto mining analyst sharply defended the company's findings. The analyst, Egizio Bianchini, of Nesbitt Burns of Toronto, attributed the discrepancies to a difference in the way Bre-X and Freeport handled core samples, rather than to any shortage of gold.
"The gold is there," he told a reporter from The Globe and Mail of Toronto.
Bre-X's own samples had been analyzed by Kilborn Pakar Rekayasa, a respected engineering division of the SNC-Lavalin Group of Montreal. In its latest resource calculation, dated Feb. 17, Kilborn estimated that there were at least 70.9 million ounces of gold at Busang. But the company did not do its own drilling.
A few days after Kilborn released that latest estimate, Bre-X officials said during a conference call to mining analysts that they were confident there would turn out to be around 200 million ounces of gold that could be easily extracted from the Indonesian jungle.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Wall Street Shifts Focus To Earnings

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Now that the Federal Reserve has raised its short-term interest rate target, Wall Street is turning its focus again to corporate earnings.
As the end of the first quarter approaches, though, small clouds are gathering around an earnings outlook that was already less than robust. 
 The dollar, which has risen 8 percent this year against the German mark and 7 percent against the Japanese yen, has already begun to eat into the profits of American multinationals.
And there are other concerns, such as pricing competition and wage pressures at home, slower economic growth in the United States and abroad, and fears that many large companies can no longer use restructuring to increase profitability.
"Earnings in 1997 will probably be weaker than people expect," said Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch. "Keep in mind, we're big bulls at Merrill. But we're seeing a slowing in the growth rate of earnings."
Industry analysts at Merrill Lynch -- those who follow individual companies -- are projecting that earnings of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will grow by about 17 percent this year. But Mr. Bernstein believes those estimates are "overly optimistic."
Even if the downgrades are not large, some fear that falling expectations would further disrupt a stock market that has been staggering in a trading range since the Dow industrials first reached the 7,000-point level in mid-February.
"There's a general malaise hanging over the market," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company. " Right now stocks are overvalued relative to bonds, and the strong dollar is not benefiting anyone."
Of course, there are those, like Abby Joseph Cohen at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who disagree with the weakening earnings scenario. Yet even Ms. Cohen concedes that slower growth in Europe could reduce her 10 percent earnings growth forecast to 7 percent.
And while Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, has not revised his forecast yet, he has begun to rethink his modest earnings growth expectation of about 7 percent because of worries about the strong dollar.
"It's a significant problem," said Mr. Wien, who has already forecast that the stock market will fall sharply later this year. "We're going to see some impact on first-quarter earnings. The companies that will be hit are the multinationals."
Earlier this year, I.B.M. said the stronger dollar was curbing its profits and just last week Eastman Kodak said that revenue in the first two months of this year was flat compared with last year, due in part to the strong dollar. Shares of both stocks plummeted on the news.
A strong dollar hurts profits two ways. It makes American exports more expensive abroad, which can reduce sales. And when those foreign sales are translated back into a stronger dollar at the end of a quarter, they are worth less.
Analysts of the technology sector, which has the largest foreign exposure, have also begun to worry about currency translations and weakening demand in Europe, two factors that have helped exacerbate an already ferocious drop in technology stocks this year.
In addition to the dollar, price competition -- as suggested by McDonald's recent decision to lower the price of selected items -- could also reduce earnings.
And if pricing competition does not eat up profits, strategists like Charles Clough at Merrill Lynch suggest that other factors will. Although real sales growth gained about 2 percent a year in the 1990's, he said that earnings had grown by about 16 percent a year, largely because of "restructuring" or downsizing. "But our belief is that that string is running out," he said.
 But Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs contends that the gloomy predictions are overstated, partly because a new formulation is at work in corporate America.
More than the strong dollar, she worries about a European economy that is in a "funk," burdened by unemployment and weak domestic activity. But those problems are offset, she said, by the fact that American companies are spread across the globe, including in countries where they benefit from a favorable currency exchange.
But even more important than the fact that many large companies hedge against bad times, Ms. Cohen said, is the fact that American products sold abroad often have a "value added" component.
"If you're selling steel, chemicals or newsprint, then your customers have options," she said. "But much of what we produce is value-added," such as Intel's pentium processor, which has few competitors in Europe and Japan.
"If we were going to see a significant dollar effect, we should have seen it in the fourth quarter," she said. "I think the surprise was that the dog didn't bark."
There are two ways of tracking earnings on Wall Street and both of them are slipping. "Bottom up" projections are based on analysts' estimates for individual companies while "top down" forecasts are made by strategists and economists using economic and industry figures to estimate overall earnings growth.
Traditionally, the "bottom up" and "top down" projections vary widely early in the year, with industry analysts more optimistic than market strategists. This year is no different. Industry analysts are projecting, on average, a 13.6 percent growth in earnings of the companies in the S.& P. 500, down from 14.4 percent a month ago. Top-down equity strategists are projecting 6.6 percent, down from 6.7 percent a month ago, according to First Call, which tracks earnings projections.
 But as the year progresses, the two forecasts get closer, usually with the bottom-up analysts reducing their forecasts, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call.
"The critical question is not whether the industry analysts lower their numbers, but will they lower them more than normal," Mr. Hill said. "But so far, no one is pushing the panic button."

Shares of Intel, surged nearly 6 percent, up 7 3/8, to 140 5/8. Cisco Systems, the most actively traded stock, rose 4 1/2, to 52 3/8, and Microsoft was up 315/16 , to 94 1/4. 
 The Dow rose 4.53 points, to 6,880.70, led by I.B.M., which rose 4 3/8, to 140 1/4, and was the biggest gainer in the index.
The Nasdaq 100 index -- which is heavily weighted with technology stocks -- surged 27.19 points, or 3.4 percent, to 834.38. It was the second-largest gain of the year for the Nasdaq 100, and the equivalent of a 234-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Along with the Nasdaq 100, the larger Nasdaq composite index also gained for the second consecutive session, up 21.02, or 1.7 percent, to 1,269.08, but was still well shy of its high of 1,388.06 on Jan. 22.
Yesterday's performance was the strongest for the Nasdaq since its Jan. 3 rally, when the Nasdaq 100 gained 4 percent. But since then, the Nasdaq, in general, and technology stocks, in particular, have been in their most serious downturn since last summer.
Networking stocks -- those that allow computers to talk to one another and log onto the Internet -- have been particularly hard hit this year, with some stocks falling by as much as 60 percent. But yesterday, two networking issues, in addition to Cisco, made strong gains. Shares of U. S. Robotics rose 3 3/8, to 59 7/8, and 3Com gained 2 1/8, to 35 1/2.
Technology stocks have been beaten down in recent weeks amid questions over whether profits would justify their high prices.
But the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase on Tuesday made the stocks of banks and big cyclical companies, so called because they ride the ups and downs of the economy, less attractive. Suddenly technology issues looked relatively cheap.
"Money managers are seeking out stocks that have been depressed," said Dan Ascani, president and research director at Global Market Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, Ga., adding that they still had a considerable amount of cash to invest before the first quarter ends on Monday.
Though computer stocks rose sharply, those of banks, for which profits are harder to come by when interest rates are going up, fell yesterday. Citicorp fell 2 1/8, to 113 5/8; Chase Manhattan dropped 1 7/8, to 99 7/8, and BankAmerica lost 2 3/4, to 109 1/4.
And basic-industry stocks that are vulnerable to an economic downturn were also losers. Du Pont was the biggest drag on the Dow, dropping 2 3/32, to 109 7/8.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-12 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 506.7 million shares as of 4 P.M., up from 487.5 million in the previous session.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.43 points, to 790.50. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index fell 0.04, to 415.37, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.09, to 583.07.
Stocks were lower early in the session after the Commerce Department reported an unexpectedly strong 1.5 percent increase in orders to factories for durable goods last month. The strong orders reinforced suspicions that Tuesday's increase in interest rates by the Fed would be the first of several intended to slow economic growth.

Orders for Durables Jump, A Sign of Stronger Growth
Showing unexpected strength, orders for durable goods jumped sharply again in February, suggesting that the economy was gaining momentum as it began its seventh year of expansion.
The increase, 1.5 percent, after January's 4.1 percent surge, lent after-the-fact support to the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates by one-quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent, to try to avert inflationary pressures. [Page D3.] 

Prices of Treasury securities slipped in response to the unexpectedly strong economic report and the weight of a fresh supply of Treasury debt. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rose to 6.98 percent from 6.96 percent. [D5.]
 
Technology Stocks in Rebound
Technology stocks rebounded strongly, sending the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest one-day gain in nearly six weeks -- 21.02 points, to 1,269.08 -- and lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 4.53 points, to 6,880.70. I.B.M. led the Dow, while on the Nasdaq, Intel and Microsoft surged. [D6.]
 
Plan on Data-Scrambling Rejected
The leading industrial nations have declined to embrace a United States proposal for computer-privacy technology that would allow eavesdropping by the world's law-enforcement agencies. The decision is a setback for the Clinton Administration, which had attempted to limit the private use of such data-scrambling equipment, and demonstrates the difficulty of setting global policies for the Internet. [A1.]
 
Hearst to Create TV Company
In a deal that furthers the consolidation of the television broadcasting business, Hearst said that it would buy Argyle Television, a San Antonio-based owner of six stations, for $320 million. Hearst said it would combine its six stations with Argyle's and create a public company, Hearst-Argyle Television. [D2.]
 
Plea of No Contest in Fraud
John G. Bennett Jr., the man accused of cheating universities and charities of more than $100 million through his New Era Philanthropy, pleaded no contest to Federal charges of fraud and money laundering. [D17.]
 
Swiss Companies to Plead Guilty
Two Swiss chemical companies, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Jungbunzlauer, have agreed to plead guilty and pay a combined $25 million in criminal fines for participating in the citric acid price-fixing scheme that also involved Archer Daniels Midland, the Justice Department said. [D8.]
 
Food Giants Pick Ad Agencies
Domino's Pizza, Long John Silver's Restaurants and Quaker Oats -- which together have advertising accounts with billings estimated at nearly $200 million -- all changed agencies. The highest billings involved the national account of Domino's, for which it chose Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis to handle the creative duties and J. Walter Thompson USA to handle media.
Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]
 
F.T.C. Staff Cites Joe Camel
The F.T.C. staff wants the commission to lodge a complaint of unfair advertising against R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, charging that its Joe Camel advertisements are intended to lure children into smoking. [B14.]
 
Sanctions Against D. H. Blair
The D. H. Blair brokerage firm was censured and fined $250,000 for failing to supervise brokers who had prompted complaints because of their high-pressure sales tactics, the New York Stock Exchange said. [D6.]
 
Costs Hurt Deutsche Bank Earnings
Deutsche Bank said that it set aside 1.2 billion marks, or $710 million, last year to reimburse customers and pay potential fines arising from the irregularities by a fund manager at a subsidiary. The bank said the costs had reduced its 1996 profit. [D16.]
 
47th Street Photo Is Closed
47th Street Photo, a landmark name in New York electronics retailing for 30 years and a pioneer discounter, has closed, laid off its work force and may not reopen. [B1.]

HEADLINE: Criticizing Giuliani, Council Proposes a New Budget Strategy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The City Council's leadership staked out its first bargaining position yesterday in negotiations over the next budget, asserting that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's spending plan lacked imagination and underestimated the growth in tax revenues from Wall Street by $516 million.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said at a news conference that the city should spend $120 million of that windfall on parks, libraries, cultural institutions and other programs, while squirreling away $225 million in a new rainy day fund. Mr. Vallone also called for $45 million in tax cuts for small businesses that create high-technology jobs in industries like software. 
 That reduction would be in addition to $123 million in tax cuts that the Speaker proposed earlier this year.
The Council also proposed that the city begin paying for repairs for water pipes that break between the street and a homeowner's water meter. Until now, homeowners have borne the cost of such work. The Council said the city should assess all water users an extra fee, which would be less than $2 per user annually, to cover the additional expense.
Last year, about 550 such breaks occurred, costing homeowners an average of $3,000 each for repairs, officials said.
Besides those initiatives, the Council leadership did not take issue with much of Mr. Giuliani's preliminary $34 billion budget, including hundreds of millions in cuts at city agencies. And the Council made few proposals to address criticism that the city is not using enough of the taxes from strong profits on Wall Street to solve its long-term budget problems.
The city faces projected deficits in 2000 and 2001 of more than $3 billion annually. The 1998 fiscal year begins on July 1.
Mr. Vallone, a Queens Democrat, said at a news conference that the Council leadership's plans would invigorate the city. He maintained that the proposal to cut taxes for small business involved in high technology showed that the Council was looking toward the future. The Mayor's budgetary priorities, he said, were rooted in the past.
"There is no strategy, no vision in that budget to propel us into the next century," Mr. Vallone said.
Mr. Giuliani defended his fiscal management, saying that in the first three years of his tenure, the number of private sector jobs in the city had jumped by more than 120,000. He said he would examine the Council's initiatives, but he complained about what he said were partisan jibes by Mr. Vallone.
The Republican administration and the Democratic majority on the Council will continue to spar over fiscal policy until May, when Mr. Giuliani presents his final, or executive, budget. If the past is any guide, the Council leadership will extract a few changes from the Mayor before approving the budget in June.

HEADLINE: Standard & Poor's Threatens to Move Jobs to New Jersey

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation, a fixture of New York City's financial industry, is threatening to move 2,000 jobs to a new waterfront office tower in New Jersey if the Giuliani administration does not grant the company special tax breaks and other incentives to remain in lower Manhattan, according to real estate executives and city officials.
Standard & Poor's, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, is seeking to consolidate its bond rating agency and financial information services under a single roof. The company is considering moving to either Jersey City or a 900,000-square-foot space at 55 Water Street, a bulky, concrete tower on the East River near Wall Street. 
 Standard & Poor's now occupies space at 25, 26 and 65 Broadway.
Standard & Poor's is only the latest corporation to engage in the high-stakes game of threatening corporate relocation to try to gain tax and other financial concessions as states compete for jobs and landlords compete for tenants.
Like Dillon, Read; the American International Group; PaineWebber, and ING Capital, S.&P. has looked into abandoning the city for less expensive offices in New Jersey or Connecticut -- all while pressing New York City for tax breaks. Standard & Poor's has talked to the developers of Newport City, a vast complex on the waterfront in Jersey City, about building a new tower for its operations, and possibly, for some units of McGraw-Hill.
"This is not a situation where McGraw-Hill is threatening to move," one person involved in the negotiations said. "They have an important business, Standard & Poor's, that has a space problem downtown. The solution is either 55 Water or move to New Jersey."
McGraw-Hill declined to discuss whether its Standard & Poor's division would move to 55 Water Street or to New Jersey. "We do have some leases expiring in 1998 and 1999, so we are reviewing our space allocations," said Neal Allen, a spokesman for McGraw-Hill.
Buoyed by the robust financial markets, revenues at McGraw-Hill's financial services division, which includes Standard & Poor's, rose 8 percent last year from 1995, while operating income advanced 13.5 percent, to $262.1 million. A spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which negotiates with corporations threatening to leave New York, would not comment on "negotiations that may or may not be taking place."
But there is little doubt that Standard & Poor's is awaiting word from City Hall before it makes a final decision, sometime in April, according to brokers active in the downtown office market.
"Standard & Poor's is one of several major transactions in lower Manhattan that appears close to reality," said Joseph F. Harkins, a director of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate broker. "Fifty-five Water Street is one of only a few candidates that could accommodate them."
As the city's economy has rebounded from a recession in the early 1990's, city officials have tried to take a tougher stand in negotiating what they call "corporate retention packages." In calculating whether a company is bluffing about a move out of New York and how attractive a deal to offer, city officials take into account that the office vacancy rate on the New Jersey waterfront and in Stamford, Conn., has dropped considerably in recent years, leaving few options other than costly new construction.
Nevertheless, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey pushed a series of bills through the Legislature in 1996 that were designed to entice companies from New York by offering a range of incentives including a rebate of up to 80 percent of the state income tax paid by employees.
But determining the sincerity of a corporation's intentions, in Manhattan or in New Jersey, is often difficult for any landlord or public official. Richard Lefrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, confirmed that Standard & Poor's had looked into building a new office building at his Newport City project in Jersey City. "They and everybody else in the market in lower Manhattan is considering a building at Newport," Mr. Lefrak said. "I can't tell you what's on their mind. A lot of people come out, kick the tires and then go back to New York to negotiate a deal. But New Jersey does have a very powerful incentive program."
So does New York. In 1995, the Giuliani administration created a general series of tax breaks and zoning changes for lower Manhattan aimed at resuscitating a seriously ailing real estate market. Nearly a quarter of all office floors below Chambers Street sat empty, a victim of layoffs and the recession of the early 1990's. City officials had hoped that the downtown plan would eliminate the need to negotiate a tailor-made deal for each company threatening to flee to the suburbs.
But over the last two decades, it has become the norm for a corporation to threaten to leave the city whenever its current leases expire. Some companies have left, while others got millions of dollars in tax breaks to stay in Manhattan.
With its high vacancy rate, real estate brokers and city officials acknowledge, 55 Water, the largest privately owned office building in New York, has served as a "stalking horse" for companies seeking concessions from the city or a landlord.
But real estate brokers now say that Chubb LifeAmerica, Reliance, IBJ Schroder and Standard & Poor's are seriously negotiating to lease space at 55 Water because there are few alternative locations for large blocks of space, the rental rates are low relative to midtown and because the landlord has refurbished the building.

HEADLINE: NAMING OF ENVOYS SLOWS TO A CRAWL

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
A leading candidate for ambassador to France has withdrawn, tired of waiting for the call from the White House. There is no American ambassador in important countries, like Russia, Japan and Germany. And many top jobs under Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright await appointees.
Two months into President Clinton's second term, the selection of the senior diplomatic corps has bogged down, a victim of White House indecision caused in part by the furor over campaign financing. 
 With the Administration under scrutiny for the favors that it may or may not have granted donors to last year's Presidential campaign, White House lawyers are scrutinizing the backgrounds of potential nominees for anything that might drag Mr. Clinton into a new controversy.
The awarding of ambassadorships has always been a game of spoils, with choice posts often going to top contributors, but now politics has further intruded, sowing confusion and anxiety. And it has left some prospective appointees hanging, with jobs, businesses and reputations on the line as Mr. Clinton makes up his mind and the lawyers make sure that his decisions create no new headaches.
Now the process appears to have claimed its first victim: Frank G. Wisner, the Ambassador to India and one of the nation's most respected career diplomats, has withdrawn from consideration to be ambassador to France, a senior Administration official said today.
Mr. Wisner, along with Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker from New York, was considered a top contender to replace Pamela Harriman, who died on Feb. 5.
But he informed President Clinton and Secretary Albright last week that he would leave the Foreign Service and take a job with American International Group, the insurance company, the official said. (The official added that it would be wrong to assume that Mr. Wisner's withdrawal would guarantee the post for Mr. Rohatyn.)
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Wisner had personal reasons to step down now. But a close friend of his said today that Mr. Wisner simply could not wait any longer for Mr. Clinton's decision. Mr. Wisner, who recently returned to New Delhi after a visit to the United States, could not be reached for comment tonight.
The embassy in Paris is only one of 14 with no ambassadors, and dozens of others are expected to open when the current ambassadors rotate out this summer.
"The system has lost common sense," said one person under consideration for an appointment, who, despite having clearance to see some of the country's top secrets, still faces an arduous background check by the White House. "Everybody is so afraid of scandal."
Richard N. Haass, the director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, said the delays in appointing people to the senior diplomatic posts -- not to mention the hurdle of Senate confirmation -- could hamper Mr. Clinton's foreign policy initiatives.
"By the time you get people named, vetted and through the confirmation process, you'll be lucky to get people into place by the summer, many by the fall," he said. In that case "you've lost most of the year, which traditionally is the best year for foreign policy in a second term."
For her part, Ms. Albright said delays in appointments would not affect the State Department's work. She noted that many top officials, like Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, are staying on, and that even vacant embassies have capable chiefs of mission serving in lieu of ambassadors.
"Obviously it would be better if we had everybody in place," Ms. Albright said in a telephone interview the other day. "But we're doing fine now."
Some officials play down any delay by noting that prolonged jockeying for foreign policy posts is not new to Mr. Clinton's Administration.
But in the two months since Ms. Albright became Secretary, the President has announced only two members of her team: Thomas R. Pickering, another respected career diplomat who retired from the Foreign Service last year, as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was domestic policy adviser to President Carter and is now an Under Secretary of Commerce, as Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
But at least a dozen more of Ms. Albright's choices were sent to the White House for approval more than a month ago and remain in the vetting process, White House and State Department officials said.
Among them, the officials said, is Ms. Albright's choice to be Under Secretary of State for Management, Bonnie R. Cohen, who is now serving as an Assistant Secretary at the Interior Department.
Ms. Albright has also tapped a number of Assistant Secretaries, including Susan Rice, a National Security Council director, for African Affairs; Stanley O. Roth, a former National Security Council director, for East Asian Affairs; K. F. Inderfurth, the deputy representative at the United Nations, for South Asian Affairs, and Marc Grossman, Ambassador to Turkey, for Canadian and European Affairs.
In other important posts, she has selected David R. Andrews, a lawyer who was previously deputy general counsel at Health and Human Services, to be her legal adviser, and James P. Rubin, to serve as the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.
Decisions appear to have been made on a number of ambassadorships as well, including James F. Collins, the State Department's special adviser for the former nations of the Soviet Union, to Russia, and John Kornblum, the Assistant Secretary for Canadian and European Affairs, to Germany.
None of these appointees appear to be in danger, but in Washington's hyperpartisan mood these days, the White House is taking nothing for granted.
"People are very careful right now in ways that they haven't been in the past," a White House official said.

Campaign Furor Slows Hiring of Top Diplomats
Frank G. Wisner, one of the nation's most respected career diplomats, withdrew from consideration to be Ambassador to France. A friend said he was tired of waiting for the White House to make its choice. The Paris job is one of many top diplomatic posts that have gone unfilled as the White House has reacted to accusations of favoritism toward donors by scrutinizing its nominees closely for any controversy.

U.S. Expels Belarus Diplomat
The United States expelled a Belarus diplomat from Washington, retaliating for the "unwarranted" ouster of an American diplomat who was monitoring an anti-Government march in Minsk. A9
 
Yeltsin Defends Finland Summit
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia defended his conciliatory stance on NATO expansion and said President Clinton had promised at the Helsinki summit that Russia would become a member of the G-7 -- something that Washington is likely to dispute. His Government prepared for a nationwide strike that unions and his opponents have called for today. A5
 
Riots Spread in West Bank
Riots spread to the West Bank town of Ramallah as Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers clashed for the seventh consecutive day. Dennis Ross, the special United States envoy to the Middle East, met the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, in Morocco and was expected to arrive in Jerusalem today. A6
 
Top German Rejects Turkey
Klaus Kinkel, the Foreign Minister of Germany, told Turkish leaders in Ankara that although Turkey "belongs to Europe," the country's record on everything from human rights to the economy made its entry into the European Union impossible for the foreseeable future. Membership in the Union is Turkey's foremost foreign policy goal, and some fear that rejection will fan Islamist sentiment. A13
 
Few Heed Haiti Strike
Stores stayed shut in downtown Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, and the windows of some cars were broken in a shantytown. But most Haitians ignored a call by opposition groups for a general strike against the Government. Protesters want Prime Minister Rosny Smarth to resign and the Government to halt a program of economic measures supported by the United States and the International Monetary Fund. (AP)
 
Malaysia Irked by Singapore
Malaysia suspended business and political ties with neighboring Singapore in the latest diplomatic dispute between the two countries. The quarrel started when Singapore's leader, Lee Kuan Yew, made disparaging remarks about a Malaysian state where a rival politician fled after accusing Mr. Lee of engineering his defeat in a January parliamentary vote. A Singapore Government spokesman refused to comment. (AP)

Apparent Mass Suicide Found in California
At least 39 young men were found dead at an estate north of San Diego, the apparent victims of a mass suicide. No note or signs of trauma were found, and the men were lying on their backs with their hands at their sides but not in any particular pattern, the authorities said. Neighbors said the house had been used for meetings of a religious cult. A1
 
Bills Swamp the Democrats
Democratic Party officials said debts of $14.4 million and projected legal bills of $4 million more in the next year had placed the party in its most precarious financial position in decades. Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the party's general chairman, said it was spending much of its time responding to subpoenas. A1
 
Flaw Seen in TV Ratings
The new ratings system for television shows may actually attract children to violent or sexually explicit programs, a study found. A researcher called it the "forbidden fruit syndrome." But the study did not explicitly examine the TV system. A22
 
Hispanic Population Grows
Hispanic people will surpass blacks as the nation's largest minority by 2005, and will account for one-quarter of the population by 2050, a census report said. It cited high fertility and immigration rates among Hispanic people. B16
 
Joe Camel Faces New Threat
Officials said the staff of the Federal Trade Commission was seeking to have the agency lodge an unfair-advertising complaint against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The complaint would charge that the company's Joe Camel advertisements were designed to lure children into smoking. B14
 
Hepatitis Cases Rising
Hepatitis C, a usually stealthy, blood-borne liver infection, will triple its annual death rate among Americans to 24,000 by the year 2017, a panel of experts said. A21

Moynihan Warns City On Governors Island Plan
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said President Clinton had offered to turn Governors Island over to New York City for use as a public resource. But he warned that the city was jeopardizing the offer by "dithering" over a plan for the island's future. A1
 
Toxic Materials Found
Detectives investigating a report of credit card fraud discovered a store of hazardous materials at a house in Queens. One metal canister was marked "Sarin Gas," the name of the powerful nerve gas used in a terrorist attack in the Tokyo subway in March 1995. Officials said they did not know if the canister actually contained the nerve gas. B1
 
Pataki Takes Center on Rent
Governor Pataki acknowledged that he supported eliminating rent limits on apartments that become vacant. It was his most specific statement on the subject since becoming Governor, and placed him in the middle ground on the issue of repealing rent laws. B6
 
More Powerful Pepper Spray
The New York City police said they would switch to a more powerful form of pepper spray to subdue violent suspects more easily. Critics said the department should have sought public review first. B3

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Mayor, Profile Low, Rides High in Election Polls

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 26

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, in the sole face-to-face encounter of their desultory contest to be Mayor of Los Angeles, State Senator Tom Hayden repeatedly derided his popular incumbent opponent, Richard J. Riordan, as "an invisible man" and "an invisible Mayor," unfit to be "the leader of a global city."
"Newsweek magazine said the Mayor of San Francisco, New York, Laredo mattered," Mr. Hayden, the 1960's radical, said in the mid-day campaign debate. (It was carried live on only one cable station, in Santa Monica.) "The Mayor of Los Angeles did not make the list in Newsweek. We need to have a mayor who matters, who represents neighborhoods against downtown special interests." 
 Indeed, two weeks away from probable re-election, Mr. Riordan stands as something of a paradox. He is a moderate Republican with broad bipartisan support who has presided over an economic rebound that would be the envy of many an aging metropolis, yet his public profile is much lower than those of big-city counterparts like Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York and Richard M. Daley of Chicago.
"It's not my personal style," he said in a relaxed interview in his City Hall office this week, recalling with a bit of amused envy a particularly vivid encounter he witnessed between Mr. Daley and Chicago reporters. "I'd like it to be. It would make it more fun, I think."
There are reasons for Mr. Riordan's comparative obscurity. Under its charter, Los Angeles has a weaker mayoralty than most Eastern cities, and the county is responsible for many of the biggest programs, from welfare to physical planning, that New York City, for example, oversees itself. The greater city is broken up by independent enclaves: Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, West Hollywood. And there is no tradition of colorful mayors like La Guardia, Curley, Daley or Koch.
But a big part of the equation is the phlegmatic Mr. Riordan himself. He built a $100 million fortune as what he calls a "transactional lawyer" and an investor in corporate buyouts before winning the mayoralty in his first run for elective office four years ago, and whatever his protests to the contrary, he seems content to be just who he is, a distinctly unpolitical politician.
"I wonder why a lot of people want a job as mayor or something who are totally incapable of doing the job," Mr. Riordan said, in what appeared to be a dig at his opponent. "And I think too often they figure the title defines them rather than what they do. And you know, to me, I just decided I'm going to be myself. You go into a room and people are cheering and you just figure, 'O.K., Dick, everybody in that room is just as important to God as you are.' "
A devout Roman Catholic, Mr. Riordan has given millions of dollars to educational charities, built a chapel in the backyard of his estate in the Brentwood section and works as mayor for $1 a year. At 66, he is an avid bicyclist and skater. A no-nonsense administrator who awoke the morning of the 1994 earthquake, put on a sweat suit and drove himself to City Hall, he presides over a monthly book group that reads works by Andre Gide, Graham Greene and Alvin Toffler.
"The Mayor does not talk about himself much," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian, author of a multi-volume social history of the state and a longtime friend. "If anything, he's almost oblique and diffident about talking about himself and the exercise of power and government. It's not the way he works. He works as a negotiator, a mediator, a lawyer."
The Mayor's critics contend that is part of the problem. They paint Mr. Riordan as too cozy with his developer friends, blame him for costly mistakes and delays in construction of a new subway system, and accuse him of working behind the scenes to successfully block the renewal of the contract of the city's police chief, Willie Williams -- all without adequate explanation to the public.
Like his fellow Princeton graduate, Jimmy Stewart, Mr. Riordan is a shy and stammering public presence, a stop-and-start speaker who routinely steps on his lines and freely acknowledged in an interview that he had lost his train of thought as a sentence trailed off unfinished.
But it is a style that most Angelenos seem to like, and the Mayor enjoys a 20-percentage-point lead in the popularity polls over his Democratic challenger, Mr. Hayden, although neither's party affiliation will be on the April 8 primary ballot. Mr. Riordin is favored to win a majority and avoid a runoff with the second-place finisher in the field of five.
On Tuesday, Mr. Riordan's longtime friend Senator Dianne Feinstein became the latest in a long line of Democrats, prominent liberals, Hispanics, blacks and Hollywood figures to endorse him.
"Frankly, there have not been any direct areas that potential opponents could zero in on, and it's clear that his current opponent is having a hard time," said Joe Hicks, the former head of the Los Angeles branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who now runs the Multicultural Collaborative, a private civil rights group. He praised the Mayor's decision to double the budget of the city's human rights agency, even as he said Mr. Riordan needed to speak out more on civil rights in the most diverse county in the nation.
"There needs to be stronger leadership from the Mayor in that regard, but it is clear to me that his heart is in the right place," Mr. Hicks said. "Hayden finds it hard stirring up antipathy because Riordan has not really angered people by doing bone-headed kinds of things."
But in one sense, Mr. Riordan has paid for his low profile: While Los Angeles has roughly double the job-growth rate of New York (1.8 percent last year, compared with eight-tenths of 1 percent for New York), and its unemployment rate is about 7.5 percent compared with nearly 10 percent for New York, Los Angeles draws less national attention.
The Mayor led a successful fight to consolidate the city and county offices responsible for issuing film permits, streamlining the process and prompting an increase in filming on location. In the last three years, 60,000 new entertainment industry jobs have been created in Los Angeles County.
Still, Joel Kotkin, a fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu and an expert on the Los Angeles economy, said: "Riordan has been a very poor politician relative to the City Council. He has not been able to make strong personal relationships with other politicians, he's not a good communicator."
Mr. Riordan amiably challenges such criticism; to suggestions that he might speak out more often, he asks: "Where? To whom? I talk to everybody all around the city, two or three times a week." Indeed he does, in informal settings. But he has adopted the front-runner's standard strategy of ducking more debates with Mr. Hayden, who has taken to carrying around a cardboard cutout of the Mayor and mocking him as "a dollar-a-year man."
The Mayor takes it in stride. "I said he could come up with a better line, like, 'He's being paid what he's worth!' " Mr. Riordan said.

HEADLINE: In Plan to Cut L.I. Utility Rates, Biggest Savings Come Early

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26

 BODY:
The state's plan to lower Long Island's electric rates delivers the greatest savings to consumers in the first few years, beginning as Gov. George E. Pataki campaigns for re-election next year. To do so, it raises the cost to consumers by more than $1 billion during the next 30 years.
The two Long Island Power Authority officials who set up the financing, a Republican and a Democrat, insisted that politics did not enter into their decision, and that the Pataki administration did not push for a particular approach. But they acknowledged that at the very least, the timing of the deep rate reductions, including one-time rebate checks to Long Islanders during an election year, is fortunate for Mr. Pataki. 
 "I expect someone will suggest a connection, but it's not true," said Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the power authority, a Republican appointed by Mr. Pataki. "This is as much a Democratic plan as a Republican plan." Aides to the Governor had referred questions about the financing to Mr. Zarb.
The accord announced last week calls for the authority to sell $7 billion in bonds to pay for a LIPA takeover of much of the Long Island Lighting Company's debts and assets. By refinancing Lilco's debts at lower interest rates, the authority would be able to save money and lower the Island's electric rates, the highest in the continental United States. The deal still needs the approval of state and Federal regulators.
Over the long run, officials say, the takeover will lower rates an average of 16 percent, and the pending merger of Lilco and the Brooklyn Union Gas Company will save 2 percent more.
But to give deep rate cuts right away, up to 23 percent, the plan calls for borrowing more than is needed for the takeover, and it postpones repayment for a few years, strategies that increase the long-term cost of borrowing by well over $1 billion. Compared with spreading the savings evenly over 30 years, the accord gives consumers an extra 5 percent savings in the first three years, but the savings are 2.4 percent less than they would have been for most of the next three decades.
"We're trying to get Long Island competitive again right away, to jump-start things," said Richard M. Kessel, a Democrat named to the power authority board by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who worked closely with Mr. Zarb in designing the takeover. "And I believe that all of the ratepayers are entitled to something up front for all the years of overpayment."
In Nassau County and the Rockaways, Queens, each residential and business customer will receive a $232 rebate check next year. In Suffolk County, every customer will receive a $101 rebate check.
But consumer advocates attacked the plan as financial gimmickry. "This is the type of proposal that would be suggested by the Mayor on 'The Simpsons,' and then would be wildly cheered by the ignorant townspeople," said Larry Shapiro, senior staff attorney at the New York Public Interest Research Group.
On the largest bond issue of $4.3 billion, the power authority would pay interest but no principal in the first three years. On another issue of $462.5 million, it would pay neither principal nor interest for the first five years. Both strategies inflate the long-term interest costs.
The $462.5 million bond sale is intended only to pay for a one-time customer rebate and rate reduction during the next five years, not to finance the buyout. That bond sale would be repaid only by Suffolk customers.
In other words, the power authority would borrow money, give it to consumers, and then charge consumers slightly higher rates for 25 years to repay the debt. Whether it is better for the ratepayer to get the savings right away at a long-term cost, is, to some extent, a matter of opinion. It is akin to lottery winners having a choice between a lump-sum payment or annual payments for many years. If the balance between the two is right, it might be a wash, but that depends in part on future economic conditions that no one can predict.
The rebate checks would go out next year, in the thick of the gubernatorial race. It was Mr. Kessel, the Democrat, who insisted on rebates, he and Mr. Zarb said.
"Ratepayers move, they die," he said. "We wanted to give money to the same people who've been overpaying all these years."
Nassau County ratepayers will get larger rebates than those in Suffolk County, as part of a tax dispute settlement between Suffolk and Lilco. The alternative to rebates, officials said, would have been to give Nassau much lower electric rates than Suffolk, which they said would have hurt Suffolk's economic competitiveness.
Mr. Zarb argued that making the deepest rate cuts right away would put pressure on Lilco and the state to find ways to keep rates low, like developing solar technology. "We need to have a lot of heat and pressure to keep it going," he said.

HEADLINE: Queens Home Yields Cache Of Chemicals

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
The police last night arrested a Queens man after discovering dozens of containers of hazardous materials at his home yesterday afternoon. One canister was marked "Sarin Gas," but officials said they did not know if it actually contained the powerful nerve gas used in a terrorist attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995.
As a precaution, more than 200 people were evacuated from the area around the house at 241-05 52d Avenue, in the Douglaston section. 
 Officials said the canister would be tested by the Department of Defense sometime today. The police reported that in the house, they had also found more 200 gallons of flammable liquids including gasoline, lacquers, jet fuel, ether and nitro-methane.
Based on those findings, the owner of the house, Lester E. Deily, 52, was arrested at the 111th Precinct station house on charges of reckless endangerment, the police said. Officials said that during questioning he had told the police that the canister did not contain any sarin gas.
Neighbors described Mr. Deily as a lifelong chemistry buff and a loner who lived in the same house where he had been raised by his grandparents.
At a news conference at the scene early this morning, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said Mr. Deily had told investigators that the canister contained only oxygen and that the label on it was a joke. But the Mayor said officials would take no chances.
"At this point, in order to be safe, we have to treat it as if it is sarin gas," Mr. Giuliani said.
"That's why all these precautions are being taken, because we don't know whether we can believe this person or we can't."
One law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that two other containers in the house were marked "radioactive" but that tests had revealed no signs of radioactivity.
Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Deily had ordered $69,000 worth of chemicals and scientific equipment from the Hewlett-Packard company but had not paid his bill, and that the police were led to Mr. Deily by two Hewlett-Packard employees who went to his home yesterday afternoon and became suspicious when they saw a number of chemical containers.
By midafternoon, police, Fire Department and environmental emergency workers had surrounded the house and had started to search through the dozens of containers, none larger than five gallons.
"The house has been described as an overpacked -- for those of you who remember the phrase -- Collier's mansion," said Chief of Department Louis R. Anemone, referring to a famous house that was found crammed with newspapers.
At about 7:30 P.M., the police found a .83-liter silver canister in the basement marked with a homemade label that read "sarin gas." Next to it was a canister marked "compressed air." At that point, Mr. Giuliani said, the search was called off.
Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Deily had been convicted of a harassment charge in New Jersey five years ago for making threatening telephone calls.
Neighbors said Mr. Deily was a car enthusiast who had been restoring an old Mercedes and Jaguar. Investigators said they believed that Mr. Deily was using some of the fuel found at his home in that hobby.
But officials last night said last night that they were most concerned over the possible presence of sarin, the degenerative nerve gas that killed 12 people and injured thousands when it was released by an apocalyptic cult in the Tokyo subway in 1995.
Police officials said they were not qualified to test the canister for the nerve gas and last night were awaiting a special airtight container from the Department of Defense officials to transport the canister to a Police Department firing range in the Bronx.
At 11:15 P.M., officials began evacuating residents from about 100 homes in the leafy neighborhood near Douglaston Parkway.
Deputy Inspector Michael Collins, another police spokesman, described the metal canister as approximately one-liter in size and affixed with a homemade label saying "sarin" that appeared to have been printed on a computer.
Inside the three-story house, investigators found tools, chemicals, generators and extension cords, Sergeant Cory Cuneo, a department spokesman, said. Investigators found the house to be extremely neat, he said. Late last night, emergency workers were preparing a police robot to conduct a further search of the house by remote control.
Lee Anne Rothstein, 30, an unemployed teacher who often walks her dog around the quiet leafy neighborhood, said that Mr. Deily was a recluse who inherited his house from his grandparents and rarely left it.
"He was quiet and kind of eccentric," she said. "I don't think he held a job."
"He was constantly throwing out garbage in big black plastic trash bags wrapped in duct tape," she added. "It would sit in the front of the driveway for weeks."
Another neighbor, Hank Brehl, 51, said Mr. Deily had moved to the Douglaston with his grandparents at the age of 10 and that he and Mr. Deily had gone to Public School 98, Junior High School 67 and Bayside High School together.
"He was always into chemistry sets," Mr. Brehl said. "He was always making little mixtures of gun powder."

Man Steals a Bus

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: WINSLOW

 BODY:
An unemployed Egg Harbor man stole a New Jersey Transit bus from a garage in Orange yesterday, made a few passenger stops, then headed toward Atlantic County before he was chased and arrested, the authorities said.
"He actually picked up two people and he drove them to their destination, dropped them off and then came down the Garden State Parkway," said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for N.J. Transit. 
The suspect, David Middleton, 34, drove out of the garage unnoticed just after 5 A.M. amid the 139 other buses that depart starting at 4:30 A.M., Mr. Coleman said.
He was eventually pulled over after a New Jersey Transit mechanic spotted the bus on the parkway, where buses are not allowed.
Mr. Middleton was charged with receiving stolen property and eluding the police and is being held on $25,000 bail, Detective Frederico said. Officials were checking whether he had ever worked as a bus driver, Mr. Coleman said.

HEADLINE: With Questionable Future, 47th St. Photo Closes Doors

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A landmark name in New York electronics retailing for 30 years, 47th Street Photo, has closed down, laid off its work force and may not reopen.
"We're re-evaluating our position," said Stuart Held, the president of Tut Services Inc., which has been doing business as 47th Street Photo since 1995 under a licensing agreement. Mr. Held said he closed the Manhattan store and its mail-order sales department "several weeks ago," when a number of issues, most notably whether his company would be able to continue using the 47th Street name, became uncertain. He said he expected a resolution of the issue, with a final closing, or another phoenixlike re-emergence of the once thriving company, within the next few weeks. 
 "Our condition right now is a wait-and-see attitude," Mr. Held said in an interview. "It has to do with whether we can make money in the business, and the raising of funds."
Beginning in 1967, 47th Street Photo helped pioneer the idea of discount consumer electronics retailing in New York. Through the 1970's and 1980's, as chains like Crazy Eddie and Nobody Beats the Wiz exploded onto the scene, 47th Street Photo maintained its own distinctive New York flavor. It was noisy, hectic -- and because of its largely Orthodox Jewish work force -- always closed on Saturdays.
The company stumbled, along with many other consumer electronics chains, during the economic downturn of the early 1990's, when the razor-thin margins of the business got squeezed to the brink by a falloff in demand. At its peak, the old company had five locations and more than 300 employees. When the current company closed earlier this month, only 39 workers were left and one location, which was not even on 47th Street, but on West 45th Street. The 47th Street store was closed in the early 1990's.
The company's original owners filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law in 1992 and are not involved in the company's current incarnation.
Mr. Held, a former employee of the old company, and his brother Ira, backed by an Israeli manufacturer, the Tutnauer Company, licensed the rights to the 47th Street name and its West 45th Street lease for $2 million in 1995.
A lawyer for the creditors committee in the bankruptcy case, Ted A. Berkowitz, said the central issue now was whether Tut Services was still able to make its payments on the licensing agreement. If the company defaults, he said, the name would revert back to the bankruptcy trustee and would probably be licensed to another store operator. "I think the name still has value," Mr. Berkowitz said.
When the Held brothers took over the 47th Street name, they announced an aggressive comeback plan, including expansion into new locations, a public stock offering and a push toward retailing on the Internet. Mr. Held said that if the company did reopen, he still hoped to sell stock perhaps later this year.
Hopes are also still alive, he said, for a new 47th Street Photo at a mall now under construction near Fortunoff's store in Westbury, L.I.
Retailing analysts said consumer electronics -- one of the most cyclical of industries because so much of its fate is tied to innovations, constantly revolutionized technology and consumer fads -- suffered nearly everywhere in the country in 1996.
"Things tapered off because consumers had all the consumer electronics products they needed and there were no exciting new products," said John Hughes, a retailing analyst at Piper Jaffray Inc.
A question for 47th Street Photo's future, whether it survives under the current management or not, is what effect its closing might have customer faith. The company has maintained a "satisfactory" rating with the Better Business Bureau since its ownership change. But the current bureau report also notes that the only two complaints received since 1995 came this year.
A longtime customer, H. C. Peterson of San Francisco, said he was concerned about not being able to get through to even ask a question. Mr. Peterson said that he ordered a $666 camera lens from 47th Street Photo in early February and that his credit card shows that amount charged, but still he has no lens.
When he called several weeks ago, he was told by a salesman that the manufacturer was experiencing delays. More recently, Mr. Peterson said, every fax and phone number has resulted in a dead end.
"It didn't strike me that a renovation should make you shut down all your phone lines," Mr. Peterson said.

HEADLINE: U.S. of Future: Grayer and More Hispanic

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
A new report by the Census Bureau documents explosive growth in the nation's Hispanic population and projects that by the year 2005, Hispanic Americans will surpass blacks as the country's largest minority.
And by the year 2050, the report says, they will outnumber the nation's total of blacks, Asian-Americans and American Indians combined, and will account for one-fourth of the population, up from 10.7 percent now. 
 The long-term rise in the number of Hispanic people, who have the nation's highest fertility and immigration rates, will coincide with a decline in that of non-Hispanic whites, says the report, which projects that by 2028, the number of white Americans who die will exceed those being born.
The report, "Demographic State of the Nation," gives a picture of a generally healthy current national economy, with an increase in median household income, a significant drop in the number of people living in poverty and a rising level of education. But there are still significant differences among the races and between the sexes, and some discouraging circumstances for children.
In 1995, the base year for most of the statistics cited in the study, children under 18 still accounted for a vast segment of those living in poverty, about 40 percent, even though they made up only about 25 percent of the total population.
There are also many more children under 18 living with just one parent than there were a generation ago. In 1970, 12 percent of all children lived with one parent; by 1995, 27 percent did. The Census Bureau cited rising divorce rates and a growing tendency to have children first, then marry.
Of the single parents in 1995, 35 percent had never married, 38 percent were divorced, 23 percent were separated and 4 percent were widowed.
In 1995, 21 percent of white children lived with one parent, as did 33 percent of Hispanic children and 56 percent of black children. Those rates are up substantially from 1970, when 8.7 percent of white childrenand 31.8 percent of black children lived with one parent. Such figures for Hispanic children were not kept until 1980, when 20.5 percent of them lived in one-parent households.
The report also reinforces earlier projections of a graying of America. It forecasts that people over 85 will become the fastest-growing age group among the population by the middle of the next century, carrying sweeping implications for the health care industry and Social Security.
In 1995, about four million people were over 85 and made up 1.4 percent of the population. By 2050, the report says, there will be 18 million people over 85, who will account for 4.6 percent of the population. By then, people over 65 will be 20 percent of the population.
The nation's population as a whole is projected to increase 50 percent by 2050, to 394 million, from 263 million in 1995. But the average annual rate of population growth is expected to decline, to 0.63 percent for the period 2040-50 from 1.05 percent for the period 1990-95. This is largely because the baby boomers, the huge postwar bulge of people born from 1946 to 1964, are beginning to move beyond their reproductive years.
Starting in 2020, the report says, more Hispanic Americans will be added to the population each year than blacks, Asian-Americans and American Indians combined. And starting in 2019, the bureau says, the Hispanic American population, relatively youthful, will have the nation's lowest death rate.
In 1995, 46 percent of the 23 million foreign-born people in the United States were of Hispanic origin; nearly seven million had immigrated from Mexico, the country that had exported the largest number of people to America. (The Philippines was second.)
About 800,000 people immigrate legally every year. Immigration of whites will continue to bolster the overall number of white Americans, but by 2034 they will be dying at such a greater rate than their rate of birth or immigration that their numbers will start diminishing, according to Colby Perkins, a statistician in the Census Bureau's population division.
In 1996, non-Hispanic whites made up 73.1 percent of the population; that proportion is expected to fall to 52.8 percent by 2050. Asian-Americans' share of the population will more than double, the report says, to 8.2 percent in 2050 from 3.5 percent in 1996, and blacks will hold about steady, to 13.6 percent then from 12 percent in 1996.
For the first time in six years, there was an increase in real median household income in 1995. The rise from 1994 was 2.7 percent, to $34,076 from $33,178.
But the median earnings of individual women working full time year-round actually declined 1.5 percent after adjusting for inflation, to $22,497 in 1995 from $22,834 in 1994, while men held roughly steady at $31,496.
And women still earn only 71 cents for every dollar that men earn for the same work.
There was a significant decline in the rate and number of those living below the poverty level, which in 1995 was $7,400 for an individual. In 1994, 14.5 percent (38.1 million people) fell below the poverty level, compared with 13.8 percent (36.4 million people) in 1995. Notwithstanding the decline, the new rate is above the 1989 level of 13.1 percent.
On the other hand, 82 percent of adults over 25 years old in 1995 had completed high school, and 23 percent had earned a bachelor's degree or more. Both figures are record highs.

HEADLINE: Another Blow to Hartford: Whalers to Leave, Rejecting Arena Offer

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 26

 BODY:
The Hartford Whalers, a hockey team whose losing record is matched only by its financial woes, rejected the state's offer of a new $147.5 million arena today and announced that they would leave Connecticut at the end of the season.
The team had not inspired a widespread following, but the decision was still a blow to Gov. John G. Rowland, who had made keeping them part of his efforts to revitalize this struggling city. For two years, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, was involved in intense negotiations with Peter Karmanos, the Whalers' owner, and this month he offered to build the team an arena in downtown Hartford. 
 "In essence, we would build the facility and hand the Whalers the keys," Mr. Rowland said at a news conference this morning. "I believe I presented the Whalers with the best offer I could reasonably expect the people of Connecticut and the legislature to support. Mr. Karmanos obviously believes that there's a better deal out there."
Mr. Karmanos said later that the team had needed a heroic deal to stay in Hartford, adding: "The problem here is that we're in a Bermuda Triangle of markets, stuck between New York and Boston, and you need to do something special to survive."
He said the team could not afford the $2.5 million rent the state wanted to charge at the new arena, and that it needed the state to pay the $45 million in losses that it faced during the next three years until the new arena opened, a request that Mr. Rowland refused. Mr. Karmanos also complained about the state's proposal to charge a 10 percent tax on ticket revenues to help pay for the construction.
Other hockey teams have also moved in search of better profits. In the last five years, the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix, the Quebec Nordiques to Denver and the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas, leaving behind thousands of angry fans and city officials who protested that the franchises were demanding too much taxpayer money.
Mr. Karmanos said the team had not found a new home, but suggested that other municipalities were lining up for the chance to get his team. He mentioned Columbus, Ohio; Nashville, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Las Vegas, Nev., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., as possibilities.
Any franchise shift requires league approval, but league officials said today that they would work with the team to help it find a new home.
There is little question that the move hurts Hartford and leaves Mr. Rowland scrambling to find other ways to help this city of 120,000. The Whalers were one of the few attractions that drew people into downtown. On nights and weekends when there is no hockey game, the streets around the Civic Center Coliseum, where the team plays, are often deserted.
Lisa Kruse, an assistant manager at Coach's Sports Bar and Grill, a downtown restaurant, said the bar fills up on nights the Whalers are playing.
"From 5 to 7:30, you can't breathe," she said. "The Whale brings people in. They have loyal fans that now won't have any reason to come into Hartford."
When the Whaler's goalie, Sean Burke, entered Coach's after a recent (and rare) victory, "he got a standing ovation," she said.
"The place was crazy," she said. "It was one of those goose-pimple moments."
About 97 percent of Whalers fans live outside the city, according to a report by the Hartford Downtown Council, and the games accounted for 16 percent of the visits to the city for arts and entertainment events. The Whalers pumped $73 million a year into the city's economy, the report said.
The team's fortunes appear to have mirrored the city's.
When the Whalers were brought here in 1975 from Boston, the team was owned by a group of local companies, including Aetna Life and Casualty and The Hartford Courant. It was boom time in Hartford, skyscrapers were rising, the city still had many local banks and insurance companies, and the Whalers were a glamorous team, with Gordie Howe and his two sons on the roster.
But since 1990, downsizing and mergers have made Hartford one of the fastest-shrinking cities in the country. Last year, it led the nation in job losses.
As part of the economic downturn, the companies that once viewed the Whalers as a worthy civic project had disappeared or could no longer afford an increasingly unprofitable hockey team. In 1994, Mr. Karmanos, an entrepreneur from Detroit who heads a $2 billion computer software company, bought it.
During the next three years, the team continued to lose about $15 million a year, Mr. Karmanos said, and he said that only a stellar arena could change the team's fortunes. The coliseum in the Civic Center seats 14,660 for hockey, making it one of the smallest arenas in the league, and placing the team among the worst in total attendance.
The team's fortunes were not helped by its lackluster performance. It has not made the playoffs since 1992, and on Tuesday night it lost its sixth game in a row.
A poll by The Hartford Courant in February showed that 7 out of 10 state residents did not want the state to spend $160 million to build the new arena.
The Whalers are not even close to having the same place in the hearts of people here that, say, the Yankees have in New York. The threat that the team might leave has hovered over Hartford for several years, and a dozen random interviews today with people here elicted responses, like "Let 'em go," and "Who cares?"
Mr. Rowland received little criticism today. Even politicians who routinely find fault with him said that he could not have offered a better deal without compromising the state budget.
Mr. Rowland described the package as "generous but fair," and said it would have given the team all revenue from concessions and parking for all arena events except University of Connecticut basketball games. The state would have paid for construction with bonds that would be repaid with the tax revenues and rent.
Mr. Rowland estimated that the deal would have provided the Whalers annual revenue of at least $50 million, a figure Mr. Karmanos disputed.
The Whalers have agreed to pay the state $20.5 million to allow them to leave one year before the expiration of the contract that Mr. Karmanos signed with the state when he bought the team in 1994.
Many were aghast that Mr. Karmanos could turn down such a deal, and saw it as a sign of the arrogance of today's professional sports team owners.
Although Mr. Karmanos insisted that he wanted to stay in Hartford, Mayor Mike Peters expressed doubts about that today and accused Mr. Karmanos of blackmail.
"Every time the state made a positive move to close the gap, the gap seemed to get bigger on the Karmanos side," Mayor Peters, a season ticket holder, said. "Obviously, we're very disappointed."
He added that he would not attend another game.

Women-Owned Businesses

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The number of businesses owned by women in New York City and the lower Hudson Valley has jumped by 68 percent since 1987, outpacing the 48 percent increase in the number of all firms for the same period, according to a study released today by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, a nonprofit research group.
The study of women-owned firms, which covered the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the country, found that New York City ranked first in the numbers of such businesses, with Los Angeles and Chicago second and third, respectively. 
 The 248,700 companies owned by women in New York City, as well as Westchester, Putnam and Rockland Counties, now represent 37 percent of all businesses there. With 754,000 people on the payrolls, those businesses employ 20 percent of all workers in the area while generating 20 percent of all business sales.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Light Trading, Following Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly yesterday, following United States stock and bond markets lower.
The selloff came in light trading, which exaggerated price movements ahead of a long Easter holiday weekend. Financial markets in the United States and most markets in Europe are closed today in observance of Good Friday. Most markets in Europe will also be closed on Monday. 
 "It's a follow-through of yesterday's technical selloff, thin holiday trade, and some long-dollar people getting out," said Russ Lascala, head of spot trading at Citibank. "It all seems to be the same scenario: Stocks and bonds are down; the dollar is getting hit."
The dollar was dragged down as stocks and bond fell sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 140.11 points, or 2 percent. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell more than a point.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 123.48 yen, from 124.12 yen on Wednesday, and to 1.6736 marks from 1.6898 marks. The pound traded at $1.6315, up from $1.6287 and the highest level against the dollar in a month.
The dollar starting slipping in Asian trading after Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers in an interview on the Charlie Rose television program expressed concern over Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
His remarks came ahead of a visit to Japan by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin on April 4 for talks in which the nagging trade tensions are expected to feature prominently.
The dollar was helped somewhat by comments Mr. Rubin made in an interview in The Financial Times of London yesterday. Mr. Rubin reiterated that "a strong dollar is in the country's interests."
The dollar fell even as new economic data -- on consumer sentiment and home resales -- pointed to possible further jumps in interest rates. Higher rates typically bolster a currency. On Tuesday, the Fed raised rates by a quarter-point, the first rise in more than two years.
In other currency trading, the mark weakened against the Italian lira after the Cabinet approved a mini-budget to rein in the deficit and earn Italy a place among the first countries signing up for the European single currency.

HEADLINE: Fed Vote on Rates Was 10-0 in February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in holding interest rates steady at their meeting on Feb. 4-5, minutes of the session showed today.
The minutes were released just two days after the Fed's March meeting, in which policy makers raised the Federal funds target rate a quarter-point, to 5.50 percent -- its first increase in more than two years. 
 At the February meeting, however, the policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted 10 to 0 to leave the target for the Federal funds rate -- the overnight bank lending rate -- at 5.25 percent. Two outgoing Fed governors, Janet Yellen and Lawrence B. Lindsey, did not attend the meeting.
"Most members thought that inflation likely would remain contained for some period ahead and that any strengthening in inflation pressures probably would be gradual, allowing the committee to respond in a timely manner," minutes from the meeting showed.
Still, the panel agreed that it would be "desirable" to raise rates even "before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident."
Several F.O.M.C. members warned an interest rate increase "was not generally anticipated in financial markets, and a move at this time could have exaggerated repercussions."
That preceded repeated warnings from the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, of the possibility of a "pre-emptive" strike against inflation.

Bond Yield Rises Above 7% on Strong Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed above 7 percent yesterday as strong consumer sentiment and vibrant housing data heightened investor concern that the Fed would again raise short-term interest rates to contain inflation.
The 30-year bond tumbled 1 8/32, to a price of 94 12/32, pushing its yield up to 7.08 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday. The yield is at its highest level since it reached 7.11 percent on last Sept. 11. 
 The bond market is closed today for Good Friday, making it a three-day Easter weekend, and Monday is the end of the first quarter. So some investors were taking no chances and sold to limit their exposure to any negative news.
Traders said the market started to price in potentially strong economic data next week that could have inflationary implications. For example, the monthly employment report is due, and it is likely to show the tight labor market continuing.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, said: "The market was able to generate little comfort from the firmer tone of today's economic statistics that were released. And since Alan Greenspan was not privy to the outcome of today's numbers, markets are going to surmise that the Fed chairman must be flexing his trigger finger for possible future action if the tone of today's figures persists much longer."
Data released yesterday showed that home resales in February rose 9 percent. Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc., said the activity suggested that interest rates were nowhere near high enough to dampen activity.
The weekly unemployment claims for the week ended March 14 fell 4,000, suggesting that the market could encounter another daunting employment report next week.
Adding to traders' worries, the University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment for March rose to 100, from 99.7 in February, suggesting that consumers are more upbeat about their finance and economic prospects.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said, "The significant element of bond trading today was not just the piercing of the 7 percent yield level, but the inability of the market to come back through it." He added that it suggested that "people were lightening long positions ahead of the quarter-end period."
If data come in as expected next week, showing continuing strength in economy, Mr. Regan added, the yield on the 30-year bond could easily reach 7.25 percent, especially if the employment report confirms the continued strength of the economy.
In the municipal market, the City of Orlando, Fla., said it planned to offer the market's first issue of inflation-protected securities through Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Dubbed "Muni C.P.I.'s", these securities have a final maturity in 2015 and will track changes in the Consumer Price Index very much as Treasury Inflation-Protection Securities do, but unlike the Treasury securities, income from the Muni C.P.I.'s will be exempt from Federal income taxes. The Treasury sold its first inflation-linked debt in January, and corporate borrowers have already followed suit with their own inflation-indexed bonds.
Underwriters said Orlando was selling $40 million of these securities to pay for its waste-water system.

HEADLINE: Strong Data: Home Resales Up 9%, Jobless Claims Down

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Home resales jumped 9 percent in February, bolstered by unusually mild weather and continued job creation, the National Association of Realtors said today.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that fewer Americans applied for state unemployment benefits last week. 
 The 9 percent rise in home resales brought them to an annual rate of 4.26 million, the second-highest level on record. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected a 1 percent gain, to a 3.98 million rate. During January, resales fell a revised 1 percent, to a rate of 3.91 million.
The figures represent actual closings, which lag behind the signing of a contract by a few months.
Housing has defied economists' predictions of a slowdown for almost a year. And although some economists continue to say that much pent-up demand has been exhausted and the growth of the nation's home-buying population is slowing, others contend that as long as the economy continues to add jobs and Americans' incomes rise, the housing market will remain strong.
Referring to the announcement on Tuesday that Federal Reserve policy makers had raised the interest rate on overnight bank loans by a quarter of a percentage point, David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers' Association in Washington, said: "It's going to take the Fed's rate hike, and further increases, to meaningfully inhibit housing activity. Right now this economy is generating hundreds of thousands of new jobs, consumers are very confident, wages are up. I just don't expect housing to slow in the next few months."
Today's report showed that resales rose in the Midwest and West and fell in the Northeast and South.
In its report, the Labor Department said that first-time jobless claims unexpectedly dropped by 4,000 last week from the prior week, to a seasonally adjusted 310,000. The four-week average for jobless claims, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, fell to 311,250, from 312,750 the previous week.
Claims have remained between 309,000 and 316,000 for the last month.

HEADLINE: Dow Tumbles 140.11 as More Strong Economic Reports Jolt Stocks

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stocks were rocked yesterday after reports showed that the economy could be accelerating too fast, raising fears that inflation could derail the seven-year-long bull market.
Falling bond prices and a selloff in futures of the Standard & Poor's 500 index set off a wave of blue-chip selling late in the afternoon, in what at one point looked like a panic. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell as many as 216 points in the last half-hour of trading before recovering to end the day down 140.11 points, or 2.04 percent, at 6,740.59. The plunge came after bond prices fell more than a point, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- above the psychologically important level of 7 percent. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
"The economy is hotter than people thought, and the bond market is recognizing that," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. "Right now, there's more of an inflationary risk than people previously thought."
If a strong pickup in inflation is indeed on the horizon, Federal Reserve policy makers -- who voted earlier this week to raise short-term interest rates a quarter-point -- may feel compelled to push rates higher. Such a move to slow the economy, analysts fear, would increase lending costs, cutting into corporate profits -- and stalling the bull market.
The new economic data that jolted the stock and bond markets yesterday included reports that home resales jumped 9 percent in February and that the number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits dropped unexpectedly. And a study conducted by the University of Michigan showed consumer confidence picking up. These signs of growth, coming just days after the Federal Reserve voted to raise rates, were troubling for the bond market. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 7.08 percent, from 6.98 percent on Wednesday -- its highest level since Sept. 11.
Many analysts say that investors begin to see bonds as more attractive than stocks when bond yields rise above 7 percent.
"It's tough to beat 7 percent when the stock market is, as many of us believe, overvalued," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany.
For the Dow, yesterday was the eighth-largest point loss in history, but in percentage terms, it did not even rank in the top 25. And the Dow fell 160.48 points less than two weeks ago, on March 13, after the the yield on the 30-year bond shot up to 6.95 percent from 6.88 percent.
And yesterday's tumble came on relatively light trading. About 476.8 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange heading into a holiday weekend. The market will be closed today in observance of Good Friday.
Still, it was the lowest close for the Dow since Jan. 24, and about 345 points, or about 5 percent, below its record close of 7,085.16 on March 11.
At one point, late in the day, a wave of program selling and a futures selloff pushed the market down and the drop looked as if it might accelerate into one of the biggest point declines in Dow history. At 3:40 P.M., the Dow was down 216 points -- or 3.1 percent. The only time the Dow has ever lost more than 200 points was on October 19, 1987. That day the Dow -- which is the most widely followed index -- plunged 508 points, or 22.61 percent.
According to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn., there were seven large program trades yesterday -- block- trade selloffs that took more than 193 points off the Dow. The largest, which came at 3:27 P.M., trimmed about 72 points.
On stock market monitors around the world, the final hour of the Dow looked like a giant "V," first plunging and then bouncing back 76 points. The one "buy" program recorded yesterday by Birinyi Associates was a last hour gain of 55 points on the Dow.
The carnage was widespread, but banking stocks and shares in financial services companies were particularly hard hit. It is believed that higher interest rates would squeeze margins at banks while also lowering their underlying asset value.
While the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 16.62 points, or 2.1 percent, to 773.88, the S.& P. Financials Index fell more than 3 percent. Among the hardest hit was Chase Manhattan, down 3 1/2, to 96 3/8; Citicorp, down 2 5/8, to 111, and BankAmerica, down 3 1/4, to 106.
Brokerage houses -- among the chief beneficiaries of a bull market -- were also down. Merrill Lynch fell 2 1/4, to 87 1/2, and Morgan Stanley lost 2 points, to 60 3/8.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 27 lost ground yesterday, with 12 stocks falling at least 2 points. Boeing, I.B.M. and Procter & Gamble led the decline. Boeing lost 3 1/2, to 101 3/4; I.B.M. was down 3 1/4, to 137, and Procter & Gamble fell 3 3/8, 117 5/8. The Dow, however, is still up 4.5 percent on the year.
Michael Metz, the chief investment officer at Oppenheimer & Company, who has long been bearish on the market, said that yesterday's decline was tied to the fallout in the bond market.
"The fundamental background of the bond market gets more and more tentative every day," he said. "The best news for the stock market is a slow-growing economy. A boom is lethal, as is a recession."
While several analysts said that yesterday's selloff was troubling, few were willing to pronounce the onset of a bear market. Still, the volatility has become increasingly troubling for analysts, and they note that young investors -- those who have not yet experienced a bear market -- may see the huge declines as more ominous.
"This is very, very disheartening," Mr. Johnson at First Albany said. 'This is one of the most volatile periods I can recall. And that volatility is pretty intimidating. I'm managing this, but not managing it well. I can't imagine how young investors feel."

Home Resales Jump 9%, Exceeding Expectations
Home resales jumped 9 percent in February, to an annual rate of 4.26 million, the second-highest level on record, the National Association of Realtors said. Sales exceeded expectations and were bolstered by unusually mild weather and continued job creation. 
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said that new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped last week. [Page D15.]
 
The 30-year bond yield topped 7 percent, as the vibrant housing data heightened investor concern that the Fed would again raise short-term interest rates to contain inflation. The yield, at 7.08 percent, up from 6.98, was the highest in more than six months. [D14.]
 
Investors Slowing Fund Purchases
Investors have slowed purchases of equity mutual funds this month, amid warnings about an overpriced stock market. Fidelity Investments expects no net cash inflows this month, while T. Rowe Price and the Vanguard Group see declining inflows. [D4.]
 
Morgan Stanley Earnings Higher
Morgan Stanley Group said that its quarterly earnings rose 15.8 percent, in large part because of strength in the firm's securities and asset management businesses. [D2.]
 
Trouble at Columbia/HCA
Law enforcement officials and Government agencies are investigating business practices at the nation's largest health care company, Columbia/HCA. The scrutiny came to light last week in a Federal criminal investigation of Columbia operations in El Paso, but a yearlong examination by The New York Times has found that the company faces problems on several fronts. [A1.]
 
On the Way to New Semiconductors
Scientists at Cornell said they had found a way to overcome a significant obstacle to making new semiconductor materials. The development could be a step toward creation of many new types of semiconductors for computer chips, sensors, lasers, switches, data storage devices and other uses. [D4.]

Big Japanese Bank May Be Rescued
Nippon Credit Bank, one of Japan's largest banks, plans a major restructuring to avert a financial crisis and might receive assistance from the Government and other banks, Japanese newspapers reported. [D3.]
 
Bank Investment in Brazil
HSBC said that it had bought the banking business of Banco Bamerindus do Brasil for about $1 billion. [D3.]
 
Oracle Chief Muses Over Apple
Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, who has speculated publicly about taking over Apple Computer in the past, did so again. And Oracle has taken the unusual step of setting up an Internet polling booth where customers, employees, competitors and others can vote on whether they think he should make a bid. [D4.]
 
Door Opens to Younger Car Renters
New York State's highest court ruled that car rental companies may not refuse to rent to young adults. While companies, many of which had set minimum ages of 21 to 25, will now have to rent to younger adults in the state, rates may be set higher for them. [B1.]
 
National Strike in Russia
Nearly two million people were estimated to have taken part in a national strike in Russia, as workers demonstrated against the nation's deepening privation. But because many of the factories rarely make anything, the effect on production is expected to be minor. [A3.]

Canadians Link Hezbollah To U.S. Barracks Bombing
Canadian prosecutors asserted that the bombing of an American barracks in Saudi Arabia last year was carried out by a militant Shiite group with links to Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group based in Lebanon that is also friendly with Syria. The prosecutors accused a Saudi man arrested in Canada last week of driving a car used in the attack and said he belonged to a group called Saudi Hezbollah. Iran denied any connection to the bombing.

Russian Workers Strike
Russian workers staged the biggest strike against the Government since the Soviet Union dissolved. More than a million people protested the deepening hardship that has convulsed the nation since President Boris N. Yeltsin introduced economic reforms. Rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg each drew nearly 100,000 people, and protests were held in more than 1,200 other cities. A3
 
Albright Considers Mideast Trip
President Clinton's Middle East envoy, Dennis B. Ross, met with Yasir Arafat in Morocco and then flew to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The key issues for both Israelis and Palestinians, one official said, are security and terrorism. Madeleine K. Albright may make her first trip to the region as Secretary of State if it can bring both sides back to the table. A8
 
British Elections Face Scandal
The British election campaign opened with scandal as some high-profile enemies of the Tory party of Prime Minister John Major vowed to pursue vendettas until they bring down his Government. The morning papers reported an affair between a 46-year-old Tory member of Government and advocate of family values and a 17-year-old nightclub hostess. The Conservatives' enemies are promising much more to come. A10
 
An explosion outside a Northern Ireland police station raised concerns that the I.R.A. might conduct a bombing spree before the British elections. The blast in Coalisland, a mainly Catholic town 30 miles west of Belfast, followed twin explosions at Wilmslow, an important rail junction 160 miles from London. (AP)
 
Serbs May Have Chemical Arms
Documents released by researchers for a human rights group suggested that the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army might still possess chemical weapons and might be tempted to use them if war resumes in the Balkans. Researchers also released a NATO report that suggests Serbs may have conducted research on biological weapons. The Yugoslav Embassy in Washington had no comment on the report, saying it had not yet seen it. A5

Comet Apparently Inspired Mass Suicide in California
The 39 men and women who committed mass suicide were members of a cult known as Heaven's Gate, the authorities said. They left behind detailed videotapes describing their intentions and appeared to believe that the Hale-Bopp Comet now streaking across the sky was their ticket to heaven. A1
 
The cult earned notoriety in California 22 years ago before disappearing into isolation to teach its members that the Earth was corrupt, that civilization was doomed and that only the disciplined few could be saved, rescued by a UFO. A1
 
Its founder, Marshall Herff Applewhite, lived an apparently unremarkable life in Houston as a music professor who sang in the choir at his Episcopal church. But sometime between 1972 and 1975, he was transformed into a budding cult leader who believed in aliens and Armageddon. The coroner's office confirmed that he was among the dead. A1
 
Neighbors in the cult's exclusive community recalled its members as taciturn, unemotional, seemingly unisexual and above all, unnaturally pale. A20

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Artful Dodger

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In New Delhi last week, the Prime Minister of India was saying that China and his country were creating "C.B.M.'s together."
That turned out to mean confidence-building measures -- such as a visit to India by the President of China and talk about moving Chinese and Indian troops back some kilometers from eye-to-eye border posts. So, he said then, he had every confidence in China's peaceful intentions toward its neighbor India. 
 For a moment Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda and I stared at each other in silence. I could not say in his own office what I thought -- that he was deliberately evading India-China reality and history.
And I knew he was in powerful evasion company. While I was in New Delhi, Al Gore was talking pieties, even political untruth, in Beijing. He talked, so help us America and India, about a "significant advance in the process of democracy" in China. That was an insult to all democracies, and to all Chinese who suffered torture and death fighting for even a sip of democracy.
But I did say to Mr. Deve Gowda that he was the second Indian Prime Minister I had heard tell foreigners and his country about his confidence in China.
Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, talked, often, about confidence-building measures like "panchshila" -- the five principles of non-interference India and Communist China had signed, the C.B.M. of the 50's and early 60's.
Nehru talked of the importance of another visit to India -- by Zhou Enlai, then Prime Minister of China. They traveled India together, passing under banners proclaiming "Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai" -- Indians and Chinese are brothers.
Nehru, too, spoke of his confidence in China's peaceful intentions -- almost up to the very hour Chinese troops came through the Himalayan passes in 1962, smashing an Indian Army that had been left unwarned, unprepared, underarmed and shivering in the cold by Nehru and his nasty, America-hating Defense Minister, V. K. Krishna Menon.
What I did not say was that I had seen Indian officers weep in their sense of betrayal and that I hoped no Indian soldier would ever so denounce the name of H. D. Deve Gowda or any who followed him.
He did not reply to my little dissertation on history. But Indian defense specialists privately do not pretend. They know China is expanding its nuclear arsenal and sells Pakistan nuclear technology. They know the U.S. exacts no price and looks away.
Sign a test-ban treaty, as America pleads? While America covers up for China and helps its military grow? No Indian prime minister would be fool enough to do that.
China also still occupies 18 percent of one Indian state, Jammu and Kashmir, and refuses to recognize the boundaries of others on India-China high borders.
And since 1962 it has been China's voice that is heard everywhere, no longer India's. Now it is the Chinese dictatorship the American Vice President visits and to which the President plans a pilgrimage, not the Indian democracy.
The American China lobby has suddenly discovered that profits might also exist in India. But it advises India not to "seek" an enemy in China. Indian friends tell me that is insolent condescension to their intelligence and memory, both of which are capable of reaching back to 1962.
China does not even have to threaten attack now. India's weaknesses, inherited or inflicted by its leaderships, and the West's political and economic submission to China are enough to keep Indians and most of Asia quiet about the China they fear.
India's policies, successes and mistakes are her own. But when American leaders talk moral and political claptrap about Chinese democracy, Asians hear far more clearly than Washington intended. They hear Washington tell them that if they should ever stand up to China economically or politically, let alone militarily, don't count on us, bhais.
The Indian Prime Minister is a religious Hindu. Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton are religious Christians. When Mr. Gore returns he and Mr. Clinton will go to churches of their choice to worship as they were taught. There they will pray aloud for Chinese Christians trying to do the same and beaten and arrested for it by order of Mr. Gore's hosts -- won't they?

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Rabbi Is Accused Of Stealing Grant Money

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
A corruption case involving a politically connected Brooklyn social-services group widened yesterday when a former top official was charged in the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars of Government funds that had been awarded to the group.
The defendant, Rabbi Elimelech Naiman, was director of employment and training of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park, an influential organization that for years has been courted by politicians who saw the council as a key to winning Orthodox Jewish votes in Brooklyn. Last December, the group's director of operations, Paul Chernick, was charged with the same crime. 
 An indictment unsealed yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn lumps the men together as defendants in the case and repeats accusations in previous court papers that a small amount of the allegedly stolen money was diverted to the council's chief political benefactor, Assemblyman Dov Hikind. But Mr. Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat, was not charged with any crimes, and he has long maintained that he has done nothing wrong.
Officials in the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment on whether they believed that Mr. Hikind's alleged receipt of the money -- totaling about $10,000 for payment of various expenses for him and his relatives -- was illegal. One of the prosecutors in the case, Elisa Liang, an assistant United States attorney, said only that "the investigation is continuing."
In fact, her office has never named Mr. Hikind as the "public official" it says received the money, though details in court papers that the office has previously filed make clear the official is Mr. Hikind, and defense lawyers in the case acknowledge it.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Hikind, Chani Katzen, said the legislator had no comment about the case yesterday, except to say, "My heart goes out to Rabbi Naiman and his family." The rabbi, a 45-year-old Borough Park resident, has been a political adviser and fund-raiser for the Assemblyman.
Rabbi Naiman pleaded not guilty in the Federal Court in Brooklyn and was released on $500,000 bail by Magistrate Judge A. Simon Chrein. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said later, "I cannot find any evidence whatsoever of any crime that was committed by Rabbi Naiman." Mr. Chernick's lawyer, Lawrence S. Goldman, said after his client was first indicted in January that Mr. Chernick "expects to be vindicated" at a trial.
In charging both men, yesterday's indictment does not specify how much each is accused of stealing and illegally "misapplying" from the Federal grants that the group -- widely known as COJO -- has received to carry out programs in job training and economic development, and for the elderly and immigrants. But Federal investigators have said in previous court papers that they believed that more than $600,000 in Government funds had been illegally diverted.
The indictment charges that Mr. Chernick and Rabbi Naiman used the stolen funds to pay for "personal expenses" and those of other COJO employees and of people who did not work for the group. The expenses it charges were paid for Mr. Hikind and his family include school tuition for his daughter and niece, a trip he and his family took to Israel and a car rental and a computer for his office.
If convicted of the most serious charge, the defendants face up to 10 years in prison.
COJO has also received state and city funds to finance what once totaled $5 million a year in programs but which today is far less because of the criminal investigation, Mr. Brafman said. In December, the city said it was rescinding nearly $1 million in contracts with the group.

HEADLINE: DEATH IN A CULT: THE BELIEFS;
On the Furthest Fringes of Millennialism

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
The mass suicide in a wealthy Southern California enclave casts a brutal light on a millennialist sect that earned notoriety on the West Coast 22 years ago, before disappearing into isolation to teach its members that the Earth was corrupt, that civilization was doomed and that only the disciplined few could be saved, rescued by a U.F.O.
The police in San Diego said the 39 people dead in the suicide were members of a group called Heaven's Gate, which maintained an elaborate Internet site under that name. Documents on that site indicate that this group was the same as a U.F.O.-obsessed organization founded in 1975 by a couple from Houston: Marshall Herff Applewhite, who was among the dead found on Wednesday, and Bonnie Lu Nettles, whose charismatic preachings were described in an article in The New York Times Magazine in February 1976. 
 In a group whose members shed their birth names, Mr. Applewhite was identified on the Internet site simply as Do, as in the musical tone, while Ms. Nettles, who apparently died more than a decade ago, was Ti.
The group's most recent posting on its Internet site declared that the approach this week of the Hale-Bopp comet provided "the 'marker' we've been waiting for -- the time for the arrival of the spacecraft from the Level Above Human to take us home to 'Their World' -- in the literal Heavens." [Excerpts from the group's writings, page A20.]
In its documents, the group described a worldview on the furthest fringes of millennialism, with disconnected elements of Christianity interpreted through a thick lens of science fiction. In essence, its teachings boiled down to a belief in exalted purpose for a few, combined with an exceptionally grim view of life on an Earth where evil was in control -- a heady mixture of profound hope amid utter isolation.
Heaven's Gate left no shortage of clues as to its negative thinking about the value of this-worldly life. The group subscribed to a gnostic religious view of the soul as a separate and superior being, temporarily inhabiting a physical form.
Bodies, wrote Do in 1995, were merely "the temporary container for the soul." A soul, he added, could evolve to a higher level of being, at which point it would receive a new physical form to house it.
"The final act of metamorphosis or separation from the human kingdom," he wrote, "is the 'disconnect' or separation from the human physical container or body in order to be released from the human environment."
In another document posted on its Internet site, Heaven's Gate declared itself "against suicide" -- but with such nuance as to leave ample opening for it.
Yes, the group said, its members expected to exit Earth in their "physical vehicles (bodies)" when a spaceship arrived to take them to the "Next Level." But should the forces of the world turn violently against them, it added, the group would be "mentally prepared" for whatever came its way. The document asked readers to consider the example of the Jews at Masada who killed themselves rather than submit to Roman legions in A.D. 73.
Furthermore, the group said its understanding of suicide was not at all conventional: "The true meaning of 'suicide' is to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered." In the group's thinking, a spaceship, thought to be following in Hale-Bopp's wake, would be offering just such an opportunity.
 
Brief Taste of Notoriety, Then a Long Silence
The group came together 22 years ago under the charismatic preaching of Mr. Applewhite and his companion, Ms. Nettles, a former nurse. It enjoyed a short-lived burst of notoriety, before the couple took it underground in 1976. After existing in deep seclusion in various Southwestern cities, the group surfaced again briefly three years ago, when members sought out recruits with a series of public lectures.
In the group's documents, Mr. Applewhite and Ms. Nettles are described as representatives of an extraterrestrial plane called the Kingdom of Heaven, come to Earth "to offer the way leading to membership" there for those who could "overcome" their attachment to money, sex and family life.
Such total separation, the group preached, was necessary because Earth's human structures -- governmental, economic and, especially, religious -- were under the control of demonic forces: "Luciferians" and evil "space aliens," in the group's parlance.
The urgent belief in a coming end to a hopelessly corrupt world has long been a recurring part of American religious culture. In one of its best-known episodes, followers of the Bible student William Miller, expecting Christ's return in 1843, gathered on hillsides, anticipating transport to Heaven.
But as the 20th century wanes, the millennialist impulse has taken an increasingly dark cast among some smaller and socially isolated groups. More than 75 Branch Davidians, anticipating a coming end of the world, died in a fire during a siege of their compound near Waco, Tex., by Federal agents in 1993. And in the last three years, more than 70 members of a sect called the Order of the Solar Temple have committed group suicides in Canada and Europe in the belief they could transcend a corrupt world and reach a higher state.
Mr. Applewhite and Ms. Nettles told an interviewer from The Times Magazine in 1976 that they had come to believe they were beings from outer space, incarnate in human bodies, with a mission to teach others about the possibility of reaching a new stage of existence.
In time, they began calling themselves "the Two," a reference to the "two witnesses" of Christ foretold in the Bible's Book of Revelation, whose dense allegory has long attracted all manner of religious believers seeking prophetic knowledge of the future. (It was Revelation that David Koresh, the Davidians' leader, insisted he was in the process of decoding as Federal agents besieged that group's compound.)
According to the Bible, the two witnesses are prophets who will be slain by a beast from the bottomless pit, then be resurrected and ascend to Heaven.
In 1975, Mr. Applewhite and Ms. Nettles, who then used the names Bo and Peep, toured the West Coast, holding forth on college campuses and in private homes, declaring that a spacecraft would arrive to take away a select few. Who was ready, they asked, to "walk out the door" of their lives, to join the movement and reach the Evolutionary Level Above Human?
In the coastal village of Waldport, Ore., 20 people who heard them lecture pulled up stakes and left town with them. Elsewhere, people abandoned spouses, children and businesses to follow.
The message that Mr. Applewhite and Ms. Nettles preached was well suited to a nation traumatized by the loss of the war in Vietnam, the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon and years of social upheaval and violence. They were both anti-establishment and puritanical, calling for total separation from society, simple living with shared resources and adherence to a moral code that eschewed drink, drugs and sex.
At one point, it was estimated that the couple had attracted between 200 and 1,000 followers, who roamed the country in free-spirited pairs and small groups, spreading the word.
But in 1976, as numerous followers became disillusioned and drifted away, the couple took the remnants of their group underground. Those who went with them severed contact with loved ones, creating a mystery that lingered in the hurt suffered by the families they left behind.
Sociologists who originally tracked the group estimated that it had shrunk considerably by this time, with far fewer than 100 members.
 
Group Published Book To Tell Its History
The years that followed are known mainly through the group's documents. In a 200-page book that the members of Heaven's Gate self-published last year, one of them wrote that they had spent 17 years undergoing a type of re-education, "a 'metaphoric' classroom experience of changing over their consciousness and behavior," evolving to reach a stage in which they could enter the higher realm that Mr. Applewhite and Ms. Nettles preached.
In this and other documents, the group elaborated on its theology, filling out a skeletal Christian framework with the flesh of a wholly new set of beliefs.
The beliefs were these:
Two thousand years ago, the beings of the Kingdom Level Above Human appointed an "Older Member" to send to Earth a "Representative" (Jesus) to teach people how to enter the "true" Kingdom of God. But humans inspired by demonic forces killed this individual, also called "the Captain," and transformed his teachings into "watered-down Country Club religion."
Then, according to the documents, a new chance was offered to humanity in the 1970's, when the Kingdom Level dispatched a second team of two Older Members to take up human bodies (or "vehicles") and resume the teachings.
The documents also make clear that the group's members took peculiar new names, another sign of their total break with the outside world. The book, for example, contains an overview written by "Jwnody -- a student."
Much of the essential beliefs of Heaven's Gate are spelled out in a lengthy, first-person statement published on the group's Web site and updated two months ago. Apparently written in 1995 by Mr. Applewhite (under the title "An E.T. Presently Incarnate"), it reveals that Ms. Nettles died in 1985 (or, as he wrote, "separated from her borrowed human container and returned to the Next Level").
The document also says the group's followers arrived on Earth in "staged" spacecraft crashes and were temporarily disembodied before taking human form in bodies especially designated for that purpose by "other crews from the Level Above Human."
The document is full of foreboding about the state of the world, warning that the Government, the wealthy and "moral" leaders are controlled by evil space aliens, who have also used all religions to deceive humans about God. It warns, too, of a coming apocalypse that will destroy civilization; gang wars and ethnic cleansing are offered as proof that the process has begun. Later there will be a "restoration period" in which another civilization will be born.
The document reveals too the group's rigidly authoritarian code. "The only way an individual can grow in the Next Level is to learn to be dependent on his Older Member as that source of unlimited growth and knowledge," it says. "So, any younger member in good standing forever remains totally dependent upon (and looks to) his Older Member for all things."
Five years ago, Heaven's Gate put aside its seclusion and took its message public. In its book, the group said it undertook a series of "satellite television broadcasts" in 1992. Then, the next year, it took out an advertisement in USA Today, with a brief description of its philosophy. The ad's title: " 'U.F.O. Cult' Resurfaces With Final Offer."
The ad was also reprinted, the group said in its book, in "alternative newspapers" and in publications overseas, allowing Heaven's Gate to enter into correspondence with a far-flung audience.
In 1994, the book said, the group "sold all our worldly possessions except for a few cars and changes of clothing, and set out cross-country holding free public meetings" in various cities. Press reports from that time suggest that this met with mixed results.
Five members who gave a lecture on the group's philosophy at the University of Illinois at Chicago in July 1994 drew only 40 people, some of whom left when a videotape of Mr. Applewhite was shown, according to The Chicago Tribune. The newspaper reported that members of the group referred to their bodies as "vessels" that contained souls from a super-human level.
 
Membership Drive Adds 'Crew Members'
 But the group's outreach accomplished two ends: membership was "nearly doubled" (the group's book did not give numbers), and the group concluded that those who joined were not part of the "public in general" but rather lost "crew members," beings from the higher level. "It was quite evident to them and to us that we were of the same family, of the same mind," the book states.
As happy as this experience might sound, it was also the last positive interaction that Heaven's Gate would experience in trying to function publicly. The group, its book said, spent the next year in seclusion, undergoing new training, "an accelerated version of the 'metamorphic classroom.' "
In September and October 1995, the group published major statements on its Internet site. One was titled, "Undercover 'Jesus' Surfaces Before Departure"; the second was Mr. Applewhite's "E.T." statement.
The documents drew a mixed response, but the prevailing reaction struck the group as "ridicule, hostility or both."
Ominously, given what was to take place near San Diego this week, Heaven's Gate read this response as final, an indication that its mission was over, that the "weeds" of humanity had taken over Earth's "garden," and that civilization was finished.
"This was the signal," the group wrote in its book, "for us to begin our preparations to return 'home.' "

HEADLINE: Harlem on Her Mind;
Preacher's Daughter Takes Wall St. Sensibility Uptown

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
It's morning again in Harlem and Deborah C. Wright, the president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, and therefore the neighborhood's de facto finance minister, begins another day deciding who will get money and who will not.
This does not always make her popular, and people sometimes scream at her in public meetings. She maintains a complicated alliance with Representative Charles B. Rangel, Harlem's longtime power broker, whose lieutenants get mad at her, too. No one, however, has accused her of measuring words. 
 Consider the following:
At 8:30 A.M., she tells her staff that a struggling Harlem doll-making company wants loans and grants of almost $7 million because its officers say "culture problems" with its Spanish-speaking workers are causing a drop in production. "They have no air-conditioning and no heat," Ms. Wright says dryly. "That's a big culture problem."
At 11 A.M., she meets with a downtown developer who wants to renovate a Harlem theater and add a recording studio. Ms. Wright perks up. "We're into this big time," she tells him, adding that applying for a loan is "not all that bloody."
At 12:30 P.M., she listens as representatives for Harlem's small grocers, losers to the big Pathmark supermarket expected to break ground this summer, ask her to finance business training aimed at making the grocers more "bankable," in the words of their consultant, Ralph Declet.
"Making them legal, to start," Ms. Wright shoots back, referring to those grocers who run cash businesses off the books, and triggering a wan smile from Mr. Declet.
"That's one way to put it," he says.
When people need things these days in Harlem, they go to Ms. Wright, a blunt, 39-year-old Harvard Business School graduate with an impeccable family pedigree, friends on Park Avenue and powerful backing from Wall Street, Albany and City Hall.
Empowerment zones try to help economically distressed areas through job training, assistance in home buying and tax and other incentives for businesses. Ms. Wright's job is to distribute $550 million in government tax credits and loans over the next decade, most aimed at jump-starting new business and spurring investment in Harlem.
She has already committed $11.2 million for Harlem U.S.A., the planned shopping complex on 125th Street, which will include the Gap and the Disney Store, and $350,000 for Minton's, a restaurant and jazz club, to be developed in part by the actor Robert De Niro and the restaurateur Drew Nieporent. Not surprisingly, she has set off neighborhood criticism that she is turning Harlem over to outside white businesses.
"Why can't the average shopper in Harlem have a range of options that looks like any other neighborhood?" Ms. Wright said. She pointed out that the third partner in Minton's is Melba Wilson, an African-American and a lifelong Harlem resident.
An economic revitalization program is hardly a new idea in Harlem -- hundreds of millions in government money has poured into the area since President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty -- but putting a woman like Ms. Wright in charge of one is. Part of a new generation of black professionals who went to Ivy League colleges and worked at the elite financial institutions of New York, Ms. Wright is not, she said, another traditional social reformer or a politician handing out favors to friends, but a financier who says she holds Harlem to the standards of Wall Street.
Ms. Wright worked at First Boston during the investment bank's white-hot 1980's ("I wanted to be the first black female partner on Wall Street," she said, although she stayed for only three years), went to the New York City Housing Authority board under Mayor David N. Dinkins, then was appointed, as a Democrat, to be Commissioner of Housing under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom she likes.
In her typical head-on style, she says she lives in Greenwich Village and not Harlem -- a lot of people would prefer it if she lived there -- because there are not yet enough amenities and she wouldn't be able to get a salad at Dean & Deluca.
"That's important to me," she said.
But there is another side to Ms. Wright. It is essential to know that she is the daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter and sister of Baptist ministers, and that her aunt is Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children's Defense Fund and a mentor who disapproved of her niece's Wall Street years. "In the family values, that was sort of a no-no," said Ms. Edelman, who is thrilled that her niece has come home to the family business of public service.
 
Not a Job, But a Mission
Ms. Wright is not entirely sure she is home to stay, but says the family pressures on her were powerful, and talks now of the mission of her work. "This isn't a job," she said, talking for several hours over lunch the other day in midtown Manhattan. "It really is an emotional undertaking. It's such a wound in the psyche of the African-American public to see this place that was such a mecca be on its back, and knowing that the answers are really not brain surgery."
She mentions the busloads of Japanese and European tourists who venture up to the home of American jazz but return empty-handed because there is nothing to buy. "It's sickening," Ms. Wright said. She wants to develop tourism as part of the Harlem mix, along with national chains, local businesses and job training programs. "I'm not naive about how steep the hurdles will be," she said.
Despite the recent optimism about a Harlem rebirth, the area's most basic statistics remain grim. Of people 25 years and older, 47,000 are high school graduates, but 52,000 are not. The unemployment rate is nearly 19 percent.
An officer of the most ambitious government program would find the task overwhelming, but Ms. Wright is leading an organization created as a legislative afterthought in President Clinton's 1993 budget, then saved in committee by Mr. Rangel, who says he never believed in empowerment zones but wanted the money for his district. He continues to call empowerment zones (there are nine around the country) "grains of sand on the beach."
Dealing with Mr. Rangel is a challenging part of Ms. Wright's job. The old guard and the new guard praise each other extravagantly in public, and need each other to survive, but there is a power struggle in private over Mr. Rangel's role. So far the empowerment zone has approved $15.2 million for 12 projects expected to create 1,300 jobs; associates of Ms. Wright say Mr. Rangel's people often call her, angry that they have not been consulted or insisting she give a hearing to friends in the community.
"I don't have one political contract in there," Mr. Rangel said. "There'll never be my fingerprints on anything. I don't want to interfere with what she does."
Mr. Rangel said that "Debbie Wright is there because I put her there." That is somewhat true. Ms. Wright is also the only candidate on whom the Mayor, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mr. Rangel could agree.
Ms. Wright, when pressed on how much she holds Mr. Rangel and the old guard responsible for the failures of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation -- an organization that Mr. Rangel helped found, but that was shut down two years ago by Mr. Pataki, who cited mismanagement and waste -- is restrained.
"I just think they didn't have the skills to get the job done," she said.
 
Road to Harlem Began in the South
Debbie Wright's road to Harlem began in the segregated Deep South, in the small town of Bennetsville, S.C., where her grandfather built the Shiloh Baptist Church and preached until he died. Ms. Wright's father, the Rev. Harry S. Wright, now minister of the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Crown Heights, took over Shiloh and the leadership of Bennetsville's black community. In the 1960's, with his three young children in tow, he helped lead the way to integration. His most vivid memory is arriving with them at the all-white public swimming school.
"I just took the kids by the hand and walked on up there, and slowly made our presence felt," Mr. Wright remembered.
Ms. Wright and her brother and sister were the only blacks at the white elementary school. "It was intense," she said. She made no friends at the school -- "I felt pretty much just ignored," she said -- and moved to Dallas a few years later.
By the time she was in junior high school, in the early 1970's, Ms. Wright once again found herself on the front lines of the racial divide, this time in the first busloads of black students to integrate the Dallas public schools. "That seventh grade year was probably the worst," Ms. Wright said.
But in the kind of melding of black and white worlds that later marked her life in New York, Ms. Wright says she and the other leaders of the school, the smart students, pulled together. "We bonded in the student government," she said. She had even broader ideas her senior year, when she rejected the safe choice of Spelman, the black women's college in Atlanta (and the alma mater of her aunt and her two sisters) for Radcliffe.
"My father tried to convince me not to go, because he thought I was going to be disillusioned," Ms. Wright said. "And the truth is, I was."
Partly, she said, her feelings came from growing up in the South, "where there's so much emphasis on how racist the South is, and you actually think there's a place where it isn't the case."
"And you think of this great intellectual institution," she said, "and you get there, and it's the same old stuff. I know I'm being oversensitive, but you just had a constant feeling of being unwanted."
But she went on to Harvard Business School. "It's the ticket," she said. By 1984 she was one of 11 students who graduated with a joint degree in law and business, a sizzling credential that landed her a job as an associate in corporate finance at First Boston, where she did not distinguish herself.
"It was a really bewildering time, because I had never been in a position where I didn't achieve what I set out to," she said. "I was not connected in any way, not to the work, not to the people."
She left in 1987, when she was making $135,000 a year, and took a job for $100,000 less at the New York City Partnership, a business advocacy group, as director of marketing for a Harlem building project. "All I wanted was a job where I actually wanted to wake up in the morning," Ms. Wright said.
In 1992 she was named by Mayor Dinkins to the board of the New York City Housing Authority, the manager of the city's public housing, and in 1994 stayed on in the new administration, after "a lot of soul-searching," as Commissioner of the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development.
Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner and the chairman of the empowerment zone, persuaded her to take her present job. She has committed herself to it for at least three years, knowing its successes and failures will be hers as well. She is eager for the talk to end and the groundbreaking to start.
"Otherwise," she said, "I'm just the latest Johnny-come-lately promising that things will be better."

HEADLINE: GOLF: Seeking Fairness on the Fairways;
Female Golfers Are Challenging Country Club Rules

BYLINE: By MARCIA CHAMBERS 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
For 10 years, Christina Watkins has been a full-fledged member of Wee Burn Country Club in Darien, one of the most exclusive country clubs in Connecticut. She put up with the all-male grill and restricted weekend tee times. She didn't get angry until she received an assessment raising her dues 6 percent.
"I do not question the board of directors' decision to raise Wee Burn's membership fees," she wrote to the board last year. "What I question is that as a full golf member I am denied the same access to club facilities as my male counterparts." 
 Her quest to get Wee Burn to change its policies began in January 1996. It has led her to the Connecticut Legislature in Hartford, where on Monday she and four other female golfers will testify before the 41-member joint Senate-Assembly Judiciary Committee about discrimination at their clubs. Each woman tried to bring about changes from within her club. Each failed.
In the last decade, a quiet revolution has taken place in scores of golf and country clubs throughout the nation. From Winged Foot in New York to Olympic in San Francisco, the leaders of the nation's country clubs have grappled with issues of discrimination, a subject they never dreamed would reach inside their gates.
Until recently, race rather than gender was the nemesis of private golf clubs. Marginal progress has been made on that front. Augusta National, home of the Masters tournament, which begins April 10, has 2 black members among roughly 250. In Connecticut, the New Haven Country Club will accept its first black member this spring. But Augusta, whose membership includes some of the top Fortune 500 executives in the country, has yet to admit a female member. As its former chairman, the late Hord Hardin put it: "We love our women. We just don't want any fussin' with 'em."
But today, it is the female golfers who are leading the charge against the clubs' policies. Women, typically only a few in each club and particularly those who work during the week, want the same rights as their spouses or single male members: to vote, to sit on the board, to be served lunch in the grill, to play golf on weekend mornings and certain midweek afternoons set aside for men only.
Because the clubs, and their male leaders, have been unresponsive to women's relatively narrow requests -- they're talking about tee times and grill access, not membership and board positions -- that women are pressing the issue.
Watkins, a construction entrepreneur who was raised in the country-club world, pays $6,000 in annual dues to belong to Wee Burn, a club that had a $42,500 initiation fee in 1996.
She thought that the inequity was so obvious the board would vote to change it. Wee Burn did make two changes: it increased women's weekend tee times by one hour, from 11:30 A.M. to 10:30 A.M., and it created a corner of another room for women and couples to eat lunch. The club kept the men's grill sacrosanct during the day. "All they did was to throw me a bone," Watkins said. "They didn't address the issues."
Such changes have also been resisted in the rest of the tristate area, home to a large contingent of the nation's corporate elite and the golf and country clubs they belong to. A bill aimed at eliminating discriminatory practices in private country clubs was first introduced in the New York State legislature in 1980; it passed the Assembly in 1981, 1982 and 1988. But it never found a Senate sponsor.
In 1991, Norma Grill, a Nassau County tax attorney and a golfer at Cold Spring Country Club on Long Island, mounted a new campaign that centered on overcoming opposition from senators who were members of private country clubs. The bill became law in 1994; it requires country clubs with 100 or more members to provide equal access, if the clubs conduct outside business such as renting out their facilities.
Last month, New Jersey's Assembly approved legislation that would eliminate disparate tee times and access to facilities for women holding their own club memberships. The New Jersey bill is now headed to the Senate, where one of the golfers leading that campaign, Hazel Frank Gluck, said, "it may well face a tough fight" to get out of committee.
The New Jersey Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, "opposes discrimination of any sort in any setting and is amazed that country clubs or other social clubs of their own accord would sanction discrimination in this day and age," her press secretary, Pete McDonough, said.
"The Governor believes men and women who pay equal dues to the same organization should all be treated alike."
The New Jersey legislation was first introduced in 1995 by Assemblyman John V. Kelly, a Republican from Nutley. He sponsored the bill after several female constituents complained about policies at their clubs. Two of New Jersey's most politically powerful female golfers testified before the state's Judiciary Committee last fall in support of the bill: Judy Shaw, Whitman's former chief of state, and Gluck, her former campaign co-chairwoman and now one of the state's most powerful lobbyists.
Again, the New Jersey bill is hardly radical in scope. It does not apply to a club's membership selection process. It does not apply to spouses, who are considered guests at many clubs. The bill says only that single women who own a membership in their name and who pay dues at their private club are entitled to the same rights as male members.
"Working women want to take their clients out to the course, same as the guys do," Gluck said this week. "If the woman has paid full freight she should have full access to the course. These are club rules left over from a bygone time."
In Connecticut last summer, Watkins approached Representative Ellen Scalettar, a Democrat from Woodbridge, the vice chairwoman of the Assembly's Judiciary Committee. Last month, Scalettar invited the Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, and various female country-club members as well as club officials to a meeting in Hartford to explore the issues. Afterward, Scalettar decided to hold a public hearing, the one on Monday. Blumenthal is scheduled to testify in support of a proposed bill that will require golf and country clubs holding liquor licenses to provide "equal access for all adults in all membership categories at all times."
Blumenthal said in an interview yesterday that the current forms of discrimination in a number of the state's country clubs "offend human dignity and deny business opportunities" to women.
Watkins also consulted a Westport attorney, Douglas Shrader. Earlier this month, he served Wee Burn with notice that Watkins had decided to sue. The lawsuit seeks to eliminate preferential tee times for men and to allow women into the men's grill.
The private country club was once treated as an oasis, protected from public scrutiny by first amendment rights of freedom of association. But not anymore.
Legislators in some states have done what was unthinkable two decades ago. After examining the inner workings of private country club life, they are searching for ways to intervene. Does the club receive property-tax incentives? Are there business tax write-offs or other economic benefits derived from corporate golfing events, social receptions or other outside events that give the club a public character? Do liquor licensing requirements bar discrimination?
In recent years, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan and Montana have enacted legislation redefining private clubs as public accommodations if they fit a variety of conditions. Maryland and Minnesota bar discrimination in country-club policies as long as the club accepts the state's significant property tax deductions under its open spaces laws.
Although weekend tee times for women is the most visible issue, the deeper political problem concerns membership. Many clubs have bylaws restricting membership to men, thus excluding women from serving on the club's governing body. In the last decade, many clubs have changed their membership structure to enable either spouse to hold the membership.
That's what New Haven Country Club does. The couple may choose who will hold the membership; the membership holder gets to play golf early on weekend mornings. But when clubs permit either spouse to hold the membership, typically the husband do, leaving the wives in the same predicament. Currently, there is no woman holding the primary membership at New Haven County Club.
Darlene Iglhaut and her husband, Lud, members of New Haven Country Club for 13 years, recently resigned because the club failed to change its attitudes and policies toward women, especially spouses. "The issue has become a strong moral issue for us which has resulted in forfeiting a somewhat large initiation fee," said Iglhaut of the $10,000 she paid to join New Haven. Iglhaut, who served as chairwoman for the women's golf association for two years, said the club routinely rents out the course, holds a state liquor license and may benefit from a reduced property tax bill for its land.
"The question is: Do these advantages place a private club in the position of denying to female members the rights they should be entitled to?"

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about female golfers seeking equal rights at private country clubs, misstated the women's primary goals. They are concerned about membership policy and positions on boards, not just tee times and access to grill rooms.

Deregulation Plan Outlined By Japanese

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 28

 BODY:
The Japanese Government today released a proposal for deregulation that is intended to lay the foundation for the liberalization of the nation's financial markets.
The package, based on a proposal earlier this month by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, includes measures to lower the barriers separating banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies and to cut the tax and fixed commissions imposed on securities trades. 
 Analysts said the proposal might fall short of expectations.
The package may pay "too much attention to reconciling the colliding interests" of financial companies, Koyo Ozeki, senior director of the IBCA credit-rating agency, said. "The key is whether the Government can overcome its hesitation by June and achieve the really sweeping reform it has advocated."
The release of the planned measures is to be followed by the announcement of a detailed plan by June.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said, "We want to do whatever we can do ahead of 2001." Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who wants to bring the financial markets in Tokyo up to the level of those in New York and London, has said he wants reforms in place before then.
The measures would make it easier for brokerage firms and investors to trade financial products like stock options and new types of corporate bonds, the Finance Minister said.
Also under the proposals, the securities trading tax would be changed and possibly eliminated. Cash transactions through brokerage accounts that are similar to transactions through bank accounts would be permitted. Banks would be allowed to sell investment trust services, similar to mutual funds, at teller windows.
Leasing and credit card companies would be allowed to sell bonds and commercial paper to finance their lending.
Regulations covering the management of employee pension funds would be eliminated. Currently, more than 50 percent of the funds must be invested in Government bonds, less than 30 percent in assets denominated in foreign currencies, less than 30 percent in stocks and less than 20 percent in real estate.
Also under the plan, the sale of options on individual stocks would be permitted.
The Government also plans deregulation measures for other parts of the economy, including real estate, housing development and telecommunications.

HEADLINE: Lane Dwinell, 90, New Hampshire Governor

 BODY:
Lane Dwinell, a two-term Republican Governor of New Hampshire in the 1950's and later a member of the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations, died on Thursday at his home in Hanover, N.H. He was 90.
The cause was heart failure, a relative said. 
 Mr. Dwinell, Governor from 1955 to 1959, was known for his shrewd application of accounting and budgeting principles to state government and for using some of the savings he achieved to pay raises for state employees, seeking to reduce what he called an excessive and costly turnover of state employees.
After being a businessman in Lebanon, N.H., for many years, he got his start in politics by being elected to the town budget committee, then worked his way up to president of the State Senate and House Speaker before becoming Governor.
In 1959, he was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration and served until 1961. He returned to the family-owned clothing-manufacturing business, Carter & Churchill. In 1969, he was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to lead the Agency for International Development and served until 1971.
Mr. Dwinell graduated from Dartmouth College.
His wife, the former Elizabeth Cushman, died in October.

More than three years after high-level talks between India and Pakistan foundered over the perennial problem of Kashmir, the two countries resumed the dialogue today, with hopes for a breakthrough toward a more neighborly relationship as high as they have been in many years.
In four days of talks, the Foreign Secretaries of the two nations, each holding the top nonpolitical job in their ministries, are to discuss issues ranging from Kashmir to nuclear weapons, from trade and water supplies to cultural exchanges. 
 If the two sides can avoid the rancor over Kashmir that has impeded numerous efforts to improve their relations since the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947, officials on both sides say, there is a strong possibility of an early summit meeting between the two Prime Ministers, H. D. Deve Gowda of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan. The tentative plan is for the men to meet in early May when six South Asian countries gather in the Maldive Islands for an annual conference on regional cooperation.
The two Prime Ministers both head new governments: Mr. Deve Gowda has been in office for nine months; Mr. Sharif won a landslide election eight weeks ago. Both have said their priority is better economic performance, not wasting energy on old confrontations, and both have said they favor breaking the deadlock this year, when India and Pakistan celebrate the 50th anniversary of their independence.
But the two leaders' upbeat mood is not fully shared by officials who prepared the current talks, largely because of concern that no way will be found to neutralize the old bitterness over Kashmir. Adminstration of the state has been divided since 1949, when the United Nations established a cease-fire line after two years of fighting between the Muslim majority and the Hindu rulers.
The dispute over the divided territory was at the heart of the last round of top-level talks between the two countries, again at the Foreign Secretary level, which began in 1989 and collapsed in 1994, after seven rounds, with increasing acrimony over the Pakistan-backed insurgency against Indian rule.
The tensions were apparent even today as the two Foreign Secretaries, Salman Haider of India and Shamshed Ahmed of Pakistan, prepared for the opening two hours of talks, with Indian officials saying progress depends on setting the Kashmir issue aside and Pakistan insisting Kashmir is the "core issue."
Still, officials acknowledge that India and Pakistan have a pressing need to find new ways of dealing with each other. Mr. Deve Gowda and Mr. Sharif have said in effect that India and Pakistan have missed out on the benefits that have flowed from political breakthroughs elsewhere in the world, notably with the end of the cold war and the collapse of apartheid.
Both countries are being nudged toward agreement by the United States, which is using enhanced diplomatic leverage born of coupling Washington's long friendship with Pakistan with a relationship with India that has greatly improved since the end of the cold war.
But the immediate spur for the talks came from Mr. Sharif, who surprised many in Pakistan by saying publicly during his election campaign what many politicians had long acknowledged privately: that hostility toward India had burdened Pakistan with unacceptably high military costs, impeded natural trade and distorted the country's development, and that it was time to be more pragmatic.
"We are nearly 50 years late, and we can't afford any further delay," Mr. Sharif said.
The Indian Foreign Minister, Inder K. Gujral, has pressed hard for a more harmonious relationship between India and its neighbors. Recent months have seen India sign major water-sharing agreements with Bangladesh and Nepal, and Mr. Gujral has said he sees no reason why similar progress should not be made with Pakistan.
But Kashmir is the toughest issue of all. India, which controls two-thirds of the territory, has never resolved the tensions that breed when a predominantly Hindu nation rules over a population that is more than 70 percent Muslim. On the other side, Pakistan has backed the insurgency by Muslim rebels, in which at least 30,000 people have been killed since 1989.

HEADLINE: Japanese Bank Reports Big Loss in U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 28

 BODY:
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said its American unit incurred a loss of $50 million from positions in such financial instruments as interest rate swaps.
 The loss, which was announced on Thursday, followed a review of the unit's computer portfolio appraisal model, which had overestimated the market value of the positions, the bank said. After having unwound those positions, the unit recorded an after-tax loss of $83 million, which included $33 million in costs. 
 The bank said that the authorities in the United States and Japan had been informed of the loss but that no laws, regulations or internal rules had been broken.
 Commenting on the loss, Walter Altherr, senior financial analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities, said: "It's not an enormous amount of money. It may be big for the U.S. unit, but I don't think it's big for the group."
The loss will not cause "the slightest" problem for the bank's financial health, he said.
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi fell 4.4 percent, declining 90 yen, or 73 cents, to 1,960 yen, or $15.85. The stock was hurt by Thursday's loss announcement and by concern that the bank, like other major Japanese banks, will be asked to shoulder part of the burden of a financial bailout plan for the Nippon Credit Bank.

HEADLINE: Dollar Rises in Quiet Trading After Broad Drop on Thursday

BYLINE: By Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The dollar rose in a quiet session yesterday as traders bought the currency after its broad decline on Thursday.
Trading was thin on the Good Friday holiday. Many European markets were closed. In the United States, financial markets were closed, and although banks in New York were open, many New York traders stayed out of the market. 
 Yesterday afternoon in New York, the dollar stood at 1.6790 marks, up from 1.6736 marks the previous day, and at 124.05 yen, up from 123.48 yen.
The only significant activity yesterday was by Japanese investors who bought marks for yen. "There's been some interest to invest outside of Japan to pick up yield," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Capital Markets in New York.
Because interest rates in Germany are higher than those in Japan, investments denominated in marks carry higher yields than those denominated in yen.
The mark reached an intraday high of 73.92 yen and ended the day at 73.88 yen. The last time it traded at those levels was on Feb. 14, when the mark reached 74.01 yen.
 Analysts expect the dollar to move significantly against the yen once the new Japanese fiscal year begins on Tuesday. Some believe a wave of new investments in dollar-denominated assets will be made from Japan. Others are not so sure.
 "People seem to think the Japanese will come in, but they may be expecting too much too soon," said Seth Garrett of Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.

HEADLINE: Drop Reported In Companies' Fourth-Quarter Profit Margins

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Reversing course, profit margins of American companies declined in the final months of 1996 as compensation costs took a slightly bigger bite, the Government said today.
Although profitability fell only modestly -- to 10.4 percent of total output from 10.7 percent in the third quarter -- it was the first decline in a year and focused attention on a warning by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who has been cautioning that investors in stocks seem to have been betting on an expanding profitability that could probably not be achieved. 
 The sag in profits comes at a time when the economy is still showing little sign of slackening from a rapid pace, which was an important factor in the Fed's decision this week to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter-point.
Growth in the October-December period was at a 3.8 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department's report also disclosed, barely changed from the 3.9 percent the agency estimated at the end of February. The price index for gross domestic purchases ran at 2.6 percent instead of 2.5 percent earlier.
Recent strong reports on housing, big-ticket manufactured goods and initial claims for unemployment benefits have sent economists scampering to raise forecasts for the current quarter, many of them to rates of 3.5 to 4 percent, more than a point faster than the consensus estimate of 2.4 percent on March 10.
A second Commerce Department tally showed today that for the first time in more than a decade, sales of new homes surpassed an 800,000 annual pace for two consecutive months. An 811,000 rate for February was just seven-tenths of 1 percent below that for January.
Investors have become increasingly worried about accelerating growth and accompanying inflation, and on Thursday, the stock and bond markets tumbled. The markets were closed today, but the latest profit and other figures seemed likely to aggravate current jitters.
Calculations based on the profits data showed that the overall margin for nonfinancial corporations narrowed in the final 1996 period after three consecutive quarterly expansions. Compensation costs, said Kenneth A. Petrick, a department specialist, rose in the autumn after holding steady over the summer.
The result seemed to bear out the concern expressed by Mr. Greenspan. Late last month, for example, he expressed it this way before the Senate Banking Committee:
"The long-term earnings projections of financial analysts have been marked up noticeably over the last year and seem to imply very high earnings growth and continued rising profit margins at a time when such margins are already up appreciably from their depressed levels of five years ago."
He added that while it was possible that margins could fatten further if pay and benefits could be held to their current pace and productivity improved, even small disappointments "could have outsized impacts" on the stock market.
Indeed, the profit margin for businesses other than banks and other financial institutions hit 10.5 percent for all of 1996, today's report also showed, up from 9.9 percent for the two preceding years and the highest since 1978. The low for the latest 20 years was 6.4 percent in 1982.
The fourth-quarter decline, however, suggested that profit margins might have begun to narrow.
"Profit rates have probably hit their peak for the current business cycle," said Dean Baker, economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-oriented research organization here. He referred specifically to what he said was an unprecedented expansion of American profit margins since 1988 involving a "dramatic" shifting of income from wages and investments to profits.
Another analyst predicting that current profit levels will not hold up is David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld. "The deflation of corporate profits will accelerate," he said in a commentary this week, pointing to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase that he said would lead to recession.
And while not predicting an economic downturn, Paul C. Taylor of America's Community Bankers said he expected "some slowing" of corporate profits, reflecting, among other things, the strength of the dollar, which is making it harder for American exporters to sell abroad. He also pointed to rising inventories of unsold homes that have been largely masked by strong sales.
As for the stock market, Mr. Taylor declared it vulnerable "to any slight reduction in profit margins."
The Commerce Department, which reports profits by four different measures, said total profits from production, including financial companies, fell 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter after rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter.
But Mr. Petrick said the decline would have become a 1.7 percent advance had it not been for special assessment on savings institutions to recapitalize their insurance fund.
The small downward revision to gross domestic product, the department said, reflected lower personal consumption spending.

HEADLINE: Paralyzed, Again, in Albany

 BODY:
For the 13th year in a row, New York State will start a new fiscal year next week without a budget and with a Governor and Legislature once again paralyzed by arguments over money. But the spectacle seems sorrier than ever, since the two sides cannot even agree on how far apart they are. An even sadder reality is that there is enough money available to finance a sensible compromise between Republicans and Democrats, if only there were leadership instead of posturing.
Gov. George Pataki started the budget cycle off on a confrontational note by proposing another round of unnecessary cuts in payments to hospitals, nursing homes, community health centers and home care for the elderly poor. Once again he advocated raising tuition at the State and City University systems and cutting tuition assistance for those who desperately need it. His school aid and property tax cut formulas are almost brazen in the way they discriminate against New York City. These cutbacks are unconscionable at a time when tax revenues are rolling in from Wall Street and an expanding economy elsewhere. 
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the top Democrat in Albany, obviously suspects that Mr. Pataki wants to push through tough budget cuts this year so he can have a surplus handy to pay for popular programs when he runs for re-election in 1998. To head off that possibility, Mr. Silver's budget goes to the other extreme. Passed in part by the Assembly last week, it would add $2.25 billion in spending and tax cuts by the Democrats' estimate. Republicans say the Democratic proposals will actually add $4 billion.
At this point in the annual Albany budget game, the two sides are at least supposed to agree on the cost of what they want to do, but partisanship has fuzzed even the numbers.
Then there is the problem of holding the budget hostage to each side's pet concerns. Last year Mr. Pataki successfully demanded that the Democrats accept reform of the workers' compensation system before he would agree to a budget. This year the Democrats are naming their price, threatening to resist any budget negotiations until Republicans agree to drop their threat to remove rent controls from New York City apartments. The law governing rents expires June 15, and many fear that there will be no budget until then.
The first priority for Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and other legislative leaders is to separate rent, welfare reform and other emotional issues from the budget itself. Second, they should direct their aides to reach a sensible compromise on the amount of revenue available for the budget. That compromise should be a cautious one, reflecting the realistic concern that the current stock market boom will not go on forever. Both sides should drop their destructive habit of enacting multi-year tax cuts and spending programs that cause deficits to balloon in the years ahead.
Finally, Mr. Pataki should accept the idea that the budget cannot be balanced with cuts that fall disproportionately on the poor, as they now do, and that his tax cut proposals should not penalize New York City. The Governor says he wants to increase the city's portion of school aid, but the budget for next year goes in the opposite direction. Only about 9 percent of Mr. Pataki's $1.7 billion proposed cut in the property tax would benefit New York City homeowners.
The Governor says that he is ready to compromise on his ideas, but that the Democrats are being unreasonable. All sides could use a dose of reality. There is no reason they could not get to it right away.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Takes to the Road, and Speculation on 2000 Follows

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., March 28

 BODY:
Perched on a windowsill in the cramped private office of State Representative Peter Hoe Burling are pictures of a beaming Bill Clinton and his heir apparent, Vice President Al Gore. And smiling back from a wall across the room is a photograph of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
In a state that takes special pride in its first-in-the-nation and frequently make-or-break Presidential primary, Mr. Burling, leader of the Democratic minority in the New Hampshire House, insists that any symbolism in the pictorial face-off between Mr. Gore and Mr. Gephardt, potential rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, is entirely unintentional. 
 "Nobody in this state is thinking about that right now," Mr. Burling said. "We are all aware that it is out there, but we have other business on our minds right now. But we know in a year's time, there will be a lot more attention."
Even now, there is hardly a move that Mr. Gephardt makes or barely a comment he utters that does not stir immediate conjecture about his intentions, raising what some of his senior aides refer to simply as "the question." And he brought speculation to a boil this week when his search for 1998 Democratic Congressional candidates carried him first to Iowa, whose Presidential campaign caucuses are held even before the New Hampshire primary, and then here.
"I think we are leaping to judgments here that are inappropriate," Mr. Gephardt said in Iowa on Tuesday when "the question" arose barely a minute into a news conference at the Statehouse in Des Moines. "I'm here for one reason and one reason only, and that is to encourage people to run for the United States House of Representatives. We've got some very, very important issues in front of all of us right now, and the last thing we need to be doing is talking about political races way out in the future."
But to Curt Olson, a high school administrator who spent the better part of an afternoon listening to Mr. Gephardt expound his views on education at a round-table discussion in Indianola, just south of Des Moines, there was a familiar ring.
"It seems we are getting started pretty early this time with the Presidential election visits," Mr. Olson said afterward.
"I like him -- he seems honest and sincere," Mr. Olson said, and then volunteered, "I'd vote for him."
The speculation about Mr. Gephardt is fueled largely by his unsuccessful campaign for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination. It was presumed that he would try again in 1992, but he chose early on, like a number of other Democratic prospects, to sit out the race rather than fight for a chance to take on a then popular incumbent, George Bush.
In recent weeks, he has rekindled the talk by staking out some positions that are at odds with those of the Clinton-Gore team. He was among the Democrats who rebuked the Administration for certifying Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs. And it was his opposition to readjusting the Government's chief inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, that scuttled a potential budget deal between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans.
Further, nearly on the eve of Mr. Gore's trip to China this week to discuss trade and other issues, Mr. Gephardt introduced legislation that would require Congressional approval, and not just the President's, for China to join the World Trade Organization.
And earlier this month, as the storm over campaign financing continued to swirl around Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, he moved to shelter himself from it, announcing that he had returned $22,000 in contributions that he had received from some figures who are a focus of the investigation, including John Huang, the former Democratic Party fund-raiser at the center of the controversy.
"It shouldn't be a surprise to Clinton and Gore, but it is breathtaking how aggressive Gephardt has become in the last few weeks," said Thomas M. Mann, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "He is staking out some positions and has made it clear that if Clinton gets anything done in the second term, it's not going to be because of the assistance of his good friend, the minority leader of the House of Representatives."
Since last year's elections, which left Democrats 11 seats shy of regaining control of the House, Mr. Gephardt has visited 14 states trying to recruit candidates who can help the party retake that control and elevate him to Speaker.
Those cross-country travels have also kept him in the public eye far away from Washington, and cemented some strong bonds with leaders like Mr. Burling.
"Dick Gephardt is always impressive -- the man has a mind like a steel spring," Mr. Burling said after accompanying Mr. Gephardt for most of a whirlwind Thursday here that included a news conference, a private meeting with Democratic legislators, a closed-door discussion with prospective Congressional candidates and a visit with the Democratic Governor, Jeanne Shaheen. It was a day that guaranteed Mr. Gephardt statewide media exposure.
Mr. Gephardt has been joined on his travels this week by his new deputy chief of staff, David Plouffe, who has extensive political experience in Iowa and New Jersey and helped run the successful 1988 Iowa campaign of the favorite-son Presidential candidate, Senator Tom Harkin.
Democrats who have been involved in private talks with him on the trip, in either Iowa or New Hampshire, say Mr. Gephardt does not discuss the next Presidential campaign.
Still, State Representative Amanda A. Merrill, the deputy minority leader of the New Hampshire House, said that in the private meeting with Democratic legislators here on Thursday, questions were askedabout Mr. Gephardt's "core values," which in the local political lexicon is an invitation to lay out one's stump speech.
"He talked a lot about family values, education and the lives of our children," Ms. Merrill said.
For his part, Mr. Gephardt insists that his visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, during the first week of Congress's two-week Easter recess, had more to do with coincidence and the opportunity to steal seats in two traditionally Republican fiefs thanwith his own political ambitions.
"The future will take care of itself," he said when "the question" was raised a fifth time on Thursday.
For all of that, trips like this one are not without personal benefits for Mr. Gephardt, who for one thing has received heavy local media attention this week. In Des Moines, the major television station led its evening newscast with an account of a visit by "a former and potential Presidential contender." And here in Concord, where his public appearances were limited to a brief photo op with the Governor and a 10-minute news conference, his visit nonetheless attracted reporters from four national newspapers.
"It is sort of a no-lose situation for Gephardt," said a former senior aide to him. "He still has a lot of friends in Iowa and New Hampshire from 1988. Even if he does not know what he is going to do, you keep in touch with those guys.
"His trips this week are not completely brazen. If you look at John Kerry, Jay Rockefeller, Bill Bradley, you notice that they are also going places that are not politically harmful to be."

Devils Draftee Wins Hobey Baker Award

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, March 28

 BODY:
The Hobey Baker trophy, awarded to college hockey's player of the year, was presented today to Michigan's Brendan Morrison, who may someday play for the Devils.
Morrison, a senior center from Pitt Meadows, British Columbia, and the highest scorer in Michigan history, was drafted by the Devils in the second round in 1993. 
When asked about his future, Morrison said: "I really haven't made up my mind what I'm going to do. Going pro is a possibility, but I haven't heard anything."
His coach, Red Berenson, said the 5-foot-11-inch, 182-pound economics major is "a player that what you see is not what you get."
"When I first saw him he was just a scrawny kid," Berenson said. "I had no idea he was going to be the player he has become."
Morrison's career with the Wolverines ended here Thursday night in bitter circumstances. Michigan, the defending champion, was eliminated in the semifinal round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in a 3-2 loss to Boston University.
"Sometimes the best team doesn't win," Morrison said.
Morrison was made almost invisible by the smothering Terrier defense until the last minute. With 57 seconds to go, he scored the game's last goal. It was his 31st this season in 43 games, the 102d in his four-season career.
His most memorable goal was the 71st. It came a year ago, in overtime against Colorado College in the championship at Cincinnati, which was won by the Wolverines, 3-2.
Morrison, who is the first Michigan player to win the Baker award, led the nation in scoring as a sophomore and again this season.
The award was initiated in 1981 by the sponsoring Decathlon Athletic Club of Bloomington, Minn. The prize is named after a pre-World War I Princeton athlete, who is widely considered the foremost American-born player of this century. Baker, a pilot, was killed in a plane crash a few days after the Armistice in 1918.
The runner-up for the trophy was Boston University's Chris Drury, who was all over the ice in the match against Michigan.
Drury's perfect centering pass to Tommi Degerman set up Degerman's game-winning goal on a power-play in the second period.
Drury, a junior from Trumbull, Conn., has been drafted by the Colorado Avalanche but has not been offered a contract and will most likely play a final season for the Terriers, the Hockey East champions.
Boston University will meet North Dakota of the Western Association in the championship game Saturday afternoon here at Bradley Center.
The Fighting Sioux from Grand Forks, N.D., reached the championship game by defeating Colorado College, 6-2, in another semifinal match.
North Dakota's sophomore center, Jason Blake, was one of the 10 Hobey Baker finalists. The winner was chosen by a panel of coaches, scouts and news media representatives.

HEADLINE: Now, Beijing Hears Another U.S. Voice: Gingrich's

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, March 29

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich told China's Communist Party leaders on Friday that they would have to begin tolerating freedom of speech, assembly and religion if they wanted the respect of Hong Kong, Taiwan and the international community.
Speaking far more bluntly than Vice President Al Gore, who visited China this week, Mr. Gingrich called on China's leaders to release political prisoners, stop arresting religious leaders and cooperate with the United States to track down any "renegade" Chinese officials who might have tried to funnel illegal campaign contributions to American politicians. 
 But at the same time, the Speaker of the House said in an interview here and in a speech to business executives in Hong Kong that Washington sought an approach to China that would promote the rule of law and greater religious freedom. He repeated his Hong Kong speech here this morning to a group of students.
"I mean, we don't want people in jail," he said in an interview at the China World Hotel after his meeting with President Jiang Zemin. "We don't want persecution of people who are engaged in religion." China routinely arrests and persecutes Catholic clerics who are not members of the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association.
Mr. Gingrich said Congress would like to play its own role in opening a dialogue with Chinese leaders under a "coordinated foreign policy" with the Administration. In his speech this morning, he said American emphasis on democracy was "the greatest gift" the United States could give to the world.
The Speaker's muscular formulation of American expectations for China and his commitment to support President Clinton's policy of engagement reflected the political pressure on Mr. Gingrich as he tries to recover from an ethics investigation, even as new criticism arises over his ideological commitment to the "Republican revolution."
His trenchant remarks about repression were an effort to appease the hard-line wing of the Republican Party, which has been calling for a tougher line on China, while his offer to open a new lines of discussion was an attempt to stay within the bounds of statesmanship.
Mr. Gingrich said he had held extensive discussions with President Clinton, Vice President Gore, the State Department and the National Security Council before delivering these messages, but it is not clear how great an expansion of Congressional involvement in China policy he expects.
He said he would "regularly" dispatch Representative Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska, chairman of the House subcommittee on Asia, to consult with Chinese officials on issues of contention. "He's there to help," Mr. Gingrich said. "He's not there to judge. He's not there to interfere."
Like Mr. Gore before him, Mr. Gingrich divided his time between tricky meetings with Chinese leaders and sightseeing excursions. Wearing pin stripes and holding hands with his more casually dressed wife, Marianne, the Speaker led his Congressional flock through the Forbidden City. Chinese tourists were pushed aside by the police.
Naturally, the Speaker with a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in his House office wanted to go to the National History Museum. "Do you want to go see the dinosaurs with me?" he asked reporters excitedly.
Unlike Mr. Gore, who seemed a bit stiff as he pulled out his charts on carbon dioxide emissions, Mr. Gingrich seemed to relish the opportunity to argue history with the Chinese.
"They don't apparently get many historians coming through," he said. "These are people who pride themselves on depth of history, on complexity and thinking strategically, and I think it's been sort of enjoyable to swap."
The arrival in Beijing of Mr. Gingrich and a 12-member bipartisan Congressional delegation followed a four-day visit by Mr. Gore, the highest-level American official to visit China since the Tiananmen massacre of 1989. Mr. Gingrich and his colleagues met on Friday with President Jiang, Prime Minister Li Peng and other senior officials.
Like Mr. Gore, Mr. Gingrich said the Chinese had raised and denied allegations that they had illegally funneled money into American political campaigns.
"I simply said that on the assumption that their Government statement that they were not involved is true, that meant there were apparently renegades that were violating both our law" and Chinese Government policy "and that we would appreciate their help as we seek to determine who these renegades are." The Chinese response "was neither positive nor negative," he said.
Where Mr. Gore gingerly admonished Beijing on the need for political reform and for greater protection of human rights, Mr. Gingrich spoke more bluntly.
"I characterized Hong Kong as an orchid," he said. "It is very delicate, and a giant can crush an orchid while having the best of intentions."
Mr. Gore bypassed Hong Kong on his trip, but Mr. Gingrich stopped there on Thursday to deliver a pointed speech about freedom as the British colony prepares for its return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
"No American leader would be true to our tradition if they came here and congratulated you on your economic achievements without also saying we believe that economic vitality ultimately depends on political and personal freedom," Mr. Gingrich told an American Chamber of Commerce audience. "For that reason, America cannot remain silent about the lack of basic freedom -- speech, religion, assembly, the press -- in China.
"The truth is that any effort to provide a partial freedom to any people, to tell them that they can be free in one sphere but not in another, will ultimately fail. China needs to understand that political freedom must accompany economic freedom."
Mr. Gingrich emphasized his concern about religious freedom, an issue that the right wing of his party has taken up as a cause celebre. Sixty-five members of Congress sent a letter with Mr. Gingrich for delivery to President Jiang saying China's Christians believed that "this is the worst period of persecution for them since the Cultural Revolution." The letter called on China's leaders to recognize "the deep concern in our country and in the U.S. Congress about the increased persecution of those who worship outside the aegis of official churches."
A relaxation of religious persecution began in the 1980's, and millions of Chinese have since joined officially supervised churches, but they have also flocked to underground churches, which are subject to frequent campaigns of repression like the one that has been under way since 1994.
Before his arrival, Mr. Gingrich discussed with aides the idea of inviting leaders of China's underground Roman Catholic Church to meet with him, but he indicated here that the plan had been abandoned as too risky. Instead, he will attend an Easter service at a Government-supervised Protestant church in Shanghai.
"Part of the tightrope we are walking on," Mr. Gingrich said, "is that it is easy for American politicians to come in here and have a nice press event and then leave behind an imprisoned person, and so we are following the embassy's guidance with great care."

HEADLINE: Growing Gap Between Old Allies Creates New Obstacles for Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Less than three years after the United States sent troops here to restore democracy, a bitter and widening dispute between supporters of the country's two most powerful political leaders has broken apart the American-backed ruling coalition and brought the Haitian Government to a virtual standstill.
The political realities of today are a far cry from the one-party dictatorship that opponents of the American intervention predicted in 1994. But the rift between former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the Government of his hand-picked successor, Rene Preval, has provoked economic and political instability and a mounting sense of concern among politicians and diplomats here. 
 The breach became a formal one when Mr. Aristide shifted his allegiance to a new political party, Fanmi Lavalas, while many officials elected under Mr. Aristide's banner have stayed in the original Lavalas Political Organization, which is rallying around Mr. Preval.
"This is really a struggle for hegemony, in which one side will erase the other," said Fritz Robert Saint Paul, a former leader of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the parliament. Alix Fils-Aime, another deputy, added that the split between the two branches of the Lavalas movement, which originally brought Mr. Aristide to power in elections in 1990, "is pure politics and pure opportunism."
Relations between the two camps have frayed to the point that some of Mr. Preval's supporters are now openly blaming Mr. Aristide for fomenting recent outbreaks of violence that have undermined confidence in the current Government, which took office in February 1996.
In the last six weeks, more than 50 people have been killed in unexplained attacks, including six police officers, a Senator's bodyguard and the Justice Ministry's chief of security. [Two more policemen were killed this week.]
One clear byproduct of the split has been virtual paralysis of the legislative branch of Government. Parliament has not met in weeks because neither the Chamber nor the Senate can reach a quorum.
And although some committees are meeting informally, laws needed to comply with international agreements and to rebuild institutions left shattered by years of military dictatorship are not being passed.
Government ministries are short of cash, barely able to pay employees and blocked in their efforts to move ahead with essential economic and development projects that would create jobs and reduce the mounting pressure on the Government.
[On Wednesday the lower house assembled to vote on a no-confidence motion asserting that Prime Minister Rosny Smarth's Government was "incapable of coping with the current social, economic and political disorder and preventing the country from plunging into an ungovernable state." Though the measure was supported by Mr. Aristide's followers, it was defeated, 37-29, with 6 abstentions.]
On the surface, the two wings of the Lavalas movement have taken markedly different stances on some important and controversial political questions like the privatization of state enterprises. With vital foreign assistance linked to the results, Mr. Preval and Mr. Smarth are committed to a program of selling off inefficient Government-owned companies. Mr. Aristide and his followers, on the other hand, have sought to sabotage that effort.
"There is no alternative but to control spending and have more efficient fiscal measures," which foreign donors are demanding as a condition for aid, Mr. Smarth said in an interview. "We have negotiated this program with the international agencies, and since 70 percent of our budget comes from abroad, our latitude is quite limited."
One of the main organizers of the new Lavalas party, diplomats and politicians pointed out, is Fred Joseph, Mr. Preval's own Finance Minister and the official in charge of carrying out privatization. Two other Cabinet ministers are also founding members of the Lavalas Family, suggesting that the split has as much to do with personalities as policy.
Mr. Aristide, who remains the most popular political figure in this country and is widely believed to want to return to power, was not available for an interview. But in remarks this week to a conference of his followers, he appeared to accuse Mr. Smarth and his Cabinet of directing the violence, saying "insecurity is one means they are using to cow us and make us accept" an American-supported plan to restructure the Haitian economy.
The ruling coalition is disintegrating as the American presence and commitment here are declining, with Washington encouraging the United Nations and especially Canada to play more active roles.
[On Wednesday the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, met with Mr. Preval and announced that Canadian troops will remain in Haiti until the end of the year, saying he recognized "there is a need for a longer-term stay to guarantee security."]
Mr. Aristide founded the Lavalas Family in November, describing it then as neither a political party nor a vehicle to advance his personal ambitions. But in January, his closest associates formally registered the new movement as a political party and began recruiting candidates for elections scheduled for April 6, in which members of 500 local councils and one-third of the 27-seat Senate are to be chosen.
Leaders of both camps suggest that the division can be traced back to a 1995 campaign within Lavalas to extend Mr. Aristide's term as President by three years. In forming his Government, Mr. Preval drew mostly from those who opposed the extension, apparently leaving some of Mr. Aristide's most ardent followers feeling neglected.
Kely Bastien, the current leader of the Chamber of Deputies, said that since most of the members of Parliament are from the original Lavalas party, it has an automatic source of power. "Those supporting Aristide don't have access to that power, and they want to use these elections as a way of gaining power," the parliamentary leader said.
But Gerard Pierre-Charles, who is the secretary general of the original Lavalas party, argues that the dispute is much more about basic principles of governance than about spoils. The underlying cause of the breach is "two very distinct concepts or visions of the state, change and power," he said, with Mr. Aristide wanting a situation in which "he decides everything," as Haitian presidents historically have.
"We want to get away from an exaggerated presidentialism that neglects political parties, concentrates power in the figure of one person and takes populist positions," he said. "We want to see a modernization of the state, respect for the system of separation of powers and an end to traditional patronage politics."
The recent acts of violence here are intended to "interrupt the road to institutionalization," Mr. Pierre-Charles said. When asked who was behind such destabilization efforts, he replied, "the people connected to the three years," a reference to Mr. Aristide's unconditional loyalists, and "those sectors which believe democracy has brought them nothing."
Mr. Aristide has particularly distressed former allies by allowing three former officers from the military he once castigated as hopelessly brutal and corrupt to run for Senate seats under his party's banner. One of them, Jean-Marie Fourel Celestin, was appointed chief of the Haitian National Police in 1995, but could not win Senate confirmation because of concerns about his past.
"We rejected him not only because he was incapable of doing the job, but because we heard a lot of disturbing evidence about him, including drug trafficking," said Senator Jean-Robert Sabalat, an independent who in 1991 served as Mr. Aristide's Foreign Minister. "To choose this same man as a candidate now is a deliberate blow to the Senate."
Several political leaders and diplomats argue that Mr. Aristide decided to found a new party because he felt Parliament was becoming too independent and, by seeking to open investigations into allegations of corruption involving those around him, had endangered his own image. The Haitian Constitution prohibits Mr. Aristide from succeeding himself, but he is widely expected to run again in 2000, when Mr. Preval's term expires.
"The man felt that something was being contrived against his person and has reacted," Mr. Fils-Aime said. "He was in a position where he had to flex some muscles."
Mr. Preval's own role throughout the dispute has been ambiguous, political leaders said. He continues to socialize with Mr. Aristide, and some of the officials who support his privatization plan, risking their own political futures by doing so, complain that he and the Cabinet have not made an effective case to the Haitian public in support of their own program.
"Preval likes to swim around the outside" of the split, Mr. Saint Paul said. Circumstances have forced Mr. Preval into an alliance with the original Lavalas party, Mr. Pierre-Charles added, but the President continues to "identify himself ideologically with Aristide" and "is not a party man, and doesn't really like political parties or having to count on one" for support.
"We confront a situation that is very alarming, with the people in power divided and shooting at each other verbally," Mr. Sabalat said. "It is sad, truly a pity, and I don't know how the country can operate on that basis or change into what everyone hoped it would become after the 1990 elections."

HEADLINE: Welfare Family Advocates, Once Allies, Become Rivals

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
The charter buses from New York City rumbled into Albany this week, carrying hundreds of advocates for the poor and disabled. Counselors for battered women and AIDS patients sat side by side, united in their opposition to Gov. George E. Pataki's welfare overhaul plan.
But when the lobbying began, longtime allies became reluctant rivals as they urged legislators to spare their constituents from welfare cuts. 
 The new Federal law that imposes a five-year limit on public assistance allows states to exempt 20 percent of welfare families from that limit. And as legislators weigh the merits of each group, advocates for battered women, advocates for foster parents and advocates for those infected with H.I.V., among others, find themselves competing for consideration.
In their view, they are sparring for space aboard a metaphorical lifeboat, battling over who will be saved (and keep welfare benefits) and who will not (losing them).
"Welfare reform hurts all of us," said Lisa Cortes, the outreach coordinator for the Boriken Neighborhood Health Center in East Harlem, who helped organize the group trip to Albany on Tuesday. "But you can't help but think, "Who is going to be saved?' "
As the nation's welfare recipients march steadily toward the day when benefits will cease, advocates and legislators across the country are struggling to decide: Which needy groups deserve continued public assistance in the new welfare world?
"We're playing God in some respects," said Rhoda S. Jacobs, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who as chairwoman of the Assembly's Social Services Committee has listened to the advocates' pleas. "It's a terrible choice to have to make. It's very painful."
In New York, where about 400,000 households currently receive public assistance, only 80,000 could be exempted from time limits if benefits were stopped today, said John Signor, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget.
With so few seats, the lifeboat is likely to fill up fast. Advocates for battered women, for instance, say that victims of domestic violence are the heads of about 30 percent of all welfare families and could easily consume the coveted exemption slots.
Advocates for AIDS patients say that 20 percent of welfare recipients may be H.I.V. positive. "That's your 20 percent right there," said Michael Kink, the legislative counsel for Housing Works, an AIDS advocacy group.
Advocates for foster parents, on the other hand, say the number of foster parents caring for toddlers or children with disabilities is so small -- fewer than 7,000 families -- that no one would be hurt by their inclusion. "We're not asking for much," Edith Holzer, a spokeswoman for the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, said.
So far, Mr. Pataki has suggested exemptions for those people whose physical or mental disabilities prevent them from working. Some Democrats in the Assembly, including Ms. Jacobs, favor exempting victims of domestic violence, among others. The Republican leadership in the Senate has yet to say which group it will support.
Some groups would clearly overlap. The sickest AIDS patients and the most psychologically damaged battered women would qualify for exemptions under Mr. Pataki's plan, or for aid from the Federal disability program. But advocates worry that many people who deserve extra help would not meet those strict criteria.
Legislators and the Governor are expected to resolve those issues during negotiations over welfare legislation intended to bring the state into conformity with the new Federal law. Legislators in both parties said the final measure would most likely include language giving certain groups special consideration for the exemptions, but leaving it up to the counties, which administer the programs, to apply the guidelines.
For those who fail to win exemptions, Mr. Pataki has promised to invest $1.2 billion in a program that would offer vouchers for essentials like food, clothing and shelter when benefits run out. But advocates say that system would be inadequate.
That leaves advocates for drug addicts, for the disabled, for the chronically unemployed and for the homeless, among others, jockeying for the exemptions.
It is a polite but unsavory competition, and many lobbyists prefer to tiptoe around the topic and each other, avoiding any talk of division in the ranks. In the position papers they send churning through legislators' fax machines and in their conversations with politicians, they are careful to push their own causes rather than attacking those of others, emphasizing collective protest whenever possible.
"We shouldn't have to compete within this narrow window of exemptions, but we do," said Fred Brancato, the executive director of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies in Manhattan. "Everyone is being squeezed into a tiny box and the reality is that not everyone will fit."
No one knows how many heads of household will fail to find work when benefits cease, or which groups will be disproportionately affected. In the absence of such data, some states, like Michigan, have simply opted to put off their decisions until later.
New Jersey, on the other hand, has already decided to exempt the elderly, the chronically unemployed, those with physical or mental disabilities that prevent them from working and those who care for the incapacitated -- though officials acknowledge that these exemptions may change. In that state, too, advocates lobbied fiercely for their collective and individual interests.
"We told them, 'We're not going to take this competition; we can't afford to exempt everybody,' " said Kathy Krepsio, the director of policy and planning for New Jersey's Department of Human Services.
In New York, advocates joined forces months ago to attack Mr. Pataki's plan, which proposes sharp reductions in welfare benefits even before the five year cutoff mark. They have urged the Governor to use state funds, which would not be subject to Federal time limits, to expand benefits for the needy. And they have charged that the Governor's plan, which would also exempt people over 60 and those who care for disabled children, is far too limited.
"We're all in this boat together," said Mr. Kink of the Housing Works group. "The hope is that we'll work our way out of it rather than fight our way out of it."
Some say battered women have the best chance of winning exemptions because the Federal welfare law urges states to grant them special consideration. But even their advocates take nothing for granted.
"There are so many people who are legitimately in need that battered women are essentially competing for inclusion in that 20 percent," said Patti Jo Newell, the spokeswoman for the New York State Coalition against Domestic Violence.
"It's an uncomfortable concept and an uncomfortable reality," she said. "Everybody's scrambling. It's terrible."

OUT OF AMERICA
 A Black Man Confronts Africa.
 By Keith B. Richburg.
 257 pp. New York:
 A New Republic Book/Basic Books. $23. 
 I still remember a story Keith B. Richburg did for The Washington Post in late 1993. It was about the death of a 65-year-old Somali man who happened to be standing in the doorway of a Mogadishu pharmacy when a passing patrol of United Nations peacekeepers, having heard two shots, opened fire. The story was a small but devastating indictment of the United Nations force's "rules of engagement," and it exemplified the dogged, passionate reporting that Mr. Richburg did in Somalia from 1992 to 1994, while he was The Post's Africa bureau chief.
"Out of America: A Black Man Confronts Africa" is a memoir, organized more or less chronologically, of the years that Mr. Richburg, who is a black American, spent in Africa. Surprisingly, it retains almost nothing of the careful, fact-chasing spirit of his daily reporting -- though it does shed some light on how that reporting was done. Being black was sometimes an advantage, he writes, because it let him move unnoticed through places where his white colleagues in the foreign press could not easily go, which "helped me get some of my best firsthand reporting details." But being a black reporter in black Africa was more often a disadvantage, he says. It made the job more dangerous, threatening to land him in the middle of ethnic disputes when he was mistaken for an African, and emboldening bureaucrats and border guards to hassle him in ways that they would not hassle whites. Local politicians, he suspects, dumped more of their anti-white paranoia on him than they did on white colleagues. Above all, there was the persistent low-grade identity crisis he suffered as he struggled to define his relationship to the continent of his ancestors.
This crisis, which inspires repeated heartfelt assertions of Mr. Richburg's happiness to be an American, clearly accounts for some of his book's overwhelmingly bleak, almost phobic depiction of Africa. The big stories he covered -- famine and civil war in Somalia, genocide in Rwanda, cholera in Zaire, civil war in Liberia -- did nothing, for obvious reasons, to lighten his view.
There was irony in Mr. Richburg's landing in Africa. As he tells it, his reason for becoming a foreign correspondent in the first place was to "escape America's race wars, escape the pressure to choose sides." He'd been feeling this pressure since his school days, when other black kids resented his white friends, and it had followed him to The Post, where, covering city politics, he resented the inner-city view that he was "brainwashed" and working for Whitey. He found relief during an assignment in Asia, but the racial pressure found him again in Africa, where "various African despots and their spokesmen . . . suggested somehow that as a black reporter, I was supposed to report more favorably on them." There were also the delegations of well-heeled black Americans visiting countries like Gabon and the Sudan, gullibly toasting the local dictators. It is easy then to share Mr. Richburg's disgust and outrage.
His own take on Africa is, unfortunately, often as unsubtle as that of the Afrocentric ground-kissers. Disappointed by the failure of the multinational intervention in Somalia, he concludes, stunningly, that "in Somalia, there aren't any good guys, just varying gradations of evil." Noting that Hutu militiamen are carrying clubs in Rwanda, he is reminded of "The Flintstones": "The country has reverted to prehistoric times, to a kind of sick version of Bedrock." After reviewing the Hutu extremists' murderous methods, he even contends that "fully evolved human beings in the 20th century don't do things like that." (Are the Hutus, then, subhuman? And the Nazis and the Khmer Rouge, were they subhuman too?)
Mr. Richburg's prose, when he forsakes the newsman's terse, impersonal style, lacks the weight to carry major themes. And in his determination to show just how hopeless, how horrifying present-day Africa is -- "I want to put it all right out here, right in your face" --he falls frequently into bathos and shaky surmise. Watching people starve in Somalia, he asks, "Does anyone care about their names?" In fact Somalia is a country where family and clan -- and names -- count for everything. His free-swinging, ahistorical asides on American virtue -- "in America, we don't reach for our pangas if our tribe loses the election" -- also come across as gratuitous. At times he lets his polemic carry him far beyond the facts. "It often occurred to me that my yearly bill for dog food and veterinary bills probably exceeded what most African governments spend on health care." This is the sort of thing you hear grumpy, ill-informed expatriates and old colonials mutter all over Africa. Indeed, by the end of "Out of America" we have Mr. Richburg in South Africa sympathizing with whites there who fret that "Africa" is coming to get them.
To his credit, Mr. Richburg lays out his own confusion and guilt about saying some of the things he does. "I found myself thinking things that one shouldn't really be thinking, feeling what I know must not be felt." He doesn't pretend to feel more than he does at Goree Island, the old embarkation point off the coast of Senegal for slaves being shipped to the New World. While he is adamant that he is "not making a defense of slavery," he is candid about his gratitude that his ancestors made it to America. He is also candid about feeling "cynical, jaded" and elsewhere "bitter and largely devoid of hope, and largely drained of compassion" -- a condition for which he blames "Africa" entirely.
His claims to be revealing unpopular truths about the dire state of Africa -- "I'm trying to tell it to you straight" -- ring hollow, however, in an era when writing off Africa (and much of the rest of the third world) has long been a popular exercise in the more truculent journals and think tanks of the developed world. Mr. Richburg lambastes whites in the West who, for fear of appearing racist, hesitate to place responsibility for Africa's woes on African shoulders, and then he extends this criticism to white Americans who are allegedly afraid to hold black Americans responsible for their own woes. He himself has some stern things to say about various hot-button topics in black America -- separatism, dependency, paranoia (he's against all three) -- but seems conveniently unaware that he is in comfortable, tenured company saying them.
What he doesn't have much to say about, oddly enough, is Africa. Shocking images, bitter jibes and bits of potted history amount to little, finally, in a book that remains, in the preferred mode of American publishing today, relentlessly focused on the author's thoughts and feelings. There are few characters of any heft in this fervently self-absorbed volume, few whole scenes, scant dialogue -- almost no concrete sense, really, of how things look and sound and feel, or of how ordinary Africans live. But Africa, for all its political and economic problems, is far more than the sum of its horrors. It is a place of staggering complexity, natural beauty and intense sensuality -- all of which Mr. Richburg seems too busy with his jeremiad to notice.
And when he widens his lens to compare, at some length, the postwar economic performances of East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (finding Africa, of course, severely wanting), he fails to take into account some of the most basic factors, like climate, soil and irrigation, that have so far helped prevent African agriculture from achieving its own green revolution, without which prosperity will never come. Indeed, he doesn't even mention agriculture in this discussion, preferring to focus on the shortcomings of African "culture."
Much of Africa is in awful shape, clearly. War, corruption, hunger, disease, environmental destruction and a world economy increasingly indifferent to African products and markets have all contributed to a broad decline in the quality of life for many Africans. Mr. Richburg cites a few countries not currently trapped in the downward spiral -- South Africa and Zimbabwe, where white businessmen still essentially control the economies; Malawi, where a dictator was democratically overthrown; and Mozambique, where decades of war recently ended -- as exceptions that, somehow, prove the rule. In fact, many other countries -- Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Senegal, Benin, Ivory Coast -- are stable or finding their feet. Keith Richburg may have stayed true to his own experience with this wildly overdrawn portrait of Africa's agonies, but he has poorly served both his American readers and his subject.

The Trouble With School Testing Systems

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
LIKE students everywhere, Robert Sternberg hates tests. But as a parent, a professor and a taxpayer, he is also sympathetic to adults' need to know just what they are getting for their investment.
Professor Sternberg, the I.B.M. professor of psychology and education at Yale, believes the desire for accountability in American education is overdue. "Having a standard that you're held to always makes sense," he said. 
 "The problem is that the standard they are being held to isn't the right standard," he said. As for the familiar tests: "They are the wrong measurement. They measure trivial facts."
In his latest book, "Successful Intelligence: How Practical and Creative Intelligence Determine Success in Life" (Simon and Schuster), Professor Sternberg dismisses the Scholastic Aptitude Test, Graduate Record Exam, Law School Admission Test and the Medical College Admission Test, all perhaps better knows by their acronyms: S.A.T.'s, G.R.E.'s, LSAT's and MCAT's.
Professor Sternberg has discussed testing with his two children, Seth, 18 and recently accepted at Yale for next fall, and Sara, 16. "I told them there's more to life, more to successful intelligence, than just these test scores. Doing well is a kind of game, a stupid game. Kids all know what going on," he said.
Recently Professor Sternberg discussed his ideas about testing and how to change and improve educational assessment. Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. Why do you object to standardized tests?
A. Together, tests of practical, creative and analytical intelligence are much greater predictors of success in life than those standardized exams, which only measure analytical intelligence. Abilities are more predicative of success than test scores. Unfortunately, testing is becoming even more important, with greater emphasis on S.A.T.'s, and in Connecticut on the Mastery Tests.
The field of psychology has grown and developed considerably during the last 50 years. But I.Q. tests like the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children used in elementary school have remained essentially the same since the 1940's.
College admissions tests have not evolved either. The S.A.T. in use today is not significantly different from the test introduced by Carl Brigham in 1930's. That's a disgrace.
The testing industry also determines the academic and employment future of America's children. At the end of secondary school students who want to continue must take standardized tests. Only a handful of American colleges and universities, including Bowdoin and Bates in Maine, have made admissions tests optional. For most, the tests are still mandatory.
I have no problem with appropriate testing. I think testing in general is fine. I have a problem with the narrowness of the current tests.
Q. Why does the testing industry appear uninterested in research and development?
A. They are a well entrenched monopoly. They have no competition; why should they change? It is alarming! Research and theory in psychology have moved since the 1930's, but to translate the ideas into tests is simply too expensive.
Q. Who are the testing companies?
A. Ability testing companies, achievement testing companies and the textbook companies are all the same companies. That tells you something. When you have the same companies serving all three functions, it creates a potential conflict of interest situation. How could it not?
We have created that system. It's not a natural born system. It was not handed down by the invisible hand of God. If you went back 40 years, we used parental socio-economic status, religion, race, which all still count to some extent. Now we rely on test scores.
Q. Who performs the worst on standardized tests?
A. The students who lose out tend to include more minority students and those who attend less affluent schools. It is also true that students possessed of a more creative or practical turn of mind do less well than their classmates. They are not viewed as smart in their own schools, they are not often the top grade getters.
I was considered a mediocre student in elementary school in New Jersey. I got low I.Q. scores. After that teachers treated me like a dummy. So I started acting like a dummy. I had a fourth grade teacher who expected more, and then I became a high performer. If I hadn't had her I would have gone through school as a poor student.
This is about wasted talent. Sadly these students who do poorly just think they're dumb.
Some students do succeed in spite their inability to perform on simple analytical tests but they are the exception and it is a stupid way to run an educational system. It is a system that is set up so that we waste talent as a nation. We have no call to waste talent; we need all the talent we have.
Q. Who is responsible for this situation? Is it teachers?
A. I do not blame teachers as much as anxious parents who worry that their children will not perform well on admissions tests and get into "the right colleges." The result is that we have created a closed system. Textbooks emphasize conventional analytical abilities, teachers are trained to teach to students strong in analytical skills and then achievement is measured according to this single criteria.
Q. What do you think of the Connecticut Mastery Tests?
A. It is a step above the conventional fact test but I dislike multiple-choice tests by themselves. America is almost unique in relying upon multiple-choice tests. For example, at the college level in England they use all essay tests.
Q. Is teaching style significant in test performance?
A. In a research study funded by the Federal Office of Educational Research and Improvement, we studied a group of high school students who took a Yale summer course taught in four different styles. One style emphasized simple memorization of facts, the other three stressed the use of analytical, practical or creative abilities.
We saw the worst way to learn was solely through simple memorization. The best results came when teachers matched their teaching style to students' learning style. When kids are taught and assessed in a way that matches their pattern of ability they perform at higher levels. Every kid will do better.
This matching is particularly promising for reaching bored and frustrated students who might do so poorly in school they drop out. Everyone can benefit when creative and practical abilities are recognized.
Q. Do you believe that practical and creative intelligence are equal to analytical intelligence?
A. I believe practical and creative intelligence are at least as important as analytical skills. Think about any field. These talents are critical in to occupations like psychologist, lawyer, doctor, salesperson, clerk.
Measures of practical intelligence predict job performance at least as well as or better than I.Q.
Q. What if a person is really missing one or two of the three types of intelligence?
A. I seek out people to work with me who complement my own pattern of abilities and styles. The really smart person is the one who capitalizes on strengths and compensates for and remediates weaknesses. Compensation means working with people who are good at what you not good at.
Q. How does the United States compare internationally in teaching styles?
A. In international comparisons United States students often score behind other countries. American teachers spend more time and deliver more information than the Japanese but in Japan they take time to carefully go through errors on tests. They have the kids reason through the problem. Although teachers know that it would be helpful to emphasize the full process of understanding, teachers tell me they do not have time. They must get through a certain amount of curriculum. It's ironic that teachers believe that if they give more time to the process rather than reaching the correct answer students will miss out.

 BODY:

Victoriana in London
Q. I will be in London in late May, and would like to see the intact upper-middle-class Victorian house that has been preserved and made accessible by a member of Lord Snowdon's family. Could you give details? And perhaps suggest a restaurant or pub where one might further capture the feeling of the era? -- Jan E. Adlmann, Santa Fe, N.M.
A. You must be thinking of Linley Sambourne House, once owned by Lord Snowdon's great-grandfather Edward Linley Sambourne, a successful artist and cartoonist for Punch. Situated at 18 Stafford Terrace in Kensington, west London, it belonged to the family from the 1870's until 1978, when it was offered to the nation by the Countess of Rosse, Mr. Sambourne's granddaughter. (A footnote of interest to Americans: Mr. Sambourne's father, Edward Mott Sambourne, was born in Easton, Pa.)
The Greater London Council bought the property, transferring it in the 1980's to the Kensington and Chelsea Council, with the agreement that the property would be administered by the Victorian Society, a nonprofit charity that campaigns for the protection of important Victorian and Edwardian buildings. 
 Very little has been changed in Linley Sambourne House, which still contains much of its original bric-a-brac, according to Richard Seedhouse, administrator of the Victorian Society. He describes the house as "probably the best-preserved middle-class townhouse in Britain."
Built in the 1870's, the four-floor house is typical of its date and situation: Italianate in style, with molded stucco ornamentation on a structure of gray Suffolk brick. All eight rooms above basement level may be seen.
The house has stained-glass windows, original William Morris wallpapers, period furniture and a cornucopia of ornaments, lamps and knickknacks, including Neapolitan copies of Etruscan vases, Japanese vases, a French Boulle clock and a bronze nymph by Barbedienne, as well as ceramics and memorabilia.
The house is open from March 1 until the end of October on Wednesdays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sundays from 2 to 5 P.M. Admission $5, based on $1.67 to the British pound. The closest Underground stop is High Street Kensington. Information: the Victorian Society, 1 Priory Gardens, London W4 1TT; telephone (44-181) 9941019.
There are a number of intact Victorian pubs in the city, but none is particularly close to the house, Mr. Seedhouse said. He recommends the Princess Louise, 208 High Holborn, WC1, (44-171) 4058816, for its magnificent interiors. The closest Underground station is Holborn.
 
'Saturday Night' Seats
Q. Is it possible to get tickets to see "Saturday Night Live" this summer? I'll be in New York City between mid-June and early September. -- Andrew Wright, Chicago
A. Alas, your trip coincides neatly with rerun season. The only way you would stand a chance would be to arrive earlier or stay later. The last show of the current season is May 17; the date for the first show of the 1997-98 season had not been set in late March, but it is usually in late September.
Even if you were to reschedule your trip, it would not be easy to get seats. Requests are accepted by postcard only, and only during the month of August (one postcard per person). Tickets are awarded by lottery throughout the season, and winners are notified one to two weeks in advance. They receive two tickets to either the live show or the dress rehearsal.
Standby tickets offer another opportunity to attend the show, though they do not guarantee admission. They are distributed for both the rehearsal and the live show on the morning of the show at 9:15 A.M. at the 49th Street entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. One standby ticket is issued per person.
Write NBC Studios, Saturday Night Live, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10112.
A taped message describes the ticket procedure for this and other shows in detail; the number is (212) 664-4000.
 
The Train in Spain
Q. We will be in Spain in May and June, based in Malaga, and would like to tour the country by train. We are not under 26, but would like to buy a pass for unlimited travel within the country. Also, we would like to attend Corpus Christi in Toledo; can you find out the dates? -- Mary Saavedra, New York, N.Y.
A. Actually, of the many rail passes sold in the United States by Rail Europe, only a few carry an age restriction (under 26); most are available to travelers of any age.
Two passes for travel exclusively within Spain are the Spain Flexipass, which allows three days of rail travel in a two-month period, for $144 in second class and $180 in first class; up to seven extra days may be purchased for $32 and $40 a day respectively. So 10 days of rail travel would cost $368 in second class, $460 in first.
The other pass is a Rail 'n Drive pass that combines three days' train travel and two days' Avis car rental with unlimited mileage in Spain. The logic is to use the rail pass for the long hauls and the car for side trips.
Travelers have two months to complete their travel; the price starts at $199 a person for each of two adults in second class, $229 in first class, with a minimum car. An economy car with manual transmission, such as an Opel Corsa, is included in the lowest price; upgraded cars are available. With the most expensive car, a small automatic, the pass costs $249 for each of two people in second class, $279 in first class.
Prices are lower for the third and fourth people in a group. Up to seven extra rail days may also be added to this pass, as can additional days of car rental.
The passes (including the extra days) must be purchased in the United States before departure. For additional information and reservations, call (800) 438-7245. There is also a Rail Europe Web site at http:// www.raileurope.com
According to the Tourist Office of Spain, this year's Corpus Christi processions will take place on June 1 throughout the country, including in Seville, Cordoba, Santiago de Compostela, Avila, Burgos and Valladolid. In Toledo, the monumental silver-gilt monstrance normally displayed in the Cathedral Museum is taken out and paraded through the town. Streets are covered with white awnings, the ground is carpeted with flowers and herbs, and a bullfight is customarily held in the evening. JANET PIORKO

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Alaska Airlines Opens Russia's 'Wild East'

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

 BODY:
FOR most of the 20th century, Russia's Far East has been off limits to Americans. The closest part of Russia to the United States, Russia east of Siberia, seemed also the most forbidding. Among its sites: Magadan, port of entry to Stalin's Arctic gold mines; Sakhalin Island, home base to the Soviet fighter that shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007; and Vladivostok, a city closed to all Westerners when it was home port to the Soviet Pacific fleet.
But the ice curtain has melted, and Alaska Airlines is building a network of flights between Seattle and Anchorage and Russia's back door. 
 It began flying there in 1991. In its latest expansion, it will offer weekly service starting on May 10 from Seattle and Anchorage to the airline's fifth destination in the region, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the provincial capital of Sakhalin Island.
In another innovation, this summer Americans holding multiple-entry visas will be able to city-hop within Russia on Alaska Airlines.
The airline, which says it makes money on its Russian routes, has built its service gradually. In 1991, summer service started to two cities: Magadan, a sister city to Anchorage, and Khabarovsk, a European-style interior city is the industrial and commercial hub for Russia's Far East.
In 1993, to facilitate trans-Pacific tourism and trade, Russia opened a consulate in Seattle and the United States opened a consulate in Vladivostok. That year, Alaska Airlines started flying to "Vlad," a hilly city overlooking the Pacific that once was known as Russia's San Francisco. After consolidating summer service, the airline started year-round flights in 1994.
The following year, the airline added Petropavlovsk, the largest city on Kamchatka Peninsula. Noted for smoking volcanoes and active geyser fields, Kamchatka recently was added to Unesco's list of places of outstanding universal value.
Now, with American oil companies starting to drill on Sakhalin, the airline plans to fly to the island. "With direct service between Anchorage and Yuzhno, it will allow the oilfield support companies to arrive there in six hours, ready to do business," said Douglas K. Barry, a professor at the University of Alaska Center for International Business. "As the oil projects go on line, traffic will grow enormously."
Building a flight network to Russia's Wild East has been as bumpy as its airfields. When an inaugural flight was to land three summers ago in Petropavlovsk, ground authorities told the pilot that he did not have landing rights, forcing him to turn the jet, loaded with dignitaries, back to Anchorage.
A few years earlier, when Alaska Airlines' inaugural flight landed in Magadan, there was no de-icing service at the airport, 400 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
"The pilot rounded up every bottle of vodka around, and sprayed it on the wings with a garden hose," Professor Barry recalled. "That's the pioneering spirit. Now the flights are predictable as clockwork."
The flights have helped to thaw relations between the United States and Russia's Far East, a vast and isolated region where 7 million people are sprinkled over an area two-thirds the size of the lower 48 states.
During the summer high season, Alaska Airlines offers two flights a week to most of its destinations. After September, it falls back to once-a-week service. Year round, the airline flies McDonnell-Douglas MD-80 jets.
Aeroflot, the sole competitor on the trans-Pacific routes, offers one flight a week from Seattle and Anchorage to three Russian destinations: Khabarovsk, Magadan and Vladivostok.
Aeroflot, which flies Russian-made jets, charges about $900 for its round-trip economy fares, about $200 less than Alaska Airlines's comparable fares.
The Russian Far East is slowly drawing a hardy band of business and adventure travelers. To fill a growing need, two English guidebooks cover the region:
"The Russian Far East," a highly readable 320-page guide written by an American couple living in Vladivostok, Allegra and Erik Azulay. (Hippocrene Books, 1995)
"The Russian Far East: A Business Reference Guide," a bible for telephone numbers and economic data. Elisa Miller, the editor, has prepared an updated edition that will be available May 1. Available from Russian Far East Update, a Seattle-based business bulletin. Information: (206) 447-2668.

HEADLINE: The View From: Waterford;
Prison Partners Make a Renovation

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
AT the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theater Center in Waterford, an 18-room Victorian mansion called Ironsides and a little stone-walled cemetery overlook grassy fields that stretch to a beach on Long Island Sound. There, with help from a prison, a long-stalled renovation is under way.
William O. Taylor of Massachusetts established the cemetery so that he could rebury the remains of his deceased relatives, including those of his grandfather, at what was once his grandfather's estate. He also donated $100,000 toward renovating Ironsides. The physical work -- from hauling heavy trash to finishing delicate woodwork -- is mostly done by inmates. 
 Such partnerships of private money and public labor may be a bit unusual, but they're fine with all concerned. The renovation is expected to be completed by June, the workers are learning a lot, and there's now another nice twist to the tale of two men who were never nice to each other -- Mr. Taylor's grandfather, Edward Crowninshield Hammond and Eugene O'Neill.
Around 1914, O'Neill was a young man who often sneaked onto -- and was thrown off -- the private beach belonging to Hammond, a railroad tycoon. Later the playwright would satirize Hammond, and Yankee millionaires in general, in his plays. Today the old Hammond estate is Waterford Beach Park, where the O'Neill Center leases buildings and about 10 of the park's 90 acres from the town, for a nominal fee. The center is known especially for helping playwrights develop their work.
For the O'Neill, as for most arts organizations today, financial support can be hard to find. "You have to be resourceful," said Stephen Wood, president of the center. The center began work on Ironsides several years ago, to provide much needed conference rooms, guest rooms and rehearsal space. But it took Mr. Taylor's gift, along with about $100,000 worth of donated labor, to "make the economics work," Mr. Wood said.
After years in which problems like water damage were getting worse, Ironsides is now getting spiffier by the week.
On a cold morning, Paul McMasters of Waterford, a restoration carpenter who's in charge of the renovation, made his way past bins of trash and piles of wood. He eyed stained-glass windows, arched doorways and tiled fireplaces; he studied paint samples in yellow, gold, bronze and a crimson called pigeon's blood. Everywhere, workers climbed ladders, lugged plywood, cut sheetrock and scraped and sanded assorted surfaces.
In an upstairs hall Mr. McMasters helped Fernando Santiago do some measuring in an area that needed attention before carpeting could be laid. "The floor's a bit rough," said Mr. Santiago, "so we're going to put in some one-inch plywood."
Nearby, Samuel DeLaTorre was sanding shutters. "The primer coat was too thick in places; I'm getting it nice and smooth," Mr. DeLaTorre said.
Mr. Santiago and Mr. DeLaTorre are on the inmate crews that arrive daily from the Gates Correctional Institution in Niantic. Other workers come -- although not as often -- from the Alternative Incarceration Center in New London, where people do community service instead of going to jail. Also helping -- with wiring, plumbing and drafting -- are students from the Ella T. Grasso/ Southeastern Regional Vocational Technical School in Groton. Local stores have also assisted; one, for instance, lends items like sanders to the project and sends personnel to demonstrate their use.
"This is a nice place to come out and work," said Mr. Santiago. "Paul is a nice guy to work for; he teaches you. Once you learn, he lets you do the job." Mr. Santiago, who likes the view of the Sound and the friendliness of the O'Neill staff, expects his renovation experience to be a help when he gets out of prison. "It's a start," he said.
"They keep me busy," said Mr. DeLaTorre. "They keep me positive."
Mr. McMasters -- known for wearing shorts, no matter what the weather -- said that in eight months, workers from Gates put in 3,250 hours of labor at Ironsides; workers from A.I.C. put in 340. "These guys work out well," he said. "They're not just getting out of jail and having a nice time. I send in work reports; I give them honest reports." He noted that besides learning specific skills, the inmates are getting accustomed to working with care and being treated with courtesy. "I have people here," he said, "that I don't think were ever treated with 'please' and 'thank you.' " The inmate workers have lunch every day in the O'Neill dining room.
Mary K. Maynard, deputy warden at Gates, said that five state prisons send crews of inmates to work on projects for public agencies or nonprofit groups. In the two years that Gates has participated, 376 inmates have worked on 78 different projects. The state pays inmates about $2.25 a day, for work within prison or outside. Working outside, "in a normal environment," Ms. Maynard said, is positive. What's perhaps more important, she said, they learn "that they have something to give."
She stressed that jobs aren't being taken away from regular workers. The inmate crews tackle jobs that otherwise just wouldn't get done, she said.
Thomas A. Sheridan, Waterford's First Selectman, agreed. "Nonprofits are hurting these days; this is a wonderful help to the O'Neill," he said. Of the inmate crews, he added: "Mostly, they're kids who made a stupid decison. It would be wise for Connecticut or any state to boost programs like these."
The only slightly unsettling feature of the project, said Mr. Sheridan, was the cemetery work: "You have concerns about moving dead people around."
Until last fall, the remains of Mr. Taylor's grandfather and other relatives -- and those of a family chauffeur -- were in Cedar Grove Cemetery in New London. But there had been some vandalism there, and Mr. Taylor, the publisher of the Boston Globe, thought of his grandfather's estate.
"He would always be there in the summers," said George White, a Waterford native and the founder of the O'Neill center. "We played together." Mr. Taylor pledged $10,000 a year until his death to maintain a small cemetery and its surroundings at the O'Neill; he also put $50,000 in an account to draw interest and provide maintenance after his death. He, his wife and another family member will eventually join the 13 others in the cemetery.
As for the family that lent its name to the mansion, "The Ironsides were related to the Hammonds," Mr. White said. Their house stood across the road and in 1987 was donated to the O'Neill by developers who'd bought the property and were selling off building lots. In August 1987 the 240-ton structure was moved to the theater center's grounds overlooking the beach.
As a young man, Eugene O'Neill loved that beach. A poem, "Upon Our Beach," went to his girlfriend, Beatrice Ashe, noted Lois McDonald, associate curator of the Monte Cristo Cottage in New London, where the O'Neill family summered. But, she noted, "He knew he wasn't welcome."
Years later, O'Neill based two unpleasant characters in his plays -- Harker in "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and Harder in "Moon for the Misbegotten" -- on Hammond and Hammond's even wealthier neighbor, Edward S. Harkness.
Still more years later, Stephen Wood stood in front of Ironsides. He gazed from the front doors, with their images of Eugene Gladstone O'Neill, to the nearby plot with the grave of Edward Crowninshield Hammond. "They're back together," he said, smiling.

For the Fabulous Eggs, The Magic Only Grows

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
THE RUSSIAN JEWELER Peter Carl Faberge never publicized the exquisite Easter eggs that he made for clients in turn-of-the-century St. Petersburg. He shrouded their production in secrecy, even refusing to reveal to his royal patrons, Aleksandr III and Nicholas II, which tiny surprises he was concealing inside the eggs -- a thimble-size palace, perhaps, or a gilded carriage, or an entire train.
His wizardry worked; these bejeweled fantasies enchanted the Empresses Mariya and Aleksandra, to whom the eggs were given from 1885 to 1916. The Imperial clients were secretive, too. They never told the Russian people about the eggs and kept them in their private apartments, out of sight of palace visitors. The public's only glimpses of the eggs were mainly at the Exposition Internationale Universelle in Paris in 1900, at which Faberge was awarded a gold medal and the Legion of Honor, and at a 1902 charity benefit in St. Petersburg. 
 Indeed, it was not until after the Russian Revolution and Faberge's death, in 1920, that the eggs came to wider public attention. Newly available documents now show that Faberge made at least 50 Imperial eggs, of which 40 survive. Born of the lurid curiosity about the Romanovs' excessive life style and their horrible deaths, the fascination with the eggs continues to grow as more details of their history and their owners emerge.
"They are magical toys that fuel the mystique surrounding Faberge's works today," said Alexis de Tiesenhausen, Christie's Russian-art specialist.
Since 1987, with the beginnings of glasnost, Faberge's works have become increasingly more visible at museums and in the marketplace. "Faberge in America," the largest such exhibition ever held in this country, opened last year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art before moving on to museums in San Francisco, Richmond, New Orleans and Cleveland, where it will close in May. The show has so far drawn about 900,000 visitors.
Several auctions at Christie's in Geneva have rewritten the records for Faberge. In 1989, the Kelch Pine Cone Egg brought $3.1 million, and five years later the Imperial Winter Egg was sold for $5.6 million.
Now the Pine Cone Egg is back at Christie's, this time in New York. Enameled in blue and awash with swags of diamonds, the egg opens to reveal a walnut-size automaton in the shape of a silver elephant with an Indian passenger on its back; when wound, it sways, swishes its tail and lumbers forward. The Pine Cone Egg is the finest of the seven made a century ago for Faberge's wealthiest clients, Aleksandr Ferdinandovich Kelch, a gold-mining industrialist, and his wife, Barbara.
It will be auctioned on April 15 for Joan Kroc, the former owner of the San Diego Padres and the widow of Ray Kroc, who was founder of the McDonald's fast-food chain. She had been the high bidder in 1989; later that year, she exhibited it with 25 other Easter eggs, mostly from the Kremlin and the Forbes Magazine Collection, at Treasures of the Soviet Union, the San Diego arts festival. Mrs. Kroc, who maintains that the Kelch egg is as good as any made for the Romanovs, has not said why she is selling it. Christie's estimates that it will bring more than she paid for it: $3.5 million to $4.5 million.
Timed to coincide with the auction is the publication of yet another book on the subject, "The Faberge Imperial Easter Eggs" (Christie's, $125). It is the first to incorporate the new findings on Faberge from the Russian Government archives. The book is a collaboration of Tatiana Faberge, a great-grandddaughter of the jeweler, Lynette G. Proler, a Faberge dealer in Dallas who was the principal writer, and Valentin V. Skurlov, who did extensive study on Faberge and his clients in the official Russian archives.
What has come to light from the archives so far is the stuff of soap opera. Barbara Kelch, a mining heiress, left her husband and Russia in 1905, when she moved to Paris after much of her fortune was wiped out during the Russo-Japanese War. In 1920, she sold her Faberge eggs there.
ALEKSANDR KELCH HAD A harder time: unemployed for years, he ended up selling cigarettes on the streets of St. Petersburg in 1925. In 1930, he was arrested, tried and convicted of sedition by the Communists for corresponding with his former wife in Paris. He was sentenced to hard labor in Siberia, where he is believed to have died.
Mr. Skurlov's investigation also uncovered many invoices for the Imperial Easter eggs but none for the Resurrection Egg and the Cuckoo Egg, more recently called the Chanticleer Egg, both of which are in the Forbes Collection in New York. While Mr. Skurlov has no doubts that Faberge made them, he suggests that they were commissioned by Kelch, not the royal family.
Christopher Forbes, vice chairman of Forbes, dismisses Mr. Skurlov's suggestion. "Until we have fuller documentation, the debate is still open," he said. "Both eggs were identified as Imperial when two of Faberge's sons were still alive."
But he is still impressed by the public interest in the subject. "Every time I think this is the last hurrah for Faberge," he said, "another wave starts."

HEADLINE: A Town in New Hampshire That Is Courting Growth

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H.

 BODY:
LOOKING forward to retirement in this pastoral town about 50 miles north of Boston, Carol A. Descoteau, 59, and her husband Harry, 61, paid $300 this month to reserve a two-bedroom unit in what will be Bedford's first rental apartment development.
Although they have not lived in an apartment for 39 years, the Descoteaus who are from Litchfield, N.H., south of Bedford, were drawn to Waterford Green, a 204-unit garden-apartment complex under construction on the eastern edge of town. They liked the size of the apartments and the extensive amenities offered by the developer, the Waterford Development Corporation of Needham, Mass. 
 "This is the life style we want," said Mrs. Descoteau, a part-time secretary for the New Hampshire State Police. "It will be pleasing to the eye, and a little upscale."
The Descoteaus were undaunted by monthly rents as high as $1,400, including hot water, but not other utilities. They will have a clubhouse, covered parking, no property maintenance, 24-hour security and not too many children or young singles as neighbors, Mrs. Descoteau said. The apartments at Waterford Green run from 900 to 1,500 square feet.
The Descoteaus and the Waterford Group are among many residents and developers who in recent years have zeroed-in on 250-year-old Bedford. Location has much to do with the town's growth.
The town is at the intersection of Route 101 and Interstate 293, New Hampshire's major east-west and north-south highways, and is 10 miles from the Manchester Airport. Its proximity to highways puts it within an hour of ski resorts, beaches and Boston.
Bedford has about 4,700 dwellings, almost all single-family houses. Last year the Buildings Department issued permits for 374 new housing units, 204 of them in Waterford Green and the rest single-family houses. In the boom year of 1986, it issued permits for 279 units, and in the bust of 1990, permits for 53 units.
The value of new housing completed last year was $32.5 million; the corresponding figure for commercial projects was $18 million. Since 1990, the population has grown from about 12,400 to 19,000.
Such fast growth is by no means universal in southeastern New Hampshire. The neighboring town of Amherst, with about 11,000 residents, prides itself on its ability to resist change. Last year Amherst issued only 112 residential building permits, all for single-family homes. Over all, new development completed last year amounted to $14.8 million in homes and $3.1 million in commercial projects.
Even in Bedford there are limits to how much growth residents will tolerate. While most of the housing stock is single-family homes, Bedford has permitted the development of multifamily housing, in part to encourage the commercial development needed to maintain a broad tax base, said Karen White, the town planner.
"Five years ago, we rezoned our commercial corridor to allow multifamily units so people could commute to work more easily," she said. But with two more complexes totaling 302 rental apartments now seeking town permission to build "people have mixed feelings," she added.
This month the town voted to halt further apartment development in the commercial corridor on the eastern side of town. On the other hand, as the town plunges into the highest volume of residential development it has ever experienced in one year, it feels prepared.
"Bedford is a very pretty, very expensive place to live and it started planning for growth 20 years ago," said Artherline L. Robersen, who has been town manager for the last six years. It had only limited municipal sewers, but it created a fund, supported by user fees, with which to build connectors to the Manchester and Merrimack municipal sewer systems. The connectors serve the commercial district, along South River Road. Work began in 1989 and continued through the next few years of recession.
"We figured businesses would flock to us when things picked up, and they have," said Ms. Robersen, who talks with a rapid-fire cadence and has a reputation as a wily negotiator. "The Sewer Enterprise Fund now has $500,000 in the bank," she said.
IN 1993, Bedford created what it called a performance zone on this eastern commercial corridor bordered by the Merrimack River and adjacent to the City of Manchester. In this area of about seven square miles, a mix of industrial, commercial and multifamily residential development is permitted. This is where Waterford Green is being built.
"We don't care what you do, but we do care how you do it and how it affects your neighbors," Ms. Robersen said. "We don't want cookie cutters. To keep the flavor of the town we want to mix it up, have a lot of greenery, big buffer areas and minimum signage."
Land already developed with small, old houses in the zone can be bought and consolidated into larger parcels appropriate for commercial development. "A good development program also thinks of redevelopment," Ms. Robersen said.
Another attraction to home buyers is Bedford's low property-tax rate of $17.99 for $1,000 of assessed value. "With a large commercial tax base, we can afford to have a property tax that amounts to only 37 percent of our budget," she said.
Jane E. Hager, president of the Prescott Investment Corporation, a subdivision developer and land dealer based in Lyndeborough, N.H., said: "There's a very good reason for all this activity -- a progressive, pro-active, professional town management eager to broaden its tax base. They don't always say yes but they're well prepared. Occasionally, you can find good government. I credit the voters."
Ms. Hager is developing 201 lots in three subdivisions here. She says she sells 30 to 45 lots a year at an average price of $70,000. Once completed, the houses are valued from $250,000 to $400,000, she said.
Buyers usually come from surrounding towns although with new businesses moving into New Hampshire lately, some have been transferred to the area. "This is a move-up community," Ms. Hager said. "Right now, the market is good but not overheated. Mortgage rates are good, land and house prices are reasonable. Lot prices haven't returned to the $100,000 level of the 1980's but have rebounded from the recession level of about $50,000."
Robin E. Simard, 38, and her husband Richard, 54, have three young children to raise as they plan for the retirement of Mr. Simard, the owner of an office supply company in Manchester.
Last November, they sold a 5,000-square-foot house here and bought a 3,000-square-foot, four-bedroom condominium at the Village Green complex west of the Performance Zone. "Even with the condominium fees, we spend only half of what we spent for upkeep on the house," Ms. Simard said. "In the house, the kids were isolated. Here, they can walk through the complex or bike to the town pool."
The developer, Peter Thompson of Peter Thompson Associates, started the complex in 1988. He built and sold seven units for $250,000 to $300,000 until 1991, when his lender, The Bank of New England, failed. In 1994, construction of smaller units resumed. So far, 33 have been built and sold for $150,000 to $250,000. Roads are being installed for 60 more units. Prices for those will range from $175,000 to $325,000.
Robert E. Shapiro, executive vice president of the Waterford Development Corporation, said that Waterford Green was able to obtain favorable financing with a 40-year Federal loan guarantee and an institutional loan from WMF/Huntoon, Paige of Edison, N.J. The financing, Mr. Shapiro said, "gives us a low monthly carrying cost." But the mainstay of the deal is the high demand for housing in Bedford. "This ZIP code equals rental dollars," Mr. Shapiro said.

HEADLINE: Critics Scrutinize Lilco Accord

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
WHEN Gov. George E. Pataki traveled to Long Island this month to announce an agreement to reduce Long Island electricity rates up to 23 percent, top Republicans and Democrats were lavish in praising his efforts to fulfill his pledge of double-digit rate relief.
Now, less than two weeks after that visit, some critics are attacking the pact as flawed and misleading, and they are calling the cuts illusory. 
 The critics -- an assemblage of business, industrial, civic and environmental groups; utility experts, and a handful of elected officials -- said that the agreement was far too generous to the Long Island Lighting Company and that it was at the customers' expense.
The critics said the accord would also slow the introduction of competition, denying Long Island benefits that other regions may experience in the next few years.
Those criticisms and details of the agreement are to be discussed at hearings by the Long Island Power Authority. No dates have been set for the hearings.
Last week the plan continued to enjoy broad support among elected officials and others involved in the agreement. Some influential groups, including the Long Island Association, have not yet made a final judgment on the plan.
But the criticisms suggest that the agreement, after the initial reception, may encounter turbulence from customers who have grown skeptical about promises of relief from the highest rates in the continental United States. The rates would drop to about 10th place if the agreement proceeds, the authority said. But some critics questioned that estimate and said the rates would continue to be expensive, the second highest among major utilities.
Under the agreement, among the authority, Lilco and the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the authority would sell $7.262 billion in tax-exempt bonds to finance a partial takeover of Lilco. The sale would be the largest municipal bond issue in United States history, producing fees estimated to run from $40 million to $70 million for the companies that would sell the bonds. Bond insurance and legal and engineering fees would add tens of millions more dollars.
The authority would use some of the money to buy the Lilco transmission and distribution system, as well as its 18 percent share in the troubled Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant in Scriba, on Lake Ontario. Critics said that that share could be costly in case of an accident or upon decommissioning.
The authority would also compensate Lilco for the remaining debt on the Shoreham nuclear power plant and for tax claims. Those claims include a scaled-down $625 million payment for a $1.1 billion judgment for excess assessments for the Shoreham plant.
A settlement of the Shoreham tax case would relieve the town and the Shoreham-Wading River School District from paying their share of the refund. But the $625 million would be repaid by all Suffolk residents through electric rates that would be a total of $150 million higher than the rates in Nassau County over the next five years.
Although the accord would eliminate a major tax problem for the county, the town and the school district, critics said it would unfairly charge all Suffolk residents for excess taxes that benefited solely Brookhaven and the school district.
Under Mr. Pataki's plan, the Lilco gas business, electric generators and other equipment would become part of a new company formed by a merger of Lilco with Brooklyn Union, fulfilling the Governor's pledge to do away with Lilco. No layoffs of Lilco workers would occur, the authority and Lilco said.
The authority would hold an option to buy the power plants in four years, and it would buy electricity from the generators for at least 15 years, although imported power from other sources, including imports from a possible new transmission line beneath Long Island Sound, would also be delivered to customers.
The authority would control electricity rates. The company formed by the Brooklyn Union and Lilco merger would manage the transmission and distribution system for at least eight years.
Immediate savings created by refinancing the Shoreham debt at lower rates and by exemptions from other taxes that Lilco now pays would allow an initial rate reduction of 18.2 percent in Nassau and 16.4 percent in Suffolk, according to the agreement. It projects that the rates would remain frozen for at least five years. The lower initial rate cut in Suffolk reflects the Shoreham settlement. In addition, if the agreement is approved, customers would receive checks for $232 in Nassau and $100 in Suffolk, with $82 of that sum from an accelerated payment that Lilco owes from a racketeering suit in 1989.
In that case Lilco was charged with overestimating the costs of Shoreham to obtain rate increases from the State Public Service Commission.
Critics said the money remaining in that $390 million settlement had already been guaranteed to customers in the form of lower rates. They said using that money in the checks would create a false impression that the money resulted from savings achieved in Mr. Pataki's plan.
Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a watchdog group formed under the Lilco settlement, said the panel would oppose discounting the remaining amounts that Lilco owed. The settlement, Mr. Raacke added, stipulated that all money had to be returned to customers.
His group is concerned that customers would receive less than the full amount.
The accelerated payment would need the approval of Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
Under the plan, Nassau would have a peak rate reduction of 23 percent in the fifth year, a figure that represents what customers would save compared to what Lilco projects that it would charge that year.
Critics said that that way of expressing the rate cut was misleading because it was based on Lilco estimates, and not on rates that the P.S.C. might set. The commission, the critics said, could order Lilco to reduce rates substantially over the five years.
"These are not savings at all," Gregory A. Palast, an economist from Southold, said. "These are just the elimination of Lilco rate increases that in fact would never have taken place. It's all a fantasy."
Others said the $7 billion in bonds would be repaid through electric rates for more than 30 years and would be reflected in transmission costs that outside power providers would have to pay. Those costs would be passed on to customers, negating the benefits of lower-cost power.
The transmission costs and the authority's need to collect enough from ratepayers to pay off the bond debt would block the benefits of competition from outside suppliers just as the utility industry underwent sweeping changes to encourage competition, the critics said.
"This deal will keep competition and low-cost electric power off of Long Island for at least 15 years, because the deal continues to force all of Long Island to bail out Lilco's shareholders over Shoreham," said Wayne Prospect, a consultant to the Hauppauge Industrial Association, a group that represents manufacturers and other industries.
The association is a member of the Initiative for Competitive Energy, a new group that opposes Mr. Pataki's plan.
Other critics said the bond sale was set up to maximize the initial rate cut by deferring the repayment of interest on some of the bonds, increasing the total debt up to $1 billion. They said the checks and the initial rate reductions were timed to arrive in the fall of 1998, when Mr. Pataki will be running for a second term.
The chairman of the power authority, Frank G. Zarb, said that was untrue.
The critics hold views that are vastly different from those of Mr. Zarb, other financial experts and public officials who shaped Mr. Pataki's plan.
In one example, a trustee of the authority, Richard M. Kessel, a pivotal negotiator, said last week that the Shoreham debt, which the bonds would pay for, would be discounted 22 percent in the agreement.
The critics said that the agreement actually showed that Lilco shareholders would be paid 99 percent of the company's book value, which included the value of the Shoreham debt to the company. The critics said that showed that there was no discounting of the debt.
Many critics argue that the P.S.C. should have compelled Lilco to write off all or much of the $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion remaining in Shoreham debt before any partial takeover of the utility was attempted.
Mr. Pataki's settlement, the critics said, signifies the second time that a governor has been outnegotiated by the Lilco chairman, Dr. William J. Catacosinos. The first, they said, was in 1989, when Dr. Catacosinos reached a final agreement with Mario M. Cuomo on a plan under which Lilco abandoned the $5.5 billion Shoreham plant because of safety problems.
That accord created a so-called regulatory asset that allowed Lilco to recover the cost of the plant in rates granted by the P.S.C.
Critics said the total cost of the plant, including interest, would be $20 billion or more. But they said the total cost of the plant under Mr. Pataki's plan, when the costs of repaying $7 billion in tax-exempt bonds was included, might run higher.
Because Mr. Pataki's plan envisions paying Lilco cash for the remaining value of the regulatory asset, which is just a so-called paper asset, the agreement would require approval by the Internal Revenue Service of provisions that would allow Lilco to avoid about $2 billion in capital-gains taxes.
Mr. Zarb said an unfavorable rulings on that and other questions could wipe out projected rate reductions. But he added that he was confident that the I.R.S. would rule favorably.
Irving Like, a lawyer from Babylon who has been involved in issues involving Shoreham and Lilco for more than 30 years, said the plan given to the I.R.S. should be public. "Normally," Mr. Like said, "when a company asks the I.R.S. a tax question, they get a private ruling. In this case, however, you have a party to the transaction that is a public entity, the Long Island Power Authority."
Mr. Like and others said the tax questions and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the bonds would disclose financial assumptions, costs and other insights into the agreement.
The critics appear to be convinced that after the agreement is more fully disclosed it will be rejected by customers and ultimately opposed by elected officials. Some officials have already questioned the plan. "This plan rewards Lilco stockholders far too much and Lilco ratepayers far too little, especially considering the billions ratepayers have already paid for the Shoreham asset," said Assemblyman Paul E. Harenberg, Democrat of Bayport.
The views of Democrats in the Long Island delegation to the Assembly could sway Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democratic of Manhattan. Mr. Silver, who would have to approve any agreement, has said he will want assurances that the plan is "as advertised."
Mr. Kessel, a Democrat, said he believed that the plan had wide support among customers. "They want their bills cut," he said. "That's the bottom line."
But because the agreement would take an estimated 12 to 18 months to take effect, other critics said there was ample time to examine flaws.
"It's not a question of what people think about it in March or April," said Charles M. Studness of Manhasset, an expert on utility finances. "It's what they think about it a year from now."

HEADLINE: In State of the County Address, O'Rourke Sets Tasks for Board

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IF Westchester lawmakers had any notion that County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke would go out with a whimper, he made it clear that they were mistaken last week as he delivered a State of the County address filled with a number of calls for action.
In the course of the half-hour speech to the Board of Legislators, presumably his last as County Executive, Mr. O'Rourke said, "Westchester's future cannot and should not be put on hold." He proposed several new initiatives and action on some other items of old business, all of which he said could be achieved before he leaves office at the end of the year. 
 But while the audience in the legislative chambers of the County Office Building, largely made up of past and present county and local officials, interrupted Mr. O'Rourke with applause about 14 times and gave him a standing ovation, it seemed certain that some of his ideas would not easily win acceptance.
The one idea that seemed clearly a lost cause was a suggestion that if the New York Legislature permanently exempts clothing purchases from the sales tax that Westchester should ask for a 0.5 percent increase in its sales tax to make up for the lost revenue to the county, local governments and school districts.
Interviews after the speech with legislators also revealed differences of opinion on other initiatives of Mr. O'Rourke, including those dealing with welfare, the arts, taxes and transportation.
Mr. O'Rourke, who became County Executive in 1983, announced in February that he would not seek re-election.
In his speech last Monday he chose not to reflect too much on what he considered his accomplishments, saying he would leave that to county historians. Rather, he said, he and the legislators still had much to do.
Here are some of the proposals Mr. O'Rourke made or proposed again in his speech:
*Mr. O'Rourke called on the Board to take steps to require that in the future property taxes may only be increased by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Legislators, not a simple majority.
*Announced a program he called Power, for Permanently Off Welfare Through Education and Responsibility. Among its requirements is that all heads of households who are on welfare earn a high school diploma if they do not already have one and that parents of welfare recipients be held accountable for their children's school attendance. There would also be an expansion of county day-care programs and educational opportunities as well as drug and alcohol testing of welfare recipients.
*Called on the Board to enact a $1-a-day surcharge on hotel and motel rates and car rentals. The money would go to a fund for the arts.
*Announced that beginning in July, the county's Department of Correction will start a young offenders program, featuring a "military-style daily regimen with an emphasis on education, treatment and self-discipline." The program is meant to decrease the recidivism rate of first-time offenders. As part of the program, participants will be closely monitored and counseled after their release, he said.
*Called for a county Commission Against Bias, which would coordinate anti-bias efforts of other agencies and government levels and hold hearings on whether broader local antidiscrimination legislation is needed in Westchester. "Anti-bias protection should extend to all Westchester residents regardless of economic class or social status," he said, later adding: "State law fails to protect certain classes from bias-related violence and discrimination in housing and employment. That's simply not right."
*Suggested that the county ask the state for money to cover lost revenue if the State Legislature decides to exempt clothing from the sales tax, and failing that, that the county should ask the state for permission to collect an additional one-half of 1 percent sales tax, which it would share with local governments and school districts. Mr. O'Rourke said the county stands to lose $20 million a year in sales-tax revenue.
*Proposed making the county's bus system an independent, regional transit agency. As a free-standing agency, he said, it would give the bus system more flexibility to meet its needs.
"I think the County Executive made it clear he intends to keep working us and working himself," said Legislator Richard G. Wishnie, a Democrat from Ossining, after the speech.
Reaction from legislators showed strong differences of opinion about Mr. O'Rourke's proposals. Mr. Wishnie, for example, generally liked the idea of a fund for the arts, while Ursula G. Lamotte, a Republican from Bedford, said she did not like the concept of dedicated funds in general.
She added that she supported the concept of Mr. O'Rourke's welfare proposals, saying they were aimed at helping children and at-risk families. But other legislators questioned the availability of jobs for members of such families.
"I'm a little concerned with the welfare proposal, that he is considering adding additional stipulations to the existing parameters" for eligibility, said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers.
Only on the matter of raising the sales tax was there unanimity among those legislators questioned.
"No," Mrs. Lamotte said.
Mr. Wishnie said: "I don't think it will fly."
Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat from Greenburgh, said: "I don't see us supporting that."
Mr. Abinanti and George Latimer, a Democrat from Rye, also expressed reservations about creating a new agency to run the county's transportation system. Mr. Latimer questioned how it would affect fares and service. Mr. Abinanti said, "We don't want a Westchester version of the Port Authority."
As to whether the Board could take up all of Mr. O'Rourke's ambitious agenda before he leaves office, George Oros, the Board chairman, said it could. But he added:
"We have an agenda of our own as well. It includes term limits, campaign financing and other things."

Max Frankel's article on Social Security ("Less Medicare, More Magic") offered one of the best definitions I've read on the problem. Although I thought the handling of Social Security was sensitive and objective, there was no mention of the hardship incurred by the aged poor. 
 My hope is that an entire issue would be turned over to the problem of poverty in the U.S. We keep emphasizing the magnificence of the economy. We neglect the disparity between the haves and the have-nots and the growing drudgery of the poor in America.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
An Auto Race Track's Last Lap

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
IN its heyday, the Bridgehampton Race Circuit drew 50,000 spectators on a weekend. Its challenging loops and curves made it world renowned until a local ordinance adopted in 1983 required race cars to be equipped with mufflers. That drove professional racers away and eroded track revenues.
On Tuesday the historic track opens its 41st, and probably last, season before beginning a new life as a golf/residential community. The checkered flag was waved in January when the owner of the 516-acre property, Robert M. Rubin of Greenwich, Conn., won appovals for a zoning change to redevelop the site for a golf course and 20 residential lots. The controversial zoning change was approved by the Southampton Town Board in a 4-to-1 vote. 
 Under the proposed site plan for the community, which is to be called Golf at the Bridge, the residential lots would be clustered on 70 acres, and 153 acres would be dedicated to the town, with the rest of the land used for the golf course. The existing zoning had permitted construction of 114 houses.
Southampton's Supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio, said he had cast the lone dissenting vote on the plan because he feared that the herbicides and pesticides that keep fairways green would filter into the ground water and pollute local wells. The race track is in a watershed.
Golf course experts scoff at such notions, citing studies conducted by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, among others, that show that properly used chemicals and fertilizers are safe.
Construction of an 18-hole golf course designed by Rees L. Jones of Montclair, N.J., is to start in the fall. The three-acre residential lots cannot be subdivided, but they can each contain two houses -- a main house and a guest house. No time frame for sales has been set.
Now that the race track has been doomed, some nearby residents are fighting to preserve it -- even to the point of suggesting that noise restrictions be lifted on specific weekends to bring back professional racing associations and spectators.
"It's true that the track, as it's run now, is noisy, but we prefer the track to having our wells contaminated," said Stacy Kaufman-Riveras, a lawyer and a resident of Noyac who is a member of the South Fork Coalition for Fresh Water, a group of residents opposing the golf course.
A lengthy environmental-impact statement prepared on behalf of Mr. Rubin, and accepted by the Town of Southampton, found that the golf course would have no negative impact on the ground water. But environmentalists are not convinced, saying that a chemical judged to be safe today may prove to be harmful tomorrow.
"The principal concern we have is that many of the pesticides and fertilizers that are approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency and by the State of New York have already turned up in people's drinking-water wells across eastern Long Island," said Robert S. DeLuca, the president of the Group for the South Fork, in Bridgehampton, a nonprofit environmental organization.
Dacthal, for example, a turf-building product used by golf courses, is suspected of having contaminated local wells, and certain products containing it are now banned in Suffolk County.
Mr. DeLuca noted that his group was particularly concerned with the Bridgehampton race track proposal because of the property's location over a water recharge area.
"You may not be able to go back and retrofit past mistakes, but you can stop those mistakes from occurring, especially in a case such as this where the existing zoning didn't even allow a golf course," Mr. DeLuca said.
William W. Esseks of the Esseks, Hefter & Angel law firm in Riverhead, who represents the race track owner, Mr. Rubin, said concerns over potential water contamination were just a smokescreen for antidevelopment sentiment.
"The hypocrisy is overwhelming," he said. "The very people who are objecting to the golf course would be perfectly willing to see all 500 acres used for farming purposes."
Suffolk County has spent millions of dollars to purchase development rights to sustain farming, a program that has also been heavily supported through local bond issues.
A farmer, Mr. Esseks pointed out, is a heavy user of fertilizers and pesticides and land is plowed each year, allowing chemicals to penetrate the soil.
His client's golf course, on the other hand, would use only 80 of the 516 acres for fairways, and chemicals would be applied in a "very protected way," he said. After the turf is established, Mr. Esseks said, all the materials will be used up by the root structure, in contrast to what occurs in farming.
MR. RUBIN, a car-racing enthusiast, purchased the race track property 13 years ago, hoping, he said, to continue auto racing there. But critical to making the track economically viable was getting some changes made to Southampton's noise ordinance, which would have permitted professional racing to resume, he said. His various proposals to the town were repeatedly rejected, he said.
Building a golf course and limiting residential development to 20 lots, he said, is a better plan from every perspective, including an environmental one, than building the 114 houses that zoning permitted. Most people are satisfied with the idea of a golf course and a few houses, Mr. Rubin said, "but the constituency for no development at any cost is by far the most vocal and aggressive."
Experts on golf course design and management say that concerns over water pollution by golf courses are rooted in outdated studies done 10 to 15 years ago. "People will dredge those up, but they're not relevant because they made assumptions they couldn't prove, " said Michael J. Hurdzan, a golf-course architect in Columbus, Ohio.
Moreover, newly developed fertilizers and new grass types needing less fertilization further reduce potential risk to ground water, he said.
"Well-designed, well-managed and properly built golf courses don't pollute ground water," Mr. Hurdzan added. "Housing is a much greater polluter."
A management program for the Bridgehampton golf course was designed by Environmental & Turf Services, environmental consultants in Wheaton, Md., who also were the consultants for the environmental impact study prepared for Mr. Rubin.
Stuart Z. Cohen, who heads the firm, directed an extensive study of the impact of golf courses on ground water quality in Cape Cod.
The study, conducted over one and a half years and released in 1990, was commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency and by Barnstable County.
It concluded that though some pesticides had been found, golf courses were not significantly impacting ground water quality on Cape Cod, which relies on its aquifer for water, as does Long Island.
Racing buffs who also opposed the golf course, hoping to save the race track, say that those hopes have been rekindled now that some local residents have said they would sue the town over the rezoning.
If neighbors could convince the town to mitigate its noise ordinance so that professional racing events could resume even two weekends a year, "we have investors who could come up with as much money as we would ever need" to buy and upgrade the track, said Guy L. Frost.
Mr. Frost is an amateur race-car driver and organizer of the Bridgehampton Racing Heritage Group which has been seeking to preserve the track.
Not likely, said Mr. Rubin, the property owner. "If tomorrow I said, I've had a religious conversion and I'm now going to try and run a race track and I started taking steps to overturn the sound ordinance, you'd have an even more vocal and equally aggressive minority of people say, We don't want the race track."
Dennis Macchio, who leases the track from Mr. Rubin, said he was resigned to the inevitable. "It will be a sad day when Bridgehampton Race Circuit closes and we see an important chapter in the history of road racing in the Northeast come to an end," he said. "The track has had nine lives and the question is, 'Have we used up the ninth?' I seriously doubt that we will see racing beyond this season."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/42d Street and Broadway;
Technology in the Front Seat at 4 Times Square

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
SINCE it is the major office building to go into construction in midtown Manhattan in the 90's, the structure being built at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway could be expected to include a few new technical wrinkles.
When the project was announced last year, the Durst Organization, which is developing the 48-story, 1.6-million-square-foot building, struck an environmental theme. The building would have energy efficient lighting, special chutes for materials to be recycled and high-tech windows that admit light, but little heat. 
 The intention was to develop a building that was pleasant, efficient and easy to work in. The building, which has the address of 4 Times Square, will be named for its first -- and anchor -- tenant, the Conde Nast publishing group, which took 585,000 square feet of space. But the success of the semi-speculative project was insured when Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, the law firm, agreed to lease 660,000 square feet.
Since then prospective tenants have grown more interested in the area, and developers have been working with renewed vigor trying to put together deals that might involve the three other Times Square office sites. These are on the west side of Seventh Avenue -- between 41st Street and 42d Street, and between 42d Street and 43d Street -- and on the east side between 41st Street and 42d Street. Prudential Insurance, the owner, is trying to sell these sites.
While attention has focused on potential development, the Dursts, their architects,
Fox & Fowle, and construction manager, Tishman Construction Corporation, have continued to refine the design of a building that is actually under way.
If necessary city approvals can be obtained, 4 Times Square could become the first major office building in New York to have photoelectric panels incorporated in the outer wall of the building. The panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, would contribute power to provide lighting for the building and the garish signs that are a requirement for buildings facing Times Square.
In addition, the design team is working to incorporate fuel cells into the building's power system. Fuel cells convert natural gas into electricity, while emitting only water and carbon dioxide, a gas that is already in the atmosphere. The panels and cells would make the building largely self sufficient in energy, with managers purchasing supplementary power from Consolidated Edison, or another supplier as deregulation proceeds, as needed.
Energy specialists say that the value of the panels and cells would be twofold: to demonstrate that these techniques have advanced beyond the experimental stage and are now actually usable in buildings, and to give them a showcase in a prominent location.
"It's a great showcase for real technologies that work," said Ashok Gupta, a senior energy economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization based in New York. "Someone has to lead in introducing new technologies to increase demand. Increased demand attracts new producers and the competition makes the price go down."
The plan to incorporate solar panels in the skin of the building came after several other ideas for generating power were considered and discarded, said Robert F. Fox Jr., one of the founding partners in Fox & Fowle. "We looked at wind power, but there was nothing available that would work now," he said. "Nobody is doing research on using wind power on office buildings."
Putting solar panels on the roof was considered as well, but they were costly, took up valuable roof space and had an unacceptable 30-year payback on the investment, he said.
BUT Daniel J. Kaplan, another partner in the firm, kept looking into the possibilities for solar power and found a place where they could fit -- in the spaces between the top of one row of windows and the bottom of the next row, spaces called spandrels. Since the spandrel panels are needed anyway, the only increase in cost was the difference between a solar panel and a conventional one, or about $10 a square foot.
Because of the design of the building, spandrel panels are relatively small, only 14,000 square feet of the 600,000-square-foot surface of the building. Still, they are estimated to provide enough power for six or seven suburban homes, or about 1.5 percent of the anticipated interior load at 4 Times Square.
One reason for the relatively small area for the solar panels is that they were an afterthought. "If we had known in the beginning, we would have designed in more panels," said Bruce S. Fowle, the other founding partner.
Since the outside walls of a modern office building are not structural and serve mainly to keep the tenants in and wind and rain out, strength was not an issue. The photovoltaic material is deposited on a thin piece of glass that is laminated between two other pieces of glass and installed in the wall.
The panels will be connected electrically to a device that converts the direct current they produce into the alternating current usable in the building. Mr. Fox said photovoltaic technology is expected to improve over time by converting more of the sunlight falling on them to power.
"We've designed it so that as the technology evolves, in 10 or 20 years, you could pop out the old panels and install new one to generate more power," He said.
If the panels will be the most visible mark of the design's novel approach to energy, the more significant part will most likely be hidden in the mechanical recesses of the building. The current plan is to install eight (up from three just a few weeks ago) fuel cells, each capable of putting out 200 kilowatts of power an hour.
If all eight run continuously, as they are intended to do, they would supply 12.8 million kilowatt hours a year, enough to handle 100 percent of the estimated power requirements of the signs or 60 percent of the demand by tenants. "You do not turn fuel cells on and off, because it takes two hours and a lot of power to get them going," Mr. Fox said. "You just turn them on and let them run for four and a half to five years. And they produce very clean power, which is important for people using computers."
Mr. Fox said that by using the fuel cells to provide the base electrical demand of the building, the Durst Organization, which manages the buildings it owns, will lower the rates paid to Con Ed for whatever supplemental power it needs. The utility, he said, not unreasonably bases its rates on peak demand -- reached for example on a hot summer afternoon -- since it has to invest in equipment to meet that demand.
"Using the fuel cells as the base load takes out that peak, so you pay a lot lower rate," he said.
Fuel cells work at about 96 percent efficiency converting the chemicals of natural gas into energy, but only about half of that is electricity, with the rest coming off as heat, Mr. Kaplan said. But that presents possibilities as well.
The developers and designers rejected conventional electrically powered chilling equipment in favor of devices that burn natural gas to produce cooled air. "We are looking into whether we could use the heat from the fuel cells in the air-conditioning equipment to supplement the heat from burning gas," Mr. Kaplan said.
The decision to use heat-driven cooling equipment blocked any chance to use ice storage as a means of reducing electrical power costs. This approach involves using electric chillers at night, when power costs are the lowest, to make ice. The ice is then used during the day to help produce the cool air all large office buildings need year round. "We looked into ice storage pretty carefully, but it would not quite pay for itself as it worked out," Mr. Fowle. He said using heat-based cooling changed the economics. "It would have worked if the building was all electric," he said.
Mr. Fowle said the failure to find adequate wind power technology was disappointing, since tall buildings have a natural draft, which can often be felt in elevator shafts. "There is natural air movement," Mr. Fowle said. "You could design a building to funnel the air to a paddle wheel array to generate power if the technology were more mature."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
The Duke and I

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
AS a stage director, Sheldon Epps has been there, done that. Miller in Minneapolis, Mastrosimone in New Brunswick, McNally in Philadelphia. Ibsen, multicultural style, and Shakespeare in San Diego, with Stoppard coming up. But theatergoers know him best as a conceiver.
A conceiver? 
 If that sounds too abstruse, call Mr. Epps a man with a concept. His is the name that completes the credit "Conceived by . . ."
Let him explain it all for you: "It is gathering composers' existing material -- buried treasures, mostly -- and finding ways of making you listen to it as if it's new."
It all began with "Blues in the Night" (Off Off Broadway, 1980; Broadway, 1983; London, 1987). Concept: three women in a seedy hotel; one piano player; 24 lamentations by Bessie Smith, Alberta Hunter, Johnny Mercer, Vernon Duke, Walter Melrose and other disciples of the blues.
It continues with a Broadway musical set in "the Magical Kingdom of Harlem in the Swingin' 40's" and titled "Play On!" -- a free-floating retelling of a comedy set in the mythical Illyria on the Adriatic Sea, written by Shakespeare in 1601 as "Twelfth Night." It opened on March 20 with a score advertised as "the best score in town." Small wonder: the music is by Duke Ellington, with more than a little help from Billy Strayhorn.
The next Epps conception, "Disgustingly Rich," is bound for his home town, Teaneck, having evolved from a cabaret show by the Production Company, an Off Off Broadway group he founded with Norman Rene in 1980. The revue, at the American Stage Company from April 24 to May 18, begins at the end of a penthouse party. Now it's the servants' turn to sing, drink leftover champagne and comment on the departed guests. The buried treasures are by Noel Coward, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, and other emissaries of elegance. As with his other conceptions, Mr. Epps said he hoped audiences in Teaneck would "listen to songs they know and find out they don't know them at all."
When it comes to the songs in "Play On!" Broadway audiences may also not know who wrote them: Ellington or Strayhorn, who composed "Take the 'A' Train," the show's opening number and the signature song of the Duke Ellington Orchestra.
Strayhorn, Ellington's arranger for nearly three decades, dedicated his entire professional life to the service of Ellington but received little credit (or royalties) for his compositions. "Billy and Duke are the only two people who knew who wrote what, and they are no longer with us," Mr. Epps said. "Something to Live For," a stunning duet late in the second act between the Rev (read: Malvolio), the manager of the Cotton Club, and Lady Liv (Olivia), the club's resident diva, "has lyrics credited to Billy," Mr. Epps said.
"They were such a close team; they functioned as one," he went on. "They finished each other's musical phrases. They were four hands on a piano, instead of two."
Mr. Epps had access to 1,200 to 1,500 compositions, Ellington or Strayhorn in whatever measure, and many unpublished. "Most were written as instrumentals for the Duke Ellington Band, with lyrics added on much later," he said. "This was the big-band era. People didn't bother to listen to lyrics; they were dancing.
"One of the things Ellington wanted most was a hit Broadway book musical. He tried, but none -- 'Queenie Pie,' 'Jump for Joy' -- got there. So the heart and soul of this one is to celebrate his songs."
"Play On!" is one of several song-and-dance shows based on "Twelfth Night," the most musical of Shakespeare's plays. The title is derived from the play's first line, "If music be the food of love, play on." In its latest incarnation, Viola Wilhemena Caledonia Pea goes to Harlem (on the A train) to be a composer in a man's world. Her uncle, the Jester (Shakespeare's Feste), tells her she is horning in on a man's world. Hence, the motivation for the cross-dressing of Vy to Vy Man, who falls in love with Harlem's ace songwriter, who happens to be named the Duke (after Orsino, the Duke of Illyria).
For Mr. Epps, the jazz musical is a continuation of a longtime collaboration with Mercedes Ellington, Duke's granddaughter, who choreographed "Play On!" as well as "Juba," an Off Off Broadway musical about racism, which Mr. Epps directed in 1991. It evolved from two staged readings in 1987 by the Musical Theater Project of the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn.
Perhaps ahead of its time, "Juba" concerned William Henry Laine, the first professional black dancer in America; his love affair with Polly Spracket, a British actress, in the 1840's, and his rivalry with John Diamond, an Irish step dancer.
"It was not a happy show," Mr. Epps recalled. "But that was before 'Jelly's Last Jam,' and no one thought a tough black musical could survive on Broadway.".
Ms. Ellington took charge of the dancers in two touring productions of "Blues In The Night," a six-week Broadway loser, albeit a Tony-nominated one in a dismal season. But a minor musical turned into a mega-event in the career of Mr. Epps, who now directs four to five productions of the show every season. "There have been 100 in the last 10 years, all over the world -- in Africa, in Australia, in Japan, in Barcelona, all over the British Isles," he said. "Blues" even played at the McCarter Theater in Princeton in 1979.
Associate director of American Stage from 1988 to 1993 and advisory producer from 1994 to 1996, Mr. Epps is now "unofficially a friend and admirer of what Jim" -- James N. Vagias, the theater's executive producer -- "is trying to do in my home county." Mr. Epps is also associate director at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, where "Play On!" had a successful world premiere last year. There he has directed a range of plays, from what he calls "a conventional 'Private Lives' to 'Hedda Gabler' with black actors as Hedda and Judge Brack, a Latino Lovborg, an Asian woman as Thea and a white Tesman." Next up at the Old Globe: "The Real Thing," by Tom Stoppard.
BORN 44 years ago to St. Paul (a minister who "always found someplace to preach") and Kathryn Epps (who taught home economics in Thomas Jefferson Junior High School in Teaneck), Sheldon Epps lived in Los Angeles until he was 11. "We moved to Teaneck when I was in the seventh grade, and there I stayed through junior high school and through college," he said. After graduating from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1973, Mr. Epps lived in Manhattan until 1985. "Then my parents moved to North Carolina and offered the house to me and my sister." He and his older sister, Frances, a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines, still share the house.
He discovered theater when he performed in a summer musical program at Teaneck High School. "I was a shy kid looking for a place to be. The combination of doing Lord Brockhurst in 'The Boy Friend' and the Prince in 'The King and I' and being close enough to see Broadway shows -- that was like Disneyland to me," he recalled.
Still looking like "a shy kid" after all these years, Mr. Epps stood at the rear of the Brooks Atkinson Theater before the opening-night of "Play On!" 10 days ago, unfazed by the din. He was leaning against a rear wall, smiling benignly. During the performance, he did not pace. At the final curtain, the audience whooped it up and hollered. Mr. Epps stood at the rear of the theater. At the teeming party afterward, he was not at the table reserved for him, but in a small room upstairs with several cast members.
Later, he mused on his life in the theater. "It's about getting the work right," he said. "The problems and difficulties are always the same. Solving them costs different amounts of money. Off Broadway or American Stage or Broadway, the difference is the number of zeros next to the problem."
Regional theaters like New Jersey's "provide a supportive, comfortable atmosphere for developing new work to ease the pressures and economics of producing in New York," he said. "You can't develop them otherwise.
" 'Blues in the Night' has made it possible for me to remain in the theater -- to have a choice. With 'Play On!' I hope I'll have a new annuity now."

Office Buildings (Remember the 80's?) Make a Comeback

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
They bought the land nearly a decade ago when New Jersey was awash with new construction. It was a time when buildings were rising with little or no money down and speculators roamed the landscape to buy up parcels for new office complexes or commercial parks.
Now, six years after building virtually stopped, SJP Properties, a development and construction concern, is finally getting back into speculative office building, rolling the dice on a new eight-story office tower that was begun before it had any tenants. 
 "It was a risk but one that has paid off," said Peter Eppie, the company's vice president, at its headquarters in Parsippany. "No one had signed a lease on it until two months ago and now it's 80 percent taken."
"This shows the market is getting tight and demand is picking up again," he added. "We're so confident now, we're planning a second tower later this year. And it's being done completely on spec too."
The 240,000-square-foot building being erected in Bridgewater Township is perhaps the first commercial site developed completely on spec in the state since 1991, when SJP built one of the last. But this developer is not alone in seeing a rebound in New Jersey's commercial real-estate market. Dozens of other office buildings are popping up to meet the needs of corporations that are expanding and require technological amenities like fiber optic cable, rooftop communications and computer-friendly climate controls.
Noting that the state has already made up 85 percent of the jobs lost at the deepest point of the recession five years ago, James W. Hughes, an economist and dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said that other economic indicators, including steep occupancy rates in existing commercial buildings, pointed to a resurgence in the real-estate market.
Commercial vacancy rates in New Jersey are 16 percent now, trimmed from 23 percent in 1992, Dr. Hughes said. He added that class A spaces, the newest and best located buildings, were reporting vacancy rates around 9.2 percent in the most heavily populated central and northern sections of the state. Other economists, like Bob Cotter, director of planning for Jersey City, said that real estate investment trusts were selling well again and that banks were lending on proposed buildings with less collateral.
"While it is still in its early stages, the commercial real estate market does appear to be coming back," Dr. Hughes said.
"It remains to be seen how deep the demand really is," he added. "At least it's not a free-for-all of excess, like in the 1980's, when everyone pretended to be a builder. This is a much more rational and slower trend."
The 1980's building boom has come to be remembered as a sea of extravagance, when banks and thrifts lent millions to developers who offered little collateral and often no more than a promise of tenants. Buildings rose at such a pace that by the early 1990's, supply had greatly outstripped demand. Banks began to fail, and investors and taxpayers absorbed the losses.
By 1994, office construction virtually halted throught the country, with only 1.6 million square feet being completed that year in the United States. That was less office space than was erected in some weeks during the previous decade, Dr. Hughes said. In fact, 85 percent of all office buildings in New Jersey were built in the 1980's, he said.
"We have gone from one extreme to another and now we are going the opposite way again," said John Maddocks, manager of Somerset County's economic development office, listing several construction sites. "Not long ago you had tenants demanding the first year free to sign a five-year lease," he said. "You don't see that anymore. The market is tight."
Among the desirable areas are stretches along Jersey City's waterfront, often called the Gold Coast; Route 1 as it approaches Princeton, and the intersection of Routes 287 and 78, where SJP Properties is beginning development of six buildings on a 118-acre site.
Few of them suggest the excesses of the 80's, either in design or in financing. Still, the trend is toward more risk, with lenders granting more money for less commitment every day and builders seeing old plots as potential cash cows.
"Builders are becoming more aggressive and lenders are becoming more willing to lend," said Robert J. Wolfe, president of Picus Associates Inc., whose four-million-square-foot Princeton Forrestal Center is now 80 percent occupied.
"The real estate industry has a very short memory," he said.

'We Don't Just Baby-Sit.' Classrooms for Child Care With the Future in Mind

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: OAKLAND

 BODY:
Kyle Whittle, 3, has waved goodbye to his mother and yelled, "I love you, Mommy!" and then hidden behind his cubby in the classroom and jumped out at his friend, Kevin Johansmeyer, also 3, and said, "Boo!" Now he is dying an Easter egg in a cup.
"We'll leave it in there for this much minutes," he says with exuberance, holding up both hands with 10 widespread fingers. 
 "How many minutes is that?" asks Marybeth Moroney, 17, who is monitoring his egg-dying skills.
"Sixty!" says Kyle.
"No-o-o," says Ms. Moroney, laughing. And then she helps Kyle to count to 10 on his fingers.
So went another day in the child-development class at Indian Hills High School in this Bergen County community, where students like Ms. Maroney get to work with and observe pre-schoolers as part of their studies in family and consumer science, (formerly home economics) on their way to becoming schoolteachers, child-care workers, and, of course, parents.
The course, which began here last September as a two-year pilot program, involves, in effect, teen-age students running a free day-care center three days a week for 13 children, ages 3 to 5. Although it is new in Indian Hills, it is patterned after similar courses that have been offered around New Jersey and other states for more than 20 years. The original courses were designed to teach young people how to care for children in their own families at home, but as more women have entered the workforce the course broadened to include day care as an occupation.
"We just don't baby-sit them," said Elaine Arendas, a veteran teacher who developed the Indian Hills course. "All the activities, which the students in the class plan, have an educational purpose. To help with the growth and development of the children in our care -- physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially."
There were 11 pre-schoolers this day in a classroom at Indian Hills that the students have helped to design and transform into one with a pre-school atmosphere, with little tables and chairs, toys, puzzles, books and colorful decorations, like the Easter bunny decals on the windows.
The children attend from 9:15 A.M. to 10:45 A.M. here every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, said Ms. Arendas, taking part in activites like arts and crafts, music and dance, story telling and science demonstrations: how objects float or sink.
Thirty-four teen-agers like Miss Moroney, who plans to study elementary education at Rutgers University, are enrolled in the course, which is split into two 45-minute classes. Eighteen students take the first period, 16 the second. They assume roles as "floaters" or "observers."
Floaters supervise the children's activities and prepare their snacks while observers watch how the children respond to tasks, their teen-age "teachers" and each other. Each observer, who is assigned a child to observe for that week, evaluates the child's progress and special needs.
On Monday, Ms. Arendas said, the students meet to plan the week's activities and on Friday review how the class went and could be improved.
Lacie Edelstein,17, a senior who plans to major in child development at Susquehanna University in Pennylvania, explains how a guitar works. She then leads them in numerous verses of "Old McDonald Had A Farm," getting stuck only when no one can figure out what sound a panda bear makes.
Kelly Torell, 17, leads the children in a game of matching paper egg shapes by color and the designs on them. Besides dying Easter eggs the children also get to make baby chicks with Styrofoam, toothpicks, pipe cleaners and glue.
"It's really fun," says Vicky Kenney, 17, who plans to become a bilingual counsellor in English and Spanish. "At first you think it's just baby sitting. But it's not because you have to really think about what activities to do that are interesting and that they'll learn from. You also have to learn how to deal with different behaviors."
"I like the interaction with the kids," says Kathleen Pope, a 17-year old junior who hopes to be a kindergarten teacher.
The parents also appear to be pleased with the program. One of them, Janet Watkins, says of her 3-year old son, William, "He enjoys it. It's his first experience with school and he's learned a lot. To socialize and make friends. Everytime he comes home, he shows me something new he's learned."

HEADLINE: The Faces of Hedda Nussbaum

BYLINE: By Francine Russo; Francine Russo, based in New York, writes frequently about human behavior.

 BODY:
As Hedda Nussbaum, in a red coat with faux-fur trim, met the press on the courthouse steps in Manhattan on March 10 to announce a legal victory giving herself and other battered women more time to sue their abusers, she dabbed her left eye with a tissue. Photographers caught the moment and news accounts suggested she was crying tears of joy. "I knew they would say that," Nussbaum says with a hearty laugh two days later. In fact, that eye, which Joel Steinberg's fingers gouged more than a decade ago, "weeps" nearly all the time from an injured tear duct.
Nussbaum, 54, and I are chatting in the law office in suburban Westchester where she works. It is the last in a series of conversations we have had over many days since 1995, after the hearings in Nussbaum v. Steinberg. 
 When I first met Hedda Nussbaum in the summer of 1995, she was driving a teal-green Geo -- her first decent car after two lemons. She escorted me and her lawyer, Betty Levinson, to a women's center in a northern suburb of New York where Nussbaum helped to lead a support group for battered women. Resting on the back seat was her shipment from Avon. Remarkably, Nussbaum, one of the most famous battered women in America, is an Avon lady. She doesn't actually knock on neighbors' doors but sells the beauty products mostly to family and friends. That day, she raved about a night cream that smoothed her shriveled arms overnight.
This is one of those surreal moments blending the commonplace and the unthinkable that characterized my conversations with Nussbaum. Scarred on much of her body, she has your average vanity and interest in cosmetics. Her only special need, she says, is waterproof mascara on the lower lid of the injured, tearing eye.
Seen straight on in a flattering light, her face framed by abundant curls styled to hide a cauliflower ear, Nussbaum can look surprisingly pretty. But when she turns her head in profile, I am jolted. Her nose, reconstructed twice, looks as if it has been sheared off. The asymmetry of her features -- one cheekbone flattened, the lips askew -- is unsettling.
Nussbaum walks with a slight limp; her back is hunched like that of an old woman. I cannot look at her without superimposing the image from a videotape made by the New York City Police Department on Nov. 2, 1987, the night Nussbaum and her companion, Joel Steinberg, were arrested for the beating death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg. Repeated viewings have not dimmed the shock of Nussbaum's sunken, glassy eyes in a bruised and swollen face, the split lip, the inflamed leg that left untreated would have killed her.
In those days, before events like the brutal death of Nicole Brown Simpson or Susan V. Smith's murder of her two young children, the nation was riveted by the tale of two affluent Manhattan professionals -- Steinberg, a lawyer, and Nussbaum, a former children's-book editor at Random House -- and their descent into sadism, cocaine
and madness. When police officers entered their brownstone apartment in Greenwich Village, they found a chaotic scene -- Lisa, who was dying; Mitchell, a urine-soaked toddler tethered to a playpen, and Nussbaum, battered almost beyond recognition -- and opened it up to the public's horrified gaze.
Steinberg's trial in 1988 -- many people referred to it as the "Nussbaum trial" though charges against her were dropped -- was the first marathon TV trial. Viewers were hooked on Nussbaum's days of grisly testimony. Nussbaum waived immunity when she agreed to testify against Steinberg. He was found guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the death of Lisa and sentenced to 8 to 25 years in prison, where he remains, his request for parole recently denied. Nussbaum spent a year at the Four Winds psychiatric hospital in Westchester and is sentenced to be Hedda Nussbaum for the rest of her life.
Despite testimony that nussbaum was delusional and near death herself when Steinberg killed Lisa, many people would not forgive her for allowing her daughter to lie comatose on the floor for 12 hours without calling for help. Her acquiescence to Steinberg's "demand" that they smoke cocaine while waiting for him to "heal" the child still outrages those who believe a mother ought to die protecting her child. Friends and supporters say those people could not forgive Nussbaum because she survived. Even feminists were split. As Ann Jones wrote in her book about battered women, "Next Time, She'll Be Dead," many public figures joined Gloria Steinem's plea for understanding; others like Susan Brownmiller blasted her.
But there has been a sea change in the public's understanding of domestic violence since 1987, when it seemed beyond comprehension that any woman -- especially an educated professional -- could remain with a man who beat her nearly into oblivion. Since then, the psychology of domestic abuse has been better understood, especially the victim's profound attachment to her abuser. Women's shelters have multiplied, police departments have been better-educated and a growing body of national and state legislation, including mandatory arrest for batterers in some jurisdictions, has been enacted. But in 1987, Nussbaum was vilified for her inability to save her daughter.
When Hedda Nussbaum met Joel Steinberg in 1975, the 32-year-old book editor, shy and socially awkward, friends say, was entranced by the charismatic lawyer. After she moved
in with him, he coached her in nightly "therapy" sessions on how to walk, dress, get raises. Her popularity and success grew.
"I thought he was godlike," says Nussbaum.
Steinberg, inventing tales about sinister cults and convincing her he had healing powers, gradually isolated Nussbaum from friends and family. He hit her for the first time in 1978, Nussbaum says. A few months later, the beatings accelerated, and in 1981 he ruptured her spleen. Soon after, Steinberg arranged to have the infant Lisa brought to them. Nussbaum describes a honeymoon period, then more beatings, burnings and torture. She lost her job because she was frequently absent as a result of her injuries. Believing the beatings were her own fault, she strove ever more hopelessly to please him. Eventually she had to beg his permission to eat, to sleep, to telephone. So when Lisa lay comatose, Nussbaum did not call for help but obeyed Joel Steinberg so that he would "heal" Lisa.
At first, Nussbaum refused to consider Betty Levinson's suggestion that she sue Steinberg. "It was so awful to hear her say he was a healer," Levinson says. "It was spooky, terrifying." Not until Nussbaum heard that Steinberg was planning to blame her for Lisa's death did she agree to testify against him, and shortly afterward she filed suit for assault.
In more than 20 years of legal practice, Levinson says, she has represented dozens of battered women -- most of them affluent, educated and self-supporting -- whose batterers could afford their victims' medical care and therapy. But New York had a one-year statute of limitations on civil suits for assault. Battering victims often are in no condition to sue within a year, and in Nussbaum's case, Levinson wanted to hold Steinberg liable for all 10 years of his beatings. She saw her opportunity in a provision allowing the clock to be stopped if the injured person has been unable to sue because of "insanity," which courts have interpreted to mean "an overall inability to function in society."
The suit, filed late in 1988, sought $3.6 million. But it soon looked as if the disbarred, jailed Steinberg had little left after his defense costs and tax problems. Levinson and Nussbaum agreed to continue the battle anyway, hoping to make new law for other battered women. Levinson says she has donated more than 2,100 hours representing Nussbaum in this and other legal matters. Fourteen women's groups, including the New York State League of Women Voters and B'nai B'rith Women, joined the suit.
At the pretrial hearings on the statute of limitations, Levinson relied on the expert testimony of Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun, a psychiatrist and director of Four Winds Hospital, and Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, a Harvard Medical School expert on psychological trauma. Levinson argued that Nussbaum was not a masochist who enjoyed or chose to endure her beatings but a reasonably normal woman trapped by an extraordinary manipulator.
In court, Klagsbrun and van der Kolk testified that Steinberg had systematically brainwashed, isolated and tortured Nussbaum, who merely survived from one beating to the next, functioning at a low level incompatible with bringing suit. Van der Kolk also testified that like Patty Hearst when taken hostage, Nussbaum formed a traumatic bond with Steinberg that took many months apart from him to loosen. He also noted that constant traumatic experience causes a victim's fight-or-flight response to be replaced by chemicals that numb pain and terror.
"It was true in Hedda's case," Levinson argued, "and it is true for other battered women, that when your surroundings are limited by your captor, you become focused on the tiny, tiny events of your life, like 'Will I eat today? Will I sleep on the floor today? Will I sleep at all today?"'
Steven Liebman, the special referee in the case, wrote in his decision in New York State Supreme Court that Nussbaum's inability to get help or seek legal assistance was "consistent with prolonged and extensive psychological and physical abuse" and noted that in domestic violence cases, "the victim may very well turn to the tormentor for connection and support....The destructive impact of violence in such an intimate relationship may be so complete that the victim is rendered incapable of independent judgment even to save one's own life."
While it is still unclear whether Steinberg will appeal, the groundbreaking decision now opens the way for battered women in New York and other states to sue their abusers. Levinson calls for legislation to extend the statute of limitation that would eliminate the need for costly and burdensome individual suits.
During one of our first meetings, Hedda Nussbaum showed me around her tree-shaded cottage in one of New York's northern suburbs. In each of her artistically decorated rooms were displayed the few mementos of Lisa and Mitchell she was able to save or scavenge -- snapshots, crayon drawings, dolls. As she led me around and pointed them out, the effect was of a ghastly theme-park tour.
We sat down in her living room, and she took her prize possession from the lamp table. It was a photograph of herself, young and pretty, bending over Lisa, then a baby. Tucked into the glass frame was a small cutting of Lisa's strawberry-blond hair. Nussbaum tenderly traced the hair strands with her little finger. There were tears in her half-closed eyes and a cast of such desolation over her smile that it was hard to look at her.
Yet within minutes, she was bustling about to show me a T-shirt she had decorated with one of Lisa's designs. The splotchy watercolor often attracted compliments. "I tell them, 'My daughter made this!' " she said zestily, as if a thriving Lisa made it in school only last week.
Her feelings about her adopted son, Mitchell, are different. She recalls the profound physical attachment she had to him as a baby -- he was returned to his biological mother -- and she fantasizes about a reunion when he is grown.
The emotional leaps are dizzying. Nussbaum is by turns touching, disturbing, even funny. Her dogged persistence -- attested to, for example, by her thick folders of job applications and resumes -- is moving. But harrowing awareness of her past colors her every utterance and act. From small talk and easy laughs she slides into grief, then reminisces with an eerie detachment. She becomes incensed about an issue and talks nonstop. She gets sidetracked by flickers of anger: taking ibuprofen for her sore tooth reminds her suddenly that Steinberg wouldn't let her take aspirin for the pain of her injuries. At other times she laughs at memories like his sending her to forage in supermarket dumpsters. "He liked free food -- he was so cheap. And I was so hungry I wanted to do it."
Chatting about food sensitivities, being a vegetarian, decorating decisions, her clothes, Nussbaum could be the Upper West Side professional she was before she met Steinberg. But try to engage her on deeper issues of her life, and she often seems naive and bewildered. I find many of our conversations painful, but when I apologize for how hard they must be, she chirps suddenly with girlish enthusiasm. "Oh, no, I find it exciting." She wants to use her notoriety for good, she says, and has five albums bulging with neatly filed clips. But, in her fragmented state, she talks with childlike eagerness of liking her "fame," as if she has forgotten what she's famous for. If she connects the pieces of her life, she will confront a picture few of us could look upon.
"Everything reminds me," she says later, as if responding to my unspoken concerns. "When I'm occupied with thinking about something specific, I don't." When she chops the carrots for our tuna salad, when she studies a menu, she is so absorbed that it's clear that she experiences nothing beyond that task.
Dr. Judith Herman, author of "Trauma and Recovery," explains that this lack of "modulation" of emotions and "unpredictable expression of feeling" is typical of trauma victims, whether battered women or prisoners of war. When such people get completely in touch with their feelings, van der Kolk explains, "the feelings are virtually unbearable." He adds, "Others in similar situations have killed themselves."
At this time, Nussbaum is slowly inching her way over the shards of her life toward accepting responsibility for her own role in the tragedy. Where she used to insist, in complete denial, that she was a wonderful mother, she now says she loved Lisa very much and was the best mother she could be. She says she doesn't feel "guilty" for her relationship with Steinberg but "regrets" it.
Van der Kolk says much damage remains from her abuse despite what Klagsbrun calls "absolutely astonishing" progress. Nussbaum herself, when I ask about the scars that remain, the work still to be done, looks lost. Then she responds with a quivery little smile and a sad quip that is haunting. "No, I'm poifect."
On the last day of february, Nussbaum, keyed up about the imminent court decision, teases a lawyer in her office about his messy desk. Her path to this, her second job as a legal secretary, began after she left Four Winds and was retrained as a paralegal. "One thing I got from Joel that was positive," she joked during one of our meetings, "was an interest in the law."
Failing to get jobs as Hedda Nussbaum, she used a pseudonym, she says. But despite mountains of applications, her real identity always scuttled her prospects. She worked part time as a word processor and applied decals to salt and pepper shakers in a ceramics factory. Finally, a lawyer, Ralph P. Katz, hired her as a legal secretary in April 1993. When he died of lung cancer in January 1996, she was unemployed for eight months. She obtained 21 interviews using her pseudonym but after revealing her identity was never hired. Finally, she says she decided: "Enough of this. I'm tired of using another name."
Using her own name, she soon found a job. "Being a secretary is not what I want to be when I grow up," she says, laughing. Still, she says she feels more comfortable with herself than ever, more than as a rising editor because then "I was giving the credit to Joel rather than myself." A realistic appraisal of her options battles in her with an eager, wistful hope for a normal life -- career, husband and even -- through marriage -- children and grandchildren. Seven years ago she began a correspondence with a 10-year-old "foster child" in the Philippines and has proudly kept that girl's letters to "Mama Hedda."
Her notoriety makes dating difficult, but she has attended singles events and used personal ads and dating services. "Hedda, huh?" one man asked, questioning her until he confirmed his suspicions, then disappeared. Another greeted her disclosure with a "freaked out" silence. Still, there has been the occasional nice guy, the no-chemistry evening. Nussbaum has the usual set of standards for men, plus a special one of her own.
"Right now," she tells me during one of our talks, "I can spot a controlling man a mile away!"
She gives a resounding no to the idea of seeing Steinberg again but concedes that she has not eradicated all feeling for him. "I still feel good about how I felt," she says, remembering some of the happiness.
"A healthy recovery from domestic violence includes remembering the good feeling," Levinson says."It's a part of herself."
On our last day together in March, at her office, Nussbaum is beaming. The press coverage of her legal victory has been overwhelmingly positive. Her phone-message tape is filled with calls from well-wishers. One women's group in New Jersey has requested her as a speaker, and she expects other invitations. She hopes to publish a book she has written for children about domestic violence and soon will help edit a domestic violence Web site planned by the Greenwich Junior League.
With the lawsuit, she says, she feels she has accomplished something positive for women. "I'd like to turn the tragedy into doing something for" -- she struggles to find the words, gesturing helplessly -- "although, of course ...I wish the tragedy hadn't happened." She subsides into silence, closes her eyes and sits utterly motionless.
A question from Levinson rouses Nussbaum, and almost immediately she is speaking briskly and knowledgeably about the lawsuit. She says she had explained to her battered-women group that the ruling can include women who are emotionally and economically abused. "You don't have to look" -- she breaks into a laugh -- "like I did."
Nussbaum will soon undergo further reconstructive surgery -- donated by a plastic surgeon -- to repair her nose and her cheek. She has decided not to undergo a third surgical attempt to repair her eye.
As we leave, Nussbaum heads outside to buy her lunch. Nimbly, she applies her Avon lip gloss and, her limp accentuated slightly by her elegant high heels, steps into the elevator and then out into the street.

HEADLINE: Clinton vs. the First Amendment

BYLINE: By Floyd Abrams; Floyd Abrams, a partner in the New York law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, is a constitutional lawyer.

 BODY:
At 10 a.m. on March 19, the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court walked to their leather chairs, which faced the attorneys before them. On one side of a podium were lawyers for a coalition of civil liberties and computer-industry groups prepared to argue that the Communications Decency Act signed into law by President Clinton last year violated the First Amendment. Standing on the other side, ready to defend the constitutionality of the law, were lawyers for Attorney General Janet Reno and, by extension, President Clinton himself.
From any First Amendment perspective, it was a depressingly familiar sight. Government lawyers routinely defend governmental conduct. But it has become the norm, not the exception, for Clinton Administration lawyers to find themselves minimizing First Amendment interests and defending laws or policies that maximize threats to free expression. Time and again, the Administration has opposed serious First Amendment claims in court, acquiesced in serious First Amendment damage by legislation and ignored First Amendment limits in its own conduct. Even when the Administration has raised First Amendment concerns, it has done so haltingly and briefly. 
 It is not hard to understand why. First Amendment claims tend to be made by unpopular people or institutions who wish to say unpopular things. Popular speakers rarely need legal protection. To lend meaningful support to First Amendment protections, a President must be prepared to put aside popular political positions and defend the rights of those who say things of which the public thoroughly disapproves.
They include a cadre of sometimes disagreeable candidates: Nazis and pornographers; companies (including those that sell liquor and cigarettes) that seek to advertise; citizens who wish to contribute large amounts of money to political parties and others who wish to protest abortion within shouting distance of the clinics where they are performed. The First Amendment's reach also includes the often despised and always feared media. To protect such people and institutions to the fullest requires a good dose of political courage. Often a price must be paid. It has not been one Clinton has been prepared to pay.
In some ways, Clinton had seemed a perfect President to defend the First Amendment. A former war protester himself -- a First Amendment user, that is -- he had moved from his Rhodes scholarship years at Oxford to Yale Law School and then to a position teaching constitutional law before entering politics. While serving as Governor of Arkansas, he opposed the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court because of the "threat" posed by "Judge Bork's constitutional theories of individual and civil rights," which were "perhaps the most restrictive ... of anyone who has been nominated to the Court in decades." In his first week as President, Clinton reversed the policy of the Reagan and Bush Administrations that had silenced doctors in publicly funded hospitals from advising their patients of their right to an abortion.
But he had a problem. Running as a "new Democrat," Clinton had carefully positioned himself to avert Republican attacks on him as a liberal. Repeatedly, he declared himself in favor of the death penalty and welfare reform. More broadly, he promised to promote family values, to defend children, to empower parents. He would use Government more sparingly than others had done but use it vigorously to accomplish his policy ends.
It was good politics. Some of it may even have been good public policy.
But it was at war with the First Amendment. No part of our Constitution is less family-friendly than the First Amendment. None is more hostile to government. The First Amendment unnerves many parents precisely because it protects the right to speak in a robust and uninhibited way. It unsettles Government officials when it interferes with their ability to make and execute Government policy -- sometimes even beneficent public policy. It is counterintuitive enough for any Administration to be genuinely protective of the First Amendment. For Bill Clinton's Administration, it has been impossible.
The Communications Decency Act, co-sponsored by Senator James Exon, a Democrat from Nebraska, was a response to the extraordinary level of vulgarity and sexual explicitness found in some Web sites on the Internet. In keeping with longstanding Congressional practice, the legislative response was not only unnecessary (technology already exists permitting parents to control what their children watch) but also of the most dubious constitutionality.
With maximum prison terms of two years and fines of $250,000, the law makes it criminal to post on the Internet material that is not obscene, that may have serious artistic value and that adults cannot be barred from seeing. So long as the material may be "indecent" or "patently offensive" to children under 18, it is unlawful. As Chief Judge Dolores K. Sloviter of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit pointed out, "photographs appearing in National Geographic or a travel magazine of the sculptures in India of couples copulating in numerous positions, a written description of brutal prison rape or Francesco Clemente's painting 'Labirinth"' may all now be barred from the Internet.
The Administration understood this well. In a letter from Acting Assistant Attorney General Kent Markus to Senator Patrick J. Leahy on May 3, 1995, when the act was being considered, the Administration warned that the law would "threaten important First Amendment" rights by imposing "criminal sanctions on the transmission of constitutionally protected speech."
Nonetheless, the Administration generally played a low-volume role as the legislation proceeded through Congress. Even when House Speaker Newt Gingrich denounced the law as "clearly a violation of free speech" and "a violation of the rights of adults to communicate with each other," the President stood mute, and his Administration made no effort to join Gingrich in opposing the legislation. (Gingrich himself ultimately voted for the bill.)
When the law eventually passed, as part of a far broader piece of telecommunications legislation, the President signed it without comment on the "decency" provisions. Since then, the Administration has vigorously defended it in the courts as a method of protecting children from "patently offensive" material on the Internet at the same time it encouraged adults "to use what has become an unparalleled educational resource."
Two three-judge courts, one in Philadelphia and another in New York, have already concluded that the law violates the First Amendment. Judge Stewart Dalzell, a member of the Philadelphia panel, described the Internet as "a never-ending worldwide conversation," which the Government is not permitted to interrupt. "As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed," he wrote, "the Internet deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion." Not from the Clinton Administration, which responded with a statement from the President himself, saying that "our Constitution allows us to help parents by enforcing this act to prevent children from being exposed to objectionable material."
A similar scenario occurred with the passage of the Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996. Adopted for the supposed purpose of promoting the "honor, courage and commitment" of American troops, the law's response was to bar Army PX's from selling magazines like Penthouse.
When the legislation was being considered, the Defense Department sent a memorandum to Congress stating that the law "would raise serious constitutional and administrative problems" since the rights of service members "may not be restricted without compelling justification." Again, the legislation was sent to the President as part of a broader piece of legislation, and once again the President signed it. When a constitutional challenge was mounted by Penthouse, Government lawyers defended the law as a "reasonable" effort of the Government "to disassociate itself from lewd and vulgar expression when such expression undermines a legitimate governmental objective."
On Jan. 22, Federal District Judge Shira Scheindlin (a Clinton appointee) held the law to be unconstitutional. "Citizens," she wrote, "do not jettison their constitutional rights simply by enlisting in the armed forces. ... Our Constitution has effectively protected us for over two centuries from living in a society where the Government intrudes on our individual rights by deciding what a consenting adult can read or view." The Administration has appealed.
In the Supreme Court itself, the Clinton record on First Amendment claims has been regrettably predictable: rejection of the claims and mini-mization of First Amendment interests. The Court itself, with seven appointees of Republican Presidents and two (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer) of President Clinton, has routinely rebuffed the Administration's efforts to limit First Amendment rights, opting in favor of far broader protection.
Consider some examples.
*An Illinois public hospital discharged a nurse because of reports that she had made "unkind and inappropriate negative" comments about her supervisor and was "knocking" the obstetrics department. The
Administration defended the hospital, arguing that government employers may fire their employees based on such reports without doing any investigating to determine whether the subject of the speech really involved a matter protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that "the possibility of inadvertently punishing someone for exercising her First Amendment rights" requires that government employers undertake a reasonable investigation of the subject of the speech before disciplining an employee based on the speech.
*The Administration argued for a provision of the Ethics in Government Act that broadly prohibited employees from accepting any compensation for making speeches, even when there was no connection between the speech and the Government employment. The Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that the law violated the First Amendment since "its prohibition on compensation unquestionably imposes a significant burden on expressive activity" and "on the public's right to read and hear what the employees would otherwise have written and said."
*In a significant case involving the protection afforded by the First Amendment for commercial speech, the Administration argued that Federal regulations that prohibited labels on beer cans from truthfully displaying their alcohol content were constitutional. The Supreme Court again disagreed, concluding that the statute violated the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech.
*In the area of political campaign contributions, the Administration argued that the First Amendment permitted limits to be imposed on spending by political parties. The Supreme Court rejected the argument, concluding that "the independent expression of a political party's view is 'core' First Amendment activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates or other political committees."
*The Administration defended the constitutionality of provisions of an injunction issued against abortion clinic protesters. It established a 300-foot "no approach" zone around the clinic and a 300-foot buffer zone around staff residences, and it also banned the protesters from using "images observable" to patients inside the clinic. The Supreme Court concluded that the three provisions violated the First Amendment since they burdened "more speech than is necessary to prevent intimidation and to insure access to the clinic."
What is most telling about these cases is not their ideological overview -- some pleased conservatives, others liberals -- but the Court's consistency. In all the cases, a Supreme Court that has hardly embraced an A.C.L.U.-like agenda has rejected the Administration's tepid reading of the First Amendment. While the Clinton Justice Department has occasionally taken a more sympathetic view of First Amendment claims with which the Court has agreed, it has never sought more protection than the Court granted and almost always sought less.
When prior Administrations cared deeply about issues, they vigorously tried to change the Supreme Court's direction. Franklin Roosevelt's Administration sought (and, with a sufficient change of judicial personnel, obtained) a significant shift in judicial thinking about the reach of Federal authority over most aspects of the econo-my. The Reagan Administration was unswerving in its efforts to persuade the Court to change its views on the right of a woman to have an abortion.
If the Administration believed it especially important to protect First Amendment rights, it might well have refused to defend one or more of the enactments in the first place. That would have left it up to Congress to defend its own dubious laws before the Supreme Court. The Clinton Administration has never taken this course.
The Administration defends many of its policies as having been adopted in the service of protecting a special, particularly threatened group: our "kids." It is on this basis alone that the Administration has defended the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act. It is the same argument the Administration has made when it has sought, more than any other since Richard Nixon's, to affect the content of what appears on television. Intense Administration pressure in 1996 for the adoption of a V-chip on television sets was followed in 1997 by still more intense pressure for programs to be rated on the basis of their content. One of the advantages of the V-chip, the President has stated, is that it "might actually change the content" of television programming. So it might. But these poll-tested and undoubtedly popular Administration efforts to change the content of television programming run headlong into the single best-established First Amendment rule of all: that Government involvement in determining the content of what is and is not said is almost always unconstitutional.
The need to protect children is real enough -- compelling enough, the courts say -- that the law allows some actions to be taken that could not be held constitutional with respect to adults. But it is a dangerous doctrine too, one that could, if not constrained, result in what Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter referred to as "reducing the adult population to reading only what is fit for children." If read too broadly, it is also a prescription for governmental involvement in areas that have historically been left to parents, not Government officials.
The Administration has exhibited a striking insensitivity to the impact of the efforts of some members of Congress to establish a "safe harbor" on television, a time period during which otherwise perfectly lawful programs could not be shown for fear of their adverse impact on children. Senator Fritz Hollings headed the Senate Commerce Committee when Attorney General Reno appeared to testify in 1993. Hollings had proposed making it unlawful for broadcasters to show "any violent video programming during hours when children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience." Farewell, then, to "Schindler's List," which NBC showed one evening last month at 7:30 P.M. But even more important: what sort of First Amendment would permit Congress to impose such a limitation on any broadcaster's right to show the film? Or any adult's right to watch it? And how committed to the First Amendment could any Administration be if it gave Congress a green light to pass such legislation?
Testifying before Hollings and his committee, Reno did just that. Asserting, without qualification, that all the different forms of legislation then being considered by Congress (including that of Hollings) were "constitutional and can be passed," the Attorney General offered the Administration's imprimatur.
As a legal matter, the Attorney General's advice was dubious. In the past, the Supreme Court has concluded that the fact that material aimed at both adults and children contained predominantly violent depictions could not itself justify barring its sale. The Court has permitted (in one of its most First Amendment-threatening opinions) limits on when scatological terms in a George Carlin record could be broadcast on the radio. But it has yet to countenance any scheme that would bar "Schindler's List" or any other program that is far from being obscene from being broadcast at any time in the evening based upon its content. Far from acquiescing in the legislation, the Administration should surely have have raised dire warnings about it.
President Clinton himself has not always chosen to oppose First Amendment interests. At some political risk, the President opposed a proposed (and generally popular) constitutional amendment to the First Amendment itself -- the first in the country's history -- that would have permitted legislation making it a crime to burn an Ameri-can flag. And he has said nothing as shameful about civil liberties issues as did former President George Bush in his McCarthyite attack on Michael Dukakis as a "card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U."
But these are exceptions. The President, a former constitutional law teacher, is entitled to be judged on his Administration's entire First Amendment record. Sum it up this way: Lee Atwater would have admired it; Dick Morris may yet claim credit for it; Bill Clinton should know better.

Grant Fizzles at a Housing Project

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Two years ago, things looked good for the people of the Beach 41st Street Houses, a public development that had come to be known as the stereotypical social failure. Drug dealers were the major employers, criminals more prevalent than cops and hopelessness the companion of many schoolchildren, residents say.
But in 1995, the government came in promising to change all that. With the help of residents, the New York City Housing Authority secured a $48 million grant from the Federal government. A new school was promised, as were a center for the elderly, an athletic complex, job-training courses, structural upgrades on the 712-unit complex and best of all, low-interest loans to attract business to this isolated community surrounded by water and vacant lots on the east end of the Rockaway Peninsula. 
 What's more, the Housing Authority promised to hold a percentage of empty apartments for working-class people like police officers, to create an economic mix that would ignite a social rejuvenation. By the sound of it, residents like Frances Johnson said, life at Beach 41st Street was going to be a Shangri-La.
Then the roof caved in. "They promised to take us to the moon," said Mrs. Johnson, president of the Beach 41st Street Houses Resident Council. "They ended up dumping us in the sewer."
The deal fell through. The money, to come from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was stripped from the development in January and reallocated to the Edgemere Houses, another project 10 blocks away, after officials of the Housing Authority decided that they could not work with the resident council at Beach 41st. Tenants in the development had exploded when they learned that the equivalent of 100 apartments would have to be destroyed as part of the redevelopment plan.
"When I saw them breaking ground near Edgemere last month, it broke my heart," said Patricia Frye, the council's vice president, who lives in the development with her 12-year-old son, Chris. "People were going to lose their homes. But housing officials didn't want to hear about it. We're not supposed to have a brain because we're project people."
The HUD program, known as HOPE IV, is supposed to give local community leaders and tenants a role in designing the revitalization plans for their beleaguered housing projects and more control over its operations.
However, it calls for the demolition of apartments. Eighty percent of the funds must go to razing, building and upgrading. It is something that housing officials like to refer to as the "alleviation of density issues." In cities like Atlanta, Chicago and Detroit, public developments that have been torn down were dilapidated and abandoned. But in New York, low-income housing is at a premium. Housing Authority officials admit that the Beach 41st Street project is structurally sound and was near capacity when the plan was rubber-stamped. The $48 million in improvements would have meant sacrificing some homes.
"We've asked the Federal authorities to reconsider the demolition requirement for New York City," said John Martinez, deputy manager of the New York City Housing Authority.
The agency, Mr. Martinez said, made every effort to come up with alternatives to appease the residents. A plan was floated to redevelop vacant ground-level apartments for nonresidential uses, and the agency promised to relocate the few people who would lose their homes.
"But the residents and the council were difficult to work with," Mr. Martinez said. "They wanted veto power over everything. The process dragged on for too long." Eventually officials from HUD got fed up and pulled the plug. Residents at the Edgemere Houses are scheduled to get the money in 18 months. CHARLIE LeDUFF

Building a Nest Egg and a Community

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
TWO years ago, when Kike (pronounced KEE-kay) Hiciano Payano, a video and film producer in Washington Heights, decided to buy a new video camera, he first went to his bank for a $500 line of credit.
The bank, the Citibank branch at Broadway and 181st Street, denied his application, but told Mr. Hiciano that he could bolster his credit standing by buying a certificate of deposit in the same amount as collateral, Mr. Hiciano said. 
 "It made no sense," Mr. Hiciano said recently through a translator. "If I had that kind of money to put in the bank, what do I need to borrow from them for?"
Out of desperation, Mr. Hiciano did what many in Inwood and Washington Heights have done for years: he went to a "prestamista" -- a loanshark -- and took out a four-month loan at 4 percent weekly interest, which compounds to 341 percent annually. Two months later, Mr. Hiciano wanted to borrow another $3,000 to buy a computer, at 5 percent a week for three months. Even though he started paying back the loans immediately, Mr. Hiciano still had to pay interest on the full principal until the end. By the time the loans were paid off, Mr. Hiciano had shelled out $3,360 in interest alone during a seven-month period.
"I never wanted to go to a prestamista," said Mr. Hiciano. "But when the bank turns you down, how much can you borrow from your family and friends?"
But Mr. Hiciano and others in Inwood and Washington Heights now have an alternative to exorbitant interest rates and out-of-reach bank loans: the Neighborhood Trust Federal Credit Union, which opened on March 20 in the George Washington Bridge Bus Station building at 178th Street and Fort Washington Avenue.
The credit union, in a renovated office with wood paneling and industrial carpeting, is run by Mark Levine, 27, and Luis De Los Santos, 31, who formed Credit Where Credit Is Due, a nonprofit organization that operates the credit union. Their goal is to offer affordable banking services and personal loans to those who are overlooked by the banks in the area, said Mr. Levin, the executive director of the organization and the president of the credit union.
To realize their goal, Mr. Levine and Mr. De Los Santos quit their jobs as teachers in the New York City public school system to work on forming the credit union. In the interim, Mr. Levine also received a master's degree in public policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, writing his thesis on the conditions of financial services in Washington Heights.
"We just wanted to make a change," Mr. Levine said.
In subsequent research, Mr. Levin and Mr. De Los Santos found a staggering 73 percent of the 800 residents they surveyed said they depend on relatives, friends, loan sharks and pawn shops for loans.
For years, residents have complained that the banking industry ignores low-income neighborhoods like Inwood and Washington Heights. Sarah Ludwig, executive director of Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, a nonprofit organization, said that while there is one bank branch for every 5,000 people in other parts of Manhattan, the ratio is three times that in upper Manhattan, or one branch for every 15,000 people. Recently, some full-service banks have been reduced to automated teller services. Cultural barriers and other problems also keep many from the banks.
Instead of opening accounts, Mr. Levine said, people here prefer to stash their money under mattresses or in drawers, symptoms of their residual distrust of institutions and authorities in their home countries. This prevents people from building up a credit history, which can be helpful during the loan process. Some also stay away because of high fees, Mr. Levine said. To receive no-fee service at banks, a minimum balance might be set as high as $3,000. When a customer's balance drops below that, most banks charge a monthly fee of $10 to $30.
"This adds up to a lot of money," Mr. Levine said. "A lot of people can't afford it."
Yet others are scared off by rumors throughout the neighborhood.
"Some people who are receiving public assistance are under the wrong impression that their benefits would be cut off if they opened a bank account," Mr. Levine said.
At the credit union, the minimum for a no-fee account is $50. If the balance falls below that, there is a $1 monthly charge. Mr. Levine said members can borrow short-term personal loans of $500 to $5,000 at a rate of about a quarter point below market. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates last week, Mr. Levine said the credit union will fix its short-term lending rate at 14 percent annually, a bargain compared to the more than 300 percent rate the prestamistas now charge.
In its first four days of business, more than 50 people, including Mr. Hiciano, have signed up. "This is really going to help me," said Janet Morales, who stopped by last Monday. Ms. Morales, a single mother of four who said she was looking to get off public assistance, wanted to borrow $500 to open a day-care center at home.
"I applied for a loan through the Citibank," Ms. Morales said. "They turned me down even with my sister as a co-signer."
But there are limitations to the credit union. So far, many have signed up with the intent to borrow. Although major banks like Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank and Fuji Bank have pledged nearly $500,000 in low-interest deposits to the credit union, and the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone has given it a $46,000 grant and nearly $250,000 in low-interest loans, it must attract enough customers to keep going. "The success of a credit union depends on the number of depositors," Ms. Ludwig said.
Clifford Rosenthal, executive director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, a non-profit organization that provides support to the credit unions, said there are 25 such credit unions citywide, with deposits averaging about $2 million each.
To help residents to overcome their fear of the institution, Mr. Levine and Mr. De Los Santos are planning to visit local churches and community groups and to offer basic finance courses. Their goal is to sign up 1,000 members within the year and to get $500,000 in deposits.

Mortality Wears a Profitable, Noncyclical Edge

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
SOME investors may find the subject ghoulish, but the fact is the funeral business is alive and flourishing. Although its stocks are not markedly low-priced, and its revenues may be threatened by the cheaper option of cremation, the "death care" industry is now enjoying increasing demand and a wave of consolidations, all while retaining its enviable ability to raise prices.
The aging of the baby boomers is one reason for the sector's sunny prospects. The number of deaths in the United States is rising by about eight-tenths of a percent a year, and is expected to do so until 2005 or so. But after that, and until 2040, deaths are expected to rise by 1.4 percent annually. That step-up will mean more demand for everything from funerals and coffins to bereavement support groups and remembrance services. For a company like Service Corporation International, the industry leader with more than 2,800 funeral homes, 330 cemeteries and 140 crematoriums worldwide, the potential growth in revenue is great. 
 And for investors who expect an economic slowdown, the companies may also hold appeal. "These stocks should be looked at as defensive stocks," said Susan R. Little, an analyst at Raymond James. "They're in a noncyclical industry, where demand for services is always there."
Moreover, funeral companies are working hard at cutting costs. For example, they are increasingly clustering their funeral homes within geographic areas so that the homes can share, say, a central embalming place or a fleet of cars. Ms. Little particularly likes Stewart Enterprises, an industry leader, because of its high potential savings from a clustering strategy.
Many kinds of businesses can lower costs, but few have this industry's ability to raise prices with so little consumer resistance. The reason is not only that people hate to scrimp, or appear to be scrimping, on the funerals of their loved ones, but also that people shop for funerals infrequently and have little sense of what prices should be.
Consequently, the average traditional funeral with a coffin and an in-ground vault cost more than $5,400 in 1995, the last year for which statistics were available. That is an increase of almost 22 percent since 1991.
And funeral companies that are adept at creating good will can reap the rewards for a long time, said Barry Fingerhut, the president of Geo Capital, a money manager.
"If you do a good job in this business, it can last 100 years, through subsequent generations," said Mr. Fingerhut, whose company holds $140 million in shares of several industry leaders. "I expect the good will will help these companies as they expand into other businesses, like the so-called pre-need business, where companies sell funerals to consumers before they're needed."
The stocks of many funeral companies are not bargains, at least by some measures. Service Corporation International is trading at 24.20 times its estimated earnings for 1997, for example, while Stewart Enterprises and Equity Corporation International, another leading company, are trading at multiples of 24.95 and 32.29, respectively. In light of the 20.31 multiple of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, these stocks seem highly priced.
By other measures, however, the stocks may not seem too expensive. Analysts compare stock multiples to the companies' expected annual rates of earnings growth, for instance. And they consider the stocks to be reasonably priced if the multiples are at or below the yearly growth projections.
Analysts predict very good growth for funeral-industry earnings -- about 25 percent a year, on average. At that quick pace, multiples that may seem excessive in slower-growing industries may be reasonable.
Joseph Chiarelli, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, said the funeral companies that he tracks had multiples below their company-specific growth projections when he checked those numbers last week. As stock prices fluctuate, these companies' multiples may surpass 25, the average percentage growth projection, but the lesson for investors may be to check the multiple and to buy on price dips.
ONE reason for the industry's rosy growth projections is acquisitions. According to Mr. Chiarelli, the four largest funeral companies -- Service, Stewart Enterprises, Equity and the Loewen Group -- own 18 percent of the $10 billion domestic market, up from 14 percent four years ago. As those numbers suggest, there is room for many more mergers: The quartet of companies still owns fewer than 5,000 of the 24,000 funeral homes in the country.
"We think it's an industry that's very ripe for more consolidation," said Zack Shafran, a portfolio manager at Waddell & Reed, which manages $25 billion and owns shares in Equity and Stewart Enterprises.
Both those companies, Mr. Shafran said, have the tightly knit management that seems to work in the industry, where customers often prefer to deal with long-established companies they know. Stewart still has family members at its helm, while many of Equity's 163 homes are run by second- and third-generation families.
At J. P. Morgan, Mr. Chiarelli likes the stocks of Service, Equity and Stewart, in that order. Equity, he said, should benefit from its strong presence in those rural markets that have high death rates. And Stewart has more homes combined with adjacent cemeteries than its rivals, enabling it to profit from both businesses.
But Mr. Chiarelli's top pick is Service, particularly because of its promising acquisitions overseas, where the market potential is large and where the chance to improve efficiencies is great. In 1995, for instance, Service bought more than 1,000 funeral homes in Europe, mostly in France. In less than a year and a half, Mr. Chiarelli said, those acquisitions expanded their operating margins to 13 percent from 9 percent.
Ms. Little also likes Mr. Chiarelli's three favorites, but she likes Stewart the most. The company began using clustering and other strategies more recently than its rivals did, and thus may see more earnings improvement going forward. The company has also given regional managers more autonomy and has instituted a bonus program; both moves could help it increase its revenues.
Mr. Shafran dismisses the shares of Carriage Services, a smaller company, as too costly; it was trading at 31.61 times estimated earnings at the week's close. But some analysts think the small size of Carriage may give it a leg up when it seeks acquisitions. Owners of independent funeral homes, who usually become employees of acquiring companies, may feel they can play larger corporate roles within such a smaller enterprise.
But what about Loewen, the industry's second-largest company? Service Corporation International failed in an attempt to take over Loewen last fall, but the ordeal was costly for the target.
Partly as a result, "Loewen is a capital-constrained company, while this is clearly an acquisition-driven industry," Mr. Shafran said.
Nevertheless, with its stock trading at just 20.52 times earnings, Loewen is among the industry's cheaper buys. And given that analysts expect the company's earnings to grow 25 percent a year, Loewen stock looks attractively priced.
But the funeral industry, whatever its promise, also faces some troubling risks. Some analysts worry that as the acquisition race heats up, some companies will overpay. Mr. Chiarelli said some companies had already come close to doing so.
OTHER dangers involve the industry's fabled strong point: pricing power. Mr. Shafran, for instance, says discounters who charge half as much as regular funeral companies are now appearing in some domestic markets. An example, he said, is Charter Funerals in Kansas City, Mo.; it plans to be in a half-dozen or more areas over the next 12 to 18 months.
"We don't think they have broad-based appeal, but we've seen a number of markets where traditional funeral-home-and-cemetery arrangements have been bypassed in favor of low-end, cut-rate operations," he said.
Some discounters just want certain parts of the business. Direct Casket of Van Nuys, Calif., one of several "coffin only" companies in Southern Calfornia, says it sells coffins at 30 percent to 70 percent below funeral-home prices.
Traditional funeral companies must also deal with an increase in cremations. The cremation rate is now about 22 percent for all domestic deaths, but one estimate calls for it to double by 2010. Although many funeral companies run their own cremation businesses, the revenue risk is great because a simple cremation costs just $800.
Can the industry avoid this danger? "The challenge for the funeral industry will be to try to bridge the revenue gap between direct cremations and those that come with an accompanying service," Ms. Little said. "The consolidators within this industry have the marketing power to do that."

Jitters for the Port Authority's Bondholders?

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
WITH the recent appointment of his good friend and trusted lieutenant, Robert E. Boyle, as executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Gov. George E. Pataki has revived talk about breaking up the sprawling agency that operates the road, rail and air gateways to the region.
For the many people who own a piece of the Port Authority's $5.5 billion in outstanding debt, that raises the inevitable question: How could such a major restructuring affect the value of their bonds? 
 History can provide little guidance, Port Authority officials and bond analysts said, because no multistate agency has disbanded in the many decades that Congress has allowed their creation.
But history aside, bondholders should relax, the experts said. Dissolving the agency would require far more political cooperation and willpower than currently exists, they said. And a major downsizing of the Port Authority through, say, the divestiture of its airports, would face huge financial and political obstacles.
Even if there were a huge restructuring of the agency, the political pressure from Wall Street, major institutional investors and elected officials to protect bondholders' interests would be overwhelming.
"My feeling is that there is no way they could split it up without bondholders being covered, because it would be so politically unpopular," said Andrea Bozzo, managing director of Fitch Investor Services. Fitch, a credit rating agency, has not changed the bonds' rating or put a watch on them since the recent developments, she added.
Nevertheless, some bondholders may view Mr. Pataki's recent statements with concern. He has echoed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's complaints that the agency favors New Jersey, does a poor job of running John F. Kennedy International and La Guardia airports and ought to reduce its real estate holdings. Indeed, Mr. Pataki told Crain's New York Business recently, "In my mind, it is still an open question whether the Port Authority is salvageable."
Mr. Pataki has made the issue more real by asking Mr. Boyle to study how to make the Port Authority work more efficiently, and, if that is deemed impossible, to propose ways to restructure it.
Aides to both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Boyle said the new executive director's primary goal was to make the agency succeed, not kill it. "The Governor sent him in here with the mission to see what it would take and how to go about making this place work," said Mark Hatfield, director of communications for the Port Authority.
Making any changes would be highly complicated because the agency is the child of two states. Dissolving it would require the consent of both states' Governors and Legislatures. And though Mr. Pataki is raising the idea, there is little interest in Trenton.
The agency has sold assets, as it did last year with the Vista Hotel and is considering doing now with the World Trade Center. Because all Port Authority revenues go into a general fund, the sale of a few properties does not affect the agency's ability to repay bondholders, analysts said.
But what if the Port Authority were to reduce significantly its revenue stream by divesting itself of some big assets, like the airports? Many experts question whether there are even any takers for such properties, and if there were, whether the public would stand for privatizing something as important as a leading airport.
Nothing in the bonds' covenants prevents such sales, however. And bondholders may not be fully reassured by the statements of Port Authority officials that any sale proceeds must be used to redeem agency bonds or to invest in new projects whose revenues could be pledged to bondholders.
FOR instance, bondholders often get irked if their bonds are recalled early, said Jim Lynch, publisher of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory report. In such cases, investors lose a stream of income they had assumed would be there, and though they can buy another bond with the redemption proceeds, they may not find one as much to their liking as the one recalled. And even if bonds are not redeemed, bondholders who liked the idea of having their Port Authority investments backed up with revenues from, say, airports, might feel less secure if the revenues came from something else, like a real estate development.
All the talk about restructuring the Port Authority has not affected the sale of its bonds, judging by a recent $300 million offering in January. Mr. Lynch said those bonds had fluctuated with the market, but not because of Mr. Pataki's remarks.
That may change if Mr. Boyle urges Mr. Pataki to seek an agency overhaul, but for the moment many analysts are unperturbed. Mr. Lynch said major institutional investors still consider Port Authority bonds a good buy and do not pay much attention to the griping of politicians.
"They know if the state were to try an end run, selling certain assets that are key to providing revenues, the state would be in court in a flash," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Why Both Bulls and Bears Can Act So Bird-Brained

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
MARKETS must be rational: most distinguished economists have bet their careers on that.
Still, your gut may be telling you something quite different -- that investors can be just plain irrational. 
 You are not alone.
To measure just how quirky investors can be, some insurgent economists are going beyond mathematical equations and computer models and are engaging in some unusual behavior of their own. They are joining psychologists in observing how laboratory humans perform in all sorts of experiments. They have watched normally rational citizens flip coins to test their inclination to gamble. They are consulting old studies of pigeons to learn how people can deceive themselves.
And they are asking: Why do investors do things that are so obviously foolish? Why do they see patterns where there are none? Why do they behave with such overconfidence when common sense says they should behave otherwise?
The answers, these economists believe, can be crucial to understanding the stock market at a time when the chairman of the Federal Reserve shakes the financial world with the frightening words "irrational exuberance."
The occasional irrational binges of investors, they argue, have helped explain why the traditional theory of market performance periodically misfires, although last Thursday's 140-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average may be no more than a rational response to the Fed's increase in interest rates.
More practically, individual investors and money managers can benefit enormously by recognizing their irrational alter egos: the otherwise sensible investor who is prone to excessive, costly trading; who ignores history and is lured by the market action of the moment; who can't stand to take losses but ultimately is humbled into suffering yet bigger losses; whose worst fear is investor's remorse.
"If you know there are fairly consistent patterns of behavior bias and can go against those patterns, you can make money," said Susan Belden, the co-editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst, a money-management newsletter based near San Francisco.
Value investing, the investing style most dependent on behavioral quirks, has done this for a long time, capitalizing on the tendency of people to overreact to bad news and to react slowly to good news. This gives the investor a chance to profit by buying stocks sold off by the herd.
"Fundamentally, this approach tells us that human behavior matters in markets just like everywhere else," said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a leader in the field of behavioral economics.
N. Gregory Mankiw, a more traditional professor of economics at Harvard and the author of a new introductory economics textbook, agrees.
"Maybe to fully understand market behavior we have to introduce some form of irrationality," he acknowledged. The behaviorists have "opened my eyes to alternative ways of thinking."
Financial behaviorists, who are being heeded as never before, are building on years of research by psychologists and others with no economic axes to grind, adding their own experiments and new conclusions. But their interpretations of behavior and how it applies to financial markets are less precise than the equations and computer models of traditional economists.

Overconfidence
The traditional theory of markets holds that investors are rational and that markets are efficient, quickly reflecting new information and the decisions of millions of investors.
Based on this view, investors should hold stocks for the long term, unless new information dictates a change. After all, history tells us that investing for the long run is the surest route to profit, and that with information disseminated so quickly and then promptly reflected in stock prices, we cannot act fast enough to outperform the market.
Still, investors can exhibit persistent and potentially harmful symptoms of overconfidence, unshaken in their convictions that they can beat the market. Both professional and amateur investors continue to trade actively, suffering needless losses and costing themselves a bundle in commissions.
And professional money managers are thriving because of investors' enduring hopes that the stock pickers ultimately will excel.
This mentality has been tested in surveys of car drivers. Asked if they consider themselves above-average drivers, most people say yes, leaving wide open the question of who all the below-average drivers are.
"One of the hardest things to imagine is that you are not smarter than average," said Daniel Kahneman, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University.
Professor Thaler and Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale, note that individual investors and money managers persist in their beliefs that they are endowed with more and better information than others, and that they can profit by picking stocks.
Sobering experience can help those who delude themselves. But not always. That people "do not learn to correct most of their tendencies to overconfidence is apparently just one of the limitations of the human mind," Professor Shiller wrote in an article available on the World Wide Web.
Overconfident investors, behaviorists say, also affect the market as a whole. Consider the huge trading volume in stocks. Much of it, some economists believe, can be traced to the behavioral quirks of investors.
High volume is "the single most embarrassing fact for an efficient market," Professor Thaler said. "People are supposed to be buying and holding."
Terrance Odean, a behavioral economist who will join the faculty of the University of California at Davis in May, found a stunning pace of buying and selling in his study of trading at an unidentified discount brokerage firm from 1987 to 1993. Examining 10,000 accounts, Mr. Odean found that individual investors had an average annual turnover rate of 78 percent in the securities they owned.
By his calculations, the stocks that they sold outperformed the ones they bought by about three percentage points, before commissions, in the year after the sale. Such a missed opportunity is the price that investors pay for overconfidence about their own investment prowess.
Could overconfidence also foster the "irrational exuberance" over stocks that has worried the chairman of the Federal Reserve? Professor Kahneman thinks so. Investors may think they can continue doing well in the market despite warnings from many analysts that stocks are overvalued.
"Optimism has a lot to do with what is going on," he said. "Many more than 50 percent of the people in the market think they are better than average at picking stocks and picking trends, and that contributes to irrational exuberance."

The Fear of Losses
If stocks are likely to produce a much higher return than bonds over the long run, why do investors still buy bonds?
Because, the behaviorists say, the pain of a small loss is greater than the thrill of a big gain. In addition, it seems that investors become even more averse to losses through apparently irrelevant actions, like frequently checking the value of their portfolios.
As Peter L. Bernstein observed in "Against the Gods," his 1996 book about the history of risk-taking, "Losses will always loom larger than gains."
Professor Thaler argues that this fear of losses makes investors ignore the opportunity for gains provided by stocks. Staying out of the stock market during the last two years, he says, has probably meant more "losses," in missed opportunities, than the out-of-pocket losses from the 1987 crash.
Another behavior -- avoiding the pain of regret -- helps explain why investors hold on to losers for too long. By not selling, the investor avoids fully facing the fact that he made a bad decision.
Investors also tend to take much more risk to avoid losses than to secure gains. That behavior is demonstrated in an experiment once conducted by Professor Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky, two leading contributors to the psychology behind behavioral finance.
In the experiment, participants were told that there was a rare disease breaking out and that 600 people were expected to die. Two plans were proposed. Under Plan A, 200 people would survive. Under Plan B, there was a 33 percent chance that everyone would be saved and a 67 percent probability that no one would be saved. Seventy-two percent of the people chose the risk-averse Plan A, with the certainty of saving 200 lives.
Then the participants were offered another set of alternatives. Under Plan C, 400 people would die. Under Plan D, there was a 33 percent probability that no one would die and a 67 percent chance that everyone would die.
Plan A and C have the same outcome (200 people survive), as do Plans B and D (a 33 percent chance that all would survive but a 67 percent chance that no one would). But the way the second set of alternatives was phrased highlighted the loss of life -- the certainty that 400 people would die. And in that circumstance, 78 percent chose to gamble on the 33 percent chance that no one would die.
This discomfort with losses may help explain why some investors buy more shares of their losing stocks when prices fall further. They don't want to confront the loss, so they take added risk -- by buying more of the stock -- in an attempt to avoid the loss.

Magical Thinking
According to the behaviorists, investors can suffer from "magical thinking." They make connections between two occurrences when, in fact, there is no link.
In illustrating such self-deception, behaviorists mention an old study of pigeons. In the 1940's, B. F. Skinner, the psychologist, fed starved, caged pigeons small amounts of food at 15-second intervals, regardless of the birds' behavior. The birds began to behave as if the feeding was a response to their behavior at the time.
One pigeon that happened to have been doing turns at feeding time began its turns again at subsequent feeding times. Another pigeon that had been bobbing its head would repeat its behavior at the next feeding time, expecting more food.
"A lot of what goes on in the markets is no more explainable than those pigeons," Professor Shiller argued, highlighting the role of behavior in financial markets.
In the article on his Web home page, Professor Shiller suggested that magical thinking might explain why the stock market has tended to fall in recent years on positive news about economic growth.
The news media, he wrote, have frequently attributed that seemingly perverse reaction to expectations that stronger economic growth would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would be bad news for stocks. In fact, Professor Shiller concluded, an entirely random series of dips in the stock market after positive economic news might have convinced the media and investors that there was a connection between the events when none existed.
"The whole belief could be the result of a chain of events that was set off by some initial chance movements of the stock market," Professor Shiller wrote. "Because people believe these theories, they may then behave so that the stock price does indeed behave as hypothesized."
 
Mental Accounting
How can two individuals make entirely different decisions when their circumstances are essentially the same? Chalk it up to something called mental accounting, which allows individuals to treat similar results or similar options differently, because of different starting points.
In "Against the Gods," Mr. Bernstein cites an experiment in which Professors Kahneman and Tversky asked the participants to imagine they were theatergoers headed to a Broadway show.
One group has $40 tickets. Upon arriving at the box office, however, they discover that they have lost their tickets. Distressed, most of them decide not to spend another $40 for a replacement ticket, and go home.
Another group arrives at the box office, intending to buy tickets. But they discover that $40 is missing from each of their wallets. Like the first theatergoers, they are each $40 poorer. But most of them still buy tickets and attend the show. Although both groups arrive at the theater short the same amount of money, they haves mentally accounted for it differently.
Mental accounting is a way for people to organize their experiences, Professor Kahneman says. But he adds that "it certainly can be used for self-deception." That means investors do not always respond to events in the expected rational way.
An experiment with coin tosses conducted by Professor Thaler shows how mental accounting can influence an investor's willingness to gamble.
In one case, each person in a group of students was given $30 and told he could walk away with the money. Or, he could take his chances on a coin toss, winning $9 more if the coin came up heads but losing $9 if it turned up tails. Seventy percent took the gamble, knowing that they would end up with at least $21.
Students in another group were offered a seemingly different gamble. They could flip a coin; heads would equal $39 and tails would equal $21. Or, they could just take $30 with no coin toss. Only 43 percent chose the gamble.
A little arithmetic shows that the two outcomes are identical, but the students made different choices. Why? Because, as behaviorists note, it is not just the information that determines behavior, but also how it is processed. That is mental accounting.
Professor Thaler says mental accounting may help explain why the 1987 market crash did not have the negative impact on the economy that many had forecast. Investors, he said, might not have seen it as a troubling actual loss of wealth, but instead viewed it less alarmingly, as the disappearance of a new-found gain. And so, no panic.
The economics establishment has come a long way in understanding behavioral about-faces and unexpected responses. Twenty years ago, when he was a student at Princeton, Professor Mankiw could not have taken an economics course in irrational behavior. None existed. Now it has become respectable for professors at Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago to pick holes in the traditional view that investors are rational and markets are efficient.
The National Bureau of Economic Research and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard will hold separate symposiums in April on behavior and its influence on financial markets; the first meeting is for academics, the second for money managers. Last fall, U.S. Trust, a money management firm for wealthy individuals, asked two of the behavioral thinkers, Professors Kahneman and Thaler, to brief its money managers.
And there are even grudging but respectful nods to behaviorists from the high priests of rational market behavior. In his 1996 edition of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," Burton Malkiel, a Princeton economics professor, noted the words of Yale's Professor Shiller, who has counseled that "one must look to behavioral considerations and to crowd psychology to explain the actual process of price determination in the stock market."
Professor Shiller's encounter some months back with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has given behaviorists yet another little lift. Professor Shiller and John Campbell, a professor of economics at Harvard, were invited to join three top Wall Street equity strategists for a meeting with Mr. Greenspan last December. Two days after that session, the Fed chairman, in a speech, posed his now-famous question of whether "irrational exuberance" had pushed the stock market too high.
Professor Shiller did not provide Mr. Greenspan with his explosive phrase; the chairman had already inserted it into earlier drafts of his speech. But that didn't mean they weren't on the same wavelength. "I am pretty sure that I used the word 'irrational,' " Mr. Shiller said, recalling the December meeting. "But not 'exuberance.' "
Later, in Congressional testimony in February, Mr. Greenspan pinpointed who might be irrational. "It is not markets that are irrational -- markets merely reflect the average, the values of people," he said. "It's people who become irrationally exuberant on occasion and take actions that induce what economists like to call bubbles, which eventually burst."
Despite his choice of language, Mr. Greenspan apparently remains a believer in the essential efficiency and rationality of markets. And why not? Mainstream economic theory has done a workmanlike job in describing how markets function.
And though the traditional economists cannot explain certain anomalies -- the curious detours from the norm that are so intriguing -- the behavioral crowd has yet to come up with an overarching theory to explain how markets function.
Behaviorists "have pointed out the defects in the existing model but have not come up with a better model," Professor Mankiw said.
Nor does the sniping of behaviorists mean that markets over all, and over the long run, are irrational. "To say that investors are affected by behavioral motivation does not necessarily mean that markets are not efficient," said Mr. Odean, once an undergraduate student of Professor Kahneman.
But that does not deny the application to individual investors, who, if they are honest with themselves, know that they do not always behave rationally.
Dr. Michael Apfel, 47, an oral surgeon from Phoenix, acknowledges that he could be viewed as a case study. He freely confesses that behavioral quirks have undermined his investment performance.
A look at his portfolio suggests that he is the quintessential conservative investor. He dutifully balanced his portfolio with stocks, bonds, mutual funds, savings bonds and real estate partnerships. And yet, he said, "I used to buy and sell quite regularly." The cost of trading alone had cut his gains by 25 percent.
He had trouble getting rid of losing stocks, too. "One doesn't want to admit defeat," he said.
Now he trades only with the idea of making changes in his long-term investment posture. And he jettisons losers as part of a tax strategy to offset capital gains.
"You have to be there all the time to do well," he said of active trading. "Or you have to be a long-term investor. Anywhere in between and you are a loser."
What he has learned is that investors are better off if they know how behavior can trip them up. But millions of other investors have yet to share Mr. Apfel's epiphany. Perhaps if they were fully rational, they would have by now.

THE GREENSPAN WATCH
The Fed Finally Does It
Rarely has anything been so feared, anticipated, talked about, second-guessed, analyzed -- without actually happening. For months, as the economy and the stock market kept whooping it up, all eyes have been on Alan Greenspan. Will he raise rates this time? When will he do it? Why didn't he do it? How did he sleep last night? What did that twitch mean? As the months dragged on, it started to seem that the Federal Reserve would never do it, so when it finally did nudge interest rates higher last week, it was an odd jolt. Apparently Mr. Greenspan wearied of hearing inflation's menacing footsteps around every corner and threw a punch before it even appeared. But the blow, soft as it was, will be felt all through the economy by lifting borrowing rates. And while most economists said the move was about right, some critics, arguing that inflation was extinct, said the move would hurt workers unnecessarily.
 
THE BULL MARKET
Could It Be Over?
So when stock prices tumbled on Thursday, a full day after the Fed acted, was it a delayed reaction? Don't be silly. Investors' reaction isn't always wise, but it's always instant. No, they're already speculating about the next Fed rate increase, which suddenly seemed more likely -- especially after various economic reports showed the kind of strength that could revive inflation. And the 30-year Treasury bond yield crept above 7 percent, a suddenly enticing alternative to stocks. Yes, the numbers looked scary -- the Dow off 216 at one point, before closing down 140. But remember that at these lofty levels, that's just a 2 percent drop. A decade ago, a 2 percent decline would have been about 40 points. Then again, those same lofty levels mean the Dow has an awfully long way to fall. So will the market crash tomorrow? The answer is a definite maybe.
 
GAS AND ELECTRIC
Cleaner Cars: A Compromise
General Motors has sold only a few dozen electric cars a month since introducing them in December. No surprise, really. The cars' short range is limiting enough, and who needs to add "Be sure to plug in the car, Honey" to lives already strewn with to-do lists? Both drawbacks, though, vanish with the "hybrid" car -- gasoline engine plus electric motor. The gas engine either propels the car or charges the battery. No limits, no plugs and a lot less pollution than a gas-only vehicle. And last week Toyota said it would be the first to offer hybrids to a mass market -- for now, though, just a Japanese mass market; it has no immediate plans to sell here. Not only is this a workable compromise on the pollution front, but the price is far less shocking -- less than $20,000, versus $34,000 for G.M.'s electric.
 
INVESTMENTS, POOR
The Perils of Gold Fever
Gold does strange things to people. Always has. Look at Charlie Chaplin in "The Gold Rush," or Humphrey Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre." History is littered with gold-plated craziness, and investors are by no means immune. When Bre-X Minerals said it had found one of the world's richest gold deposits, in the wilds of Indonesia, investors went wild, turning this little Canadian company, with not much going for it beyond those gold stars in its eyes, into a $1 billion-plus concern. Big-name mutual funds put serious money into the company. And yes, if you'd bought Bre-X stock in early 1995 and sold it last year, you'd have struck serious gold indeed, as the share price went from pennies to $20. Last week, though, just as the gold was scattered to the avenging wind at the end of "Treasure of Sierra Madre," the Bre-X dream got a blast of reality. The company acknowledged that the gold find was probably not nearly what it seemed, and the shares plunged more than 80 percent in a day.
 
ACQUISITIONS, DOOMED
A Costly Gulp of Snapple
William D. Smithburg, chairman and chief executive of Quaker Oats, has been denied a bonus the last two years. But before the pity wells up in your heart and you mail him that $17 in the cookie jar, consider his imaginative use of stockholders' money. In 1994, Snapple was all the rage, and Quaker was so desperate to acquire it that it paid a price that made jaws drop: $1.7 billion. But Snapple didn't become the next Coke -- Quaker must have expected that it would -- and last week Quaker essentially acknowledged its costly mistake, selling Snapple for a mere $300 million. In other words, nearly $2 million of its investment was wiped out every single day it owned Snapple. Gently, now: put the lid back on the cookie jar.
 
UPS AND DOWNS
A 'Good Time,' Fortune or No
In 1935, James Ryder, a day laborer, borrowed $100, bought a used Model A truck and soon afterward started a truck-leasing business. Then comes the old rags-to-riches tale: Ryder System was grossing $1.5 million a year by 1946, and when Mr. Ryder quit in 1978 -- in a battle over control of what had become a giant -- he had a $20 million fortune. There the tale loops back again, though, as Mr. Ryder sank his nest egg into the creation of a rival company, Jartran, which within a few years was in bankruptcy. But Mr. Ryder, who died last week at 83, had no regrets. "I had a good time," he said.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL
Today's Widgets: Prisoners
The debate in Fallsburg, N.Y., revolves around a very modern economic quandary. This struggling Catskills town badly needs new businesses, and the Corrections Corporation of America has bought 185 acres here and wants to build one of its private prisons. Town officials love the idea because a private prison would be taxable property; the prison guards' union hates it because private prisons often hire nonunion workers. Sound familiar? When a business is booming -- and the business of locking people up is certainly booming -- someone will come along and try to do it for less, turn out widgets more efficiently. What's unusual, to put it mildly, is that the widgets this time are human beings.
 
BOOK MADNESS
Have Circus, Will Publish
What a strange business book publishing is. Here, often, is how a best seller is made: The media, ever on the prowl for a "hot story," latch onto a book and create a circus of publicity; a shopper sees the book, remembers the media circus and buys it. Perhaps, along the way, someone reads the book -- perhaps even likes it -- but that's beside the point. It's irrelevant whether it's literature or, well, just words. Case in point: A buzz begins about a 98-year-old Kansas woman named Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who has written a memoir, and publishers -- possibly remembering the hit "Having Our Say" -- claw at each others' tweeds to try to buy it. When the dust settled recently, Warner Books had paid more than $1 million for Mrs. Foveaux's book. Yes, yes, maybe the book's good -- maybe it's not, as a Simon & Schuster executive put it, "so boring it was unbelievable." But that's not the point. Good books don't automatically become best sellers; circuses do.
 
TV VIOLENCE
Don't Touch That Dial! Please?
Television violence is not about to go away -- at least it hasn't so far, according to a study out last week, and it's still "sanitized and glamorized," with punishment rare. So for those who want to shield children, the question remains: How? Those new ratings don't look promising, the study says, because the old "forbidden-fruit syndrome" kicks in. If a show is rated TV-M (mature audiences only), a teen-ager will say, "Bring it on!" And anything with a Y (all children) will elicit a resounding "Yuk!" So it's really simple: just label the nastiest stuff Y, and the kids won't go near it.

HEADLINE: The Wealth That Isn't?

 BODY:
"Are You Worth More but Enjoying It Less?" (March 2), by Jonathan Fuerbringer, discussed the debate over the wealth effect, the theory that consumers spend more simply because the value of their financial assets has risen. The article drew varied responses from readers.

To the Editor: 
 The reason that "wealth effect" is not working is not so mysterious. Despite the explosion of American wealth, consumer spending is so low because business is cutting wages of employees, who spend 95 percent of their income in the consumer economy.
In the 1990's, the dominant corporate profit strategy has been to cut labor costs, which account for two-thirds of the cost of producing products and services. This dramatically increases corporate profits, which increases stock prices. This has been done through approaches like downsizing, building an army of low-paid contingent workers, offering lower wage increases, ending cost-of-living increases, cutting health and pension benefits and outsourcing.
In America's golden economic age, the quarter-century ending in 1973, the real wages of Americans -- including the middle class -- doubled. The secret of a successful American economy is a large, successful middle class -- because employees are also consumers.
In another age of so-called prosperity, the 1920's, there were big increases in corporate profits but not in manufacturing employees' wages. In 1929, many people ran out of purchasing power, sales collapsed, the stock market crashed, and the country fell into the Great Depression.
Are there any signs of this today? Absolutely. Many consumers are mired in debt because they earn less than they spend, and personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high.
The new explosion of wealth has had a negative effect on consumer purchasing power in the current economy.

HEADLINE: The Wealth That Isn't?

 BODY:
"Are You Worth More but Enjoying It Less?" (March 2), by Jonathan Fuerbringer, discussed the debate over the wealth effect, the theory that consumers spend more simply because the value of their financial assets has risen. The article drew varied responses from readers.

To the Editor: 
 As investors, we risk our already-taxed money in the stock market, stick with a stock for years through thick and thin (nervously checking its price in the newspaper) and often see the real value of our investment decline in terms of inflation. If we happen to have some profit, the I.R.S. has its hand out as if it were our partner in the investment -- even though it didn't share any of the anxiety along the way.
The I.R.S. also doesn't take into account the inflation portion of that profit.
It's a bit like the children's story about all the animals who are willing to help "eat" the cake but didn't help with any of the work to create it.
Uncle Sam is in for its share and it's too large. That's why many of us don't cash out and spend. Here in California, the state takes a substantial share, too.
We must lower capital gains taxes. If we do, there will be a tremendous unleashing of the wealth that is now only paper profits. It will create a boom.
Furthermore, I believe the capital gains tax should be indexed: the longer you hold an investment, the smaller the tax rate. This would take into account the fact that an investment made 10 or 20 years ago has seen tremendous erosion in terms of buying power.

 BODY:
"Are You Worth More but Enjoying It Less?" (March 2), by Jonathan Fuerbringer, discussed the debate over the wealth effect, the theory that consumers spend more simply because the value of their financial assets has risen. The article drew varied responses from readers.

To the Editor: 
 One factor not discussed in the article may have a big impact on whether Americans are feeling wealthier because of their recent stock-market gains: the devaluation of the currency, so to speak, of financial assets.
If you had $100,000 in stocks a few years ago, with a dividend yield of 4 percent, you had $4,000 in dividend income. If you have $200,000 in stocks today with a dividend yield of 2 percent, you have the same income. If yields continue at these levels, you ask yourself, does it matter that much that stock prices have risen? Just when I've gotten to the 30-yard line, have they moved the goal posts?
You certainly are entitled to ask yourself how much wealthier you really are today. You certainly are not twice as wealthy. So the problem may not lie with the wealth-effect coefficient, but on what the consumer sees as his true wealth.
Of course you can make your nominal gain a real one by selling the financial assets, paying whatever taxes apply, and converting to an asset in a nondevalued currency -- cars, real estate, vintage wines. But that is precisely what you don't want to do if you are trying to provide for your long-term and retirement needs.

HEADLINE: Criticisms on Criticisms Of Matrimonial Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The matrimonial practice of law has recently been criticized as inhospitable to litigants and undesirable as a career ("Goodbye, Divorce Court," Feb. 16 and Letters, March 9). I disagree on both points. I have just been named the Administrative Judge of the New York State Court System for Matrimonial Matters -- after being a divorcee, a matrimonial attorney and a judge handling matrimonial cases -- and I cannot name an area of the law that has received more attention by the heads of the judiciary or been the subject of greater reform. Neither could I have chosen an aspect of the law that is more personally rewarding. 
 During a recent matrimonial trial, I noticed a young woman in my courtroom who told the court officer she wanted to speak to "her judge." This grown woman was Karen P., who as a child was the center of a bitter custody battle. I had presided over the trial and, for many years thereafter, retained jurisdiction as Karen's parents disputed many parenting decisions and turned to the court to resolve the most intimate details of their lives.
Seeing Karen and hearing of her life -- she is a sophomore at Barnard College, planning on law school -- reminded me of why I decided to enter the matrimonial field as a lawyer and continued as a judge and administrator.
The handling of matrimonial cases has changed significantly over the last few years. When I was a practicing attorney, my cases were interspersed with personal-injury claims and contract disputes. Judges often had little specialized knowledge or interest in matrimonial matters. There were no rules in place to mandate early intervention of the court, nor was there a mechanism to hold both the courts and bar accountable for their actions or inertia.
Since 1993, we have changed the way matrimonial cases are handled -- to insure that they are met with sensitivity and efficiency, and with minimal economic and emotional disruption to families and children.
The court system's commitment to reform reached the very structure of the courts, with the addition last year of a new administrative position, Administrative Judge for Matrimonial Matters. This position, which I am fortunate to hold, allows us to coordinate and focus all of our efforts on managing these important cases in every court and through every stage of the case process. We are identifying the most innovative ideas in the matrimonial area, streamlining the litigation process as never before.
Are there problems? Of course there are. The message, however, is that we are addressing them. Despite difficult legal and emotional isses, I believe the future of matrimonial law is bright. If Karen P. does go to law school and should seek my advice on her career choice, I would urge her to consider matrimonial law.

Fighting the Drug War With Boomerangs

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
EVER since the Nixon Administration, Washington has been pressing Mexico to crack down on its marijuana and poppy fields. The results have been mixed, and now, over the last decade or so, something more pernicious has occurred.
Policies meant to push narcotics trafficking out of the Caribbean and destroy Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels have produced the unwelcome side effect of funnelling drugs through Mexico on their way to the rich American market. 
 As a result, the emerging Mexican cartels have grown richer, leaving a mounting toll of assassinations and corruption all the way from the steamy jungles of Tabasco to the ribald streets of Tijuana. "We push the drugs around," said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international relations at the University of Miami, "and new networks and new routes are established. As a result, we have overwhelmed Mexico's weak political and law enforcement institutions."
 
The Generals' Turn
 Just in the last couple of months, the corrosive effect that drugs inevitably have on any society appears to have reached the upper echelons of the Mexican Army. Two Mexican generals have already been arrested -- one of them the country's former drug czar, who had been privy to many of the most intimate details of Washington's anti-narcotics strategies.
These aren't just any high officials, either; corruption of the army is a development that threatens this country's gradual move toward democracy. As President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada of Bolivia once put it: "When you have a corrupt chief of police, you fire him. When you have a corrupt chief of the army, he fires you."
Of course, there is no telling how strong the international cartels would be if it weren't for the efforts of United States law enforcement. Drug supplies might be even more plentiful and purer in the cities of North America, and prices even lower. Victories over traffickers in the Caribbean and Colombia have brought periodic spikes in cocaine prices in the United States over the last couple of decades that just might have persuaded some potential first-time users to buy a six-pack of beer instead.
Drugs, after all, are international commodities that follow the laws of economics. And however the sources of supply are squeezed or displaced, demand for one drug or another has been fairly steady in the United States in recent years, making supply the most important determinant of price.
The Mexican Government would like Washington to reverse that equation by doing something to change the continuing American taste for illegal highs.
The Clinton Administration, like its predecessors, would love to oblige but finds it difficult, to say the least. Its next effort, scheduled to be launched soon, is an aggressive media campaign to discourage teen-age drug use.
 
Unintended Results

In the meantime, the Mexican cartels are rapidly expanding internationally, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. They are linking up with coca growers in Bolivia and Peru and violently seizing local drug markets in Los Angeles and across the southwestern United States.
The leaders of the competing Cali cartel in Colombia have suffered billions of dollars in losses already, but there is little they can do since they have been imprisoned in Colombia over the last two years as a result of pressure from Washington.
"I have seen firsthand how so many of our programs that we hoped would help can have unintended, adverse consequences," said Mathea Falco, who was Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters in the Carter Administration.
Ms. Falco recalled that American pressure on South American governments to eradicate drug plants began at the end of the Carter years, and that as that policy blossomed through the 1980's, "it alienated and intensified tensions between the Peruvian Government and the peasants, helping the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla movement grow, and that's what is happening in Colombia now."
A metaphor, which has become a cliche in narcotics-control circles, describes the problem. It's called the "balloon effect:" Squeeze a balloon in one spot and it billows out in another.
When the Nixon Administration closed down Turkey's "French Connection," heroin production spread to Burma, Pakistan and ultimately Afghanistan. When the Bush Administration urged Bolivia to eradicate coca plants on the eastern slopes of its Andean range, cultivation spread into Bolivia's Amazon Basin and into Brazil. When the Clinton Administration urged the Peruvian Air Force to intercept planes carrying raw coca to Colombia, traffickers began shipping their goods on the Amazon River and growing more coca in Colombia.
"Stop the traffickers on the ground, and they take to the air," sighed Gen. Enrique Salgado Cordero, chief of the Mexico City police. "Control the air, and they go by sea. It's a battle with no end."
Still, President Ronald Reagan had little choice but try to stem the flood of drugs that was pouring into Miami from the Caribbean in the early 1980's. Miami was plummeting into an abyss: its streets had become a battleground of dealers fighting for turf, its police force was corrupted by bribes, and the integrity of its banks was threatened by a deluge of laundered money.
The Reagan Administration unleashed the Coast Guard, the Navy, the Customs Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration to block the fleets of boats launched from Colombia that made their way to Miami through Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas. At the same time, pressure was exerted on Colombia to crack down on the Medellin cartel.
 
Shifting Gears
 The operation was so successful that panicked Colombian drug lords first made war on their Government and then took refuge in Panama in 1984. With the help of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, they rerouted their shipments up through Central America and Mexico. Once the Medellin mafia was crushed, the Cali cartel took up the slack with the help of emerging Mexican organized crime groups.
Miami was saved, but the police forces and militaries of Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras were all corrupted to varying degrees. Drug corruption led to an American invasion in Panama, and now it appears to promise years of tensions between Washington and Mexico City.
And still, for all the international turmoil, cocaine and heroin prices in the United States keep dropping, and the potency of the drugs keeps rising.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Caricature in the Age of Political Correctness

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
"Caricature is rough truth."
 
George Meredith 
 THERE is a sense of achievement, plain as a Daumier leer, that comes upon a political cartoonist when his work stirs outraged condemnation. For some cartoonists, "going too far" is exactly where their pens must aim, and the bite of public complaint is encouraging, even necessary evidence of a bull's-eye.
"There's a tremendous amount of people waiting around to get annoyed at something," said Roman Genn, the cartoonist who lampooned President and Mrs. Clinton as toothy and narrow-eyed Asians and Vice President Al Gore as an alms-taker on a National Review cover this month, stirring complaints of racism from Asian-American organizations.
 
Just Doing Our Jobs

 "I think that's fine," said Mr. Genn. "Their job is to get ticked off at cartoons and my job is to draw them. We're all doing our jobs."
The cover, dubbed "The Manchurian Candidates," depicts a coolie-hatted President obsequiously proffering a tray of coffee. The First Lady grins widely at his side as a doctrinaire Maoist. Mr. Gore stares stolidly as dollars whirl into his beggar's cup.
The cartoon is a send-up of the three Administration principals involved in the Clinton re-election campaign's zealous, now fabled scramble for big-money donations among such groups as Buddhist temple goers and Asian-American business solicitors. In the most sensational allegation, the Clinton campaign was said to be the possible target of Chinese government agents intent on buying high-ante influence in American politics.
"Extremely offensive and racist," Daphne Kwok, executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans, said of the cover. She complained that Asian-Americans sense that their patriotism is being besmirched in simplistic renderings of the scandal.
Not everyone, of course, agrees. "Roman did a great job," said Pat Oliphant, a master caricaturist whose wit is razor-sharp from four decades of skewering politicians. "We need it, God knows," he said of the drawing. "It's a wonderful fact that there is a publication that will still run these politically incorrect things."
Not only did John O'Sullivan, editor of National Review, publish the cartoon in color, he defended it mightily amid the controversy that followed. He insisted the caricature was only fair in exaggerating such features as the First Lady's own toothy smile and not, as critics saw, the buck-toothed visage of an Oriental stereotype. Above all, he denounced the complaints as orchestrated by "the ethnic grievance industry," and, far from offering the apology requested by Ms. Kwok, demanded one from her.
"Like Charles Philipon!" exulted Mr. Genn, referring to the 19th century journalist who defended Daumier's graphic ridicule of the French authorities when they locked up the great caricaturist for his opinions.
Mr. Oliphant feels that the "confrontational art" of political cartooning needs a boost from provocative work like Mr. Genn's if it is to survive the homogenizing pressures of American culture. "We are drowning in political correctness and somebody's got to kill it," he said. "It's the ruination of my business," he added, citing individual newspapers that withhold his more controversial work or quickly apologize for it when the first complaint is lodged.
"Newspapers are really the only vehicle there is for political cartooning and they won't speak up and provide a forum for the more outspoken cartoonists," he said, complaining not so much for himself, he said, as for the tartly gifted newcomers who are rebuffed by publishers wary of giving offense.
But his sense that political correctness has triumphed is debatable. After all, Mr. Genn's cartoon is not the only rough-edged lampoon of an ethnic group. Last week's New Republic cover, "Jude the Odd," uses an Islamic prayer-rug as the setting for an American target, Jude Wanniski, the Republican economic theorist. And in a recent Wizard-of-Oz rendering by Mr. Oliphant of Alan Greenspan, chief of the Federal Reserve, some Jewish readers perceived an echo of anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda.
 
'It's About Racism'
 A friend and colleague of Mr. Oliphant's, Dan Wasserman, cartoonist of The Boston Globe, grants that editors can be timid, but insists that clumsy stereotyping is no less a problem. "Only a minority of cartoonists agree with me, but I don't think this is about sensitivity or political correctness," Mr. Wasserman said. "I think it's about racism. Cartoonists ought to get at the essential, not the accidental, and what's essential here is a fund-raising scandal in the nation's capital. The fact that some of the figures happen to be Asian -- that's number 20 on the list of important things."
Besides, he said, the main problem is not foreigners' contributions: "It's that U.S. corporations are buying the Government." And Mr. Wasserman, like many caricaturists, is delighting in the rich possibilities of the donation scandal. "It's something of a smokescreen here to call up the Yellow Peril and not get to the heart of the matter. Why not pick on these hot-shot Ivy League lawyers who can't read the fund-raising laws?"
All three cartoonists agree that dollar-hungry politicians have provided a fresh mother lode of material. "Hypocrisy is good for cartoonists," said Mr. Wasserman. "And we're up to our hips at least in hypocrisy."
Mr. Oliphant, whose laughter has a merry edge of mayhem to it, thinks there is no way to be offensive in the depiction of Mr. Clinton.
"He writes his own stuff like Nixon did," the artist said gratefully. "Wonderful! The man's an embarrassment of riches."
Mr. Oliphant's inclination is to pick on everyone and never apologize for what he does. "You have to get mad in this business, work yourself up to a boil once a day," he said, as if this precious work dynamic can only be dulled by trying to keep in mind the multiple sensitivities of his variegated audience.
As a post-Soviet immigrant, Mr. Genn, who was once jailed overnight for caricaturing a Kremlin politician, suspects the current complaints come mainly from second-generation Americans who are concerned about having a place in the Establishment.
"Clinton's the one who should be offended," the cartoonist said with a certain air of disappointment, as if maybe he had not gone quite far enough in rendering his Manchurian candidates.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Yankee, Go Home. Send Cash.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: MAJURO, Marshall Islands

 BODY:
THE President is in his customary place in the hotel bar, apparently inebriated and enjoying yet another pre-dinner drink, when he is asked about the United States. He frowns.
"You know, I was arrested by the United States," the President, Imata Kabua, slurs proudly, and he starts to tell the story of how he was detained in 1982 for protesting the American military presence at a base here. His drinking buddy, a local senator who is also more than a little unsteady, is repeating over and over: "I don't like America, I don't like America." 
 Thus this paradox of foreign aid: There is almost no place in the world where America, as America sees it, has been so generous as the Marshall Islands, a collection of coral atolls between Japan and Hawaii. Yet the local economy remains a shambles and the United States is broadly resented. Something went badly wrong, for usually it is possible to be resented without paying $1 billion for the privilege.
An arrestingly beautiful collection of islets with a relaxed, friendly feeling and about 56,000 people, the Marshall Islands are about as American as a non-American place can be. The currency is American dollars, and although there is a local language, the newspaper is mostly published in English. The loose atmosphere is evident in the way President Kabua simply dines in the hotel with his buddies each evening, chatting with anyone who drops by. (To be sure, although Mr. Kabua was as cordial as he was tipsy, not everybody was pleased. Although the meeting had been approved ahead of time with Mr. Kabua's office and with the Foreign Minister, the Health Minister later called to threaten bodily harm and demand that any tape of the interview be destroyed.)
 
No Thanks
 Under a treaty that is soon coming up for review, Washington gives the Marshall Islands millions in aid and even offers free access by all citizens to move to America for work or study. Yet, asked about the treaty, President Kabua scowled. "I don't like it," he said. "It shouldn't be renewed. It should be renegotiated, that's right. Renegotiated, not renewed."
From the American point of view, the treaty is enormously generous and any renewal -- if it happens at all -- will be on much less favorable terms. From the perspective of the Marshalls, the United States has been bullying this little country for decades, and it finally will be forced to treat the Marshalls with some respect.
The Marshalls, like two nearby island countries, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia, were Japanese possessions that effectively became an American colony after World War II. They became independent in the 1980's, but their economies now depend on the current treaty with Washington, known in each case as a "compact of free association." Over the last decade or so, about $2.4 billion has been appropriated for these three countries, or a total of about $13,000 per inhabitant.
In both the Marshalls and the Federated States of Micronesia, the compact expires in 2001. The problem for the islands is that they have lost their strategic advantage. When the compacts were negotiated, Washington was afraid the Soviet Union would sign up one of the island countries as a client state, a prospect that now seems ridiculous.
"The compacts were negotiated during the cold war," Aurelia E. Brazeal, a deputy assistant secretary of state for the region, pointedly told a Congressional subcommittee in the fall.
The United States has a military base in Kwajalein, one of the Marshall Islands, that it uses to monitor space operations and missile tests. But there may be pressure to close the base, and in any case the United States can keep it until 2016 even if the compact as a whole is not renewed.
To gain a bit of leverage, the Marshall Islands is threatening to allow China to set up a naval base on its territory. "China is getting bigger and bigger in this region, and I'm sure that the United States would not like to see them here," warned Phillip Muller, the Foreign Minister. In Washington, the threat provokes less alarm than mirth.
Almost everybody, American and Marshallese, complains that the Micronesian countries have become far too dependent on American aid. Yet if the United States did not renew the compact and cut off aid, the result would be a fiscal disaster.
"We might not have a Government to run," said Alvin Jacklick, a senator. By far the largest part of Government revenue comes from American payments.
The islanders make the point that not all the money is aid. Much of it is a negotiated payment for military cooperation or for past offenses, like spraying radiation on local citizens during nuclear tests.
The broader challenge for all the Pacific island countries is to figure out how they can compete economically in the modern world. These countries have gorgeous atolls and an alluring lifestyle, but few ways to generate hard currency other than sales of postage stamps to collectors and occasional tourism.
Still, experts do point to ways that the island countries can bolster their economies. Joan M. Plaisted, the American Ambassador, noted some opportunities to develop eco-tourism, sport fishing and diving in the Marshalls. A scuba diver herself, she raves about the underwater environment.
"You're almost guaranteed to see sharks," she said enthusiastically, quickly adding: "And most of them are friendly."

The Suicides Next Door

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
As the network news shows were first airing the videotapes from Rancho Santa Fe on Thursday evening, I was sitting in a Broadway theater watching the actor Rip Torn declare how wonderful America is. Mr. Torn plays the role of Will Kidder, a can-do 63-year-old businessman in the can-do boom town of Houston, 1950, in Horton Foote's Pulitzer Prize-winning play "The Young Man From Atlanta." Will tells anyone who will listen that he lives in the best house in the best city in the best country in the world.
But Will's faith is tested. He has lost his job. His only child, a 37-year-old son, has drowned in an apparent but inexplicable suicide. And his wife is so deep in grief that she has put down her Bible to seek spiritual solace from her child's former roommate, a mysterious, ostensibly religious young man from Atlanta whom Will believes to be a con artist. 
 Mr. Foote has been writing plays set in the very heart of America for more than half a century, and he understands this country so well that "The Young Man From Atlanta" almost seems like a companion piece to the real-life drama that was unfolding on TV simultaneously with Thursday's triumphant opening night. The segue from his final curtain to "Nightline" was seamless. Like the Kidders, many Americans pride themselves on living in the best houses in the best towns in the best and most religious country in the world. And yet in the midst of all this plenty and spirituality, people drown without coherent explanation, leaving more questions than answers behind.
The mass suicide outside San Diego is in some particulars another casebook cult scenario to be measured against Jonestown or Waco. Yet it seems even more disturbing because it lacks those apocalypses' dusty scruffiness and violent mad-dog flameouts. Here was a mass suicide suitable for Better Homes and Gardens.
The Heaven's Gate folk killed themselves in the sort of palatial suburban villa, complete with tennis court and swimming pool, that has defined the American dream from Will Kidder's postwar day to our own. They were not unemployable deadbeats but successful practitioners of the most exalted and lucrative new American profession -- computer geek. They lived inconspicuously in not one but two of our most desirable neighborhoods: Rancho Santa Fe and cyberspace, both virgin venues for wholesale death. They died not with their boots on but in immaculately new Nike running shoes our kids would pray for. They cleaned up after one another, leaving the death scene so spic and span it could be used in a TV commercial testifying to the prowess of household cleansers.
In keeping with this picture of fastidious suburban affluence, the cult's leader, Marshall Applewhite, was not a volcanic Koresh or Manson or Jones but a smooth-talking, professorial flim-flam man like Oz's Professor Marvel -- albeit a Marvel for a media-savvy age. Mr. Applewhite trained, appropriately enough, in the performing arts. He was in "Oklahoma!" and "South Pacific" at college and later had a career as both a church choir director and a singer with the Houston Grand Opera. He publicized his cult through books, interviews with national magazines, a USA Today ad and a public-access cable TV show before joining much of America on line. While his considerable video and cyber trails of pronouncements may now, with hindsight, strike us as utterly mad, they failed to attract much attention, let alone suspicion, right up until he staged his doomsday.
After the corpses were found, the San Diego County Sheriff, Bill Kolender, said that there may never be an answer to "the question that's on everybody's mind: Why did they do this?" In "The Young Man From Atlanta," the Kidders can't readily answer that question about their smart and seemingly content son's suicide either, any more than they can know whether the young man offering them prayers is an apostle or a bush-league Applewhite. But in the best country in the world it is hard to accept any troubling questions as unanswerable, especially when tragedy unfolds in a setting that fits our contented self-image of unstoppable economic progress and sunlit domestic bliss. We want to dismiss nightmares like this as the kind of distant, alien catastrophe that cannot happen here -- but we're not in Jonestown anymore.

Harry Lee's Slur

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The dictator of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew long known to his American business admirers as Harry Lee -- has just fallen on his face in a way that heartens freedom-lovers everywhere.
For decades, Lee has used a corrupt judiciary to repress political opposition to his rule. His lap-dog judges impose crippling libel judgments to silence press criticism of their master. 
 This year, as usual, the dictator went to the judges with a demand that a Singapore dissident who dared to campaign vigorously be punished for "defamation." The offender raced across the causeway to Malaysia, citing not just the certainty of financial ruin but death threats.
Then Lee blundered. In an affidavit to his lickspittle judges, he hooted at the opposition politician's fear: "If there is anywhere where people can do him harm," it was the neighboring Malaysian city of Johor, a place Lee called "notorious for shooting, muggings, and car-jackings."
Dictatorial etiquette in Asia permits you to jeer with impunity at "Western values" of freedom and human dignity, but you must never, never suggest imperfection in the country next door.
Malaysia erupted at the insult. "Deeply hurt" was the mildest reaction; one firebrand demanded Singapore's water supply be cut off. Protesters in the (somewhat unsafe) streets denounced Lee, a cunning 73, as "senile" and the Malay Government allowed an even more subversive sentiment to be displayed: "Respect human rights in Singapore."
Lee and his son, the strongman-in-waiting, were forced to apologize for the slur. Their spokesman blamed the mean-spirited press for reporting the prevalence of muggings across the Straits, a condition all believing Singaporeans now realize does not exist.
But it was not diplomatic politesse that dictated the dictator's order to the court to expunge his impolitic testimony. Business is no longer booming; Singapore's electronic exports plummeted last year; employers are finding cheaper land and labor in Malaysia and Indonesia.
This is hardly the moment for Lee to offend his closest neighbor and -- along with the U.S. -- a major trading partner. The Malays have taken sly advantage of the dictator's gaffe by pressing for replacement of the old causeway linking the island with the peninsula by a bridge; that would permit ships to bypass the port of Singapore to use Malaysia's Port Klang. What do dictators do when times get tough, or when competition squeezes? They become more repressive, lest economic discontents spawn political challenge. And to keep power in the family, they bait foreign purveyors of individual rights.
That's why the "Singapore model" is so instructive. Its economic flexibility and political rigidity -- drawing strength from Western investment while reviling our democratic values -- shows us what can happen, on a huge scale, in China.
The same American business executives who like doing business in ultra-orderly Singapore are eager to build up China as an authoritarian superpower. Example: Maurice Greenberg, the insurance tycoon who led the Nixon Center's recent obeisance to Lee Kuan Yew is on the board of advisers to China's Citic; that's the military-industrial empire whose shining light and leading arms dealer, Wang Jun, was ushered by an Asian agent of influence into the White House to be greeted by the U.S. President.
Harry Lee, the man these misguided Americans think of as their friend, must be transfixed by this summer's takeover of Hong Kong by China. He realizes that China will permit no serious competition from Singapore as Southeast Asia's main connection to the West. As a realist, Lee is positioning his island to be a pilot fish to China's whale.
That's why his house organ, The Straits Times, joins Al Gore in minimizing Beijing's sinister intervention in U.S. elections. "The powerful expect to be courted," opined Lee's mouthpiece (which, in a fit of perversity, may run this column, festooned with apoplectic rebuttals). "The Clinton Administration will not find it easy to get the Republican and media monkeys off its back."
Harry Lee, his U.S. business friends, China's despots and nepots, and Nixon-Clinton Sinophiles make strange bedfellows. Fortunately for freedom, an equally motley opposition is beginning to take shape.

HEADLINE: Over Here, Paper Chase for Nazi Gold

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
For the last year singly, in pairs and in larger groups -- people have been searching in an unlikely place for traces of gold and other treasures looted by the Nazis: the National Archives of the United States.
In that period, perhaps 100 private and Government researchers have picked up a paper trail that has offered many clues involving the Swiss role in World War II. They have skimmed or studied uncounted millions of documents that have lain untouched in the half-century since the war ended. 
 Some of the documents had not been seen because, until recently, they were classified as secret. In other cases people simply had not known they were there or could not find them in a paper mountain so huge that it was reckoned not in pages but in cubic feet.
Some of the newly released material provides stark evidence of what has long been known, like a report obtained from an informer at the Mauthausen concentration camp on May 9, 1945, a day after the formal German surrender was announced.
The report, filed by the Office of Strategic Services, then the principal American intelligence agency, cites a meticulous secret record that about 6.8 pounds of gold had been removed from the teeth of 528 bodies. Most of the victims were Jews who had been killed by the Nazis the previous March, just weeks before the war's end.
Some of that gold, the report indicated, had been intended for re-use as tooth fillings for "members of the Waffen SS and their families." But much of it is known to have been melted down and deposited in Swiss banks.
That dental gold is a symbolic pebble in a mountain of life savings, artworks and other assets that a dwindling number of concentration camp survivors and their descendants are trying to obtain an accounting of from Switzerland's Government and secretive banks.
Some of it was stolen by Nazis and deposited in Switzerland for their personal use or for the Nazi war machine. Some was deposited by Jews and others before they were sent off to concentration camps, in the vain hope that it would be safe in a country whose wartime role is now being questioned.
Last October, President Clinton appointed Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, to head an 11-agency review of the material in the archives. Preliminary findings are expected soon.
"I think there will be historically important revelations," Mr. Eizenstat said in an interview.
"Hundreds of documents will be declassified for the first time," he said, adding that although other documents to be cited in the review had been declassified some time ago, "nobody looked at them before to put a coherent picture together."
"In addition to the narrative," he said of the forthcoming report, "we will release 200 or more of the most revealing documents."
Many revealing documents have already been discovered by Miriam A. Kleiman, a researcher who has been examining the papers for a year, previously for the World Jewish Congress and now to support a lawsuit that seeks to force Swiss banks to disclose the assets they received.
"It is just fascinating to see the pieces fit together and see the myth of Swiss neutrality," Ms. Kleiman said. "The papers show that the Swiss were helping the Axis during the war."
To support that assertion, she said she had found documents showing that "the Swiss were the ones who suggested putting the 'J' on the passports of German Jews so that they could be kept out of Switzerland."
In response to Ms. Kleiman and others who question whether Switzerland was truly neutral during World War II, Cristoph H. Bubb, the legal counselor at the Swiss Embassy, said: "What is their notion of neutrality? Neutrality is a military concept of nonparticipation. Neutrality does not involve equal distance in economic and moral matters."
Mr. Bubb said that although "the vast majority of the Swiss people were clearly opposed to the ideas of the Nazis," the reality of their geographical position had to be faced.
"To be able to survive," he said, "the economic ties were closer to the Axis countries than to the Allies because Switzerland was surrounded by the Nazi countries. That is the reality."
One of the documents uncovered by Ms. Kleiman addresses that point: a report by Robert P. Patterson, Under Secretary of War, from Nov. 30, 1944.
"Down to the fall of 1944," Mr. Patterson wrote, "the Swiss produced and exported to Germany large quantities of ammunition, aircraft parts, radio equipment and other military supplies, as well as machine tools, precision instruments, locomotives and industrial equipment. They also furnished electric power to Germany, and their railroads carried a heavy traffic for the Germans between Germany and Italy. These activities were of substantial assistance to the Germans in waging war."
Greg Bradsher, an assistant branch chief at the National Archives, said that Ms. Kleiman was in the vanguard of an army of researchers now going through the records.
He said researchers had also been sent by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Banking Committee and was one of the first public officials to call for the Federal study.
In addition, there are some from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Swiss Historical Commission, the Swiss Government, the World Jewish Congress, the Bank for International Settlements in Bern, a law firm representing Swiss banks and another from the Swiss Bankers Association, and several American agencies, including the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of the Army.
The amount of material they are going through is enormous, about 5,000 cubic feet of papers, which Mr. Bradsher calculated would total about 10 million pages.
The material is stored in a modern, airy building the National Archives recently moved into on the edge of the University of Maryland campus in College Park. Researchers take boxes from shelves and place them on a table in an interior room to examine them.
Some boxes are requested so often that Mr. Bradsher keeps them in a separate area handy to the researchers.
"We call this 'The Best of Nazi Gold,' " the archivist said. "On some days, we have three sets of researchers asking for the same documents."
On a nearby table are many boxes of documents recently declassified by the Treasury Department after 50 years. One box holds folders with these titles written on their tabs: "Dutch Gold Shipped Into Germany," "Looted Gold -- Bank of France" and "Letters From Anti-Nazi Germans."
"Maybe 100 people have been researching here, some every day," Mr. Bradsher said.
Gregg Rickman, the legislative director for Senator D'Amato, who has led that office's inquiry, said the documents showed "the amounts of gold the Nazis had looted and sent to Switzerland, and the Swiss were laundering it on their behalf."
In response to accusations that Switzerland had been reluctant to part with deposits left by the Nazis' victims, Mr. Bubb said that a new system had recently been put into place to speed the settlement of claims. The Swiss banks have appointed an ombudsman to accept inquiries and distribute applications to all of the banks.
At the same time, he said, a commission led by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve in the United States, "is auditing all Swiss banks' archives" to search for other dormant accounts.
Of Nazi plunder that might have been taken to Switzerland, Mr. Bubb said the Swiss Government had appointed a commission to look into "all questions relating to the Swiss role as a financial place during World War II."
"The huge picture to be drawn involves a lot of work that cannot be done in a few months," he said.
As for why more than 50 years had passed without a resolution, Ms. Kleiman said: "This was an international effort. The British needed loans and went to the Swiss banks for them. American attention turned to the cold war. The Allies lost interest. The Swiss figured that if they blocked it long enough, the United States would give up."

HEADLINE: A Bargain in the Harbor

 BODY:
Open space with waterfront access is a rare thing in New York City, so when someone offers an accessible 173-acre island for less than the price of a cheeseburger, responsible officials should jump at it. President Clinton has made such an offer. He proposes to transfer control of Governors Island in New York Harbor to the city and state for exactly one dollar. Since Mr. Clinton's budget office values the property at $500 million, this is on its face an irresistible deal.
It is not, though, quite as cost-free as it seems. Even if New York acquires the island for $1, it will inherit $30 million in annual operational and maintenance costs that the Coast Guard, the island's present tenant, is eager to shed. New York will also lose millions more in annual revenues that the Coast Guard brings to the region. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton has handed the city a splendid chance to create new public spaces and to make creative use of its underappreciated marine environment. What is needed now is for state and city officials to produce a plausible plan. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, to whom Mr. Clinton first made the offer early last year, fears that unless such a plan is set forth this year, the President will lose interest and Congress, which must approve any deal, will put the island on the market.
There are several good reasons why it would not make economic sense for Congress to sell. For one thing, it may never find a buyer at $500 million or even half that, since developers are notoriously leery of island properties. Also, while searching for a buyer, the Government would be responsible for a high-maintenance lemon with heavy operating costs. Rather than watching this scenario unfold, Senator Moynihan wants to see the city move quickly on a plan of its own.
Governors Island was once the home of Britain's colonial governors, hence its name. In American hands, it has served as a fort, a race track, a game preserve and an Army base for 100 years until the Coast Guard took it over in 1966. About half the island, which includes Revolutionary War fortifications and elegant 19th-century homes, is protected from alteration as a city landmark district. The other half contains barracks and large open spaces. The island commands sweeping views of the harbor, Manhattan and Brooklyn.
There is no shortage of ideas about what to do with this acreage. Some would turn the half of the island that is not already landmarked into playing fields and parks. Others would build housing for the elderly. A report from the Regional Plan Association released Thursday speaks vaguely of "something like Central Park with a large water feature, a public space, a harbor commons."
Whatever the outcome, the planning should be guided by two principles. First, in a manner consistent with its esthetic and recreational value, the island should be self-sustaining, so that it does not become a drain on municipal resources. Large-scale private development should be ruled out, but the city needs to find one or more institutions -- a college, for example -- to lease the island's historic buildings, thus providing for their upkeep.
The second principle is public access. That part of the island not devoted to institutional activity should be made accessible to all New Yorkers. There could be recreational facilities, playing fields, perhaps a marina. Whatever the mix, Governors Island must be seen as an opportunity to enrich the city's quality of life.
Neither objective can be met without convenient transportation, but even this need not be a money-losing proposition. Some planners see no reason why the existing hodgepodge of subsidized ferries cannot be replaced with a profitable operation that makes regular calls at Governors Island, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.
Speed is important, and not just to head off some foolish action by Congress. The Coast Guard, which has been a loving custodian of Governors Island, will vacate the premises this summer. Because unoccupied buildings tend to deteriorate in a hurry, a drawn-out planning process will make the island less attractive to any potential occupant. Delay could also cheat New York's citizens of what could be a grand public resource. It would be good to have a coherent scheme to show the President before the Coast Guard decamps.

HEADLINE: Clinton's College-Aid Plan Faces Doubt From Experts

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 29

 BODY:
Audrey Dismuke of Albany, Ga., says a state Hope Scholarship saved her life.
"I would not have been able to go to school without it," said Mrs. Dismuke, a 31-year-old mother of three, who has used the Georgia scholarship program to study to become an X-ray technician at Albany Technical Institute. "It saved my life, and it saved a lot of other lives." 
 The Georgia program that Mrs. Dismuke extolled is the inspiration for President Clinton's wide-ranging package of college aid, which promises to expand access to education and offer the hope of economic advancement. But interviews with experts on student aid, and with students like Mrs. Dismuke who have benefited from the Georgia plan, raise serious questions of whether Mr. Clinton's plan would help those who need it the most or would primarily lighten the burden somewhat for those already likely to attend college.
Despite some encouraging findings from Georgia and support from many higher education groups disinclined to criticize a multibillion-dollar increase in aid to education, many experts on the left and right are increasingly skeptical of the President's proposals, particularly those that would give $38 billion in tax relief to families over the next five years. Some also say the President's plan would be difficult to monitor and would be a boon mostly to the college and universities that need it least.
The Administration contends that its plan is balanced and will help both the poor and the middle class. In addition to the tax it would include the largest increase in Pell Grants to low- and moderate-income families in two decades.
"People in today's world who are working hard and making a living, know that when it comes to educating several of their children, they are educationally poor," said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. "They don't need some expert to tell them that, and they appreciate the fact that the Government is concerned about helping them."
But David W. Breneman, an economist and dean of the education school at the University of Virginia, said of the proposal, "It's good politics but bad economics." He added: "On the economic side, five of us testified before Ways and Means recently and all of us had the same assessment -- you don't want to spend money on programs that won't change people's behavior. It's an inefficient way to spend public money."
He said most of the aid would go directly to colleges that would adjust financial aid to reflect the Government investment.
The three main items in Mr. Clinton's proposal are $1,500 yearly tax credits called Hope Scholarships that could be used for two years of college; a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for college expenses, and a $300 increase, to $3,000 from $2,700, for Pell Grants. Students need no particular grade to get the Hope Scholarship but must maintain a B average to keep it for a second year.
Under Georgia's plan, high school students who have a B average gain free tuition at state colleges and universities as long as they keep a B average there. Students can use Hope Scholarships to attend professional programs at technical schools regardless of their high school record.
The money comes from a state lottery that has provided $333 million so far to send 238,500 students to college tuition-free since the program began in 1993.
In Georgia, enrollment has increased about 50 percent at the kind of technical schools that could be fully financed by the $1,500 tax relief Mr. Clinton's Hope Scholarships provide. Typically, they enroll those on the lower end of the economic scale most in need of financial assistance.
"It hits me in the face every day of my life that a very significant number of people are able to go to technical institutions and get training because financing is no longer a burden to them," said Ken Breeden, who supervises that part of the Georgia plan.
Glenn Newsome, executive director of the Georgia Student Finance Commission, which administers the Hope Scholarships, said that Hope has changed the culture of Georgia by putting out a firm message that higher education is open to everyone, and that Mr. Clinton is trying to spread that message nationally.
And those who have benefited from Georgia's program are often supportive of any Federal program, even if on a smaller scale, that would help parents pay for college.
"Clinton's plan is a lot better than nothing," said Amanda White of suburban Atlanta, who has two children attending college at state schools in Georgia under the Hope program. "My husband works every minute he can at two jobs, and there are a lot of people like us who need all the help they can get."
But in other ways, the Georgia experience does little to bolster the claims of Mr. Clinton's program.
Mrs. Dismuke of Albany is ecstatic about the Georgia program, which pays for tuition and $100 in books up front. But she was far less enthusiastic about Mr. Clinton's program of a tax credit for families who had already paid for college.
"There's no way I could have come up with $1,500 to begin with, and most people without money aren't going to understand what a tax credit will do for them -- they wouldn't even blink an eye at it," she said. "That's for people up on the income scale a little bit. I think he needs to look more at people who are lower down."
And, though it has not become a big political issue in Georgia, the Hope Scholarships here often go to those with the least financial need. Unlike the Federal plan, which is phased out for families with adjusted gross income from $80,000 to $100,000, there is no income limit for recipients. At the University of Georgia, one of the state's elite institutions, 97 percent of entering in-state freshmen have Hope Scholarships.
Jessica McGregor is a 21-year-old junior from suburban Cobb County, the most affluent county in Georgia. Her mother is a real estate agent and her father works in property management, and she describes the family as upper middle class.
"I went to a high school where just about everybody goes here," she said. "There was never any question if I'd go to college. And I would have gotten A's whether or not they had the Hope program. But Hope made my decision about where to go."
Finally, the simple message of Georgia's program -- study hard in high school and college to get and keep a scholarship -- is hopelessly watered down in Mr. Clinton's program, experts say.
"One of the biggest differences between the programs is that high school students in Georgia have an incentive to perform better in high school that's not there in the President's plan," said Gary T. Henry, a professor of policy studies at Georgia State University and author of a study of Georgia's plan. "In the long run I believe the incentive for high school students is a far more powerful engine for educational change than the incentive at the college level."
Still, the difference between the programs gets to the basic debate about the President's program -- should it be one that is focused primarily on improving access to education or one with a broader scope?
Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University, said Georgia's program makes more sense than Mr. Clinton's precisely because it targets high achievers already destined for college.
"When you come down to it, public policy really ought to benefit without regard to race or income those most likely to benefit from exposure to higher education," he said. "It goes against the grain of what's politically correct, but the best investment for society is probably in best educating the next generation of leaders."
Mr. Riley says the Administration's approach strikes a balance between aiding those with the most need and middle-class families.
But given limited resources and the growing gap in college attendance between rich and poor, and absent the huge pool of lottery money that has become a painless way to finance Georgia's program, Mr. Clinton's plan is certain to face withering scrutiny, even from those most supportive of expanded aid to higher education.
"We understand and respect the need for some kind of alleviation of the burden for middle-income families, but when you're talking about the difference between having access to school and not having access, I think we have to focus most on those with the most need," said Erica Adelshein, legal director for the United States Student Association, the nation's oldest and largest student association.

HEADLINE: Under the Spotlight in China, Gore Lacked Luster

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 29

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore is not known for daring improvisation.
"This is really one of the wonders of the world," he said as he looked out Thursday on the silent rows of hundreds of life-size terra-cotta warriors that were entombed 22 centuries ago with an emperor in Xian, China. 
 Moments later, he was asked again for his reaction. "It's a fantastic sight," he said. "One of the world's wonders." After a few more minutes, he encountered the same reporters once more.
"One of the world's wonders," he observed.
Mr. Gore's weeklong foreign trip, which ended today after a stop in South Korea, sorely taxed his improvisational skills. In China, it pitted him against some of the world's toughest negotiators as he pushed for American hopes and interests in human rights, the environment and commercial and military trade. Today, Mr. Gore pronounced himself pleased with the results.
"I think that the mission was accomplished," he said.
But particularly during his four days in China, the Vice President was forced to mix his role as an American diplomat with his political ambitions back home, where campaign finance accusations buffet the Administration almost daily.
And, with Chinese relations and his own political plans under heightened scrutiny, Mr. Gore and his aides found themselves tracked by television cameras and examined by editorial writers to a degree they had not known in previous foreign trips. It is scrutiny, they acknowledge, that they must get used to.
Mr. Gore's team and the leaders he met with provided few details of how the Vice President handled himself at the negotiating table. But away from the table and pinned in the media spotlight, Mr. Gore seemed tentative at times, and he did not demonstrate the nimbleness of his boss and past Presidents on such trips. Years after Ronald Reagan visited Xian in 1984, Chinese still recalled with delight how he threw the loyally waiting warriors a salute, and one word: "Dismissed."
Mr. Gore made no bold moves. In Japan, China and Korea, as his motorcade swept past crowds of staring adults and waving children, he never once stopped to shake hands or to question people. His only unplanned mixing, brief in both cases, was with Chinese tourists in the Forbidden City and American tourists at the Shanghai museum.
On the policy front, Mr. Gore lent weight to the Administration's argument for cooperating economically with the Chinese. He left China on Friday having witnessed the signing of major new contracts for Boeing aircraft and General Motors. And on one of his central missions -- continuing the warming in United States-China relations -- he also claimed success.
"We made true progress in lending forward momentum to the relationship with China, while making it clear that the issues where we disagree will be pursued," Mr. Gore said today before leaving Seoul. "It is obvious, in the aftermath of the visit, that the Chinese feel as we do that we have new momentum in the relationship."
Mr. Gore also made political gains. To the world, television beamed images of the Vice President in carefully scripted Presidential poses. Today, dressed in a black and gold cap and an olive Army jacket, Mr. Gore rode a camouflaged Humvee through the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea.
Before a cluster of cameras at one hilltop observation post, he repeatedly stretched out his right arm and pointed toward the border, just 50 meters away. "It's still real here," he said. "The cold war survives. But perhaps not for long, because their system is collapsing." He praised soldiers in the south for serving "right on the front lines of freedom."
Mr. Gore also seemed to be trying to protect himself this week against one line of attack by potential rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination: the mushrooming trade deficit with China. He repeatedly emphasized that problem. "There are still serious and systemic obstacles to greater access for American companies," he said on Wednesday. "That is why I did not pull any punches in my conversations on these issues with the Chinese."
But on both policy and political ground, Mr. Gore stumbled. The stumbles come at a delicate time for the Vice President, who has been criticized recently for soliciting campaign donations from the White House. Until then, Mr. Gore had managed to be lauded as among the most influential Vice Presidents in history without being splattered by ethics accusations that have bogged down the Clinton White House. But his popularity has suffered in recent polls, encouraging his rivals.
They are unlikely to be discouraged by this trip. Mr. Gore argued today that the "new momentum" in the relationship with China "will allow us to make more progress in areas like human rights, trade, and nonproliferation." But he returns to Washington with nothing to show that the Chinese have made progress on human rights or toward ending weapons sales to Iran or Pakistan. He also has no tangible evidence that the Chinese are willing to sacrifice to protect their environment.
Instead, on Tuesday, Mr. Gore found himself cornered into sharing a toast with Prime Minister Li Peng, who publicly presided over the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. With glasses of champagne suddenly materializing, Mr. Gore frowned and spilled his champagne, but the footage is still fodder for political attack commercials.
More significant, on a subject touching both American policy toward China and his political fortunes, Mr. Gore appears to have tried to walk such a fine line in his talks with Mr. Li that he even confused other Administration officials.
At issue was whether Mr. Gore had told Mr. Li on Tuesday that American policy toward China would be affected if a Justice Department investigation found that the Chinese had tried to influence last year's elections through donations. A lower-level Administration official, speaking for Mr. Gore's office, told reporters on Tuesday night that he had not. "He didn't go into that kind of detail," the official said.
But, on Wednesday morning, a senior Administration official summoned reporters to insist that the Vice President had said that the accusations, if true, could have an impact on the relationship. In a news conference later that day, Mr. Gore made the same point: "I made clear that that would be serious indeed."
But on Thursday, Ambassador James Sasser, who was present during the meetings, offered an account that seemed to fall between the previous versions. He said that Mr. Gore had told the Chinese that the issue "was a serious matter, that it was under investigation, and that was essentially it."
But Mr. Gore's aides shrugged off the notion that any apparent missteps this week were significant. "Despite the babble of the toast and briefings by Administration officials, the Administration accomplished what it set out to accomplish," said Ginny Terzano, his press secretary.
Further, once the difficult meetings in Beijing were behind him, Mr. Gore seemed to relax a bit, and by tonight in Seoul he was practically roaring in a warmly applauded speech to American soldiers and their families at a base here.
Even by Thursday night in Shanghai, he had relaxed enough to reveal a touch of improvisation, along with a little road-weariness, in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce. "Here in the United --" Mr. Gore said, catching himself as titters swept the crowd, which was well aware it was in China.
"Here in the United States delegation to Shanghai," the Vice President amended himself, and immediate laughter turned quickly to applause.

HEADLINE: First Day Is Doused but Coney Island Still Swings

 BODY:
With the thunderous rattle of the Cyclone and the familiar music of carousels, Coney Island shook off winter yesterday and reopened for the summer season. But gray skies and a drizzle that deepened into rain kept all but the hardiest visitors away and meant an early journey home for the long-faced carnies, many of whom had pined for the season to begin after months of unemployment.
"Opening day is like coming out of hibernation," said Gerry Menditto, 53, a veteran operator of the Cyclone, the legendary 85-foot-high, 76-year-old roller coaster. "The whole area comes to life." 
 Still, that life is shadowed by accidents at the amusement park in preceding years. Two years ago, 13 people were injured on a ride called the Hell Hole, and last spring two people were hurt on the Jumbo Jet ride.
Yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the city was doing all necessary inspections, but he added that amusement park rides were "inherently dangerous."
"Everyone should be warned that these rides, in order to create the thrill that they create, also create a certain amount of risk," he said. "People should know that, and no matter what the operators say, these are inherently risky situations.
"The Buildings Department will do the best they can to make sure that they are properly inspected," he said. "But people should also be careful. If you go on a roller coaster, you are going on a roller coaster in order to take a risk, and you do take a risk on a roller coaster. It's certainly a lot more dangerous than just walking along the street."
The Jumbo Jet, a small roller coaster that ascends a spiral track before plummeting, was being tested yesterday, with its formal reopening scheduled for today. Norman Kaufman, 66, the ride's operator, said there was nothing to fear. "As far as safety is concerned, we are 100 percent safe," he said. "We are ready to go. Hopefully we will have a good season."
He said the city and a private engineer had checked the ride, and added that he would be having workers inspect it every day.
The Saturday before Easter is the traditional reopening of Coney Island, an urban rite of spring marked by displays of freshly boiled corn on the cob and the barking of vendors.
Despite the foreboding weather, there were some very enthusiastic visitors. Harold Ragalski, 50, a restaurant owner from Marine Park, Brooklyn, was showing his in-laws from Pennsylvania his "old stomping grounds," including a mandatory stop at Nathan's for a hot dog.
"It's opening day, but it's essentially a dress rehearsal," said Dick Zigun, a spokesman for Astroland amusement park and the artistic director of Sideshows by the Seashore, home of acts like Koko the Killer Clown. On Sunday, he said, "we rock and roll with a huge crowd."
At the Wonder Wheel park, whose flagship ride is a 150-foot Ferris wheel, a sign boasts: "Over 30 million riders, never one accident." Dennis Vourderis, one of its owners, was hopeful that the sunny forecast for today would hold true, since 10,000 visitors were expected, which would make it the biggest day so far this year.
At 9 years old, Helen Heuer of Florida, is a veteran rider of the modern roller coasters at Busch Gardens. Visiting family in New York brought her to Astroland, and after a ride on the Cyclone, she was undaunted and frankly unimpressed. "Well," she said, "I thought it was a little slow and it was not that scary at all."

HEADLINE: Councilmen Positioning for Bronx Primary

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
For two weeks now, City Councilman Jose Rivera has courted the clergy, met with labor leaders and implored business owners to make campaign contributions.
His feverish pitch is not about votes. At least not yet. He is trying to persuade his fellow Bronx politicians to view him as the Democratic machine's consensus candidate for Bronx borough president. 
 There were widespread predictions that the race for borough president would lead to a divisive free-for-all, with candidates from every ethnic sector of the Bronx entering the fray for the Democratic nomination.
But no such competition has emerged. Instead, Mr. Rivera seems positioned to be the leading candidate to be backed by the Democratic organization to face City Councilman Israel Ruiz Jr. in the party's primary.
Until two weeks ago, Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx County Democratic leader, was considered the candidate most likely to face Mr. Ruiz. But the Democratic chairman said he did not want the borough president's post, which is being vacated by Fernando Ferrer, who is running for mayor. Instead, Mr. Ramirez said, he would oversee the process under which anyone interested in getting the party's support would spend a month seeking help from various politicians, labor leaders and contributors.
"As soon as Roberto decided not to go for the borough president position, I immediately informed him that I would be reaching out to people," Mr. Rivera said. "So far, I think things are going pretty well."
At first, several black officials said that in an election year in which a Puerto Rican candidate was running for mayor, they wanted to see a black candidate run for borough president. Some Jewish leaders, too, said that they were too important a constituency to be overlooked. But so far, Mr. Rivera has mounted the most aggressive search for support, winning commitments from a variety of political leaders.
As a result, the race for the nomination in the heavily Democratic Bronx seems to be forming as a contest between Mr. Rivera and Mr. Ruiz. And the contrasts between the two candidates are sharp indeed.
Mr. Ruiz is a political phoenix who forfeited his State Senate seat as a result of his 1989 conviction for fraud. He spent four months in a Federal prison in 1990 and re-entered politics by winning a Council seat in 1991. A Columbia Law School graduate, Mr. Ruiz, 56, is known in the Council as a bright if unpredictable legislator with an accomplished speaking style. Although he is not particularly close to the county Democratic organization, he has already raised nearly $500,000 -- much of it in loans.
Indeed, Mr. Ruiz's loans represent an unconventional method of campaign finance. The New York Post reported yesterday that he received them from friends who own two construction companies: $300,000 from the Kafci Corporation in the South Bronx and $150,000 from the GMA Industrial Corporation of Scarsdale, N.Y.
Mr. Ruiz said he had put up his home as collateral for the loans, as well as his future earnings and pension. While acknowledging that the arrangement was unusual, Mr. Ruiz said he expected to repay the loans by Sept. 10, the date of the Democratic primary, as required under the city's campaign finance laws.
"I have several fund-raisers planned," Mr. Ruiz said in an interview yesterday. "They will be at the Waldorf and the Water Club."
He said it was important to take the loans because of his expectation that the Bronx Democratic organization would most likely endorse another candidate. "If the organization comes up with a half-million dollars in support of another candidate, I have to have the ability to get my message across," he said.
Mr. Rivera, who is 60, has been in the City Council since 1987, after serving in the State Assembly (he was elected to the Assembly in 1982 while receiving unemployment insurance). He began his career as a street activist and a union organizer. He is chairman of the Council's Black and Latino Caucus. And in recent years, he has become a particularly influential ally and tactician for Mr. Ramirez and is considered the political godfather of a host of the borough's Puerto Rican officials.
Mr. Ramirez has said publicly that he intends to sponsor an open process under which all candidates, including Mr. Ruiz, will be consulted, and said the party would make a decision by the middle or the end of April.
But it is no secret that the Bronx Democratic leader has no intention of supporting Mr. Ruiz. Several Bronx politicians suggest that they have some reservations about Mr. Rivera. A graying man with a somewhat rumpled look who often dresses casually, Mr. Rivera is criticized by some Bronx Democratic leaders as not fitting their image of what a borough president should be.
"Izzy Ruiz is a well-educated, experienced speaker and Jose is a man whose education was in the streets," said a Democratic Assemblyman, who asked that his name not be used. "It's a little bit like the city slicker versus the country bumpkin."
Also, Mr. Rivera is not well known to many of the politicians outside the Hispanic sections of the Bronx.
"He's got to be a little more out front with his campaign style and with his speaking style," said Jeffrey Klein, a Democratic Assemblyman from the Bronx. "But he does have passion on issues."
Mr. Rivera said he was unconcerned with such views.
"My background is one of being an activist and I continue to be like an activist," he said. "I have demonstrated that I have brought in a lot of people into the political process who would have been turned off by politicians."
So far, Mr. Rivera's efforts seem to be paying off. He said he has received the support of State Senator Larry Seabrook, one of the Bronx's influential black officials.
"Some might think Jose is a hard sell, but I don't believe that," Mr. Seabrook said. "He has a track record of working with African-Americans and on struggles that we identify with. He has stood with Jesse Jackson and David Dinkins. For me, it's an easy sell."
In the meantime, aides to Mr. Rivera said, the Councilman has started to wear suits more frequently.

HEADLINE: Police in Baltimore Try New Kind of Recruiting

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, March 27

 BODY:
Almost 30 years after the idea first occurred to him when he was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, Adam Walinsky is finally watching the Police Corps come alive. He and others say it could fundamentally change the way police departments all over the country serve their communities.
As part of the 1994 Federal anticrime law, $10 million was appropriated for six states to develop programs modeled after the military's Reserve Officers Training Corps. The programs will reimburse as much as $30,000 in educational costs to college graduates who agree to serve four years on a participating police force. 
 Because Lieut. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Mr. Kennedy's oldest daughter, strongly supported the program, Maryland got the biggest amount, $6.5 million. All of that went to the Baltimore police. The first of three classes of 40 recruits is scheduled to begin training next month.
Proponents of the Police Corps say it will transform policing, not just by attracting college graduates but by having those older, better-educated recruits trained in a different way. They will have a new curriculum focusing on the community and emphasizing leadership, sensitivity and social skills as tools to break down the friction and distrust that officers often encounter.
Police academies typically teach skills and aspects of the law in a more sterile, textbook fashion.
"What we're trying to do is enrich and give fuller content to training for community policing," said Mr. Walinsky, a lawyer from New York who played a pivotal role in developing the curriculum, with suggestions from dozens of police officers, in the rank and file as well as the command level. "Yes, we are deliberately reaching for a higher level of recruit, but our goal is that whether they remain on the force or leave it, they will be committed to solving the difficult social problems that are affecting so many people in our country."
To deal with those problems, recruits, in addition to learning new self-defense techniques, will be taught the demographics of neighborhoods, along with communication and note-taking skills. Role playing will also be a major part of training.
"We'll have a lot of recruits from the white suburbs who have never been in a tough urban environment," said Ronald L. Daniel, chief of field operations for the Baltimore Police Department. "Their fear factor could be very high. By playing roles, you begin to understand why people are different and the pressures that people from certain economic groups are under."
Convinced by the urban riots in the late 1960's that policing needed to change, Mr. Walinsky began actively promoting the concept of the Police Corps in 1982.
He found an eager ally in Mrs. Townsend, a lawyer who was a policy analyst at the time for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and campaign manager for her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Viewing it as a logical extension of the Peace Corps, which began when another uncle, John F. Kennedy, occupied the White House, Mrs. Townsend tried to sell the idea in Massachusetts but got little support from state law-enforcement officials.
Mrs. Townsend left Massachusetts for Maryland in 1984 and served in several state and Federal positions before her election as Lieutenant Governor in 1994. But she and Mr. Walinsky kept campaigning for a Police Corps, buttonholing members of Congress and other elected officials whenever and wherever possible.
The concept finally blossomed with the $10 million pilot program. In addition to Maryland, recipients of the money will be South Carolina, which is receiving an estimated $1.08 million; Oregon, $910,000; North Carolina, $450,000; Arkansas, $225,000, and Nevada, $222,500. Eleven other states are competing for money from the $20 million appropriation in the 1997 budget, and President Clinton has asked for $20 million in the 1998 budget.
Maryland gave all its share to Baltimore because local officials, senior police officers and the police union leadership all expressed eagerness for it to become the first major city to adopt the Police Corps approach.
"I had been thinking about this years ago in San Jose," said Thomas C. Frazier, Baltimore's Police Commissioner since 1994, who had served as deputy chief of operations in San Jose, Calif. "Out there, we had lots of union opposition. But the idea always stuck in my mind. Adam Walinsky knew of my interest in California, and when he asked me if I was still interested, I said I was more interested in it here than there."
In Baltimore, police union leaders were as supportive as city political officials, which made it easier for Mrs. Townsend to contend that Baltimore should become the steward of the state's pilot program.
Mr. Walinsky and other consultants were called in, and they began meeting with police officers at every level for suggestions. Many officers were particularly impressed by that.
"We got to be part of the planning process," Mr. Daniel said. "We all had something to say, and they listened. That was lacking in the current training."
Mr. Frazier said the Police Corps program would gradually replace the curriculum used in Baltimore's policy academy, which produces about 200 new officers each year.
All new officers earn an annual starting salary of $25,400.
One uncertainty about the new program is how well Police Corps graduates will work with new colleagues from the academy. Mr. Frazier said he did not expect a two-class system to emerge.
But Mr. Walinsky said the experiment was worth watching. "We're going to learn as we go along," he said. "Look, we're going to make mistakes. They'll be setbacks. Did we pick the right people? Is the training as good as we think it is? That's why we're only starting with 40 and not training them all at once."
State officials say they have already received 500 requests for applications.
One came from Darren Zeck, a 1996 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University and a psychology and accounting major who had wanted to become an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Zeck said he had learned about the Police Corps last year while visiting a friend in Owings Mills, Md., a Baltimore suburb. He said that after the F.B.I. had told him the agency preferred candidates with several years of law-enforcement experience, he had decided that the Baltimore program might be the ideal conduit.
Mr. Zeck, 23, is scheduled to take written and physical tests next week, and, if he passes, return for psychological tests.
"I'm not getting a lot of support right now from my parents," he said. "They're a little scared about the police stuff. And my girlfriend is a little upset because I'd move to Baltimore. But I'm real interested in the community service aspect of the program, the one-on-one intersection with the community. But whether I stay after four years or not, I'm really looking forward to getting started."

HEADLINE: Maryland Lawmakers Reject Increase in Tax on Cigarettes

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The tobacco industry, which has endured some setbacks of late, won a victory this week in Maryland that had more to do with local politics than with national health issues.
Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland had wanted to double the cigarette tax of 36 cents a pack, which would have given Maryland the highest cigarette tax among tobacco-growing states and the fourth-highest in the country, behind Washington (82.5 cents a pack), Massachusetts (76) and Michigan (75). 
 As debate intensified in the state capital of Annapolis this week, there seemed to be no support in the Senate for an increase of more than 15 cents. In the House, some lawmakers from tobacco-growing districts proposed increases so high that they had no chance of passing -- which was just the point.
The Senate overwhelmingly defeated a 30-cents-a-pack increase, and debate finally stalled in the House after increases of 64 cents to nearly $5 a pack were proposed.
By Friday night, proposed increases in the tobacco tax were back in the Senate and House committees, where they were theoretically still under consideration. But no one expects them to surface before the legislative session ends on April 7.
The Governor was keenly disappointed. "Nothing is ever dead until the final banging of the gavel on the last day," he said. "However, the odds are obviously against it."
For Mr. Glendening, a first-term Democrat, doubling the tobacco tax was both a personal health issue -- he has said that both of his parents were smokers and that he does not want his son to smoke -- and an economic one. He had made the increase a cornerstone of an economic development plan. Doubling the cigarette tax would generate $285 million over three years and offset a planned cut in state income taxes, he contended in an interview in November.
Independent polls had suggested that a majority of Maryland residents supported a big increase in the tobacco tax. But Delegate George W. Owings 3d of Calvert County pointed out tonight that tobacco was still the largest cash crop in the state, one that many farmers and their families depend on.
"I represent an agrarian area of southern Maryland that has 1,200 farmers," Mr. Owings said, in explaining why he opposed the Governor, a fellow Democrat, on the tobacco tax.

HEADLINE: RISING PHONE BILLS ARE LIKELY RESULT OF DEREGULATION

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Thirteen months after the telephone industry was deregulated in the name of free-market benefits for consumers, the public might soon see the first tangible result of competition: higher phone bills.
The Federal Communications Commission is currently weighing proposals that could increase monthly local phone bills anywhere from $1.50 to $6 a month. And even if the Federal Government stops short of imposing new charges, industry executives and economists said that state regulators might eventually have little choice but to let local telephone companies lift their rates. 
 Fatter phone bills are not what Congress had in mind when it passed the sweeping telecommunications bill early last year.
But many experts say that higher rates may be an unavoidable first step toward the competition that is supposed to bring lower prices in the long run.
Why this seeming paradox? In setting the rules for a fully competitive communications market, Federal and state regulators must strip away subsidies that for decades have allowed millions of Americans to get local service for less than it costs the telephone companies to provide it.
That leaves the F.C.C., in particular, with a dilemma. It can simply end these subsidies for the local phone companies and risk a jarring disruption of the "universal service" tradition that enables 93 percent of American households to afford a telephone. Or the F.C.C. can allow the phone companies to ease into the world of pay-as-you-go competition, by replacing a portion of the subsidies with higher rates.
"This is the Sophie's Choice of the telecommunications revolution," said Roy M. Neel, the president of the United States Telephone Association, which represents more than 1,000 local phone companies. "Something has got to give if you want to establish competition."
With the F.C.C. set to rule on these issues on May 8, the prospect of higher rates is already whipping up a political tempest on Capitol Hill. At a recent hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, several senators said they would never have voted in favor of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 if they had thought it would lead to higher rates.
One of the senators, Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said in a recent interview that he was particularly worried about rural customers. Rates for those customers are subsidized more heavily than elsewhere because it costs more for the phone companies to string lines out to them. Without an adequate replacement for the subsidies, those rates could skyrocket.
"We would be foolish to build up all these expectations about competition without saying to the American people, 'We're going to have to raise your phone bill,' " Mr. Brownback said.
Further complicating the arithmetic is the Clinton Administration's campaign to wire the nation's schools and libraries with sophisticated cable for high-speed access to the Internet. Under the White House plan, the phone companies would be responsible for wiring -- at an estimated cost of $2.25 billion -- with help from a universal service fund collected by the Government.
The question facing the F.C.C.: How does it preserve affordable local phone service and also wire schools and libraries, while stripping away billions of dollars in subsidies?
"The nub of the problem is dealing with the transitional period," said Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C. "My No. 1 goal is to make sure the cost of residential dial tone does not go up."
Mr. Neel of the telephone association and other experts acknowledge that it would be politically untenable for the F.C.C. to put through a direct increase on basic phone rates.
Mr. Hundt said the commission might instead try to increase monthly flat rates for people who install second phone lines in their homes -- even at the risk of curbing Internet and other on-line computer access, which is what many second lines are used for these days. The F.C.C. might also raise the line charges on phone lines used by small businesses or for lines used in vacation homes.
Under the regulatory system in place for decades, Americans have been assured of affordable access to basic phone service, through the policy known as universal service. As a result, while the average monthly bill for residential long-distance service was around $31 in 1995, the average household paid only about $19 a month for local phone service.
But those low local rates are made possible only by a complex web of Federal and state subsidies, which are coming under attack as the Telecommunications Act opens up the telephone market to competition.
The first subsidy to go under the knife will be access charges, the per-minute fees that long-distance carriers like the AT&T Corporation pay to Nynex and other local phone companies to complete their calls. These charges are purposely set above cost, and they generate roughly $14 billion a year, which the local companies use to subsidize local service.
The MCI Communications Corporation says the F.C.C. should cut access charges to $3 billion, which it contends is the local companies' actual cost of providing access. The company is currently running a multimillion-dollar print and television advertising campaign to persuade consumers that they are victims of rampant overcharging by their local companies.
The BellSouth Corporation, however, said that if access charges were cut that much, it would no longer be able to pay for improvements in its phone network. The company, which offers local service in nine Southern states, said these charges ought to be allowed to decline on their own as new competitors lured customers away from the Bell companies.
In a filing last year with the F.C.C., the GTE Corporation estimated that it would have to raise local rates by $7.20 a month to make up the money lost from access charges and other subsidies.
Despite such potential increases, some analysts said consumers would benefit from reduced access charges because the long-distance carriers would pass along the money they saved in lower long-distance bills. But consumer advocates noted that access charges have already declined 15 percent since 1990, while long-distance rates have risen 15 percent. Moreover, they noted that access charges are only one of the subsidies that keep local rates down.
Another way that local phone companies are able to keep rates down is through the monthly "subscriber line charge," an additional flat fee, long mandated by the F.C.C. and currently $3.50 for residential lines and $6 for businesses, which local phone companies levy to help defray the overall costs of operating the local network. This fee, which is waived for low-income subscribers who qualify for bare-bones "lifeline" service, amounts to a subsidy underwritten by the more affluent.
Other subsidies include the inflated prices for extra calling features, like call waiting, caller identification and voice mail, which regulators have let phone companies charge as a way of underwriting basic telephone service.
All told, Federal and state subsidies generate about $23 billion a year for the local phone companies. Under the terms of the Telecommunications Act, these subsidies are to be replaced with a new universal service fund, to be collected from any company -- old or new -- offering local phone service. This fund would be administered by the Federal Government to insure affordable phone service for all.
How best to make this transition is the subject of intense debate between local and long-distance companies and the regulators. If access charges are cut too abruptly, or if the universal service fund is not large enough, the local companies said, they will have to raise their local rates in order to continue offering ubiquitous and reliable service.
These companies have not hesitated to battle the F.C.C. in court on these kinds of issues. GTE and several of the Bell companies are suing the commission in Federal court in St. Louis over the F.C.C.'s rules for opening their networks to new competitors.
Still, few experts expect the local phone companies to be compensated dollar-for-dollar for the subsidies they lose. Wall Street analysts said the stock prices of the seven Bell companies and GTE already reflected an expectation that they would give up $1 billion to $2 billion in revenue.
Executives at BellSouth said the Federal universal service fund would have to be between $9 billion and $10 billion, including the cost of wiring schools, in order for local companies to keep a lid on rates. In his recent speeches, however, Mr. Hundt has hinted that he would prefer to keep the Federal fund at between $5 billion and $7 billion.
Unless it wants local phone companies to absorb the difference, the F.C.C. must find several billion dollars. Among the proposals being considered is a plan to increase the monthly $3.50 subscriber line charge.
In separate filings with the F.C.C., AT&T recommended doubling the charge to $7 a month, while BellSouth suggested increasing it to $5.43 a month. The F.C.C., however, seems more likely to increase charges on second lines or on lines in second homes.
"This game is called 'shift and shaft,' " Sharon L. Nelson, the chairwoman of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, said. "You shift the costs to the states and shaft the consumer."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Price of Competition"
In the transition from a regulated telephone industry to free-market competition, the F.C.C. may need to raise local phone rates to eliminate long-standing subsidies. Here are the various parts of a sample monthly phone bill that could be affected.
 
Subscriber Line Charge*
The F.C.C. is weighing proposals to increase this $3.50 charge by $1.50 to $3.75 per month, most likely on second phone lines and on lines in second homes. It may also raise the $6.00 monthly charge to businesses for primary phone lines.
 
Usage fees*
If the F.C.C. does not raise rates at the Federal level, state regulators may have no choice but to let local phone companies raise per-minute or per-call rates.
 
Long-distance access
The F.C.C. may impose a flat rate on long-distance carriers for access to networks of local companies. The long-distance carriers will probably pass some of the cost along to customers.
 
*Nynex does not advocate increasing either subscriber line charges or usage fees (pg. 15)

HEADLINE: Use Democratic India as Counterweight to China

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal's columns on India (March 21 and 25) are heartening. India is the world's biggest democracy, and we have a common bond, for we were both British colonies. We also imported India's method of peaceful dissent, which fueled our civil rights movement in the 1960's. And the tremendous number of immigrants from India contribute so much to this country. 
 We would be wise to cultivate this bond for several reasons. Economically, India is an enormous unclaimed Asian market timed to emerge just as China's market matures, much in the way China's market emerged as Japan's was maturing. Culturally, standing by a solid agrarian democracy as it grows on the world scene would go a long way toward advancing American ideas globally. Politically, a confident, democratic India allied with the United States can provide leverage against a tyrannical China.
Many fear this century will be America's last great hurrah as a superpower, and that the next century will belong to the Chinese. But if we stick to our tradition of being the advocate of democracy worldwide, our way of life will continue to reign supreme. Leaning toward India is the next logical step down that path.

HEADLINE: U.S. SURVEYS FIND FARM WORKER PAY DOWN FOR 20 YEARS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SALINAS, Calif.

 BODY:
Despite decades of efforts to improve the lot of American farm workers, wages for the nation's more than two million farm laborers have trailed stubbornly behind inflation for the past 20 years, making it hard for many of them to afford adequate housing and other necessities.
Agricultural economists and some industry surveys found that farm workers' wages have fallen 20 percent or more over the past two decades after accounting for inflation, while a United States Department of Agriculture study found a 7 percent drop, to $6.17 an hour in current dollars, over that period. 
 Here in Salinas, a lush farm center on California's Central Coast, the piece rate for picking broccoli remains 20 percent below levels of a decade ago, even before considering inflation. In nearby Watsonville, the average wage for strawberry workers has dropped from $6.55 an hour in 1985 to $6.25 today -- and that is without taking inflation into account.
"In terms of constant dollars, there's been a significant decline in wages, we think by over 25 percent, over the last 20 years," said Don Villarejo, executive director of the California Institute for Rural Studies. "You have a situation where there is a substantial surplus of workers, almost all of them immigrants, and labor unions have lost their importance in terms of helping to maintain wage levels for farm workers."
Making the economic squeeze worse, many farm laborers work fewer hours a year mainly because farmers can choose from a large pool of immigrant workers, most of them Mexican, to get their harvesting done more quickly. As a result, many farm workers -- whose jobs often involve bending over for hours at a time under a searing sun -- complain that their earnings have slid to $8,000 a year from $9,000 a few years ago.
Despite all the surveys, many farmers insist that wages are keeping up with inflation. They also assert that living conditions for farm laborers have improved, noting that a far lower percentage are migrants who follow the harvest from state to state each year.
To be sure, the United States has made some sizable strides in lifting living conditions for farm workers since the 1960 CBS documentary "Harvest of Shame" trained a spotlight on the deplorable conditions that migrant workers endured.
Nowadays most farm workers are offered unemployment insurance, Social Security and workers' compensation. Safety laws have been tightened, and farmers generally provide toilets and drinking water to their workers, as required by law.
But farm workers say that in some important ways their lives have deteriorated, often in ways related to the slide in after-inflation wages.
Effraim Lara, an earnest, muscular vegetable worker, says that because rents are so high and wages so modest, he, his wife and three daughters have to share a four-bedroom house in Salinas with two other farm worker families.
"In 1986, we were paid $3.70 for each box of broccoli rape we picked, but now we're paid $2.50 a box," Mr. Lara said in the Spanish of his native Guadalajara. "In the 1980's, I often earned $450 or $500 in a good week; now it's more like $300. I can assure you housing prices haven't gone down. What used to rent for $300, 10 years ago, now rents for $600."
His employer has stopped providing dental coverage, and his health insurance plan has grown skimpier -- now he has to pay 40 percent of each medical bill, up from 20 percent a decade ago.
In the 1960's, farmers usually provided free, though sometimes substandard, housing to their workers. But Federal laws that were enacted a decade ago to set standards for those farmers who provide housing have instead caused many growers to stop providing lodging, concluding it is too difficult and costly to meet the regulations. As a result, farm workers must pay for their own shelter, a cost that often claims at least one-third of their paychecks. That change has also forced many farm workers to find their own transportation to work, since they no longer live on the farm. Frequently they pay $15 to $25 a week for rides to work.
"Just by moving off the farm their disposable income has been cut enormously," said Philip Martin, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis.
Seizing on the surveys that show the smallest decline in farm wages, agricultural growers maintain that the wages of farm workers have done better, at least in the 1990's, than American workers not employed on the farm.
"Real wages in agriculture have declined slightly over the last 10 years, but they have declined less than the real wages of nonagricultural workers," said James Holt, an economist who serves as a consultant to the National Council of Agricultural Employers.
For all nonsupervisory American workers, real wages have slid about 3 percent since 1989, while some surveys show that farm wages have slid 2 percent since 1989 and others show a 10 percent drop. Farm wage studies often reach different conclusions because some are based on surveying farmers, some on farm workers, and some on census data.
To farm workers, it is scant comfort to hear that their after-inflation wages have slightly outpaced nonfarm earnings in recent years since agricultural wages have traditionally been just half that of nonfarm wages. What is more, only a small fraction of farm workers have benefits like health insurance and pension programs, which are common among nonfarm workers. Farm workers also complain that in many states they are not paid time-and-a-half for working more than eight hours a day.
According to the Department of Agriculture, wages for field workers rose from $2.57 in 1977 to $6.17 last year in current dollars. After adjusting for inflation, that survey found a 7 percent drop.
Many economists fault the Department of Agriculture's survey, saying that because it is based on questioning farmers, it overstates how much workers are paid and understates how much wages have fallen.
Some economists also fault that survey for not factoring in the many field hands who work for farm labor contractors, a fast-growing group that hires and supervises workers for farmers. Contractors, who employ about one-third of California's 700,000 farm workers, normally pay about 20 percent less than farmers who hire their workers directly.
An important factor behind the fall in wages has been the sharp decline in the power of the United Farm Workers of America. Its membership plunged from 80,000 in 1970 to 21,000 in 1993, the year its founder, Cesar Chavez, died.
Two decades ago it had contracts for all California table grape workers. Today, it has none, the result of growers getting tougher toward the union.
Mr. Lara, the Salinas vegetable worker, said that when the union had a contract with his farm 15 years ago, the farm paid $7.05 an hour at a minimum. Today, the workers have no contract, and the farm has a $6 an hour minimum.
"As long as there is no threat of unionization, growers have no reason to raise wages," said Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers. "Unless we have a real presence to force the industry to do what it should do there will be no change."
If California farm wages had kept up with inflation since 1985, he said, workers would be earning $9.40 an hour, instead of $5.50 or $6. To raise wages, the union is mounting one of the nation's largest organizing drives, an effort to unionize 20,000 strawberry workers.
Edward Angstadt, president of the Grower-Shipper Vegetable Association of Central California, said it would not be so simple for farmers to raise wages. "The past couple of years we haven't been in the best position from a sales standpoint," he said. "There are some people who just can't afford to bring up wages."
To farm workers and many economists, it is a truism that another major reason for falling wages is what they see as a huge surplus of immigrant labor. Sometimes immigrants show up at a field and begin working without even being hired, hoping the crew leaders will pay them at the end of the day.
Leo Polopolus, an agricultural economist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said that 1986 legislation has not slowed the inflow of immigrants, as it intended.
"This continuous flow of legal and illegal immigrants into the work force has kept farm wages from rising faster than the cost of living," he said. He notes that the piece rate for picking oranges has remained flat in much of Florida since 1990.
Showing that farm workers and growers often have starkly different views of reality, employer groups deny that there is a surplus of labor and also deny farm worker allegations that they have manipulated Federal law to insure there are excess workers to keep wages low.
"If there is a surplus of labor, I don't know of any farmer who knows where it is," said Bryan Little, chief lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Economists say giving farm workers a substantial raise would in theory raise the costs of fruits and vegetables just a few cents a pound. For example, only about eight cents of the cost of a lettuce that retails for $1 goes to farm workers. That means a 25 percent increase in farm wages would raise the labor cost for each head of lettuce to 10 cents from 8 cents, in theory raising the supermarket cost of a head to $1.02 from $1.
"Most Americans don't want to do this work," Mr. Villarejo said. "Yet we want our fruits and vegetables. We love our fruits and vegetables. When it comes to this work, we're just as happy to have someone come in illegally and do that work for low wages. It's a serious question that we as a nation haven't faced up to."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Support Fewer Supercomputer Centers

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 30

 BODY:
The National Science Foundation announced Friday that it planned to cut in half the number of supercomputer research centers it finances -- going from four to two -- another reminder, if one was needed, that the time when supercomputers were hailed as symbols of the nation's technological prowess has passed.
New awards were given to the National Center for Supercomputer Applications, or N.C.S.A., based at the University of Illinois, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, two of the original four centers that helped pioneer the networking technology during the mid-1980's that was to become the modern day Internet. Researchers at N.C.S.A. also created the Mosaic browser that led directly to the commercial explosion of the World Wide Web. 
 "There has never been a Federal technological program that has come close to showing the social and economic benefit of the National Science Foundation supercomputer center funding program," said Michael Roberts, a vice president of Educom, a consortium that promotes computing in higher education.
Officials said that financing levels for the supercomputer center program would not change significantly, despite the decline in the number of centers. Total spending for each center is planned to be $170 million over five years, with a budget of $29 million the first year.
While the most advanced supercomputers are still designed and installed first at the national weapons laboratories, the supercomputer centers have, during the last 12 years, provided a ready source of high-performance computing power for the nation's scientists.
However, the increasing power of the microprocessor chip has meant that near-supercomputer speeds are attainable inexpensively on the desktop.
The explosion of computer networking has reduced the need for supercomputing research centers, according to National Science Foundation officials. Increasingly, supercomputing power which was once available only to researchers at the weapons laboratories is now accessible to thousands of scientists via high-speed computer networks.
"When the program began in the mid-1980's we had four machines on top of four mountains," said Robert Borchers, director of the foundation's advanced scientific computing division. "If you could scale the mountain you could use a supercomputer."
He said the new program is based on the new realities of scientific computing in the Internet era in which it does not matter where computers are located.
One of the new programs, named the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure, will be led by the University of California at San Diego, and will focus on building a generation of computers and networks that are more than a hundred times as fast as today's technology.
"The opportunity for making enormous strides is absolutely there," said Sid Karin, director of the partnership program, which will involve 37 other institutions.
The goals of the project include building a new class of supercomputer-based scientific instrumentation that will be accessible to researchers around the nation via high-speed networks, Mr. Karin said. The new program will also focus on making supercomputers and data bases available to social scientists.
The second program will be named the National Computational Science Alliance. Led by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign it will also focus on making advanced computing available to a broad range of researchers like cosmologists and biologists.
"What's appropriate for the next 10 years starts with the assumption that we have a networked nation," said Larry Smarr, director of the N.C.S.A.
The new programs have the potential to match the impact of the original program, Mr. Smarr said.
The National Science Foundation supercomputer centers program began in 1985. In December 1995, after a task force review of the program, the National Science Board recommended reorganizing support for a new program. A summary panel met in late 1996 to make final recommendations to the foundation.
The process was not without conflict. The Cornell Theory Center at Cornell University, one of the losing centers, has filed a protest over the award process with the Government, Mr. Borchers said. Funding for the Cornell center, and for the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center at the University of Pittsburgh, will be phased out over two years.

HEADLINE: DEATHS AT RALLY RATTLE CAMBODIA

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, March 30

 BODY:
Cambodia's hard-won but increasingly tenuous democracy was shaken today by a grenade attack that killed or wounded scores of people at an opposition political rally in the center of the capital.
At least 10 people were killed and more than half the 200 people at the rally in Phnom Penh were wounded by the rapid series of explosions. It was the worst political violence since a democratic Government was established here in 1993. 
 The apparent target of the attack, the opposition leader Sam Rainsy, escaped with only minor injuries, though he was covered with the blood of a bodyguard who he said leaped to protect him. He immediately blamed one of the country's two feuding co-Prime Ministers, Hun Sen, who has frequently threatened violence against his opponents.
A leading member of Mr. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, Khie Kanharith, denied that the party was involved. "The C.P.P. has long experience with politics and does not commit acts of violence against innocent people," he said.
The country's fragile democracy has degenerated in recent months into a cold war between Mr. Hun Sen and the other co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, that has occasionally burst into exchanges of gunfire between soldiers loyal to each of the two government factions.
The confrontation has eroded the legacy of a $2 billion international effort sponsored by the United Nations in 1992 and 1993 to hold elections and establish a democratic Government in this nation wounded by many years of civil war.
But political analysts said today that they were stunned that large-scale political violence had erupted so far in advance of elections scheduled for November 1998.
"This does seem ominous," said David Chandler, a scholar of Cambodian history and politics. "This much violence so soon is a surprise. It was a perilous, perilous thing to do."
Western diplomats whose countries continue to support Cambodia's corrupt and threadbare economy with large amounts of aid expressed fears that this international experiment in nurturing democracy could collapse.
"It is imperative that all in Cambodia do everything possible to avoid any future violence which could put at risk the significant progress Cambodia has made in recent years," the United States Embassy said after the killings in what seemed an almost pleading statement.
As rivalries have grown here, political interests have become increasingly complex and fragmented. Although Mr. Hun Sen appears to have been behind previous smaller attacks on opposition politicians and journalists, one Western political analyst cautioned that it was not clear who had ordered today's attack.
"I don't know whose interests are served by this," said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's a murky situation. This would be exactly the kind of thing Hun Sen's advisers have been advising him not to do."
Political alliances have been in flux in recent weeks, with Mr. Rainsy entering into a prickly alliance with Mr. Ranariddh in opposition to Mr. Hun Sen with both sides courting the support of a new political player, members of the previously outlawed Khmer Rouge.
That radical Communist group, which is blamed for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during its four years in power from 1975 to 1979, has been collapsing as a guerrilla force since last summer. Large numbers of defectors have joined the Government side and are expected to be involved in the coming election.
Outside the National Assembly building, where Mr. Rainsy had staged his rally to criticize Mr. Hun Sen and his party, even the details of the attack itself seemed unclear.
In the stunned silence that followed the explosions, nobody was quite sure whether there had been three or four grenades, whether they had come from a white car that rolled slowly past, from "two beefy men" on a motorcycle or from over the wall of the National Assembly building.
Casualty estimates varied, with Mr. Rainsy offering the highest numbers: 15 dead and 120 hurt. Hospitals said that as many as 20 of the injured were in serious condition.
The dead and injured included many of Mr. Rainsy's supporters, several journalists, passing motorists and vendors selling sugar cane and other refreshments.
At least one local journalist, Chhet Daravudh, of New Liberty News, was among those killed.
Among those seriously injured were an American, Ron Abney, 55, of Cochran, Ga., a political adviser who works for the International Republican Institute, and Zhu Changdu, the Phnom Penh correspondent for the New China News Agency.
As police officers stood by helplessly, witnesses said, journalists and other bystanders rushed the dead and wounded to hospitals.
The ground was littered with shoes and bits of clothing and blood-spattered protest placards. Severed arms and legs were collected in a bin.
"This is a terrible setback for the democratic process in Cambodia," Mr. Rainsy said, his glasses cracked and his suit covered with blood. "It bodes ill for the national elections.
"Hun Sen, the bloody guy -- he should be sentenced and arrested."
For months, Mr. Rainsy has been taunting and provoking Mr. Hun Sen, and Mr. Rainsy's supporters have in turn come under harassment.
In a radio broadcast later, Mr. Hun Sen said the police should find and arrest the attackers -- as well as the leaders of the rally, who he said shared responsibility for the bloodshed.
He also said he had ordered the Interior Ministry to prevent Cambodians with dual nationality from leaving the country.
He did not specifically refer to Mr. Rainsy, but like many Cambodians who fled abroad after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Rainsy holds both Cambodian and French passports.
The political rivalries that are paralyzing Cambodia's Government have long and tangled histories. When men like Mr. Rainsy fled Cambodia after a Vietnamese invasion ousted the Khmer Rouge in 1979, the Vietnamese installed a compliant Government headed by Mr. Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge soldier.
Mr. Hun Sen governed Cambodia through the 1980's, until the elections sponsored by the United Nations. When Mr. Ranariddh's royalist party won the elections, Mr. Hun Sen threatened civil war and a contentious power-sharing arrangement was put in place, with the two men heading what amount to parallel governments.
Mr. Hun Sen's rivalry with Mr. Rainsy, bloody as it has become, is only a sideshow to his growing confrontation with Mr. Ranariddh.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Warns China That U.S. Would Step In to Defend Taiwan

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, March 30

 BODY:
Speaking with startling bluntness on an issue so delicate that diplomats have tiptoed around it for years, Newt Gingrich said today that he had warned China's top leaders that the United States would intervene militarily if Taiwan was attacked.
As he left for Tokyo after a three-day trip to China, Mr. Gingrich said he had made it absolutely clear how the United States would respond if such a military conflict arose. 
 Referring to his meetings with China's leaders, Mr. Gingrich said: "I said firmly, 'We want you to understand, we will defend Taiwan. Period.' "
He also said, "I think that they are more aware now that we would defend Taiwan if it were militarily attacked."
Mr. Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, delivered his message, among the most forceful ever given about Taiwan by a visiting United States official, to Wang Daohan, China's chief representative in talks with Taiwan. Mr. Gingrich said he had given the same message to President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng in Beijing last week.
Chinese leaders offered no public response to Mr. Gingrich today. But on Friday, Mr. Jiang urged him to treat the Taiwan issue with care.
Although Chinese leaders can hardly be pleased by his remarks, just as Taiwan's leaders are likely to be thrilled by them, Mr. Gingrich said the response he had received in Beijing and Shanghai had been calm.
"We never got into an argument," he said. "They never said, 'Well you can't have that right -- that's interference.' They said, 'O.K., noted.' And then they basically would say: 'Since we don't intend to attack, you won't have to defend. Let's go on and talk about how we're going to get this thing solved.' And I think that's very healthy."
[Asked about Mr. Gingrich's statements, a Clinton Administration official in Washington said Mr. Gingrich had received briefings about American policy toward China, but that Mr. Gingrich "was speaking for himself" in his conversations with Chinese leaders.
[The White House issued a statement saying that the policy of the United States was to "meet its obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act, including the maintenance of an adequate self-defense for Taiwan," and that the Administration would maintain its "one-China policy, the fundamental bedrock of which is that both parties peacefully address the Taiwan issue."]
As a Republican leader, Mr. Gingrich is often at odds with President Clinton, yet Mr. Gingrich and Vice President Al Gore said during their visits to China in the last week that they were coordinating their messages to Beijing.
Mr. Gore stayed away from the subject of Taiwan in his public comments. After the Vice President met with Prime Minister Li, Mr. Gore's national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, said the two men had not discussed Taiwan.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Gingrich said he had spoken with Mr. Clinton, and with Mr. Gore on several occasions, to make sure that their messages to Beijing dovetailed. At the time, he did not mention his message on Taiwan.
After visiting Japan, Mr. Gingrich and the dozen members of Congress with him will stop in Taiwan on Tuesday.
Mr. Gingrich said he agreed with the Administration's support for a one-China policy that opposes formal independence for Taiwan and preserves the hope that the island will be reunited peacefully with the mainland someday. But he insisted that the American willingness to defend Taiwan must be unmistakable.
The Clinton Administration's position on Taiwan is intentionally vague. It leaves open the possibility of American intervention, yet never spells out a firm position for fear of angering Beijing, which considers any discussion of Taiwan to be unacceptable interference in China's internal affairs.
After losing a civil war to the Communists in 1949, the Nationalist Government of China retreated to Taiwan, where it has remained in power -- maintaining a capitalist economic system -- with American suppport.
A year ago, when China test-fired missiles off the coast of Taiwan to intimidate voters in the island's first democractic presidential election, the United States sent an aircraft carrier to waters nearby. No public stand was made, but the unspoken message was clear.
Rejecting an indirect approach, Mr. Gingrich effectively said that it was best to bang a drum loudly, and that to remain vague could be dangerous.
"The worst thing that could happen would be an absence of clarity, the Dean Acheson problem of 1950," Mr. Gingrich said. In outlining the American defense perimeter in the Pacific in a 1950 speech, Secretary of State Acheson did not mention South Korea, an omission that may have encouraged the North Korean attack that began the Korean War later that year.
China has said consistently that it might use force to take back Taiwan, if necessary, much as it favors a peaceful reunification with the island. Mr. Gingrich said today that since China's position is that it might have to use force, the United States position should be that it would use force in response.
For the last 25 years, ever since the policy was spelled out in the Shanghai Communique when President Nixon visited China in 1972, the United States position has been that China and Taiwan should work toward a peaceful solution of their conflict. That effectively allowed Washington and Beijing to put off the Taiwan issue indefinitely and proceed with diplomatic and economic cooperation.
Yet China remains highly sensitive about Taiwan. Even though the possiblity of reunification seems remote to the people of Taiwan, where the standard of living and the political system are starkly different from the mainland's, Beijing has not relented in its determination. After China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong this summer, Chinese leaders have said repeatedly, recovering Taiwan will be their next goal.
Despite the seeming intractablility of the Taiwan question, and the bluntness of his own remarks on Taiwan, Mr. Gingrich said the overall atmosphere of his talks had been warm and friendly.
"I didn't flinch, but they didn't flinch either, because I wasn't hostile," he said. "If you can be respectful but firm, you can get a long way talking with the Chinese. I think that's a key part of this. We are who we are. We believe passionately in freedom. To deal with us is to deal with a free people.
"Now having said that, they are a great nation. The more we honor their pride and we honor their national achievement, the easier it is to then get them talking openly about democracy."
Mr. Gingrich, like many other foreign visitors, was clearly taken with experiments in village-level democracy. Today he extolled Shanghai's local legislature, where he described the use of new technology as "a video-computer legislator's dream."
Mr. Gingrich arrived in Shanghai this morning in time to attend an Easter service in a Chinese church built by Americans in the 1920's.
"It was a wonderful thing to be in Shanghai celebrating the Resurrection of Christ and to have a chance to worship with Chinese and Australians and others," Mr. Gingrich said, referring to the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, who was here too. "I think that's a good sign. We want to encourage that kind of openness."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The Roman Catholic Church gets mixed reviews on its foray into advertising's big issues.

BYLINE: By Tamar Charry 

 BODY:
THE Pope's getting into advertising?" said one ad executive with a laugh.
In a sense, the answer is yes. Forget, for a moment, about separation of church and state, for that issue has a new twist: separation of church and capitalism, or, more specifically, separation of the Vatican and Madison Avenue. 
 What took that executive by surprise was a pamphlet put out recently by the Roman Catholic Church that plunges into the debate about the impact of advertising on society.
The 35-page pamphlet touches on a host of familiar themes: truthfulness in advertising, the preservation of human dignity, the manipulation of children and citizens of developing countries, and the influence of advertising on politics and the media. It comes down hard on familiar targets like vulgar or violent ads.
Valid issues all, but the larger issue is whether the church should even sit in on this particular debate.
"We get into a very dangerous place when the Catholic Church or any other religious organization tries to dictate content," said Donny Deutsch, chief executive of Deutsch Inc. in New York. "Let the consumer decide. The free enterprise system provides its own policing."
But others react differently. "We are in a powerful position, and we need to be careful not to abuse that privilege," said Seth Werner, co-chief executive of Publicis/Bloom in Dallas, owned by Publicis S.A.. "The way I look at it, the Vatican can say anything they want, about anything they want."
Not that the report has exactly shaken the advertising world since it was released in late February. Few advertising professionals have even heard of it, and when they were told of it, their response was often one of surprise. But it is getting around, with an article and excerpts of the statement published in Advertising Age earlier this month.
The pamphlet, "Ethics in Advertising," makes no blanket condemnation of the industry. "Many women and men professionally engaged in advertising do have sensitive consciences, high ethical standards and a strong sense of responsibility," it states. "But even for them external pressures -- from their clients who commission their work as well as from the competitive internal dynamics of their profession -- can create powerful inducements to unethical behavior. That underlines the need for external structures and systems to support and encourage responsible advertising and discourage the irresponsible."
The report was written by the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, the Vatican's communications department. It was released in six languages, and was distributed among bishops worldwide. It is just one of many documents on social issues, like a 1992 report on changes in communication technology and policy and a 1989 report on pornography and violence in the media.
The impetus for this one came from Catholic bishops and cardinals, as well as advertising executives, said Archbishop John P. Foley, an American and president of the council. It was intended as a balanced assessment, and does mention several useful aspects of advertising.
"Advertising has a profound impact on how people understand life, the world, and themselves, especially in regard to their values and their ways of choosing and behaving," the report states. "These are matters about which the church is and must be deeply and sincerely concerned."
Many business ethicists agree that this is fair game for the Vatican.
"The Vatican not only has every right to do this, but it is fundamentally what religion is about," said Gene Laczniak, a professor of marketing at Marquette, a Jesuit university, and author of a book on marketing ethics. "All religious organizations are about values. Espousing those values in a way that has implications for society is to be expected, and in some ways commended."
Others, though, think the church statement is more likely to sour the industry to issues of social responsibility.
"The first thing the advertising community will say is, 'Who is the Vatican to make statements about capitalism?' " said Tim C. Mazur, vice president of the Council for Ethics in Economics, based in Columbus, Ohio. He said the argument that advertising decisions should be based on moral standards is irrational to the capitalist business audience. "To that extent, it may turn off this audience more than they were before," he said.
To a degree, he is right. Some executives do go on the defensive when faced with the statement.
"They're playing in the wrong ballfield," said O. Burtch Drake, president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York. "There are very strong governmental regulations in the United States, particularly on the basis of honesty. You can't say anything deceptive without the F.T.C. getting on your case."
While that may be true in the United States, this document was intended for many countries, including those that do not have such strict regulatory systems. And in addition, pointed out Professor Laczniak, government intervention in this country does not necessarily insure moral conduct at all times.
"Unfortunately, I think there are a lot of business people in this country who on Saturday or Sunday profess the values of their religious community," he said, "but when they go to work on Monday, it's the dog who snaps fastest who gets the bone."

Gingrich Issues Warning To Chinese Over Taiwan
Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, said he had warned China's top leaders that the United States would intervene militarily if Taiwan were attacked. The issue is so sensitive that diplomats have tiptoed around it for years, but at the end of a three-day trip to China, Mr. Gingrich said he had bluntly stated how the United States would respond. Chinese leaders offered no public comment, and a Clinton Administration official said Mr. Gingrich "was speaking for himself." A1
 
Grenade Attack in Cambodia
A grenade attack killed at least 10 people and wounded more than 200 at an opposition political rally in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. The apparent target, the opposition leader Sam Rainsy, escaped with only minor injuries. He immediately blamed one of the country's two feuding co-Prime Ministers, Hun Sen, who has frequently threatened opponents. It was the worst political violence since a democratic Government was established in 1993. A1 
 
Palestinian Protest Contained
Palestinian police maintained a tight grip on Palestinians who rioted for an 11th day across the West Bank, preventing a dangerous increase in violence on an annual day of protest by Arabs. Both the Palestinians and Israelis continued their tough talk, and Arab officials meeting in Cairo threatened to revive economic and political isolation of Israel. The United States special envoy is expected to prepare a new plan to break an impasse in the peace talks. A1
 
Italy Blamed in Refugee Deaths
An Albanian man who survived the sinking of a boat carrying refugees wept in Brindisi, Italy. Senior Albanian officials blamed Italy for the deaths of as many as 79 Albanians, accusing one of its navy vessels of deliberately ramming and sinking the boat. The episode is expected to complicate Italy's effort to assemble a multinational force to deliver food, medicine and other aid to Albania. A3
 
India Coalition Nears Collapse
Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda's nine-month-old minority Government was on the verge of collapse after the Congress Party abruptly withdrew its support, thus depriving his 13-party coalition of a parliamentary majority. The move appeared to set the stage for a new period of political uncertainty in India, and possibly even for a new general election less than a year after the inconclusive election that brought Mr. Deve Gowda to power.

School Shooting in Yemen
A man with an assault rifle killed a school headmistress, a teacher and six children in an attack on hundreds of pupils at two schools in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, a security official said. Eleven other pupils from two neighboring schools and three other people were wounded. The gunman was arrested after a shootout with security forces. Witnesses described him as a disgruntled bus driver who had been dismissed. (Reuters)

Farm Workers Poorer Despite Years of Action
Wages for farm laborers have fallen as much as 20 percent over the past two decades after accounting for inflation. Despite years of organizing, protests and other actions, many of the workers still cannot afford adequate housing and other necessities. Experts attribute the problem to immigration and the weakness of labor unions. In some areas, piece rates and wages have fallen even without considering inflation. A1
 
The Inexplicable on Day of Faith
On a day when the Christian world celebrated a Resurrection, priests and ministers across the country dealt with the suicide of 39 members of a cult who expected to be brought back to life aboard a U.F.O. they thought was hidden behind the Hale-Bopp comet. The adherents of the Heaven's Gate cult were remembered directly and indirectly in Easter services throughout the country. Attending church in Cincinnati was Donald McCurdy, the brother of one of the victims, Yvonne McCurdy-Hill. A12
 
The journey of a Durango, Colo., real estate developer to become Heaven's Gate's "Brother Logan" illustrates how the straightest of arrows can fall into a cult. A12
 
Winds Hurt 40 at Space Center
With little warning, a fierce storm whipped through the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, injuring about 40 tourists and causing minor damage to the launching site, a NASA spokesman said. Winds gusting up to 52 miles per hour hurled rocks and debris against three double-decker tourist buses, shattering windows and showering glass on the occupants, said Joel Wells, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (Reuters)

Robbers Shoot Bank Teller
Two bank robbers shot a teller and got away with $20,000 at a Bank of America branch in Danville, Calif., the police said. The robbers fired a warning shot before ordering customers to lie on the floor, a police sergeant said.They then ordered two clerks to take them into the vault to try to open the safe and deposit boxes. While one robber was in the vault, the other grabbed bills from cash drawers, the sergeant said. When the clerk could not get the safe and deposit boxes open fast enough, one of the thieves shot the teller in the arm, but did not seriously hurt him. The pair got away in a brown BMW. (AP)
 
2 Boys Charged in Fatal Beating
Two teen-agers were arrested in the beating death of a 62-year-old Sacramento man at a train station, the police said. The suspects, both 13 years old, were charged with murder and robbery in the death of the man, John Yee, who had been beaten at a North Sacramento station, the authorities said. Officers said they were looking for a third suspect in the beating of Mr. Yee, who died on Friday. Mr. Yee was waiting for a train when a man in his early 30's began encouraging two boys to attack, the authorities said. Mr. Yee was hit, kicked and stomped. (AP)

A Bronx woman was charged with murder after taking her five-year-old son -- his small, bruised body already lifeless from weeks of starvation and abuse -- to Union Hospital, city officials said. The woman, Joycelyn Bennett, 27, is accused of killing her son, Daytwon, who along with his four siblings had been in and out of foster care for several years. The other children were found unharmed.

Domestic Danger for Women
More women in New York City are killed by their husbands or boyfriends than in robberies, sexual assaults, drug violence, random attacks or any other crime in cases for which the motive is known. That conclusion, long suspected by experts on family violence and criminal justice, has been confirmed by a study of every woman killed in the city over five years, one of the first studies of its kind in the country.

Celebration, in Many Ways
Over the years, New York City's Easter parade has become a commingling of protesters and those who don outlandish costumes, and this year's was no exception. Many New Yorkers appeared to be in a good mood for the holiday, as a spring sun momentarily burned away winter. At the Hyo Shin Bible Presbyterian Church in Queens, parishioners clutching Korean-English hymnals gathered to hear about the rebuilding of their church, which had been destroyed in a gas explosion in September.

But at St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens, where 2,200 people were attending Mass, a masked man went down to the basement, menaced a priest with what he said was a gun and stole more than $600 in donations that had been collected during Holy Week. B3

Market Drop: Blip or Bear?
The stock market has fallen into a dizzying stupor, experiencing its biggest declines since last summer, after the Dow Jones industrials rose to more than 7,000 points earlier this year.

HEADLINE: Guiding Journeys Through Ancient Text

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Mass., March 26

 BODY:
The rabbi was heading east on the Massachusetts Turnpike, a stack of Torahs in his back seat, the full moon out his window. It was three weeks before Passover, and he was talking about the Passover story: the meaning of the exodus from Egypt, the four questions, the importance of joy.
"The Hebrew word mitzraim is translated into English as Egypt," the rabbi, Alan Ullman, was saying as the signposts of the Boston suburbs beckoned, Home Depot, Ski Market, McDonald's. "The root of mitzraim is the Hebrew word, tsar, which means narrow." Ancient Egypt, he said, was for the Israelites a spiritually narrow place, and by extension, mitzraim today can mean any spiritually narrow place. "In Egypt, one can't even find God. One is worshiping a false God. Passover is about leaving Egypt." 
 Rabbi Ullman, who lives in Worcester, Mass., has 48,000 miles on his blue 1995 Saturn. He does not have a traditional congregation. For seven years, he has been a rarity: a wandering rabbi, traveling around New England, leading Torah study groups in synagogues, Unitarian churches and people's homes. Together the rabbi and his students, who are non-Jews as well as Jews, wrestle with the ancient text, interpreting it as a metaphorical map for the journey through contemporary life.
In one group, an examination of Exodus, Chapter 5, where Moses tells Pharaoh to let the people go, led to a conversation about power. "Moses knows Pharaoh has the economic, political and military power," Rabbi Ullman said, recalling the discussion. "But Moses knows that there is another kind of power, the power of the spirit."
Rabbi Ullman, whose schedule allows him plenty of time with his wife, Melanie, and children Lara, 12, and Noah, 8, recalled that one woman in the group talked about how her husband, a corporate executive, had spent two weeks away from home on a project with 18 other men from his company. With two days off before the next project, the company made it clear that it preferred that the men not fly home for the weekend.
"All but one of them were afraid to go home," Rabbi Ullmansaid. "Here were all these high-level corporate executives who one would think had power, and in fact they're acting like Israelites who are making bricks in Egypt. We talked about what does it mean to have the spiritual wherewithal to say, 'I'm going home.'?"
On this night, the rabbi, in jeans, a flannel shirt and running shoes, was on his way to Lexington, where 12 people were meeting; the night before he had been in a Wellesley synagogue, with 14 people.
The Lexington meeting was at the home of George Foote, a lawyer, and his wife, Susan, a high school librarian. "The Torah has messages that can guide us here and now," Mrs. Foote said. "But you have to take the time to stop and know what's in it."
The group, which includes a surgeon, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a social worker and an engineer, talked about Passover. Leaving Egypt, the rabbi said, is about spiritual freedom. In order to leave, he said, one has to recognize that Egypt is spiritually dead.
One woman in the group related the story of Passover to her marriage, and subsequent divorce. "I had to see what was dead," she said.
Everyone has an "Egypt," Rabbi Ullman said afterward. For him, in his 20's, it was working as a senior auditor in a bank in California. "It was not just the bank," he said. "It was where I was in the bank. I knew people when I was at the bank who were very spiritual people and very good people. Of course, the bank has its regimen. I was a person who was giving that too much power."
He found satisfaction in his work outside the bank, teaching in the religious school of a congregation in San Bernardino, Calif. Eventually, he left the bank, and enrolled at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, the Reform movement's seminary.
He became an assistant rabbi at a synagogue in Worcester. For him, the pulpit meant too many administrative demands, and he left nine years ago to open a religious school in his house, which he still runs. Teaching gives him joy, he said.
The discussion had turned to joy the night before in Wellesley. The group had been talking about the four questions. The rabbi suggested that the fourth question, about why people recline at the Passover meal, relates to the capacity to "rest in the blessing," to "rescue joy."
One woman in the group, a lawyer, volunteered: "Joy is very hard. If you ask me the last time I felt joy I'd have to really think about it."
In his car, reflecting upon the discussion, Rabbi Ullman recalled a summer night in Jerusalem 12 years ago. He was sitting on the rooftop of a youth hostel with friends. "It was a gorgeous Jerusalem night," he said. "The scent of the city was in the air. You could feel the air on your skin. We were good friends who hadn't seen each other in a year, we had this exquisite orange vodka from Russia, and we were talking Torah." That, he said, was joy.

The Bell Tolls for Oslo

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The Arab-Israeli peace process is in such dire straits today because for the first time it is threatened not by extremists, but by the very leaders who are supposed to be doing the negotiating. The enemies are all inside the tent, and they are Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasir Arafat, Bill Clinton and just about every Arab leader.
Thanks to these gentlemen, the core bargain struck at Oslo is being trashed. That bargain stipulated that at the end of the Oslo road the Palestinians would get a homeland in most of the West Bank and Gaza, and Israelis would get the security and normalcy they have craved. That bargain also implied that despite the huge advantage in power Israel holds over Palestinians, Israelis would not undertake unilateral acts on issues, like Jerusalem or settlements, that are reserved for the final-status negotiations. Unfortunately, today Israelis no longer feel they're getting security and Palestinians have lost all confidence that they'll get anything near a state. 
 Why? First of all, Mr. Netanyahu thinks he can have a politically painless peace process, in which he makes a concession in Hebron one day but then, so that there will be no political pain, starts building in a disputed area of Jerusalem the next day, to appease some right-wing followers. Yitzhak Rabin was no less committed than Mr. Netanyahu to Israel's right to build in East Jerusalem. But Mr. Rabin tried to avoid doing so in provocative cases so as not to disrupt his higher goal of bringing the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end. He knew Israel controlled Jerusalem. He didn't need to prove it over and over. Not only does Mr. Netanyahu engage in provocative building, but he does so without even saying to Mr. Arafat first: "Look Yasir, we're partners. I have to do this to shore up my political base. But what can I give you to get us through this?" Instead, Mr. Netanyahu embarrassed Mr. Arafat, and then had the nerve to complain that Mr. Arafat wouldn't take his phone calls. That's flat-out dishonest.
Still, however maladroitly Mr. Netanyahu handled the Jerusalem case, he did withdraw from Hebron a month earlier. That was a hard thing and the Arab leaders (except King Hussein) have done nothing -- zero -- hard in return to give Mr. Netanyahu some credit. That's flat-out pathetic.
As for Mr. Arafat, he responded to Mr. Netanyahu's provocation in Jerusalem with his usual one-two punch -- terrorism, followed by a trip far, far away to Bangladesh. There can be no place for terrorism in this process. None. Israelis will not tolerate a situation in which every bump in the road is greeted with a suicide bomb. But let's not forget one thing: The reason Israel's security chiefs warned Mr. Netanyahu that his actions in Jerusalem could trigger violence was because they understood that the Palestinians, having no other means to stop Israeli bulldozers, would resort to terrorism.
I still believe that a majority of Israelis feel Oslo brought many benefits. It has extracted Israel from a demoralizing occupation in Gaza. It has established cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security services, albeit rocky at times. It has delivered a peace treaty with Jordan and trade with many countries that once shunned Israel, contributing to Israel's economic boom.
But none of this will count if the core bargain is not restored -- if Israelis don't get security and the Palestinians a homeland. And that core bargain certainly can't be restored if Mr. Netanyahu thinks he can play peacemaker one day and provocateur the next. And it certainly can't be restored if the Palestinians behave as if bulldozers and suicide bombers are moral equivalents.
The Oslo bargain also can't be restored unless Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Albright start acting as the reality principle for the parties, speaking out loudly and clearly -- not with the mumbo-jumbo they've been using to avoid offending anyone.
Mr. President, you had it easy the first four years. You could just walk behind Mr. Rabin, let him take all the political flak while you provided the catering and got the benefits. Well, those days are over. Yitzhak Rabin was your friend. He died for this process and so far you haven't been willing to take even an ounce of political heat to keep it alive. If Oslo goes down, Mr. President, your name will also be on the death certificate. Be sure of that. If you want to be remembered as a peacemaker, then you too have to pay. Everybody pays, or this is the end.

HEADLINE: Ban Expiring, Haitians Fear Return of the Tontons Macoute

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Ten years ago, Haiti approved a new Constitution prohibiting officials of the recently deposed Duvalier family dictatorship from seeking public office. But that ban is expiring, and the prospect that former leaders of the Tontons Macoute may soon re-enter public life has the Haitian Government scrambling to take countermeasures.
An old lawsuit against members of the Duvalier family and their entourage has been revived, and President Rene Preval has warned of a renewed threat from the Tontons Macoute, the Duvaliers' dreaded private security force, even as his aides seek to reassure the population that they have nothing to fear. 
 The Duvalier family first took power here in 1957, when Francois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc, was elected President and initiated a period of brutal and corrupt rule that lasted three decades. Early in 1986, Jean-Claude Duvalier, the dictator's son, known as Baby Doc, was overthrown in a popular rebellion and fled to France with a large chunk of the state treasury.
On March 29, 1987, a Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution denying political rights for a decade to "any person well-known for having been by his excessive zeal one of the architects of the dictatorship." The 10-year ban also applied to all those "denounced by public outcry for having inflicted torture on political prisoners" or "for having committed political assassinations."
For several weeks now, the country has been awash with nervous rumors that Jean-Claude Duvalier himself plans to come back to Haiti. Diplomats here say that is extremely unlikely: he still faces criminal charges here.
Nevertheless, Mr. Duvalier's former father-in-law, Ernest Bennett, returned recently. At a restaurant in the upper-class suburb of Petionville, Mr. Bennett, who used his ties to the Duvaliers to reap a fortune, even led a group of diners in cheers of "Long Live Duvalier!"
Mr. Bennett is reported to have left Haiti in late February, after the Government filed a suit against Mr. Bennett, his daughter Michele (now estranged from the former dictator), and 36 other former officials and sympathizers of the Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship, charging that they had misappropriated public funds.
"This came up because these guys started coming back, which I thought was pretty brazen," said Ira Kurzban, an American lawyer who represents the Haitian Government in efforts to recover assets the Duvaliers sent abroad. "There was no sense of anyone being brought to justice who was a figure in any of this, which is why the Bennett suit is important."
The Haitian Government, which estimates that the Duvaliers and their associates pilfered more than $500 million from the treasury during their last five years in power, has already won judgments of $11 million against the Duvalier family in American courts. They have been able to retrieve little of that, though Mr. Kurzban said the Government expected to take possession soon of an apartment of Michele Bennett's on the East Side of Manhattan.
Whether pro-Duvalier forces still represent a threat to public security and political stability here, however, is a subject of considerable debate. In a recent speech, Mr. Preval evoked the specter of their return to rally support for his Government and its unpopular policies.
"We have a police force that is young, short of equipment and beleaguered," Mr. Preval said. "If you don't help them, the Tontons Macoute, who are watching from the sidelines, will stage a coup d'etat, just as they did in 1991, which will force us to go into hiding."
But some of Mr. Preval's supporters argue that it is important not to overstate the possibility of a resurgence of the Tontons Macoute.
"As a political force, they are completely finished," said Gerard Pierre-Charles, leader of the Lavalas Political Organization, the center-left political party that has the largest bloc in the Haitian Parliament. "The Duvalierists have no leadership, no ideology and no army."
The director of the United Nations mission here, Enrique ter Horst, described the neo-Duvalierists as "a spent force" politically. But it does not necessarily follow, he cautioned, that they no longer constitute a security threat.
"There are still people from that part of the political spectrum who do meet and have dreams of organizing a coup d'etat, which only shows how gravely they are misinterpreting the new political situation," Mr. ter Horst said.
Still, some public officials said that they had begun to detect a certain nostalgia for the Duvalier era among groups dismayed by the lack of economic growth since democracy was restored in 1994.
"The population is so disappointed by the current rulers of the country that some of them say, 'It wasn't so bad when we had a dictatorship,' " said Jean-Robert Sabalat, a Foreign Minister under President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who is now a member of the Senate.
"After the Macoutes were defeated, they dispersed throughout the country," he said. "But when they see misery growing and disagreement among the people in power, they get more confidence in themselves and say, 'The people who used to criticize us are doing worse, so why don't we come up again?' "

Muslim Wins $3 Million In Suit Over Dismissal

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: FREMONT, Calif., March 30

 BODY:
A former United Airlines worker who claimed he was discriminated against because of his Muslim beliefs and then dismissed for complaining has been awarded nearly $3 million in a wrongful termination suit.
An Alameda County jury ruled for Ahmad Abu-Aziz on Friday after a two-week trial. United said it would appeal. Mr. Abu-Aziz, a 29-year-old Jordanian who is a permanent resident of the United States, won $2.67 million in punitive damages, $246,000 in economic damages and $50,000 for emotional distress. 
 He began working for United as a customer service agent at Oakland International Airport in 1994. He said fellow workers made anti-Muslim and anti-Arab comments and that he got unfair work assignments.
After he complained to his supervisors, he was dismissed because co-workers accused him of drinking and stealing company property, both of which he denied. United officials said they had five witnesses.

HEADLINE: CUNY Critics Should Blame Themselves

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The spate of New York politicians imputing slow progress and scant success to City University of New York students smacks of "blame the victim" (news article, March 27). The carpers should blame themselves for raising tuition while slashing financial aid: a double whammy that forces more students to work longer at outside jobs with less time for study. 
 The politicians have also been slashing away at teachers and books, making it harder for students to complete their education in a timely and adequate manner. Faced with such obstacles, the students are to be commended for their commitment to excellence. Two from my own department have just won full graduate fellowships to Harvard. Others are finishing graduate study at Columbia and Yale.
In spite of political fashion, disinvestment in education is shortsighted. Educated citizens and producers will be essential for New York to keep pace in the new century as an economic and cultural player. Nor will a narrow technological training suffice. I have been hearing from business executives that new recruits must be versed in analytical reading, critical thinking and effective communication -- the meat of liberal arts.
Politicians who complain of falling standards should ask whether they themselves meet the standard of support for the liberal education our future requires.

HEADLINE: Women's Killers Are Very Often Their Partners, A Study Finds

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
More women in New York City are killed by their husbands or boyfriends than in robberies, disputes, sexual assaults, drug violence, random attacks or any other crime in cases where the relationship between the murderer and victim is known.
That conclusion, long suspected by family violence and criminal justice experts, has been confirmed by a study of every woman killed in New York City over five years, one of the first studies of its kind in the country. 
 To piece together a portrait of these women, researchers from the New York City Department of Health spent nine months teasing clues out of the dispassionate documents that are the residue of murder: autopsy findings, crime scene reports, witness statements, toxicological and sexual assault tests, ballistics reports, and descriptions of stab wounds and strangulation marks.
For a study that is yet to be released, researchers looked at files on each of the 1,156 women age 16 and over killed in New York City from 1990 through 1994. In only 484 murders could investigators determine the killer's relationship to the victim -- friend, stranger, acquaintance or relative. From that narrower pool, researchers learned that nearly half of the women were killed by current or former husbands or boyfriends, a much higher proportion than expected. Nationally, the figure is 40 percent, compared with 6 percent of men who were killed by wives or girlfriends.
The portrait derived from the homicide files is telling in its details of how the women lived and graphic in the specifics of how they died. More than half the women killed in the city during those years died in private homes, usually their own. In the majority of the cases in which the killer was identified, the murderers were people they knew.
When they were killed by their husbands, one-third of the time the women appeared to be trying to end the relationships. In one-quarter of the cases where husbands or boyfriends were the killers, children were also killed or injured, or they watched the murders or found their mothers' bodies.
And, unlike men, who are killed most often by guns, women "are very likely to be punched and hit and burned and thrown out of windows," said the leader of the study, Dr. Susan A. Wilt, the director of epidemiology and surveillance for the Health Department's injury and prevention program.
"We were surprised by the degree to which some of these murders just spoke of enormous rage. Some women were stabbed and also strangled," she said. "Some women were beaten, and they weren't dead yet, so they were thrown out of the window."
"What's very clear is that female homicides are so different from male homicides," Dr. Wilt added, noting that her research staff attended monthly support group sessions and deliberately avoided looking at gruesome autopsy photographs while studying these deaths.
Understanding the women's deaths, city health officials say, will help map a plan for hospitals, law enforcement officials, clinics and community organizations to identify and protect women at risk.
The study also provides concrete information at a time when domestic violence policy is a heated issue, with victims' advocates pressuring city and state officials for more help for battered women and more serious penalties for their batterers.
"This study shows that to protect women from the threat of homicide we have to develop different strategies," said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the New York City Health Commissioner.
"On-the-street police strength is not effective when the majority of women are killed in an individual's home," Dr. Hamburg said. "Health care providers should be trying to identify women who are at risk for domestic violence because often women do have early contact with the medical system. And we need to reexamine laws that apply to domestic violence."
Two clear patterns that emerged were particularly worrisome to the researchers.
Two-thirds of the domestic violence killings were in the poorest boroughs, the Bronx and Brooklyn, and three-quarters of the women killed by husbands and boyfriends were black or Hispanic. These findings run counter to the long-held public impression that "domestic violence knows no class and color boundaries," said Dr. Jeff Fagan, director of the Center for Violence, Research and Prevention at Columbia University's School of Public Health.
"The myth of the classlessness of domestic violence is one that has persisted since the 1960's," Dr. Fagan said. "The truth is, it is a problem of poverty, associated with other characteristics like low marriage rates, high unemployment and social problems. Whatever we've done to prevent domestic violence has been more effective for white women and we have to figure out how to make it apply to poor women in poor areas."
Also surprising was that in nearly one-third of the cases where husbands and boyfriends killed women, the men also tried to kill themselves.
"Now, when a man comes into a psych clinic and acts like he's suicidal, we should know to screen him to see if he has a family and what kind of relationship it is," Dr. Wilt said. "And women who come into an emergency room because they get hurt by their intimate partners should be made aware of the risk to children in the house."
The fact that one-third of the women killed by their husbands were still married but not living with them suggested to Dr. Wilt that these women were trying to leave the relationships at the time of their deaths.
"At a certain moment when a relationship unravels, it really gets very volatile and dangerous," said Dr. Richard Gelles, director of the Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode Island.
Over all, many fewer women are killed than men -- during the five years in the study, the proportion was nearly seven to one. As total crime decreased in those years, murders of women decreased also, but not as sharply as those of men. At the same time, the number of domestic violence murders increased slightly.
Public health officials worry that the incidence of domestic violence has not dropped as precipitously as the overall crime rate in the past few years following the five-year period of study. And they are finding that domestic violence rates are not responding to the most common crime fighting techniques.
"Intimate violence is not amenable to community policing or the death penalty," Dr. Gelles said. "If you crack down on crack cocaine, you don't affect the domestic homicide rate."
Out of the files and forms and documents used in the study sprang vivid pictures of how some of the women met their deaths.
A 35-year-old woman in Brooklyn was stabbed 12 times with a hunting knife and bludgeoned with a baseball bat by her boyfriend in a case described as "very typical" by Dr. Wilt, who said confidentiality concerns kept her from providing names or identifying details of the victims. The Brooklyn women's boyfriend killed her on a night he had come home drinking and accused her of having an affair. He also stabbed the woman's sister, who survived.
In another typical domestic violence case, Dr. Wilt said, a 28-year-old woman in the Bronx was killed by her live-in boyfriend after they argued about her leaving him. Neighbors said that the boyfriend had abused the woman before and that there was a protection order barring him from seeing her. The boyfriend hit the woman in the face, shot her with a .38 caliber handgun and then shot himself in the head. When the police arrived, they found two children, 5 and 7, in the home with the bodies.
The researchers also looked, of course, at the highly publicized murder cases of those five years, but said that many of them were not typical. Those included the deaths of 87 clubgoers (31 women, 56 men) in the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx in 1990, which was set on fire by the ex-boyfriend of an employee. And the 1993 murder of Danielle Almonor, a Federal probation officer shot in the back of her head by her estranged husband at the Brooklyn Family Courthouse while she was waiting for their case to be called.
Other unusual cases were the deaths of a woman whose doctor was accused of malpractice and a 16-year-old girl who died of AIDS after being infected through childhood sexual abuse.
Of the 1,156 women killed in New York over the five-year period, more than half were black, even though only one-quarter of the city's female population is black. Sixteen percent of the victims were white, although they make up nearly half the city's female population. And 29 percent of the victims were Hispanic, about the same as their proportion of all women in the city.
Black women were likely to be younger, in their 20's or 30's, and to live in poorer neighborhoods. White women were likely to be older (nearly half were over 50).
Almost one-third of all the murders of women were in the Bronx, even though only 16 percent of the city's women live in there.
Sixty-eight women were killed by their children, grandchildren or other family members who were not husbands or boyfriends. Those murders tended to be more brutal than "intimate partner" murders and other killings because women were more likely to be stabbed -- and stabbed more than 10 times.
Domestic violence victims were much less likely to be using cocaine, marijuana or other illegal drugs than other women who were killed. But they were just as likely to be drinking. Dr. Gelles said if a woman in a troubled relationship used alcohol to help her cope, she would be "less able to perceive a threat, more vulnerable to a lethal assault."
Still to be studied, Dr. Wilt said, was whether these victims had sought help from hospitals, the police or other places.
"We're very interested to know," she said, "if women didn't avail themselves of the system, or if the system doesn't work, or if the system can't save them at all."

HEADLINE: In Albany, Budget Lateness Is a Form of Realism

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 30

 BODY:
This Tuesday, barring a miracle, New York State will begin a new fiscal year without a budget in place for the 13th consecutive year and for the 19th time in 23 years -- a record unrivaled in the nation and quite possibly the world.
To any close watcher of the Albany budget game, this year's failure no doubt seems strikingly, perhaps depressingly familiar, with its bickering over projected revenues and costs, its partisan warfare, its personal animosity among negotiators. 
 Yet in its very sameness, many fiscal monitors point out, this year's impasse is in its own way extraordinary, for this reason: Like Dorian Gray, it has managed to resemble impasses through the decades, even though the world around it has undergone major political and economic changes.
A Democratic governor was unseated by a Republican. Years of dark recession have given way to years of Wall Street prosperity. Perennial deficits have been replaced by annual surpluses. (This year's surplus is $1.7 billion.) Welfare caseloads are consistently falling, not rising.
The political ground has rumbled, rattled and shifted beneath Albany, yet the budget is once again late. It is as if the local political culture dictates a hard and fast rule that no matter what the economic circumstances or the political climate, the budget must forever be enacted after the legal deadline of April 1.
"New York is in a category all by itself," said Arturo Perez, a specialist on state budgets for the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver. "Other states have late budgets typically only in recession years. In good times and bad times, New York is late."
So, the question inevitably arises: Why? What makes New York's Legislature constitutionally unable to accomplish its most basic function in a timely manner? A few reasons stand out:
*The negative consequences of the late budget are not noticed by most people. School districts, state contractors and local governments often take out interest-bearing loans to make up for late state payments when the budget is overdue, driving up overall costs by tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But most people do not feel such costs because they are dispersed throughout a $66 billion budget.
As a result, many legislators contend that holding out for improvements to the budget plays better back home than getting it done on time. "There is a track record that nothing truly bad happens from a late budget," said Donald J. Boyd, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. "So why would you agree to a budget that you think has the wrong policies?"
*Voters rarely hold legislators or governors responsible for late budgets. Last year, when the budget was enacted a record 104 days late, all but 3 of the more than 145 incumbents who sought re-election won their races -- a re-election rate of better than 97 percent.
"The average voter doesn't make the late budget an issue," said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat. "The public has simply come to accept this."
*Though being a legislator is theoretically a part-time job, more legislators than ever treat it as full-time work. That means they don't have other jobs tugging at them to get home to by May or June. So if the budget fight drags into July, well, they're just doing their jobs.
"Because members are full-time they don't feel pressure to leave," said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican. "You can sense it around the place."
*As the power and size of state government have expanded over the years, the budget has become a much more complicated document than it was 25, 15 or even 10 years ago. Total state spending now stands at $66 billion, compared with $11 billion in 1977. There is more policy tied into the budget than ever, and programs for welfare, education, health care and prisons have grown and diversified through the years.
The people most responsible for negotiating the budget -- the Governor and his budget director, the Senate majority leader and Speaker of the Assembly -- offer few solutions or apologies for the problem. As much as anything, they sound resigned to it.
"It has become a cultural thing," said Patricia A. Woodworth, the Governor's budget director. "I don't know why it started 13 or 14 years ago. But once you cross that threshold, it's very hard to go back."
Mr. Silver unapologetically acknowledges that he thinks it serves his members' political needs to wait for the best deal possible. "While I would prefer things in a timely fashion, I think fairness is of equal importance," he said. "I am not going to sell out the working-class people or children or elderly of this state, just because the media or some part of the public says you have an obligation to have a budget on April 1."
The most repentant of the group is Mr. Bruno, who contends Senate Republicans tend to represent more conservative voters who care more deeply about budget timeliness. He has repeatedly pushed for legislation that would bring greater pressure on the Legislature to enact budgets on time, but to no avail.
"April 1 doesn't mean a thing to anybody," he said. "You might as well as say Christmas. It's just an accepted kind of thing. It gets to be almost humorous. I talked about an April 1 budget to one group, and everybody started laughing."
But even if the lateness has become accepted in Albany, many political analysts warn that it has a long-term, corrosive affect on the public's image of state government.
"It's delegitimizing to have late budgets," said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University at New Paltz. "All this government bashing today is based on the fact that government doesn't work. That we're not only paying a lot, but that when we pay a lot, we don't get what we pay for. Government as an institution has lost support in the culture for these very reasons."

HEADLINE: In His Daughter's Memory;
Grieving Father's 14-Year Crusade Helps Air Crash Victims

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
The 75-year-old retired businessman with a horseshoe of white hair climbed into the witness stand in a Long Island courtroom this month, to face Korean Air Lines in a lawsuit over his daughter's death. It had taken him 14 years to get there.
In 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 strayed into Soviet airspace and was shot down by a Soviet fighter pilot. All 269 aboard died, among them Alice Ephraimson-Abt, a 23-year-old graduate student in Asian studies from Saddle River, N.J.
Her father, Hans Ephraimson-Abt, endured the legal marathon that follows international aviation crashes, but not just for his benefit. As chairman of the American K.A.L. 007 association, the first such large-scale crash victims' group, he took on Congress and the airline industry, helping to win victories to insure that families of future victims will be compensated swiftly and fairly, and that their voices will be heard in debates over aviation policy.
Mr. Ephraimson, as he is called, pursued three Presidential administrations for information about one of the most notorious Cold War attacks. Families of passengers who had died on Pan Am 103, Valujet 592, and T.W.A. 800 considered his group a model for their own organizations.
Two victories have come in the last six months. In November, Congress ordered the National Transportation Safety Board to communicate with and care for families of victims. In the past, an airline assumed that role. Then, in February, United States airlines agreed to increase the base compensation customarily made to families of victims and to lower the barriers preventing speedy resolution of lawsuits.
Mr. Ephraimson's legal battle was protracted because his daughter had been on an international flight. A longstanding international aviation treaty limits a carrier's damages to $75,000 per passenger, unless the family proves that the airline's misconduct was willful. That criminal-like standard has been overcome less than a dozen times.
Under the February agreement that Mr. Ephraimson helped to broker, the base payment by airlines involved in future crashes will increase to $139,000. Families seeking more money will no longer have to prove willful misconduct. Instead, the burden will be on the airline to show it was not negligent.
Department of Transportation officials and industry leaders have publicly thanked Mr. Ephraimson. "Because he has tenacity and unbelievable patience, he has become terrifically effective," said Jeffrey N. Shane, a former assistant secretary of transportation. "And he made us better public servants. What a monument to a daughter."

A Gentle, Cheerful Man, A Relentless Fighter
For the first six years after Flight 007 went down, lawyers in the United States for 108 victims' families worked to show that Korean Air Lines had willfully erred because the plane, en route to Seoul, had gone off course three minutes after leaving Anchorage.
Information about the disaster was scant, as East and West traded accusations of espionage. No government raised the plane, which lies in 574 feet of international water off the coast of Sakhalin Island. Bodies were never recovered.
Forgotten in the furious political posturing were the victims' survivors. Gradually, the American families stumbled toward one another. If their cause was to remain alive in courts and diplomatic circles, "we would have to do it ourselves," said Mr. Ephraimson, who became the group's chairman in 1985.
He was a logical choice, because he had the temperament and financial means for a siege. Although his family home and fortune in Berlin had been plundered by the Nazis, he re-established himself here as an adviser to the West German Consulate General, developing a cheerful but gently relentless style of diplomacy. Later, he became an international business consultant. Divorced since the 1970's, he settled in Saddle River, where he raised two daughters and a son, and cared for his parents.
Accustomed to fussing over others, he became the Flight 007 families' one-man research librarian, therapist, cheerleader and unofficial grandfather. Every month, he would send typewritten newsletters as long as 50 pages to those who could not travel to the meetings in one family's East Side Manhattan apartment.
There, a core group of 20 would peruse the agenda Mr. Ephraimson had prepared. Which lawmakers could they write? How could they get documents declassified?
He encouraged members to talk about grief, money woes, legal problems. "Men in the legal profession tended to intimidate the widows and patronize them," recalled Renay Bevins, whose husband was on the plane. "So Hans would say to us: 'Why don't you ask your attorney this or that?' as if to say, 'We're really going to blow their socks off!' "
Always dressed in three-piece suits, Mr. Ephraimson, who is fluent in three languages and retains such Old World mannerisms as hand-kissing, proved a master at keeping the group on track, its members said.
Since 1983, he has traveled to Washington more than 250 times. Scarcely 5 foot 3, with a shiny pate, bright blue eyes and a German accent, he charmed his way into offices by memorizing the birthdays of dozens of receptionists, eventually meeting with 149 officials in the State Department alone.
"Hans would often open meetings with either a small but symbolic gift for someone or an announcement that the day happened to be an anniversary of a benchmark in his group's litigation," said Anne McNamara, general counsel to American Airlines. "Or that we should dedicate our work today to one family, 'so that for them we will have a good result.' "
By 1989, a Federal jury in Washington, before which 108 cases had been consolidated, found Korean Air Lines liable for willful misconduct; two years later, a Federal appeals court agreed. It was now eight years after the plane went down. No American plaintiffs had yet received any money. Finally, it seemed as if the plaintiffs would be able to be compensated, through settlements and trials, for more than $75,000.

A Listener Who Can Calm
Over the years, Mr. Ephraimson advised other families afflicted by air disasters about forming groups. But he found his legislative soul mate in M. Victoria Cummock, whose husband died in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Ms. Cummock, tall, brash and given to all-American hyperbole, towered over Mr. Ephraimson, the epitome of quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
They wanted to expand carrier liability and to make sure that in the aftermath of an air disaster, families would be quickly informed. The two loped through the halls of Congress, testified before subcommittees, worked on national aviation commissions, and popped up, often uninvited, at industry conferences.
Some airline executives would sneer at them; many lawyers who sue airlines considered them naive meddlers.
"Hans has somehow ingratiated himself with the Government so they accept him as a representative of victims' families," said Lee Kreindler, who represented many victims of Pan Am 103 and K.A.L. 007. "But he's not qualified: he's not a lawyer and he doesn't really understand the cases."
This July, at the invitation of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents, the pair spent two weeks on Long Island helping families of passengers who had been on T.W.A. 800. Over the summer, his phone bill would include more than a thousand calls he made on behalf of the T.W.A. families.
"Hans was a very calming influence for the European families," said Peter Goelz, a top official at the safety board, who relied on Mr. Ephraimson's fluent French. "He would just sit down at a table and introduce himself. He's a great listener and the most unruffled guy: he has an amazing capacity to listen to anger and handle it."

A President Lends a Hand
Meanwhile, Flight 007 trials started and stopped, as the airline appealed jury verdicts around the country. Eventually, the United States Supreme Court wrote two opinions on the litigation.
Changing political winds also affected the cases. With the end of the Cold War, thousands of Soviet archives were made public. Buried in the vaults were Flight 007's data recorders. Unknown to the world, they had been retrieved by Soviet divers six weeks after the plane crashed.
Mr. Ephraimson began plucking at a hundred diplomatic elbows: Four Senators wrote to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President. In October 1992, Mr. Ephraimson led a delegation of families and State Department officials to Moscow, where the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, handed him transcripts from the plane's last half-hour.
In 1993, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, concluded that the downing had been caused by mechanical and human error by the Soviet Union and Korean Air Lines. The airline tried unsuccessfully to undo the willful misconduct verdict. Trials were halted for two years.
One struggle has been over the type of damages survivors can seek. In 1996, the United States Supreme Court said that because the plane crashed in international waters, admiralty law , which governs shipping, applied, not aviation law. And so compensation was limited to a victim's economic value, and claims for grief were precluded. Children and students like Alice Ephraimson-Abt are worth less than wage-earning spouses, because they had not yet started working. According to George N. Tompkins Jr., a lawyer for Korean Air Lines, Flight 007 settlements range from $75,000 to $10 million, for the family of a Korean businessman.

One Victory, But a Continuing Battle
About 16 families have still not been compensated. This month, Mr. Ephraimson's case finally went to trial. Years of rulings had left him clinging to a sliver of legal turf. He could not, for example, ask a jury to punish Korean Air Lines for the actions of its pilot or the years of delay.
All he could seek was the economic worth of Alice, his first-born daughter. When the plane crashed, she was traveling to China to study Mandarin, her career undecided. Mr. Ephraimson's lawyer since 1983, Gerald H. Baker, could ask the jury only for home care services that Alice might have rendered her elderly father.
Several months earlier, the airline had offered Mr. Ephraimson about $575,000, the amount offered by Pan Am for college students who died in the Lockerbie crash. Knowing that one student's family had won $1.2 million at trial, he refused.
He wanted to gamble on an untested legal theory. Judge Thomas C. Platt of Federal District Court in Uniondale, L.I., permitted him to raise a second question, unaddressed by the Supreme Court. The jury, the judge ruled, could decide if Alice had been conscious as the plane went down, and award damages for her suffering.
The trial lasted five days. After the verdict, Mr. Ephraimson rushed over to the jurors.
Because Mr. Ephraimson's mother died at 97 and he appeared vigorous, the jurors found that he would not require home care services until he was 82. They awarded him $135,000. Gravely, he thanked them for their optimism.
But they also said they believed that as Flight 007 spiraled down, Alice Ephraimson would have been conscious of her impending death for at least eight minutes. They awarded him an additional $2 million.
Crowding around him, jurors expressed their sorrow at his loss, and their fervent hope that with their verdict, his 14-year battle would be over.
Because of appeals and the unresolved question of pain-and-suffering compensation, he explained gently, the end is still years away.
