Why the Allied Victory Was Not a Sure Thing

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

WHY THE ALLIES WON
By Richard Overy
Illustrated. 396 pages. W. W. Norton. $29.95.
 The Allies won World War II because, compared with the Germans, the Japanese and the Italians, they were bigger economically, they had more people and their cause was just. Indeed, looked at from the perspective of the past half-century, the combined power of the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union inevitably had to prevail in World War II, even if the sacrifice, the cost and the time spent in doing so had to be enormous.
According to Richard Overy, it is true that greater size and greater population were indispensable elements in the Allied victory. But Mr. Overy, whose "Why the Allies Won" is a clear-sighted and very interesting explanation of the reasons for the victory, forcefully denies that there was anything inevitable about it. 
 Mr. Overy, a professor of modern history at King's College, London, and the author of several previous books on World War II, takes nothing for granted as he examines the question of victory from the ground up. Large powers have been defeated by smaller ones, he notes, even by technologically far less advanced ones (Vietnam over the United States, for example). Countries have fought multi-front wars and been victorious over adversaries that faaed enemies on one front only. And even in the case of World War II, the margin of victory was, Mr. Overy argues, precariously slender.
In showing why and how matters went as they did, Mr. Overy has written a learned, multifaceted piece of military history. With straightforward prose and an obvious command of the facts, he lays out the vast and complicated story of what the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenberg aptly called "deep war," war that involved every aspect of the societies that fought it.
Some of Mr. Overy's conclusions are unsurprising: that the Soviet victories at Stalingrad and Kursk were the major turning points in the war, for example. But Mr. Overy also takes issue with some commonly accepted views: that the bombing of Germany was an ineffective element in the Allied victory, for example. Mr. Overy contends that it was a crucial element, because it caused the downing of numerous German planes and most of Germany's best pilots, which was essential in giving the Allies air supremacy for the Normandy landings.
Mr. Overy devotes separate chapters to each of the main theaters of the war, from the struggle for control of the oceans to what Mr. Overy calls "the moral contest," the advantage brought to the Allies by the moral defensibility of their struggle. ("In every theater of the war," Mr. Overy writes, "the language of liberation and resistance was directed against the Axis.") But Mr. Overy's starting point is the nearly forgotten fact that early on in the conflict, after the first huge and stunning victories of both the Germans and the Japanese, the odds seemed to favor the Axis.
"On the face of things," he writes, "no rational man in early 1942 would have guessed at the eventual outcome of the war." The Germans had needed only a few short weeks to smash Poland and France, and they seemed to be making short work of the far larger Russia. Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor, occupied half of China and taken all of the British, French and American possessions in Southeast Asia. In this sense, Mr. Overy says, "Allied victory represented a remarkable reversal of fortune."
The most conventional of Mr. Overy's explanations concerns the war in the Pacific, where he recounts once again the often-told tale of the American naval victory at the Battle of Midway. The lesson, given overwhelming Japanese superiority in the number of warships, has to do with superior technology and tactics. In the Atlantic, victory involved finding a way to defeat German U-boats, which were sinking supply vessels faster than they could be built. Here, the key had to do with the development of accurate radar and of very long-range aircraft equipped with it.
Two essential factors made the landings in France in 1944 successful, Mr. Overy says. One was Allied supremacy in the air. The other was deception, the creation of a decoy landing force in England that effectively kept the 20 divisions of the German 15th Army, commanded by the legendary Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, out of the battle. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the Bpitish commander of the Normandy landings, told a subordinate that his "forces could well have been defeated, for all the Allies' advantages, if Rommel had been able to mount strong assaults from midday against forces still in a confused state on the beaches."
Mr. Overy uncovers some parodoxes, not the least of them that the Germans and the Japanese lost the war in part because of the very strength of their early victories. The Axis powers felt that they already had the correct formula, Mr. Overy argues, and they were therefore much less prone to alter their technology or their tactics as the situation changed. The Allies, by contrast, including even Stalin, understood that they had to correct many weaknesses. How, for example, did the Germans so quickly lose the overwhelming superiority they had in waging mechanized warfare? "The answer lay in imitation of German practice," Mr. Overy contends. "Given the extraordinary success of German arms, the Allied learning curve had to be short."
Among the most interesting of many interesting passages in "Why the Allies Won" are those examining the roles of the senior leaders. Hitler's early victories gave him a sense of infallibility that led him to try to manage the war from afar, often with disastrous consequences for the German armies. Stalin, contrary to the popular image of him, was more adaptable in this sense. He was a ruthless dictator who tried to command military action in the early phases of the war. But even though he bullied his subordinates so that "the threat of punishment or death hung over every mistake," Stalin learned to listen to his best commanders, most notably Georgi Zhukov.
"The victories at Stalingrad and Kursk were designed by military leaders, not by Stalin, who played a smaller role as the war went on," Mr. Overy writes. Hitler's role, by contrast, grew; and that, as Mr. Overy describes it, was an under appreciated element in his defeat.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Seeks World Bank Funds

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin appealed to Congress today for funds for the World Bank and other international financial institutions, saying United States participation in the lending agencies was at a crossroads.
He told lawmakers that United States credibility and leverage at the agencies had already been severely hurt by Republican-led cuts in contributions last year, at a time when Japan and Europe are aggressively trying to increase their influence. 
 In testimony to a House Appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Rubin said the Clinton Administration was trying to do more with less when it came to those institutions, but needed the help of Congress to achieve that.
The Administration is seeking Congressional backing for just under $1.48 billion for the multilateral lending agencies and debt reduction programs in the year starting Oct. 1.
But the proposal faces tough going with Republicans in Congress amid continuing efforts to cut the budget deficit.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of his planned testimony, Mr. Rubin rejected suggestions for cuts in economic aid to Israel and Egypt to pay for United States contributions to the international financial institutions.
He said the money would help the United States press ahead with its efforts to reform the lending agencies.

HEADLINE: Stripped of Themes, Yeltsin Wraps Himself in Flag

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 18

 BODY:
In his embattled bid for re-election, President Boris N. Yeltsin has raised the red flag. Literally.
Bowing to the growing nationalism and nostalgia for Soviet power fueling the Russian presidential elections, Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree this week restoring the red banner, embossed with a gold star instead of the Communist hammer and sickle, as a national emblem. 
 From now on, a Soviet-style flag will be unfurled alongside the Russian tricolor at patriotic ceremonies -- a symbol of Russia's deep ambivalence over its post-Communist identity.
President Clinton arrived in Russia today for a summit meeting that was planned in part to bolster Mr. Yeltsin's prestige before the elections, and he will be tiptoeing through a radically changed political landscape.
Resentment and suspicion of the West, particularly the United States, have never been higher since the cold war ended. Mr. Yeltsin's main challenger, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, is seeking to reach beyond orthodox party members and capture the nationalist vote by reviving a common enemy. Mr. Zyuganov calls it "a planetary regime of political, economic and military dictatorship of the West, headed by the U.S.A."
In his meetings with Mr. Clinton and other leaders of industrialized nations gathering in Moscow for a meeting on nuclear issues, Mr. Yeltsin will use all the pomp he can muster to suggest to Russian voters that he is greeting them as the head of a still great power, and not as a needy supplicant turning to the West for political and financial support.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Yeltsin is not beating the nationalist movement, he is joining it. After Communists won the parliamentary elections in December, his Cabinet was purged of all advisers viewed as "Westernizers." His new Foreign Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, complains repeatedly that Russia has been too supine. Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Zyuganov are both courting the Russian Orthodox Church.
As he campaigns across the country, Mr. Yeltsin is competing for the same voters who are flirting with his Communist and nationalist opponents, promising to restore part of the social safety net that was torn when Communism collapsed and seeking to wrap himself in symbols, not of democracy, but of Russia's imperial past.
The presidential regiment, the honor guard that once goose-stepped in front of Lenin's tomb, now serves in the Kremlin. Last month its elite soldiers, selected for their Slavic blond looks and six-foot stature, were refitted with pre-revolutionary dress uniforms. Heavy on gold braid and peacock colors, the uniforms were designed by the Bolshoi Theater's costume designers and are meant to evoke the martial splendor of imperial Russia.
The West is now an obsessive topic in Russian politics, much in the way American candidates were once defined by their attitude toward Communism. Politicians of all stripes talk about the "specialness" of Russia, of its intrinsic incompatibility with Western models of democracy.
Figures as disparate as Mr. Zyuganov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn use "sobornost" to describe the Russian condition. The word loosely translates as "spiritual unity" and connotes a collectivist mentality far removed from the individualism that drives people in the West.
It is a loaded phrase, conjuring the centuries-old battle between Westernizers and Slavophiles. That struggle still raged under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet President, whose policy of perestroika divided liberal Westernizers within his circle from the hard-liners. In political discourse, if not always in practice, the Slavophiles have won.
Irreconcilable differences remain between Communists and nationalists. Many nationalists will never forgive the Bolsheviks for their original sin -- killing the Czar. Mr. Solzhenitsyn recently called for an international tribunal to try the Communist Party for crimes against humanity. He suggested Nuremberg as a site.
But Mr. Zyuganov, who in 1991 recognized the need to replace the bankrupt ideology of Communism, has won the endorsement of many nationalist groups.
He exploits Russians' shock over the loss of empire, their anxiety about economic and spiritual decline, the invasion of American pop culture. His campaign speeches are buttressed not by Marxist-Leninist dogma, but alarms about a Western conspiracy to enslave the Slavic spirit.
And such sentiments, expressed more sedately, can be found at every level of Russian society. "There is now a shameful policy of concession to the West in our country," said Aleksei Petrov, 25, a journalism student at Moscow State University. "Russia should lead a policy of revival -- its economy, military and all sides of life. I am very much against democracy." He said he planned to vote for Mr. Yeltsin.
American political analysts and politicians, who like many Russians view Mr. Yeltsin as the lesser evil, express bafflement that there is no stronger democratic alternative. The liberal economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky is feted in the West as Russia's brightest prospect. He is running, but his chances of becoming one of the two candidates who advance to the second round are dim.
"Democrats like Yavlinsky have as much chance today of getting elected in Russia as Gus Hall had of becoming President of the United States," said Leonid Dobrokhotov, a former Gorbachev adviser who now teaches Russian history at Richmond College in Virginia.
Once a liberal reformer within the Communist Party, he now supports Mr. Zyuganov. "We Soviets understood this, why can't Americans understand the political reality here?" he said.
Anti-Western sentiment, fanned by the likes of Mr. Zyuganov and the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, is proving fertile ground.
Campaigning in Krasnodar on Tuesday, Mr. Yeltsin was booed when he tried to defend his economic reform policies. "The most difficult period is over," Mr. Yeltsin told an angry, jeering crowd of workers and veterans. "Those three or four years have passed, and we survived. I don't want you to lose hope."
But mainly, his is a message not of hope, but appeasement -- promising to raise pensions and wages to offset the inequities of the free-market system.
Mr. Yeltsin's economic reforms are increasingly viewed as an ill-fitting import, imposed by Western governments and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and not even with good intentions.
In a poll of 3,850 Russians that was sponsored by the Brookings Institution in Washington and conducted last December, 60 percent of the people interviewed said they believed that "the West is pursuing the goal of weakening Russia with its economic advice."
Such views can be found not only among elderly pensioners, but also among ambitious entrepreneurs.
"This Western assault, all these economic loans and business ventures, I think they are bad," said Lyudmila Chelnokova, 38, a former construction engineer in the town of Sergiyev Posad, who is now attending law school in the hopes of starting her own business. "We Russians have to develop ourselves, our own way."
The domination of Russian television by Mexican soap operas and knockoff game shows is a universal lament. Yet Russian nationalism is creeping onto Russian screens.
The Moscow Channel, which reaches 35 million viewers, features the weekly program "Russki Dom" ("Russian House"), a homespun talk show that showcases the Russian Orthodox faith and old Russian traditions. The show's creator, Aleksandr N. Krutov, a former member of the Soviet Parliament, described Russia as a "flowering meadow." He said: "Under democracy, they tried to turn Russia into an internationalist, cosmopolitan English lawn. It's not in our souls."
Russia's largest network, the state-controlled company ORT, which blatantly favors Mr. Yeltsin's candidacy, is also seeking to co-opt the nationalist movement. Last month ORT began broadcasting a new show by Aleksandr G. Nevzorov, a celebrity television journalist turned Member of Parliament who is known for his nationalist views.
His old show was banned after he supported the 1993 parliamentary insurrection against Mr. Yeltsin. His new program, "Dni" ("Days"), is veined with attacks on the West. In last week's episode, he asserted that organized crime leaders lobbied to make Russia a part of the European Union.
Many ordinary Russians seem more depressed than angry about their loss of status.
"I think it's something that Clinton even agreed to meet Yeltsin, that they haven't turned their backs on us," Lidiya K. Mogusheva, 45, a receptionist at a hairdressing salon in Sergiyev Posad, said mournfully. "We've become a third-world country -- nobody looks at us with respect any more. Why should they?"

HEADLINE: In an Amazon Cave, Light Is Shed on Early Americans

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
Digging in a cave near the Amazon River in Brazil, archeologists have found stone weapons, rock paintings and other traces of what may have been one of the earliest human cultures in the Americas. The discovery could revise thinking -- and stir more controversy -- about the lives and migrations of the first Americans.
The excavations yielded evidence that the ancient Americans who regularly camped in the cave led lives distinct from the big-game hunters who roamed the plains and hills of western North America at the same time, about 11,000 years ago. These Amazonian people lived off the fruits and nuts and small game of the tropical forest and took fish and turtles from the river. 
 Their paintings on the cave walls are thought to be the earliest reliably dated examples of art yet found in the Americas. The earliest European cave paintings are believed to be more than 30,000 years old.
The findings, being reported today in the journal Science, challenge the widely held assumption, based on knowledge of an ancient group of North Americans called the Clovis people, that the earliest Americans were primarily specialized big-game hunters who lived in open, temperate country and could not have sustained a culture in the humid tropics, where large animals were scarce. They had supposedly migrated across the Bering Straits from Asia in pursuit of mammoths and mastodons, settled in North America and then moved into South America, still a hunting society and living mainly in the highlands. These hunters were presumed to be the forerunners of all subsequent cultures in South America.
But a team of archeologists led by Dr. Anna C. Roosevelt of the Field Museum in Chicago and the University of Illinois reported radiocarbon dates of material in the Brazilian cave showing that early paleo-Indians there were contemporaries of the Clovis people with a distinctive foraging economy and different styles of stone weapons. These foragers used the cave as a campsite from 11,200 to 10,000 years ago, the scientists estimated.
The research seemed to confirm earlier evidence that the spread of paleo-Indians through the Americas was more complex than current theories would explain. It also seemed to lend weight to Dr. Roosevelt's thesis, based on two decades of excavations in Amazonia, that the tropical lowlands were not necessarily a barrier to early human cultures and that, indeed, substantial societies were living in Amazonia as early as or earlier than in the Andes.
In the Science article, Dr. Roosevelt and her colleagues wrote: "The existence of a distinct cultural tradition contemporary with the Clovis tradition, but more than 5,000 miles to the south, does not fit the notion that the North American big-game hunters were the sole source of migration into South America. Clovis is evidently just one of several regional traditions. Clearly, paleo-Indians were able to adapt to a broad range of habitats."
Other archeologists said the findings indicated that parts of South America might have been occupied by a wave of migrating people who crossed from Siberia before the people associated with the Clovis culture. Several recent discoveries provide tantalizing hints that people may have been in America several thousand years before the Clovis culture, though none of them has yet been established beyond dispute.
Dr. C. Vance Haynes, an archeologist at the University of Arizona who specializes in the Clovis culture, conceded the possibility.
"It wouldn't surprise me that somebody was here before the Clovis people," he said.
Dr. John Rick, an anthropologist at Stanford University, said the evidence produced by Dr. Roosevelt "left no room for doubt that this is an old site of hunter-gatherer occupation." He said the date of 11,000 years for materials found in cave sediments appeared to be well-founded.
But Dr. Rick cautioned that it might be premature to derive broad interpretations about the nature and timing of early American cultures on the basis of a single site, particularly one that he said had only a relatively small sample of tools on which to make cultural inferences. The findings "open the door but don't tell you exactly what's on the other side of the door," he said.
Some archeologists, notably Clovis specialists, expressed reservations over the dating of the Amazon materials, saying that a more conservative averaging of the radiocarbon results would yield a more reliable date of 10,500 years ago, which might preserve the Clovis primacy and could have given the Clovis people time to move south, modifying their weaponry and diet as they went.
Dr. Roosevelt argued that such averaging would obscure the time of a site's earliest occupation and also distinctions between artifacts and seeds found at slightly different levels of the excavated sediments.
Dr. Roosevelt made the discoveries at Caverna da Pedra Pintada, Cave of the Painted Rock, near Monte Alegre, a town on the north bank of the Amazon between Manaus and Belem. The excavations occurred in 1991 and 1992, but laboratory analysis of the thousands of artifacts and other campsite remains, as well as the radiocarbon testing delayed publication of the results. Several independent dating tests were conducted on charred seeds and wood found in sediments associated with stone spear points and other artifacts.
One of the most striking discoveries at the site was the presence of stone projectile points of a triangular shape. This set them apart from the Clovis style of fluted points, which have often been uncovered in North America at kill sites also bearing many large animal bones. Archeologists said it was not clear whether the Amazonian points were used as knives, spears, darts or harpoons. But the litter of stone flakes indicated that people using the cave spent much of their time making or repairing their stone weapons.
The other important discovery, Dr. Roosevelt said, was the presence of such a variety of food remains. These included the charred seeds and nuts of tropical trees and other plants, but no plant remains associated with temperate habitats. Being charred in ancient fires helped preserve them. Other remains included shells of mollusks, bones of fish, birds, turtles and land animals and scraps of meals. "This culture didn't emphasize big-game hunting," Dr. Roosevelt said. "The charred food remains we found point instead to broad-spectrum foraging."
Dr. Betty J. Meggers, an archeologist at the Smithsonian Institution who has frequently differed with Dr. Roosevelt on interpretations of early Amazonian cultures, said that she was convinced that the Amazonian environment was much less tropical 11,000 years ago, with more open, dry land. In that case, she said, there could have been such scattered foraging cultures, but it would not disprove her hypothesis that significant human cultures could not have been supported in the Amazon basin because the climate was too harsh and resources scarce.
Dr. Roosevelt, on the other hand, thinks the people of the Monte Alegre cave show that "early human evolution was not severely limited in humid tropical environments as compared with others." Indeed, she views them as the beginning of a "dynamic trajectory" of cultural evolution along the Amazon, leading in time to fishing villages, then to horticulturists who adopted and used pottery as early as 8,000 years ago.

HEADLINE: Profit Data Help Lift Stock Prices

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose narrowly yesterday, while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index set a high for the 12th time this year.
"Today's stock market actions were strongly influenced by recent earnings reports," said John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president of Advest Inc. "Stocks and bonds have effectively decoupled over the last two months and this was more of the same." 
 As evidence of that decoupling, the bond market fell, after a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia gave indications that demand for manufacturers' products was strong and that the economy was gaining momentum. The 30-year Treasury bond dropped 8/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, increased to 6.83 percent, from 6.81 percent on Wednesday.
The Nasdaq index, which had established the previous record of 1,124.92 on Tuesday, jumped 15.43 points, or 1.38 percent, to 1,136.30. Other major market indicators did not gain as much, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.81 points, or 0.03 percent, to 5,551.74, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 2, or 0.31 percent, to 643.61.
Advances topped declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,300 to 1,007. Big Board volume amounted to 415.2 million shares, compared with 465.2 million shares Wednesday.
Another record was also set by the Dow Jones transportation average, which rose 19.98 points, to 2,221.06. The previous high of 2,206.68 was achieved on April 4.
Among the gainers in the Dow transportations were Union Pacific, up 2 3/8, to 70 1/8; Burlington Northern, up 2, to 84 1/2; UAL, the holding company for United Airlines, up 1 7/8, to 222, and AMR, the holding company for American Airlines, up 1/2, to 93 3/8.
Gillette jumped 3 1/8, to 52, after increasing first-quarter profits by 17 percent, raising its dividend and announcing a stock buyback program. Raychem surged 5 3/4, to 73 1/4, after its fiscal third-quarter earnings more than tripled those for the period a year ago. And McDonnell Douglas vaulted 2 3/4, to 90 5/8, after reporting surprisingly strong first-quarter net income.
Good profit reports from drug companies helped to stimulate the pharmaceutical sector. Eli Lilly closed at 58 7/8, up 2 3/8; Pfizer ended at 68 3/4, up 1/8, and Bristol-Myers finished at 82, up 7/8.
Computer stocks rebounded from Wednesday's retreat. Motorola rose 2 5/8, to 60 1/88, and Hewlett-Packard added 1 1/2, to 99 7/8. I.B.M., which plunged a whopping 10 1/4 the previous session, increased 1/4, to 105 1/2. The Morgan Stanley high-technology index had a gain of more than 2 percent, to 326.
On the other hand, oil stocks slid amid rumors of an agreement between Iraq and the United Nations over Iraqi oil sales. Exxon declined 1 5/8, to 81 7/8; Royal Dutch tumbled 2 7/8, to 42, and Mobil fell 2 3/8, to 112 5/8.
Traders rotated out of some beverage issues. Coca-Cola closed at 79 1/2, down 5/8, and Adolph Coors closed at 17 7/8, down 7/8.
Tobacco stocks also dropped as concern over litigation continued. Philip Morris fell 1/2, to 89 1/4, and RJR Nabisco declined 1/4, to 29 3/4.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Sooner Than Expected, Germans Cut Key Rates

 BODY:
The central bank of Germany, faced with a stagnant national economy, unexpectedly cut official interest rates half a percentage point yesterday.
The move is expected to help the German economy, which appears to have contracted for a second consecutive quarter. And because Germany has Europe's largest economy, a rebound there could be expected to flow into neighboring countries. 
 Although many economists had expected the influential central bank, the Bundesbank, to lower interest rates at some point this year, few thought it would act so soon. The rate cut caught the financial markets off guard, and the dollar initially rose against the German mark. But by the end of the afternoon in New York, the dollar stood below its levels of Wednesday.
The Bundesbank lowered the benchmark discount rate to 2.5 percent from 3 percent, matching a record low after the stock market collapse in the autumn of 1987. The discount rate, which is charged on loans by the central bank to commercial banks, sets a floor under German money market rates. It also effectively dictates interest-rate levels elsewhere in Europe.
The bank also cut a second important measure, the Lombard rate, to 4.5 percent from 5 percent. The Lombard rate is charged on emergency loans the central bank makes to commercial banks and acts as a ceiling on money market rates.
The Bundesbank last lowered the discount and Lombard rates in mid-December.
In reducing the rates yesterday, it said it was confident that inflation would remain under control.
The bank left unchanged a third widely tracked interest gauge, the securities repurchase rate. Better known as the repo rate, that is what banks pay for short-term borrowing in the money market. The Bundesbank, which controls the repo rate by adjusting the money market's liquidity, said it would keep it at 3.3 percent for the next two weeks so as to leave its monetary-policy options open. That, plus comments by the central bank's president, raised the possibility of a further reduction.
On the heels of the Bundesbank's move, interest rates were cut yesterday in Austria, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well.
"Because Germany is weaker than the rest of Europe, and is setting the base rate for the rest of Europe, this is more stimulative than the other countries may need," said Steve Englander, a European economist at Smith Barney in Paris, to Bloomberg Business News. Still, he added, "This is very bullish for Europe."
Interest-rate reductions in a country tend to weaken that country's currency by reducing the yields available on investments there. The Bundesbank's announcement did cause the mark to fall initially, though the dollar later turned lower.
Traders attributed the dollar's afternoon retreat to a view among some in the currency markets that the rate cut would be the last the Bundesbank would make -- despite the indications from the central bank to the contrary. And they said that the dollar had lost value against the Japanese yen yesterday because traders believed that Japan's central bank might soon move to raise interest rates there.
"The timing of the Bundesbank cut was a surprise," said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But the talk is widespread that this is the last rate cut. The rise in commodity prices we have seen has to be an inflation concern in Germany. What the central bank did yesterday was a political concession, one the Bundesbank is not likely to do again."
The dollar rose as high as 1.5120 marks, a 14-month high, before retreating. In New York, it settled at 1.5015 marks, down from 1.5060 on Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 106.65 yen, down from 108.20 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5185 from $1.5095.
But the dollar gained against the Canadian dollar, after Canada's central bank cut interest rates there by one-quarter of a percentage point. The Canadian dollar fell to 73.35 United States cents from 73.72 cents.
The German bank, always alert for signs that inflation may be accelerating, is known for its great caution in cutting interest rates. In a report issued yesterday before its rate announcement, the bank said that the broad measure of Germany's money supply rose at an annual rate of 12.2 percent in the first three months of the year, slower than the 12.8 percent pace in the first two months. It also said that the current annual rate exaggerated actual monetary growth.
The Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, said at a news conference that inflation pressures were relatively tame. Addressing the possibility of a further easing of interest rates, he said that the bank would "wait and see."
"We aren't talking about an end," Mr. Tietmeyer continued. "We will see whether there is further room."
The rate reduction came against a backdrop of continued stagnation in Germany. The Economics Ministry said in a report yesterday that the economy probably shrank in the first quarter. It cited unusually cold weather and the lack of a pickup in consumer spending.
The economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, shrank four-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995 from the previous quarter. It has been hurt by the strong mark, which makes Germany's exports less competitive, and high labor costs.

HEADLINE: Group Asserts U.S. Workers Are Better Off Than Thought

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Injecting its voice into the debate over economic insecurity, a lobbying group representing the nation's manufacturers issued an analysis today that it said rebutted "the conventional wisdom that wage stagnation and job loss represent reality for American workers."
The National Association of Manufacturers said in its report that there were valid reasons why workers might feel uneasy about the future, reciting what has now become a familiar list to employees of almost any company: global competition, the fast pace of technological change, demands on the labor force to continually upgrade its skills and the bigger bite taken out of paychecks by taxes. 
 But it said problems with measurements of inflation had caused Government statistics to report that average wages had stagnated when they had actually improved somewhat. Once distortions created by overestimating inflation are taken into account, the group argued, wages have risen by 15 percent since 1979. And the report said that the economy was creating jobs far faster than corporate downsizing was wiping them out. Unemployment has stayed under 6 percent for more than a year and a half.
"There is one overriding, fundamental truth about the U.S. economy," the study said. "It has created millions of new jobs over the last 25 years -- 8.4 million since 1992 -- and at the same time it has raised average compensation for a rapidly growing work force. Other industrialized countries in recent decades have done one or the other; none, aside from the United States, can claim to have done both."
The study did not generate or analyze new data, but was an attempt by the manufacturers' group to shift the focus from what it said were misleading or incomplete accounts of an issue that has taken center stage both in politics and in economic policy debates.
The report's conclusions also reflected a broader belief on the part of corporate executives that they are unfairly being blamed for the plight of workers when the executives' success in helping industry become more efficient and competitive has restored the United States to a position of pre-eminent economic strength.
"Much of what is said about the plight of workers is inflammatory, demagogic, or flat out wrong," said Jerry Jasinowski, the association's president.
Many news organizations, including The New York Times, have reported in recent months on the anxieties of workers who fear for their jobs, worry that living standards are slipping and feel they are working harder and harder to keep up.
Those sentiments have also been seized upon by politicians. In his bid for the Republican Presidential nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan railed against what he called the greed of corporate executives and their lack of concern for their workers. President Clinton has been touting companies that treat their employees well as part of a White House effort to address feelings of disenfranchisement among the middle class.
In Congress, Democrats including Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico have offered plans to give tax breaks to companies that offer better wages, benefits and training to workers. Congress is edging closer to raising the minimum wage, despite the arguments of many economists that such a move might discourage companies from hiring additional workers.
Next week, the White House's Council on Economic Advisers plans to release its own study of the downsizing phenomenon -- one expected to bolster the Administration's argument that while workers have undergone a wrenching change, the job displacements have not been worse than other recent periods in America's economic history.
"What we want to show is that the new jobs being created are good jobs -- better paying, more stable than people think," one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers said this week. "On the other hand, we're concerned that the layoffs that people have experienced recently may be more permanent than in past periods, and that's something we'll have to address in the campaign."
For Mr. Clinton, the divergence between the figures showing strong job growth and the economic insecurity felt by voters poses a tricky political quandary: he clearly wants to take credit for the country's strong economic performance without seeming oblivious to the pain and anxiety felt by many workers.
"Obviously there is extraordinary anxiety -- let me say high anxiety -- among many workers," the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said the other day. "No one is trying to ignore that."
Instead, Mr. Clinton's re-election team is trying to cast the President as the man who helped spur growth, and who now is focused on Government and private-sector programs, including portable health insurance and retirement savings systems, to aid those caught up in the wheels of the national economic transition.
The manufacturers' group, in its report, said the two main causes of worker anxiety were slow economic growth and high taxes. A typical family in 1955 paid about 20 percent of its income in state and Federal taxes, but now pays about 37 percent, an added burden of $9,000 for the median two-income family, according to the report.
The report made several recommendations, starting with increasing the economic growth rate, in part by reducing taxes. It said that companies should use more incentive-based compensation and stock ownership plans for workers. It also called for less government regulation of business and a vaguely defined "new employment relationship" under which employees would commit themselves to keep learning new skills and companies would keep lines of communication open and help workers achieve their goals.

HEADLINE: Elusive Salinas Turns Up in New York

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 18

 BODY:
He was supposed to be in Cuba, or Canada, or Costa Rica, or a resort on Paradise Island, or a walled compound in central Mexico.
For more than a year, reporters have chased yachts, climbed mountains, cased apartment buildings and flown halfway round the world to try to find him, but former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has been hard to find. 
 Until Wednesday. The former President showed up in New York wearing a navy blue trench coat and an impish smile to attend the annual meeting of the Dow Jones & Company, where he is a director.
Mr. Salinas, whose whereabouts have been a mystery since he was hounded out of Mexico last year by political opponents and public outrage, told a Mexican reporter, "I live in Ireland with my family." An article in The Sunday Times of London last weekend reported the same thing.
When asked about reports of his global ramblings, Mr. Salinas reportedly smiled and said, "You know how reporters are."
Mr. Salinas arrived about 20 minutes late for the meeting at the 43d floor of the World Trade Center in New York City. He officially began his two-year term on the Dow Jones board last April.
Company officials would not say how often he attended meetings but the proxy statement given to shareholders noted that he had taken part in just over half of the board and committee meetings held in the last year.
He works on the membership and audit committees and, according to the statement, does not own any shares of Dow Jones.
People who attended the meeting said that Mr. Salinas looked slightly thinner and that the little bit of hair he has left has turned grayer. Mr. Salinas, who just turned 48, completed his six-year term as one of Mexico's most popular presidents in December 1994. But just weeks after he left office, the seemingly strong economy he built collapsed, setting off an avalanche of criticism.
Since then, he and his family have been accused of everything from theft to murder. No charges have officially been brought against Mr. Salinas himself, but most Mexicans consider him a symbol of official corruption.
Most of Mr. Salinas's political allies in Mexico have abandoned him and the few who continue to support him face troubles of their own. Socrates Rizzo Garcia, the Governor of Mr. Salinas's home state, Nuevo Leon, across the border from Texas, resigned today under a cloud of suspicion and speculation.
There are no official charges against Mr. Rizzo. But during the last year, drugs, violence and political infighting have become increasing problems in Nuevo Leon.

HEADLINE: Boat People Embark on Sad Voyage Home

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUANTAN, Malaysia, April 18

 BODY:
 Sullen and defeated, 317 Vietnamese boat people shuffled down a gangplank into the hold of a Malaysian Navy landing craft this morning, the first to be sent back home by ship as refugee camps in Southeast Asia begin to close down for good.
Some sobbed. Most were silent. A few whispered "We don't want to go" and, "They are forcing us." One man holding a small child stared intently at a reporter and muttered, "Malaysia United Nations are animals." 
 For these failed migrants it was the end of a journey across the same South China Sea, begun in the hope of a new life in the West but leading only to half a decade in a crowded refugee camp.
It also signaled the approaching end of the era of Vietnamese refugees that began on helicopters in the tumult of the Communist takeover of Saigon in 1975, then grew to a flood of hundreds of thousands of desperate boat people, many of whom lost their lives to storms and pirates.
More than a million Vietnamese refugees succeeded in reaching the United States. Even as today's shipload began its 40-hour journey to the Vietnamese port of Vung Tau, successful Vietnamese-Americans were flying back to visit or do business, with dollars in their pockets.
As the unwilling returnees approached the gangplank one by one this morning, Malaysian police officers searched their purses and pockets, removing any items, as one official said, with which they might "hurt themselves or others."
The officers removed not only belts and combs and pencils but watches, keys and nail clippers, bobby pins, mascara brushes, bracelets, rings and rosaries, and they pulled barrettes from the hair of children.
The morning's operation -- quick, efficient and uneventful -- was a clear success. Earlier forced returns by air from Hong Kong have sometimes been chaotic, with refugees wailing and officers carrying them bodily aboard the aircraft.
Here in Malaysia, the prospect of a forced return has touched off two riots in the last six months in the Sungai Besi camp in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. In the last of these, on Jan. 18, one Vietnamese was killed and 24 people, including seven police officers, were hurt.
Rear Adm. Yaacob Daud, director of Malaysia's task force on illegal immigrants, was clearly relieved as the last Vietnamese walked down the gangplank today.
"This is what we have wanted all along," he said. "This shows it can be done peacefully."
A decisive factor, he said, was the announcement last month by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees that it would stop financing the camps in Southeast Asia as of June 30. "That was a clear message to the people still in the camps that they have no more choice but to go home," he said.
The Vietnamese in the Sungai Besi camp had clearly given up their struggle as they were marched single file before dawn today to board busses for the five-hour ride to this small port city on the Malaysian east coast.
A refugee named Le Binh Xinh, who had been here since 1989, said, "We do not want to go but they are making us go." Asked how they were being forced, he raised his palms and gestured at the rows of riot police officers that surrounded him, carrying heavy batons and wearing red, visored helmets bearing the word "Polis."
Monitors from the United Nations refugee agency looked on uncomfortably as observers. They have spent the last two decades assisting Vietnamese refugees but have agreed now to step aside. Almost all the 35,000 Vietnamese remaining in Southeast Asia's camps have been judged to be "economic migrants" rather than genuine refugees fleeing persecution and deserving of protection.
A United Nations observer at Sungai Besi camp this morning said she was satisfied with the conduct of the operation, but she declined to give her name.
Admiral Yaacob said 3,128 Vietnamese remain in two camps in Malaysia. Of these, about 1,500 have agreed to sign voluntary return forms, allowing them to take the quicker and more comfortable flight home by aircraft.
The others have so far refused to volunteer, after their years of struggle, and are opting for the more arduous and humiliating journey in the hold of the Sri Inderapura, a 7,000-ton landing craft that was bought last year from the United States, where it was known as the Spartanburg County.
Admiral Yaacob said he hoped that the forced return today would help persuade more of the Vietnamese to return voluntarily. Already, he said, today's total was reduced from more than 500 when many of the holdouts chose instead to volunteer.
Shortly after the departure of the 317 involuntary returnees from the Sungai Besi camp this morning, 216 volunteers were bused to the airport, where they were to board an Air Vietnam flight for Ho Chi Minh City.
One of these volunteers, Vu Long, 23, acted as a sort of trusty this morning, helping carry out the involuntary departure before his own trip to the airport.
"I must go back; I have no choice," he said. "I came here looking for my future and I wasted seven years. Now I must go home and start again."

HEADLINE: A Rivalry Between East and West Grows In New Media

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The new-media business may be a fledgling industry, but it has already generated a big-time fight for bragging rights that pits New York against the West Coast.
The heated debate was precipitated by a study of the new-media industry in New York released on Monday. The study, conducted by Coopers & Lybrand, found that companies making sites on the Internet's World Wide Web, multimedia software, computer games and other new-media products supported 71,500 workers in 4,200 companies in the metropolitan New York region. 
 New-media jobs, the study found, had doubled over the last three years, and gross revenues reached $3.8 billion, although once transactions among themselves were eliminated, the final figure was about $1 billion.
On the West Coast these figures were greeted with derision.
"That New York study galvanized people here like you wouldn't believe," said Rohit Shukla, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance, a corporate and government partnership.
"There may be a thriving new media business in New York," Mr. Shukla said, "but no matter what they are doing in New York, it isn't generating those kind of revenues and jobs."
Mr. Shukla, using a different methodology and definition of new-media technologies, places New York behind both San Francisco and Los Angeles.
A study done by the Bay Area Multimedia Partnership, a corporate and government group, estimated last year that new media industry in the nine-county region around San Francisco had more than 2,200 companies employing 62,000 people.
Measuring employment and job creation in any new industry is tricky because such jobs do not fit neatly into the standard industrial classifications of the Federal Government's official employment counter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Most new-media jobs, economists say, would probably be included in the Government's business services category, which saw a rise of 30,000 in the last three years, to 260,000 from 230,000, in New York City and adjacent counties in New York State, noted David Hensley, a regional economist at Salomon Brothers.
In New York City, the nearest comparable area in Coopers & Lybrand study, 17,000 new-media jobs were created over the last three years. "The net job growth is possible, but it would mean new media accounted for much of the growth in the entire business services category," Mr. Hensley said.
"Measuring this kind of amorphously defined industry is difficult for anyone, but the results of the New York study don't make sense to me," said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow for public policy at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif.
Andrew Zimmerman, a partner at Coopers & Lybrand, said: "I feel that within a reasonable margin of error, the survey numbers are accurate," but he admitted that measuring employment in new media involved judgment calls.
"We did extrapolate from a sample, but we made every effort to avoid double-counting that might exaggerate the numbers," Mr. Zimmerman said. Coopers & Lybrand followed up the data generated by market research and government data with telephone interviews and some face-to-face interviews.
The New York survey was paid for by the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, and commissioned by the New York New Media Association, a trade group.
One explanation for the bicoastal dispute, said Brian Horey, president of the trade association, is that westerners "are looking at this from the prism of CD-ROM and PC software." New York lags in those areas, he said, but is dominated by legions of small firms designing and supporting Web sites for larger companies. He estimates that companies working on the Web account for more than half of the new media employment in New York.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Still Plagued By Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower for a third consecutive session yesterday, retreating from early gains, as inflation worries revived following a stronger-than-expected regional manufacturing survey.
"We're still within the grasp of a bear market in bonds," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management, a money management firm in Washington. 
 Bond prices rose in early trading, bolstered in part by a cut in German interest rates that helped the dollar. But bonds fell sharply after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its index of general business activity jumped to 17.3 in April, from minus 0.1 in March. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 2.8.
"The overall reading was higher than expected," said Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of Government bond trading at Cowen & Company. "I think it really knocked the wind out of the bond market's sales after starting the New York session with a firm tone."
The price of the 30-year bond fell as much as 14/32 of a percentage point after the Philadelphia Fed report. It ended down 8/32 , to 89 16/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to6.83 percent, from 6.81 percent on Wednesday.
While the Philadelphia Fed report contained indications that inflation remained moderate, the bond market seized on the signs of sharp growth. The business activity index is at its highest in in more than six months. And surveyed companies reported increases in both new orders and shipments this month.
Mr. Carpenter of ASB Capital Mangement noted that the market ignored the second consecutive monthly contraction of employment seen in the report. "Collectively these two months worth of data cast doubt on the strong February employment report we had," he said, "and even the validity of the more moderate March data."
And many analysts note that the Philadelphia Fed's index number is often volatile, with wide swings from month to month. Some suspect that the sharp rise this month reflected a bounce-back from the General Motors strike that shut an Ohio assembly plant in March.
Another economic report was largely in line with expectations. The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the first time rose by 10,000 last week, to 360,000. Analysts said the underlying trend remained consistent with a noninflationary pace of job growth.
Another source of investor concern remains new supply as the market prepares for next week's Treasury auctions of $18.75 billion in new two-year notes and $12.5 billion in five-year notes.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6 percent; the yield on the five-year issue was 6.37 percent. Both were up a about three-hundredths of a percentage point from the previous day, as dealers sought to reach a yield level that would attract the most buyers.
Despite the slump in recent days, Mr. Carpenter, for one, remains optimistic. "I still think that we are no more than a quarter away from a substantial rally in bonds," he said. "By year-end, the long bond yield will be closer to 6 percent than to 7 percent. I remain optimistic that the current level of both long- and short-term rates are certainly high enough to suffocate or strangle the developing second-quarter spurt in economic growth."

HEADLINE: Researchers Link Income Disparity to Higher Rates of Death

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Poor people have long been known to have more medical problems than affluent people of the same age, but a new study suggests that greater inequality in the distribution of income contributes to higher overall mortality rates and deaths from heart disease, cancer and homicide.
The study, undertaken by three faculty members of the Harvard School of Public Health and being published on Friday in the British Medical Journal, suggests that reducing such inequality may reduce mortality rates. Data from the Census Bureau show that income inequality in the United States has increased in recent years. 
 The study found that for treatable conditions like tuberculosis, pneumonia and high blood pressure, mortality rates were higher in states where the income gap was wider.
"The size of the gap between the wealthy and less well-off, as distinct from the absolute standard of living enjoyed by the poor, appears to be related to mortality," says the article, written by Dr. Bruce P. Kennedy, Dr. Ichiro Kawachi and Dr. Deborah B. Prothrow-Stith.
Why this may be true is not clear. "It is possible that income distribution is a proxy for other social indicators, such as the degree of investment in human capital," the researchers say. "Communities that tolerate large degrees of income inequality may be the same ones which tend to under-invest in social goods such as public education or accessible health care."
In an interview today, Dr. Kennedy said, "We found that mortality was strongly related to inequality in the distribution of income, but not to the median income or per capita income of a state."
A separate study in the same issue of the journal, by researchers at the California Department of Health Services, reaches similar conclusions. They found high levels of income inequality and high death rates in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky and New York. Conversely, they found comparatively low levels of income inequality and low death rates in New Hampshire, Utah, Wisconsin, Iowa and Hawaii. By both measures, New Jersey and Connecticut were in the middle.
The principal researcher in the California group, Dr. George A. Kaplan, said in an interview: "What we found is that as income inequality goes up, as the wealthy receive a greater share of total income, death rates also go up. The states that had the highest levels of income inequality in 1980 had poorer mortality trends from 1980 to 1990, compared with states that had more equal income distribution."
In addition, he said, "We found that income inequality increases death rates at all ages, from infant mortality to deaths in the elderly."
Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues reported that "income inequality increased in all states except Alaska from 1980 to 1990." Over the decade, they said, mortality declined in all states, but those with greater income inequality showed smaller declines.
The California team suggested that decisions about economic policy could affect mortality levels, for better or worse. So, they conclude, "it would be prudent to consider health effects, and the costs associated with them, when evaluating the impact of economic policies."
Dr. Kaplan, an epidemiologist, said, "People might assume that states with higher income inequality have more poor people, and we know that poor people have higher death rates." But he added: "The evidence in these two studies suggests that the increased death rates in those states are not due simply to their having more poor people. Income inequality seems to be increasing mortality rates among nonpoor people as well, and we are investigating that possibility."
Dr. Kaplan suggested that "income inequality affects all segments of the population because it affects rates of violence and disability, as well as public spending on police protection, education, welfare and health care."

HEADLINE: A Season of Opening Days;
Companies Make New Issues a Big Event on Wall St.

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, a lot of high-priced talent is just standing around in the frenzy. Henry B. Schacht, the chairman of Lucent Technologies, is part of the crowd, and so are Richard A. Grasso, the exchange chairman, and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy, who is at the exchange to give a speech. Messengers push through the gawkers to deliver buy or sell orders to Michael La Branche, the specialist at Post 7-N.
Lucent is going public, a spinoff of AT&T. And even those who are not trying to buy shares in the $3 billion deal, the largest initial public offering in American history, want to witness it. 
 Most excited of all, perhaps, is Nellie Perkins, who works the second shift at a Lucent plant in Oklahoma City. She has never before set foot in New York City, let alone on the floor of the Big Board, but on this particular day, April 4, Lucent has flown her in to buy the first 500 shares.
Finally, at 10:44 A.M., 74 minutes after the opening bell, Mr. La Branche matches orders and bundles them into one trade. Ms. Perkins, whose purchase is part of the package, announces the inaugural transaction: "15,887,800 Lucent shares to trade at 31 7/8." Cameras click. There are smiles, hugs, even tears in the Lucent crowd.
In one variation or another, that scene has been repeated hundreds of times in the last year, as companies increasingly make going public into an event, hoping to stand out in the crowd. And what a crowd it is. If current trends hold up, April will be the hottest month ever for raising money in new issues.
Wall Street's roaring bull is allowing a throng of companies to tap the market for money. But as a few recent sharp declines suggest, the market's strength -- based in part on a five-year-old economic expansion -- will not last forever. At some point, investors will undoubtedly have their fill of these newly minted companies, and the window for new stock issues will close. That prospect is making the current rush to the starting gate all the more jammed.
New York, as the capital of capitalism, makes it all happen. Wall Street orchestrates, and lives off, these stock offering deals, through which shares in private companies are made available for sale to the public for the first time.
The blockbuster fees generated by mergers and acquisitions get more attention because the deals are bigger. But securities firms typically collect 7 percent of the value of a stock offering, compared with 1 percent of a merger, said Richard J. Peterson, an analyst at the Securities Data Company. Only once in the last dozen years, 1989, have merger fees surpassed stock offering fees, which already exceed $700 million this year. Lucent rained $117.6 million on Wall Street.
From the pockets of investment bankers, that money gets sprinkled around. Some wends its way to printers, hotel and restaurant workers, chauffeurs and even unemployed actors on some recent occasions. The money shows up in everything from a generous tip to the shoe-shiners downtown to box seats at the Metropolitan Opera. And a lot goes, too, into Park Avenue co-ops and summer homes in the Hamptons.
In a trend likely to fatten the bonanza, some recent stock offerings are being celebrated in ways that go beyond the traditional exclusive breakfasts and dinners for executives and investment bankers. Now companies are using the occasion to create a public image, to foster esprit de corps among employees and to spread the action around -- as well as to forge an identity with Wall Street brokers and traders.
Along with the ubiquitous Lucite-block gewgaws for deal makers, companies like Lucent, which makes telecommunications equipment, are handing out baseball caps at the exchange. Revlon brought the models Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford to spice up its debut in February. It also put their photos on the traditional giveaway lapel pins, instantly turning what are normally throwaways into hot items.
Cartoon character appearances -- like Spiderman for Marvel Comics and Mr. Peanut for Nabisco -- are becoming so common that last fall the Boston Beer Company did not just bring an actor playing Samuel Adams, the namesake of its label, but re-enacted the Boston Tea Party, sort of, on Broad Street.
Boston Beer deployed employees and actors on a ship-shaped float. Dressed in colonial garb, they dumped cases of imported beer into the street "to dramatize the declaration of beer independence," C. James Koch, the chief executive, said.
These antics are spreading as the number of new issues soars. Ever since the bull market that began in the early 1980's got its second wind in 1991, private companies with great ambitions and a need for capital have been running to investment bankers. They size up the company's prospects with investors and determine the price the shares may fetch.
Lately, investors have been snapping up virtually every company on offer. Companies with a link to the Internet, no matter how tenuous, are the stars, commanding prices in the ionosphere. When one of them -- Yahoo -- went public last Friday, it soared from an offering price of $13 to $43 and closed at $33.
But restaurants, makers of luxury goods, retailers and manufacturers are feasting on the market's plenty, too -- even some that have failed before. On Wednesday, for example, Donna Karan International, the fashion house that found little interest in a stock offering in 1993, said it would try again later this year.
So far in 1996, 198 companies have sold $12.6 billion worth of new stock, more than double the money raised in the corresponding period in 1995, according to Securities Data. The pace so far this year is running ahead of 1993, when a record $34 billion was raised.
The numbers add up to good news for the economy, simply because initial public offerings fuel dreams. By allowing companies to raise money, usually to pursue growth and invest in new ideas, they help drive innovation, technological advances and productivity gains.
For a long time, Wall Street has kept mum on how new stock offerings actually happen, partly in fear of running afoul of Federal regulations that forbid anyone involved to hype a stock, partly out of reluctance to demystify the process.
But the move to make the offerings into events is changing that. Although each stock offering is different, there are certain traditions and rituals. When a company goes public on the New York Stock Exchange, its chief executive normally rings the opening bell. He usually makes the first trade, too, though some companies delegate the tasks.
Most companies, however, go public on Nasdaq, an electronic market that has no trading floor. So the scene takes place on the trading floor of the lead investment firm. A banker there balances the initial buy and sell orders, while the company's executives watch and then head out for a lunch.
With so many deals, some on the trading floors take a jaundiced view of the hoopla. "We want them to get out of here so we can get back to business," said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "This is a big important event in their life, and they're fascinated. But we want to declare victory and get on with it."
Some people with long memories or a sense of history also find much of the hoopla a bit hard to countenance. Robert Sobel, a business historian at Hofstra University, pointed out that as recently as 40 years ago, common stocks were considered too speculative for the average person.
It was not even until 1984 that the New York Stock Exchange began to trade in new issues. By then, the business was too big to ignore.
Today, the issues that go public on the Big Board generate the most folderol. The day typically begins with breakfast in the private dining rooms of the exchange's high-ceilinged Luncheon Club. Lucent had to give a lunch, thanks to the long-scheduled breakfast appearance by President Scalfaro of Italy.
Whether it is breakfast or lunch, the two chairmen -- of the exchange and the company -- bring gifts. Mr. Grasso gave Mr. Schacht the traditional bronze medallion depicting a bull and a bear. Mr. Schacht handed over what he called "the obligatory hat that goes with the obligatory T-shirt and a sweater," all bearing Lucent's red logo.
As the culmination of weeks or months of work, those involved in stock issues are glad it is over. The so-called dog-and-pony shows, a routine of speeches, videos and slides that executives make to countless potential investors, end the night before opening day.
Big issues like Lucent generate so much attention that three teams traversed the country for 11 days, three or four cities a day, on the roadshows. More than 400 people packed the Terrace Room of the Plaza Hotel for the biggest.
Luckily for Lucent's weary executives, Morgan Stanley, the lead investment banker, cut the schedule short. With demand for the stock high and the market looking volatile, the bankers decided to go on April 4, rather than later in the month.
The night before, they huddled with executives from AT&T, which was spinning off Lucent as part of its plan to split into three companies, to agree on the offering price of $27. The deal signed, "everyone drank champagne," one participant said.
Mr. Schacht and the rest of the roadshow teams were still calling on customers. They did not return to the area until 10 or 11 P.M.
The next day, the big suspense was the price at which Lucent would open trading. Investment bankers consider the job well done if the stock begins trading at 5 to 20 percent above the offering price. Lucent fell within the range at $31.875, without going too high. "They'd be disappointed if it ended up at $36," a veteran said. Too much money would have been left on the table.
For Carleton S. Fiorina, an executive vice president at Lucent, the process was "exhausting and chaotic, but also exhilarating." Ms. Fiorina, who piloted Lucent's efforts to go public, added, "I feel like I've given birth here, literally."

HEADLINE: GUNMEN IN EGYPT KILL 18 IN ATTACK AT TOURIST HOTEL

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 18

 BODY:
Gunmen with automatic rifles and pistols opened fire early today on Greek tourists outside their hotel, killing 18 people and wounding at least 17 others in the most violent attack on foreigners since tourists became targets here in 1992.
Hours after the 7 A.M. attack, no group had claimed responsibility, nor did the Government officially accuse any party. 
 But senior Egyptian officials said they suspected cells of the Islamic Group, fundamentalist Muslims who have waged a violent four-year-old campaign to undermine Egypt's secular Government. Their former spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, is serving a life sentence in the United States for involvement in plots to bomb several New York City landmarks.
In a statement from prison made public this week, the Sheik called on his followers to avenge him, saying he was being treated shabbily, prevented from praying when he wants and subjected to frequent strip searches.
Witnesses to the shootings today said three men dressed in black jackets shouting the familiar Muslim refrain "God is great!" jumped from a taxi van to spray bullets at the tourists. Most of them were elderly Greeks on a pilgrimage, lining up at the palm-framed Europa hotel for a bus tour.
The firing, aimed both at the bus and inside the hotel lobby, lasted about three minutes, then the gunmen packed into the van and a fourth man, armed with a pistol, drove them away, the witnesses said.
The attack ended a hiatus in a terror campaign in Cairo, a metropolis of 13 million people, and will almost surely usher in a new crackdown on the fundamentalists by the Egyptian Government.
Recent roundups of the militants had restored enough confidence in the capital that Egyptian security forces had visibly relaxed their watch here in the last year, for example, by allowing unarmed guards to provide hotel security.
Grigorious Mafoutis, 65, had come to see the Orthodox Christian tourist sites and was waiting in the hotel's lobby to board a tour bus when the shooting began. "When I saw people screaming and running, I threw myself on the floor," he said. "I never suspected it could happen here."
Most of the dead and wounded were Greek visitors who had just arrived in Cairo from Israel on Wednesday after having celebrated Orthodox Easter there on Sunday.
The group operator, Mistakidis Tours of Athens, said the 88 Greek visitors had gone to Israel to visit churches and other religious sites.
At the hotel, 10 miles or so from the Pyramids, the killers left behind a scene of mayhem, with the dead and wounded lying on the ground among small pools of blood, abandoned shoes and smashed bottles of mineral water.
The dead included 14 women and 3 men, all Greek, and an Egyptian parking attendant.
Interior Ministry officials said the killings were part of the four-year-old campaign by militant Islamic groups to punish the Government by casting doubts on its stability and setting back the economy.
There was no evidence to link the slayings to Israeli attacks on Lebanon over the last week.
"The victims were Greeks from a country very friendly to Egypt and the aim was us -- the police, the security forces and the Government," a senior Egyptian official said tonight in a telephone interview.
Ahmed Hassan, one of the hotel's security guards, said he felt helpless in face of the attackers. "We are not armed," he said. "Even if we were, what would a gun have done to stop these automatic weapons. All I could do was to shout at the group to 'lay down, lay down.' "
Mr. Hassan said one attacker had a moustache and another was bald. He said both appeared to be in their 20's and were dressed casually.
Greek and Egyptian planes were reportedly sent to Cairo to take home the bodies of the dead and the wounded and the shocked survivors.
 In the last three years, the Egyptian police had largely succeeded in driving the Islamic militants out of major cities, reducing attacks to a few infrequent incidents in remote areas of southern Egypt.
The latest assaults were largely concentrated on the unarmed and unguarded minority of 10 million Christians who are landlords and farmers in many southern villages.
The attack this morning was evidently intended to deal a blow to Egypt's tourist industry, which had only recently recovered fully from the assaults on tourists that began in 1992.
The Government announced a week ago that 3.1 million visitors came to Egypt in 1995, the highest figure ever recorded. Officials had hoped to increase tourism revenues to $4 billion this season, which ends in June, from $3 billion a year earlier.
Today's attack, however, is bound to seriously dampen the momentum of tourist travel here.
Since 1992, 920 people have been killed in political violence, mostly Egyptian Christians, Government officials and police personnel, but also scores of Islamic militants. The Government campaign to crush the terrorism put an estimated 26,000 armed militants in jail, dozens of whom have been sentenced to death.
It is virtually certain that the crackdown on fundamentalists, even those of seemingly peaceful disposition will now go into higher gear, Government officials here said tonight.
The Islamic Group has repeatedly advised foreigners to avoid visiting Egypt, but its primary aim is believed to be to sabotage the fragile Egyptian economy in hopes of nudging President Hosni Mubarak's secular Government away from its Westward leanings toward an Islamic Government.
While these attacks have little chance of bringing down the Government, which is held up securely by the two pillars of support that brace all Egyptian regimes -- the army and security forces -- they do present a potent instrument of blackmail.
This is especially the case because the violence has the tacit support of some senior members of Egypt's religious establishment and of the Muslim Brotherhood, a militant political and social network that was established in the 1930's and that has spawned many of the militants who are doing the shooting today.
In a rare gesture, made perhaps in anticipation of a crackdown, the Muslim Brotherhood, which is officially banned but whose social activities have so far been tolerated by the Government, condemned the attack today, calling it "a disgrace to humanity."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Relaying Warning To Libya

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Deep inside a mountain, Libya is building the world's largest underground poison gas plant. Short of a bombing raid, which the United States is preparing for if it comes to that, the Clinton Administration is doing everything it can to deliver a message to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi: Stop while you have the chance.
Those are some of the realities that make Libya and its chemical weapons program a major security issue and a critical military and diplomatic planning operation for the U.S. And these are four others: 
 1. Any debate inside the Government about whether the U.S. should use military power if needed to prevent the plan from going into operation is over. The conclusion is that Libya wants the plant as a shortcut to Mideast power. The colonel would become the quartermaster of poison gas and mustard gas weapons for terrorist groups and such countries as Iran and North Korea. Then the spread of chemical weapons would make them, like land mines, a military plague beyond effective containment -- but with mass loss of life.
2. Using European products, Asian go-betweens and Iranian money, Libya built the plant so deep into the mountain that the U.S. does not now have acceptable military weapons to destroy it. Unhappily, the U.S. did not fully comprehend what was going on until it became impossible to knock the plant out with acceptable weapons already in the arsenal.
3. Bombing by large nuclear weapons is not acceptable. The danger of drifting radioactive fallout is so terrifying that it has been ruled out.
But as a last resort, the use of a "small" nuclear weapon that could penetrate the mountain and destroy the plant without exterior fallout has not been dismissed. The U.S. expects to have such a weapon by 1997 -- a year before the plant might go into operation.
4. More likely would be a non-nuclear bomb that after penetration of the mountain would detonate another, spreading fire. The twin bomb would not destroy the plant. But it would put it out of operation long enough to give the colonel a choice: Shut the place down or invite more raids.
So far, in two tests at White Sands, N.M., the fuse of the second bomb did not work. Research and testing go on.
Meanwhile Washington is trying to stop Colonel Qaddafi from completing the plant, at Tarhunah, without the U.S. having to take military action. By the time Washington discovered the full extent of the plant in 1992, a couple of years after work began, it was three underground stories high, thousands of square feet large, a network of caverns connected by two-way truck-wide lanes.
For about three years the counter-operation was secret -- an effort to break Libyan foreign supply lines. Huge earthmovers and drills were sold by Europeans to middlemen in Asian countries, bomb-shelter blueprints may have come from Russia, and "dual-use" chemicals arrived from around the world -- "peaceful" in themselves but part of the first stage of making poison gases.
Washington believes it broke enough supply-line connections to slow the Libyans down, but not enough to stop them.
Now the U.S. has gone public with warnings it will not allow the plant to go into operation. Defense Secretary William Perry, intelligence chief John Deutch and Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have delivered them. The U.S. is trying to build a coalition of Arab and European leaders to persuade Libya to stop, or at least support America politically if military action is needed. (There's some talk of economic "inducements," but a Marshall plan for Libya would not make Americans cheer.)
That's the American double track -- avoid attack on the plant if possible, but prepare for it unless construction ends. Washington wants the colonel to know all that.
I think that's why I was able to gather much of the material for this column, after I wrote my first on the danger of the plant on Feb. 27. If so, I am glad to be part of the warning to Libya.
I also think I was encouraged to believe next year is the cutoff point of U.S. patience. But the U.S. officials I dealt with are extremely sophisticated. Could it be, colonel, that an attack might come earlier so you better stop now? No guarantees on American timing go with this column's conveyed message.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise by 10,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
The number of new claims for jobless benefits rose by 10,000 last week -- the first increase in three weeks.
The Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 360,000, up from a revised 350,000 a week earlier. 
 Claims last rose in the week that ended on March 23, when they shot up by 47,000, to 433,000, reflecting the effects of a strike that virtually closed down the General Motors Corporation. Employees at many of the auto maker's suppliers were also affected. After the strike, claims dropped by 27,000 during the week ended March 30, to 406,000, and by 56,000 the following week.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims fell by 6,500, to 387,250, the lowest since 383,500 in the period ended on March 23.

HEADLINE: Senate Defeats Dole Revision To Health Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
The Senate cleared the way tonight for passage of legislation that would make health insurance more accessible, narrowly defeating an amendment by Senator Bob Dole that opponents charged would have killed the bill.
Before adjourning close to midnight, the Senate disposed of all other amendments to the measure and scheduled a vote on final passage, which is assured, for Tuesday. 
 The bill would make it easier for workers to obtain health insurance coverage if they changed jobs. Mr. Dole sought to add to it tax incentives encouraging medical savings accounts, in which individuals would put aside money to pay for health care costs not covered by high-deductible insurance policies that holders of those accounts would be required to buy.
But the Dole amendment was rejected on a vote of 52 to 46, with 5 defecting Republicans joining all 47 Democrats.
Democrats had said President Clinton would veto the bill if the Dole provision was included, fearing that it would appeal to the rich and the healthy, who would benefit from lower-cost, higher-deductible insurance, and raise costs for the poor and the sick, who would not. And the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, made clear that Democrats would use the issue in the Presidential election campaign, saying of the amendment, "If this passes, health insurance reform once again is dead, and Bob Dole will have killed it."
Mr. Dole, the majority leader and presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, said the provision would enable someone to "tailor his or her own health care to his or her own needs." He said he would press for the amendment in the conference committee that will reconcile the Senate bill with one passed by the House, which includes the provision.
The larger bill was hailed by both parties as offering the kind of incremental health care improvements that Congress can manage after the demise of the Clinton universal-coverage plan in 1994. Mr. Dole said the bill's modest steps forward were the only sensible alternative to "President Clinton's insistence that turning the American health care system over to the Federal Government was the only solution."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who has urged sweeping health care legislation since 1970 and is a chief sponsor of the current bill, said: "The legislation is not comprehensive health reform. It will not solve all the problems in the current system. But it is a constructive step forward -- a step that will help millions of Americans."
The bill's other chief sponsor, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican who is Mr. Dole's fellow Kansan in the Senate, and who opposed his amendment, said, "This legislation isn't exciting, but then again good government often isn't."
The bill would require insurance companies to cover workers who moved from one employer offering health insurance to another. If the new employer did not offer insurance, then the insurance company would be required to provide individual coverage, a provision that would also apply to workers who lost their jobs with insurance-offering employers.
That provision was hailed by Mrs. Kassebaum as a boon to 25 million Americans who, she said, now fear changing jobs because of insurance restrictions.
The bill would also prohibit insurers from denying coverage for a specific existing medical condition for more than 12 months.
And, under an amendment offered by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and adopted by the Senate tonight, health insurance plans would be required to deal with mental illness the same way they deal with physical ailments, providing the same maximums for hospital stays, office visits or lifetime spending limits for both. The House bill has no such provision.
Further, Mr. Dole did succeed in adding to the bill a provision that would allow self-employed people to deduct 80 percent of their health insurance premiums on their income tax returns. Under current law, they can deduct only 30 percent; the House bill, passed in March, would allow deducting 50 percent.
Another major difference between the two versions is that the House measure would impose severe limits on medical malpractice suits. The Senate bill has no such provision.
But the crucial issue for the House-Senate conference is sure to be the incentive for medical savings accounts, a proposal that would allow holders of those accounts to contribute to them in pretax dollars and also enjoy tax-deferred growth of the accounts' earnings. The idea has been pushed hard on Republicans by a marketer of such accounts, the Golden Rule Insurance Company, a major contributor to the party. The concept also fascinates Speaker Newt Gingrich, although he said on March 28 that he would not insist on it "if the President sends up a veto signal."
Mrs. Kassebaum and Mr. Kennedy made clear all day long that they would oppose any amendments, even those they personally favored, that lacked overwhelming support. One apparent ally of theirs, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, said this morning, "I would rather pass legislation that actually becomes law, even if it is not as far-reaching and perfect as I would like it to be, than to make a political statement with legislation that ends up in the scrap heap of unfinished business."
But later, when Mr. Dole went all out for his amendment, Senator Simpson voted with him. Another vocal opponent of amending the bill, Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, sat uncomfortably through almost every minute of the roll-call as one side and then the other lobbied him. He finally voted with Mr. Dole.
Yet another Republican, Senator William S. Cohen of Maine, first voted against Mr. Dole and then switched to side with him.
In the end, though, Mrs. Kassebaum was joined by four other Republicans in opposing the amendment: Senators Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, Slade Gorton of Washington and Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon. Two Republicans were absent, and, after stretching the 20 minutes that it normally takes for a roll-call to 35 minutes, Mr. Dole acknowledged defeat, at least for today, and let the voting end.
Throughout the day, there was an alternating between politics and substance. Politics dominated.
After the vote on the Dole amendment, Vice President Al Gore, who had sat in the Senate president's chair to break a tie if he had to, stepped outside the chamber and assailed the proposal. He called it an attack on Medicare, the health program for the elderly, which the amendment did not address.
One Republican after another said the larger bill showed the error of Mr. Clinton's 1994 plan. Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, for example, said the bill demonstrated that "improvements in health insurance can be made without a massive government takeover."
The partisanship had time to thrive because except for the medical savings accounts, there was little disagreement on substance.
Senator Kennedy said the bill was needed because "those who have insurance deserve the security of knowing that their coverage cannot be canceled, especially when they need it most."
And Mr. Dole said that "passage of this bill will not only improve our health care system, it could very well restore the faith of the American public that the work of Congress is not just a series of political stalemates."

* Guarantees that most people in health plans sponsored by employers would be able to obtain health insurance after switching or losing their jobs without being denied coverage because of existing medical problems.
 
* Guarantees coverage for many people leaving an employer-sponsored plan, but does not set Federal limits on the premiums, leaving regulation to the states.
 
* Assists employers and individuals in forming private, voluntary coalitions to purchase health insurance.
 
* Generally requires insurers to offer group health plans to all employers in markets where they operate.
 
* Forbids employer-sponsored health plans to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to individual employees because of their health problems.
 
* Gradually increases the tax deduction for health insurance purchased by the self-employed to 80 percent from 30 percent.
 
* Provides new tax breaks for people who spend money on nursing home care or buy insurance to cover the cost of long-term care.
 
* Allows accelerated tax-free payments of life insurance benefits to the terminally ill. (pg. A26)

HEADLINE: Expect Gas Prices To Keep Going Up

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As evidenced by recent Business Day articles (April 11 and 17), consumers are facing steadily increasing gasoline prices as a result of rapidly increasing demand. This textbook supply-and-demand relationship is being worsened by omissions and commissions perpetrated in Washington that are letting energy demand soar and pushing prices up. 
 For example, we expect legislation that was enacted last year to increase the national speed limit to result in heightened demand of seven million gallons a day, costing more than $3 billion annually and increasing oil imports by 10 percent.
A new proposal to vitiate the executive branch's ability to raise Federal fuel-economy standards will, in our view, cut down the nation's most successful oil-demand reduction effort. These standards have already saved the typical buyer of a new car an average of $3,300 at the gas pump over the life of the car and lessened the country's oil demand by three million barrels a day.
Congress has refused full financing of a research effort between the Federal Government and automakers that is intended to triple fuel efficiency performance. Meantime, the Federal budget for operating assistance for mass transit was hit: the President proposed a 37 percent cut and Congress approved a 50 percent cut.
In the past year, Congress has cut the Administration's request for energy efficiency and alternative energy sources by one-third, leading to delays in bringing about new technologies and applications that will help lessen demand for gasoline, heating oil and other fossil fuels.
As long as demand for gasoline and other finite energy sources keeps going up faster than supplies, price increases for drivers will stay in the fast lane.

As Piracy Grows in Mexico, U.S. Companies Shout Foul

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
Luis is proud of his work, and he backs it up with a personal guarantee. From his stall in a teeming Mexico City market, Luis peddles the latest in pirated videotapes of American movies. Recently his prize item was Walt Disney's "Toy Story," which is not even out on video yet in the United States.
"I taped it myself," Luis assured a hesitant customer. "If there's any problem, bring it back and I'll make you a better one." 
 After losing an estimated $485 million annually to Mexican pirates in recent years, American music, film and software industries have set off alarm bells about the rapidly growing business of illegal entrepreneurs like Luis, who, like other vendors, would not identify himself further. Industry leaders complain that Mexico has grossly failed to enforce its own laws protecting intellectual property, violating the tough copyright standards of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.
Piracy in Mexico is a major trade issue in the making that the Clinton Administration is not eager to confront right now. Since the free trade agreement remains a prickly subject for many Americans, President Clinton's advisers hope to keep Mexico out of the public debate during the campaign. In contrast to its high-profile clash with China over piracy, the Administration discusses the problem with Mexico in low-key closed-door meetings.
Mexican officials acknowledge that President Ernesto Zedillo is not keen to come down hard on a trade, even an illicit one, that is sustaining thousands of poor Mexicans through an economic depression.
"Mexico has become one of the biggest pirate markets in the world," the International Intellectual Property Alliance said in a recent report to the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor. The Washington-based Alliance, which includes American film, music and business software companies, called Mexico's enforcement record "abysmal" and sent a 10-point emergency reform plan to President Zedillo, threatening to file a formal trade complaint if there was no change over the summer.
William H. Gates, the chairman and chief executive of the Microsoft Corporation, told President Zedillo of his worries about piracy in a private meeting in Mexico City earlier this year. According to the Business Software Alliance, the industry association based in Washington, four-fifths of all business software programs now used in Mexico are unlicensed copies.
Mr. Zedillo responded to the pressure by reviving a high-level committee on piracy that went dormant after meeting once in 1993. Also, Mexican and American trade officials agreed to meet monthly to monitor the issue. An American trade official familiar with the meetings said the Mexicans pledged to put new controls in place, and the American official described them as "very cooperative."
The heart of the problem is in Tepito, a tough Mexico City neighborhood that is home to one of the world's biggest bazaars for pirated videos, music cassettes and software. The crowded labyrinth where hundreds of yelling vendors hawk their wares is just a few blocks away from the offices of the top Mexican prosecutor in charge of stopping the pirates and right around the corner from the national headquarters of the police who are supposed to hunt them down.
In the alleyways of Tepito there is no sign of a crackdown. In dozens of open-air stalls, commerce is thriving.
Music cassettes are a favorite product of Tepito vendors because they are easy and cheap to copy. Tapes of the Beatles are selling strongly, especially a collection of their classics labeled "Golden of Memories," apparently by a pirate with less than perfect English. On a tape of Madonna's "Something to Remember," in the spot where the Warner Music label should be, a service-minded counterfeiter stamped a message in Spanish: "Thank you for your patronage." The tapes sold for 5 pesos, or 67 cents each.
In his booth with a sheet of pink plastic for a roof, another youthful merchant named Alfonso offered his own catalogue of cassettes that can be made to order in an hour, among them a Gloria Estefan medley.
Gabriel Abaroa, a Mexican executive who is president of the Recording Industry Federation of Latin America, said a recent census showed that pirates sold about 66 million cassettes, for a total of more than $90 million, in the Tepito market last year. By comparison, the entire legal music industry in all of Mexico sold only 30 million cassettes.
A whole section of Tepito's sprawl is occupied by video copiers. The Oscar-winning film "Braveheart," which has been out on video for only a month in the United States (mainly for rental, since it sells for about $100), is available for purchase here for 20 pesos, or $2.70. But let the buyer beware, because quality is uneven. One tape of "Toy Story," the computer-animated children's film, was sloppily recorded over the action movie "Mortal Kombat." Bloody scenes emerged suddenly from the happy Disney cartoons.
"We felt that Nafta signaled a level of maturity in Mexico that meant that business conditions would improve," said Tim Kuik, anti-piracy director of the Motion Picture Association of America Inc., by telephone from Los Angeles. "Instead, the level of legitimate distribution was greatly reduced. We began to lose terrain we had already gained."
The problem for the Clinton Administration is different in Mexico from what it is in China, where the Government encourages and protects huge pirate industries that cost American companies $1.8 billion last year. (These losses are calculated partly from wholesale prices, partly from actual pirate prices.)
In Mexico, the Government has tolerated the explosion of a business that trade officials say supports a handful of large pirates and thousands of small sellers making subsistence livings.
The criminal fight against piracy is in the hands of an energetic but novice 26-year-old prosecutor, Ernesto Soriano Valdez, who has a staff of just 15 agents to cover the whole country. When Mr. Soriano took over the post in October 1995 he conducted an aggressive series of raids, but this year the raids have fallen off. Out of hundreds of cases brought before the anti-piracy prosecutor's office since 1994, only six pirates have been convicted, and none have served substantial jail terms.
Mr. Soriano said he was hampered by Mexican laws. "Our legislation is very benevolent with this type of crime," he said. Pirates are immediately released on bail as low as a few dollars and face fines of less than $150.
And that is when the pirates are actually caught. Mireille Gotsis, a Microsoft corporate counsel who heads the Latin America committee for the software group, said that in four separate cases, evidence seized in police raids -- computers, diskettes, office records -- vanished from police warehouses before the cases reached court. In several other cases word of impending raids leaked out of the prosecutor's office, giving pirates time to pack up and flee.
So after several years of frustration, the Business Software Alliance decided to settle directly with pirates for damages where it could, Ms. Gotsis said .
The settlements infuriated Mr. Soriano, who accused the companies of "obtaining juicy profits through economic deals." His office, he said, has different goals.
"We are not that interested in helping them recover their losses," Mr. Soriano said. "Our interest is in punishing criminals, not correcting economic damage."
Industry executives argue that Mr. Soriano's operation needs to grow and change its tactics to signal that piracy is no longer tolerated. "There will never be a frightened pirate until one of them goes to jail," Mr. Aboroa, the music executive, said.
But Mr. Soriano said the Government had decided to catch pirates in highway roadblocks and clandestine factory raids, but not to go after Tepito.
"There will be no more frontal attacks in these street markets," Mr. Soriano said. "There is a risk of generating a social conflict."

HEADLINE: Columbia Defeats the P.C. Separatists

BYLINE: By Chris Glaros; Chris Glaros is president of the Columbia College Student Council.

 BODY:
Some of my fellow students at Columbia staged a two-week protest this month to try to force the university to establish an ethnic studies department. Such a department would be wrong. Twenty-two students were arrested after more than 150 occupied Low Library, the main administrative building. About 100 blocked the central classroom building for four days to protest the school's "hegemonic and white supremacist" curriculum.
While I admire such activism and dedication, these tactics only disrupted the education for which we pay so much. Many students disagreed, not only with the means used but with the ends demanded. 
 An ethnic studies department would divide the curriculum along racial lines, implying that the study of whites and nonwhites should be segregated. This is not only an academic issue. It is a national issue that lies at the core of the American challenge: how to build one nation from many peoples and preserve democracy for all.
I chose Columbia because it is one of the country's most diverse institutions of higher education. Its students represent nearly every race, ethnicity and conceivable social and economic background. More and more, it is becoming a microcosm of the nation.
The university is struggling to diversify its curriculum while creating a strong campus community based on common bonds. But as the protest showed, our common bonds are increasingly ignored as we become more diverse. Though the university has made tremendous progress, the ethnic studies issue indicates that it still has far to go.
Should we insure that cultures and traditions that have been excluded from the curriculum are embraced and taught? Of course. But do we need a separate department to focus only on the ethnicities of nonwhites? No. Separatism isolates and marginalizes not only academic disciplines but students, too.
It is necessary to study all ethnicities. Native Americans and Americans of African, Asian and Latino descent have given their blood, sweat and tears in the development of this nation. But so have Americans of European descent. I am tired of people celebrating difference to the neglect of commonality. This includes politicians who make careers of ethnic divisiveness.
In an age of declining political discourse, of an "us versus them" mentality, we must work together to elevate the national dialogue. Tactics of division and polarization must be rejected everywhere.
In saying no to an ethnic studies department, Columbia has shown great leadership in taking a road less traveled: It refused to become another haven of political correctness. It has shown commitment to individuality, pluralism and community -- ideals we must all embrace, now more than ever.

HEADLINE: Here's a Stadium Plan That Will Work

BYLINE: By Meyer S. Frucher; Meyer S. Frucher is an executive vice president of Olympia & York and a former president of Battery Park City.

 BODY:
Faced with shrinking revenues and cuts in services, New York City has to find ways to grow. Done a little differently, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal to build a ball park over the Long Island Rail Road yards in the West 30's offers this chance -- without dislocating residents or businesses.
In fact, it's a mistake to cast such a proposal as a sports project. The goal should not be simply to create a stadium but to develop an engine of growth that can create jobs and revenues for years to come. 
 My suggestion: Build a single-purpose stadium on the site -- between 30th and 33d Streets, next to the West Side highway -- and make it the center of a master plan to revitalize the moribund area around the rail yards. At the same time, transform the stadium in the Bronx into two new schools and playing fields.
The dreary neighborhood around the L.I.R.R. storage yard has confounded planners' attempts at development for 50 years. This area is primarily a warehouse district for a port that no longer exists. It is not much of a home or a workplace, nor is it a magnet for investment or tourism. (Under a reorganization settlement, my employer, Olympia & York, is shedding property in this district at a substantial loss, after 10 years of trying, and failing, to develop the parcel.)
A ball park over the rail yards could spur the city to improve transportation into the area and speed up construction of the esplanade and park that are planned, but not yet financed under the scaled-down Westway project.
The storage yard district is already near a mass transportation hub. The port for ferries to and from New Jersey is across the street from the site. And it would be easy and relatively inexpensive to create a subway shuttle, using L.I.R.R. tracks, from Penn Station.
The shuttle could emerge at 11th Avenue and 33d Street at a station that would serve the new stadium, the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the planned park and esplanade and any commercial enterprises that might spring up.
To discourage driving to the games, parking would be limited to existing spaces in the area, with minimal new parking for stadium employees and boxholders. About one-third of Yankee fans drive to the games in the Bronx. A West Side stadium would likely increase the number of Manhattan dwellers who go to games, and, with more convenient mass transit, decrease the percentage of fans who drive.
The overall plan -- upgraded transportation, the ball park, the waterfront development, changes in zoning to spur economic renewal-- could be put under the auspices of a single development authority like the Battery Park City Authority.
How to finance this master plan?
* Make the new stadium and waterfront area a so-called tax-increment district, where the increased taxes that result from a growth in property values pay for the structural improvements that helped create that growth. Once those costs are paid, however, the taxes would go into the city's general revenues.
* Insist that the ball park itself -- which would cost $250 million to $300 million -- be built with private money. Private developers, after all, get tax breaks for such investments. (It does not make sense to build a stadium that would serve other teams or other uses. The returns would not be worth the added cost.) Would the Yankee organization be willing to spend this money or find others to do it? I believe it behooves them to stay in New York. They'll make a lot of money here.
* Pay for the $100 million deck covering the L.I.R.R. yard (this would be the floor of the stadium) by selling the right to name the stadium. This may shock traditionalists, but there may be no other way to keep spending down.
The stadium plan could be a winner for the Bronx as well.
In part because of lack of space, no new high school has been built in the Bronx since 1973, and the borough needs to make room for 14,000 more high school students. Two new high schools could be built in Yankee Stadium in the space occupied by the left field and right field stands. And by building the schools under the mezzanine using the stadium's outside walls, the existing playing field and some 35,000 seats could be used for sports and athletics.
The goal in planning a new stadium should not be to keep the Yankees in New York. It should be to keep New York growing.

News of German Economic Woes Helps Propel the Dollar Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied yesterday, strengthening on a new report of German economic malaise and uncertainty over the outcome of high-level meetings of finance ministers this weekend in Washington.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5120 German marks from 1.5015 marks on Thursday. The dollar traded at 107.36 yen, up from 106.65 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5140 from $1.5185. 
 The advance largely erased the dollar's losses the day before, which came despite a half-point cut in interest rates by Germany's central bank, aimed at stimulating the largest economy in Europe.
German rate reductions have tended to weaken the mark against the dollar and other important currencies, but the degree of Thursday's decrease, if not the timing, had been widely expected, so it had already been factored into foreign exchange rates.
Currency traders said the dollar advanced against the mark yesterday after a monthly report from the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent group in Munich, Germany, showed a sharp drop in business confidence in March.
The report compounded fears that Germany could be sliding into a recession and aroused speculation that the Bundesbank might have to follow up the latest rate reduction with another cut soon.
Traders reasoned that Germany's central bank had little choice in the matter because the German Government could not increase spending to stimulate the economy. Doing so would raise Germany's deficit and risk violating terms of the European Union pact aimed at monetary union by the end of the century.
"The German economy is weak, and there has to be some mechanism German authorities have that can counteract that," said Seth Cohen, director of foreign-exchange sales at Merrill Lynch & Company. "It means more of the brunt of stimulating the economy is falling on the Bundesbank's shoulders."
Other traders attributed some of the dollar's strength yesterday to speculation about a finance ministers meeting this weekend by the Group of Seven major industrial nations in Washington.
Some traders speculated that Japan would be asked by the other six nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United States -- not to raise interest rates because that would put pressure on them to do likewise.
"The market will be a little bit interested to see if there's pressure on Japan to keep rates low," said Bob Near, a vice president at the Bank of New York. "That would help the dollar."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexico Brighter, But the Cheering Isn't by Leaders

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 19

 BODY:
The Mexican stock exchange hit record highs four days this week, interest rates dropped to their lowest point in seven months, and the once-wobbly peso traded at its strongest level since January.
But because the Mexican economy is still so fragile after last year's peso crisis, even the Government's top officials were reluctant to express much optimism. 
 "The possibility of a collapse has completely disappeared," was the less-than-triumphant declaration of President Ernesto Zedillo as he opened the annual meeting of the Mexican stock exchange convention on Monday. He referred specifically to the dangerously weak banking sector, but in many ways the remark captured feelings about the economy as a whole.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz has also been restrained. He addressed Mexico's stock market leaders on Tuesday and said that while the Government's tough recovery plan was working, "most of the population hasn't yet seen any improvement in their lives."
The reticence of the Government to crow about an economic recovery stems in part from its disastrous record last year in which just about every official projection turned out to be wrong. It is difficult for officials to declare an end to the worst recession in 63 years when domestic consumption is anemic, many families are burdened with unpayable debts and prices for gasoline, milk and even tortillas continue to rise.
For the recovery to be real, Mr. Zedillo said, Mexico will have to perform the trick of increasing both domestic savings and domestic consumption. That will take time for the economy to heal more and for the Government to establish the private pension funds that it hopes will increase the paltry rate of domestic savings.
Nonetheless, market analysts in the United States have seized on the rash of positive indicators. "The recovery has begun," is the headline of a typical report on Mexico, this one by HSBC James Capel, a research company in New York.
"What you have now is a situation where people have to be making the assumption that a strong peso is compatible with economic growth," said Felix Boni, director of Mexico research for James Capel. "If that's true, then the market's a buy."
Even analysts who normally are cautious about predicting Mexico's ability to bounce back now sound downright exuberant. "The Mexican bolsa is blowing away everyone in the hemisphere," said Michael M. Churchill, assistant director of global research at Polyconomics Inc., a market research firm in New Jersey, speaking of the stock exchange.
"The thing driving the rally is December peso futures," Mr. Churchill said. He was referring to contracts to buy pesos on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which in the last month have strengthened from 9.5 to the dollar for December delivery to 8.86 currently. In New York foreign exchange trading today, it took 7.3850 pesos to buy a dollar. As the peso gains value against the dollar, the trend improves the earnings of many Mexican companies.
Even with the reserve exercised by Mexican officials this week, it is clear that they have tried to reshape expectations. For example, President Zedillo pointed out that the bolsa index had more than doubled since it hit a low of less than 1,500 last year.
The market exchange closed today at a record high of 3,284. In just the last week, the exchange has gained 3.45 percent, and since the beginning of the year, it has rallied 18 percent.
Mr. Zedillo also made headlines when he said on Monday that the economy would expand by 5 percent in the second quarter of this year. But he was using as a base the dismal second quarter of 1995, in which the economy contracted 10.5 percent.
The head of Mexico's central bank, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, delivered what was taken as good news on inflation, projecting that in April prices would rise 2.8 percent, even though substantial wage increases and price increases took effect on April 1. In subsequent months, prices will jump less than 2 percent, Mr. Mancera said, for total inflation of 20.5 percent by the end of the year. If that holds true, and many private economists think the estimate is too low, it would drive up company earnings and stimulate domestic buying.
Mexican business leaders have harshly criticized Mr. Mancera, saying he has strangled the recovery by keeping an iron grip on the monetary supply in order to bring down inflation. But he made it clear that he did not intend to change his policy.
He did leave open the possibility, however, of someday abandoning the floating exchange rate that has been in effect since the peso was devalued in December 1994.
"We have a floating exchange rate, and I do not see the possibility or the advantage of changing it in the forseeable future," Mr. Mancera said. "I want to underline the term foreseeable, because in these areas it is not easy, nor proper, to establish dogmas."
Government figures showed unemployment dropping to 6 percent, but the figures are unreliable. Industrial production is improving and Mexican exports totaled $7.5 billion in March, the highest level ever.

HEADLINE: Tiff Over Intellectual Property;
Should Columbia Own Fruit of Economist's Labor?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Did Columbia University convince Geoffrey H. Moore, a world-renowned pioneer in business cycle forecasting, to sign over the rights to his life's work, then callously evict him from his office? Or did the university walk the last mile with Dr. Moore, an 82-year-old economist, absorbing his deficits for a decade and arranging for a wealthy alumnus to underwrite his money-losing research center before cutting off his paycheck?
Just who has the better claim to the high moral ground in this embarrassingly public dispute between the Ivy League university and an icon of economics remains murky. 
 What is clear, though, is that Columbia's problem is linked to the widely pursued effort these days by universities to profit from the intellectual output of their professors. Columbia, for example, expects to earn nearly $50 million from intellectual property this year, most of it from licensing biotechnology and other scientific endeavors.
The tangled tale of Dr. Moore and his institute is a study in what can go wrong when a university goes out of its way to provide a home for research unrelated to the interests of its regular teaching faculty.
Dr. Moore was in the vanguard of economists -- a group that included the former Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns -- to search for statistics that would explain past recessions and predict future ones. Their approach to analyzing ups and downs of the economy, begun under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the 1940's, has achieved commercial success in the business world. Indeed, Stephen McNees, a consultant to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, notes that "it won the war for popular acceptance over formal econometric modeling in forecasting business cycle turning points."
Dr. Moore, who continued the development of his predictive indexes at his own center, garnered clients like Chase Manhattan Bank, Business Week magazine, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Publication of the Government-sponsored index of leading indicators, a dozen measures derived from Dr. Moore's work and used by many to forecast economic activity six months to a year down the road, has often had as much impact on markets as Government reports on inflation or employment.
And for decades, the pronouncement by Dr. Moore that the economy had entered a recession has been regarded as the closest thing around to a certification from Mount Olympus. "His work is without peer," says Hank Hatch, the head of EMG Advisors, a money management company in Fairfield, Conn.
But this approach to business cycle research went out of fashion long ago among academics. They favor the use of more complex models designed to answer the same questions. Though Dr. Moore's place in the economist's pantheon is assured and forecasting is making a bit of a comeback in some quarters -- he was named the American Economic Association's "distinguished fellow" for 1995 -- his welcome at the ivory tower has at times been strained.
In 1983 Dr. Moore was forced to find a new host for his Center for International Business Cycle Research when Rutgers University chose not to underwrite his deficits. The Columbia Business School was then approached by some of Dr. Moore's friends.
The association seemed a natural since Columbia's economics department had once been home to Arthur Burns. And while the business school was prepared to supply seed money, the university administration apparently gambled that with the prestige of the Columbia connection the center would quickly become self-sufficient through the sale of forecasting services. "All research institutes are expected to pay their own way," Michael Crow, Columbia's vice provost, said.
Revenues from the sale of Dr. Moore's indicators did increase, perhaps in part because of his coup in predicting the 1990-91 recession before other forecasters. But according to Mr. Crow, they were never large enough to cover the center's annual budget, which had ballooned to as much as $600,000. By 1993, the cumulative deficit exceeded $1 million, and the university ran out of patience.
Giulio Pontecorvo, a professor at the business school, rode to the rescue. As a member of the center's board of faculty advisers he had earlier raised private donations for the center. And he persuaded one former "angel," Edward Armaly, a Lebanese-born British investment banker who had earned a Ph.D. from the Columbia Business School, to underwrite what was expected to be a long-term solution to the center's financing problem.
Under the December 1993 deal, Dr. Moore assigned to Columbia the rights to the dozens of economic indexes he developed. In turn, the university licensed this intellectual property for 15 years to the Foundation for International Business and Economic Research, a company registered in the Cayman Islands that was controlled by Mr. Armaly. Columbia received $150,000, plus 5 percent of future royalties. In a separate contract the foundation, known as Fiber, agreed to pay at least $150,000 a year for five years to Columbia to support continuing research at the center.
The foundation demonstrated its determination to create a viable business by luring Victor Zarnowitz, a well-known researcher in business cycles, out of retirement to help Dr. Moore oversee the work. The center's work was marketed to bond traders on Wall Street.
But within months of the new union there was friction between the center's staff and Richard Pantel, a new manager brought in by Mr. Armaly. Some of the center's staff members were transferred to work at the foundation, while others were dismissed. And last year, to the university's dismay, Fiber failed to come up with the minimum research budget it had guaranteed for the center.
"We have been negotiating in good faith with the university," Mr. Pantel responded, "but the research must have commercial applications."
Given its policy that research centers should be self-sufficient, Columbia was unwilling to reassume the center's obligations. It finally threw in the towel last month. "I am sorry to have to inform you that, due to the loss of funding for CIBCR, I am forced to put you on leave without salary," the Business School dean, Meyer Feldberg, wrote to Dr. Moore.
Even before the cutoff, Dr. Moore and several of his colleagues moved to set up a rival to Fiber called the Economic Cycle Research Institute. "I think an amicable resolution is still possible," explains Dr. Moore, who says he still wants to re-establish ties to Columbia that makes future operations self-financing.
Lakshman Achuthan, who is serving as the new institute's business manager, notes that its first newsletter will be published next week. "We hope to regain the rights to sell Dr. Moore's indexes," he says, "but we'll go forward either way."
Where you sit determines where you stand on whether Columbia has an obligation to sustain the center. Mr. Crow, the vice provost, dismisses the idea that the university should treat Dr. Moore more generously than other scientists with research appointments. Moreover, he notes that the fees that Columbia received from licensing Dr. Moore's research amounted to a fraction of the center's debt and less than one-half of 1 percent of Columbia's total income from royalties on faculty research.
But Mr. Achuthan insists that the university has played hardball, exploiting the unworldliness of the aging researcher in convincing him to sign over the fruits of decades of labor without explicitly assuring future financing. "The man has been prohibited from using his life's work," he argues.
Moreover, Mr. Achuthan insists that the center's debt to Columbia is much smaller than the university contends. "When the deal was done with Fiber," he says, "the university was made whole financially."
The root of the problem, it now seems clear, was in grafting a research operation onto an economics faculty with which it had so little in common. The isolation left Dr. Moore and his colleagues with few allies within the university who had a stake in raising funds. And it almost guaranteed that the university would be faced with the problem of phasing out the operation once Dr. Moore left the scene.
How could it have happened, then? "Big universities are complicated places," laments Philip Cagan, a recently retired professor of economics at Columbia. "Nobody knows what anybody else is doing."

Smaller Stocks Rise, As Dow Average Falls 16.26
Smaller issues took the leadership role in a mixed stock market. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.40 points, to 1,138.70, establishing its third new record of the week. And the American Stock Exchange market value index climbed 2.80 points, to 585.88, marking its fourth consecutive record and its 18th high this year. 
 But the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.26 points, to 5,535.48, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased just 1.46 points, to 645.07. A series of computer-assisted sell orders and the simultaneous expiration of options on stocks and on stock indexes fed the market's gyrations. [Page 37.]
 
Open short positions reached a record level for the third consecutive month on the New York Stock Exchange, showing expectations of declines ahead. On the American Stock Exchange, short interest was at its highest level since its peak in October 1994. [35.]
 
 
Archer-Daniels Settlement in Doubt
A Federal judge cast doubt on the proposed $45 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit accusing Archer-Daniels Midland and three competitors of price-fixing, saying Archer's $25 million share may be too low. United States District Judge Milton Shadur ordered attorneys for both sides to revise court filings to indicate the settlement reserve. [34.]
 
Westinghouse Considers 2 Stocks
Westinghouse Electric, the nation's biggest broadcaster since acquiring CBS in November, said that it was weighing the idea of separate stocks for its broadcasting and industrial operations. Westinghouse also said it would take a charge of $813 million, or $1.85 a share, to sell its environmental services businesses, close a Florida plant and adopt accounting changes. [34.]
 
Ascent to Acquire Spectravision
Ascent Entertainment Group agreed to acquire the assets of Spectravision, a rival company in pay-per-view television, which has been operating under bankruptcy-law protection, in exchange for canceling $600 million in debt. [35.]
 
Freer Use of Nicotine Patches
Smokers should be able to buy two brands of nicotine patches without a prescription, a panel recommended to the F.D.A. Over-the-counter sales of the nicotine gum Nicorette started this week. [9.]
 
Mexicans Pirate U.S. Software
Mexican piracy of American music, film and software is a major trade issue in the making that the Clinton Administration is not eager to confront right now. But after losing an estimated $485 million annually to Mexican pirates in recent years, American audiovisual industries have set off alarm bells about illegal entrepreneurs who violate both Mexican laws and the tough copyright standards of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. [1.]
 
U.S. and China Hold Talks
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, opened talks in the Hague in an effort to resolve disputes over trade and software piracy -- for which Washington has threatened $2 billion in retaliatory sanctions -- among other issues. [5.]
 
Treasury Securities Rally in Price
Prices of Treasury securities turned higher, ending a three-day slump, sending the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.78 percent, from 6.83 percent on Thursday. One reason was overseas buying in the wake of Thursday's interest rate cut by the Bundesbank, which led to cuts throughout Europe. [43.]
 
The dollar rallied, responding to a new report of German economic malaise and uncertainty over the outcome of high-level meetings of finance ministers this weekend in Washington. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.5120 German marks from 1.5015 marks on Thursday and to 107.36 yen, from 106.65 yen. [36.]
 
Wheat futures prices jumped 7.5 cents to $6.08 a bushel in Chicago as wet soil conditions in the northern Plains delayed spring plantings. Copper and crude oil contracts rose. [36.]

HEADLINE: Small Stocks Lift Nasdaq; Dow Declines 16.26 Points

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Smaller issues took the leadership role yesterday in a mixed stock market.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.40 points, to 1,138.70, establishing its third new record this week. And the American Stock Exchange market value index climbed 2.80 points, to 585.88, marking its fourth consecutive record and its 18th high this year. 
 But the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.26 points, to 5,535.48, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased just 1.46 points, to 645.07. These market actions were spurred by a series of computer-assisted sell orders and the simultaneous expiration of options on individual stocks and options on stock indexes.
"The market is shifting into the smaller-to-mid-size companies that have underperformed the Dow and the top 50 stocks in the S.& P.," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist of Legg Mason. "Small-cap stocks were relatively more attractive than the bigger guys."
Advancing issues outpaced decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,390 to 915. Turnover on the Big Board was 422.4 million shares, compared with 415.2 million shares on Thursday.
Bond yields moved lower, and analysts forecast that inflation would remain under control. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.78 percent from 6.83 percent Thursday.
Software stocks were higher yesterday, starting with Microsoft, the country's largest software company, which reported a better-than-expected 42 percent profit increase after the close of the market on Thursday. Microsoft gained 3/4, to 109 3/4; Pure Software vaulted 4 3/4, to 41, and Shiva Corporation added 9 1/2, to 108.
The report also lent strength to computer makers. Compaq gained 7/8, to 41 7/8, and Digital Equipment rose 1 5/8, to 54 3/8, in active trading on the Big Board. On Nasdaq, Dell Computer rose 1/8, to 41 1/4. But I.B.M., which has been battered this week after issuing a cautious outlook in an otherwise strong earnings report, struggled again, losing 1/8, to 105 3/8.
Drug issues continued to show strength in reaction to good first-quarter results. For instance, Eli Lilly closed at 60 3/4, up 1 7/8, and Pfizer closed at 70, up 1 1/4.
Regional telephone companies also finished in positive ground. Reports that merger plans were close to being resolved helped push Bell Atlantic up 2 1/2, to 65, and Nynex up 1/4, to 53. Bell South, which was upgraded by Cowan & Company, advanced 1, to 39 1/8.
In contrast, the two giant soft drink stocks, Coca-Cola and Pepsico, retreated amid concern that a strengthening dollar would negatively affect their international operations. Coke slipped 3/4, to 78 3/4, and Pepsi gave up 3/8, to 61.
Tobacco companies, which also have major operations outside the United States, declined on dampened prospects for foreign earnings growth. Philip Morris closed at 88 1/8, off 1 1/8, and RJR Nabisco closed at 29 5/8, off 1/8.
Paper issues were weak, and analysts cited profit-taking. International Paper fell 1 1/8, to 39 1/2; Georgia-Pacific dropped 7/8, to 73, and Boise Cascade eased 1/8, to 45 1/8.
Kimberly-Clark fell 1, to 69 7/8, after saying that it would sell its remaining shares in Midwest Express Airlines. EMC Corporation slumped 1 3/4, to 18 1/2, after Merrill Lynch lowered its earnings estimate for 1996. Zycad, which said that it expected to report a first-quarter loss, dropped 15/16 , to 51/16 . And Alternative Resources fell 11/16 , to 33 1/2, on slightly lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue.
Two widely-touted initial public offerings began trading yesterday, and their prices spurted. Planet Hollywood soared 8 7/8, to 26 7/8, and was the most actively-traded stock during the session. Compuserve jumped 3, to 33, and was the second most actively traded stock for the day.
The New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market observed a moment of silence at 10:02 A.M. to remember the victims of the bombing last year in Oklahoma City.
Tokyo's Nikkei stock average rose 71.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to close at 21,883.84, yesterday.

HEADLINE: 90's Revival: Positive Power of Thinking

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Few legends haunt the imagination of New Yorkers of a certain intellectual or literary bent more than tales of the circles, salons and other highbrow hobnobbings that were once a feature of city life.
It has become de rigueur in some quarters to dismiss the possibility that anything these days could measure up, to opine wearily that such circles have vanished and that intellectual life is heading that way, too. 
 Yet throughout New York City, people are consciously (sometimes self-consciously) resuscitating the tradition, flocking together in a ritual that can simultaneously stimulate the mind, the heart and the gut.
One high-powered set -- including Susan Sontag, Denis Donoghue, Robert Silvers and others -- convenes weekly over sandwiches, designer water and wine in plastic cups to ponder such topics as the relativity of truth.
A coterie of conservative writers and editors pushing 40 (Yale, the Manhattan Institute, The Wall Street Journal) organized a salon that went on to spawn a book of essays on politics and culture written by salon regulars.
A loose circle of young magazine writers gravitates on weekends to a couple of houses in Garrison and Cold Spring, N.Y., an area some of them have taken to calling Bloomsbury-on-Hudson. ("It's a joke! It's a joke!")
In a loft above Dragon Auto Repair on the fringe of Hell's Kitchen, in East Village apartments, salons have been serving up everything from discourse on beauty and evil to quiche and literary gossip.
And in a bar called Mare Chiaro on Mulberry Street in Little Italy every Friday night, a 33-year-old editor on the staff of The Paris Review convenes a roomful of young fiction writers, screenwriters, editors and publishing-industry types.
"I started to pull friends together out of a kind of quaint notion that New York, at its best, is like a series of small towns," the editor, James Linville, said. "It's a series of circles, of overlapping circles."
One evening recently, George Plimpton stopped by and found the place packed. "I was deeply impressed," Mr. Plimpton, who edits The Paris Review, said. "It was like Elaine's in the old days."
New York City is still, in many ways, a city of circles (especially if the term is liberally defined). The circles are formal, informal, calculated, impulsive. They range from purposeful to purposeless.
One group of writers with interests in boxing, policing and politics meets regularly at Supreme Macaroni Co. in Chelsea for what Jack Newfield, one of the organizers, calls "pasta, pugilism and rap sheets."
At the on-line salon Echo, a six-year-long discussion of the work of Thomas Pynchon is still in progress. On the Upper West Side, a writer only half-jokes that his rotisserie baseball association has become his intellectual circle.
 
Freelance Thinking: A Lost Way of Life
But these days are not the old days, Mare Chiaro notwithstanding. Many people agree that intellectual and literary life is not what it was in earlier decades, when the Algonquin Round Table and later the Partisan Review crowd indelibly defined two types of New York circle.
Gone are the fierce ideological struggles that galvanized earlier generations. Gone is a culture, an economy, a way of life that made it easier back then to subsist in New York City as a freelance thinker.
Universities have swallowed up many intellectuals, scattering them across the country. Intellectual life has become increasingly balkanized, people say, with its many duchies circumscribed by politics and specialization.
The publishing industry, too, has absorbed many among the intellectually inclined into its expanding embrace. They now devote themselves, critics complain, to work that has strayed far from the realm of ideas in pursuit of topicality and profit.
"I never hear people talk about ideas," said Jim Holt, a writer who does commentary on American culture for the BBC. "The only people who talk about ideas at book parties and cocktail parties always turn out to be interns."
"They're the only ones who haven't been jaded by the volume of gossip and the incredible velocity with which it moves," he added. "It tends to drive anything related to ideas out of conversational currency."
Social changes, too, have made it difficult to follow the old patterns. Work seems to have intensified, socializing to have declined. With intellectual life more cosmopolitan, some circles survive primarily by telephone or on line.
"With a culture more compartmentalized, work more competitive, insecurity more rampant," said Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, "I think you're not finding spontaneous croppings of social, cultural, intellectual exchange in the way you did."

A 'Talk Tank' Of Intellectuals
Yet on a recent Friday in a house in Greenwich Village, dozens of big thinkers turned out for the weekly lunch of the New York Institute for the Humanities, the city's best-known gathering of card-carrying intellectuals.
There was Anne Hollander, president of the PEN American Center, talking with Ms. Sontag, the novelist and critic, whose son, David Rieff, the journalist, was sharing a table with Louis Menand, the critic, and Richard Howard, the poet. There was Joanne Akalaitis, the director, next to Jonathan Schell, the author, next to Mitchell Cohen, co-editor of Dissent.
"Usually Robert Silvers comes last and eats nothing but grapes and sits in the back taking mysterious and copious notes," said Jocelyn Carlson Baltzell, the institute's assistant director. Mr. Silvers is co-editor of The New York Review of Books.
Ms. Baltzell likes to call the institute a "talk tank." Started in 1977 to promote intellectual cross-fertilization, it has become what some members describe as an intellectual lunch club. There is food and a talk, usually by someone smart working on a new book. Then there is a discussion, ranging in tone from respectful to what one member called "nail the speaker."
One subgroup within the institute has become something of a circle itself -- a group of writers, mostly in their 40's, some of whom have set out to carry on the tradition of the earlier New York intellectuals.
The group includes Mr. Menand, Paul Berman, Katha Pollitt, Andrew Delbanco and others inside and outside the institute whose hallmark has become the kind of critical essay they publish in magazines like The New Republic and The New Yorker.
If no great cause unifies them, the group is seen as loosely allied by friendship, age and a suspicion of academic intellectual discourse. They bump into one another mostly in the pages of magazines but also occasionally over lunch, at the institute or at events like a recent conference at Princeton University celebrating the centenary of Edmund Wilson's birth.
Ten to 15 years behind that group is another circle of writers and editors, mostly in their early 30's -- politically contrarian and skeptical about ideology. They include Jacob Weisberg, national political columnist for New York magazine; Michael Lewis, who wrote "Liar's Poker," and a half-dozen other friends associated with magazines like The New Republic, The New Yorker and Lingua Franca.
Mr. Lewis and Mr. Weisberg, who lived in the same building in Washington when they worked for The New Republic, have each bought houses, one in Cold Spring and the other in Garrison, where they spend weekends. Mr. Weisberg holed up there last summer and wrote his book "In Defense of Government," which is due out this month. Mr. Lewis rattles off a roster of writers whom he has "dragged up" to stay in his gray-shingled house.
"He proselytizes," Mr. Weisberg said of Mr. Lewis. "His fantasy is to turn this into a writers' paradise."
One of Mr. Lewis's pastimes there is hiking, he said. He can be found from time to time on Breakneck Ridge in the company of Philip Weiss, the journalist and novelist, who is also an inhabitant of Cold Spring.
Another circle, more tightly bound by a sense of ideological mission, is composed of conservative writers and editors with ties to The Wall Street Journal, the Manhattan Institute and various conservative magazines.
Some of them, like Richard Brookhiser and Walter Olson, met at Yale in the 1970's. Lisa Schiffren met Mr. Olson in Washington, where she wrote Vice President Dan Quayle's Murphy Brown speech. David Frum worked on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, which he describes as a "switching point" through which conservatives meet. In the late 1980's, they and a few others coalesced as a group.
For a while, they passed continually in and out of a brownstone in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where Mr. Olson and Steve Pippin held small dinner parties several times a month and garden parties timed to the roses. After one such party, Terry Teach out, a music critic, who had been reading about salons, invited a dozen friends to a meeting at a Chinese restaurant near the Empire State Building. They agreed to organize a conservative salon.
 
The Vile Body In a Town House
They named it The Vile Body. (They had all read Evelyn Waugh.) Until several years ago, it met monthly in a town house on the Upper East Side occupied by the Manhattan Institute. "It looked like a cocktail party," Mr. Teachout recalled. "The difference was, it was a cocktail party of like-minded people." In 1990, the group produced a book, "Beyond the Boom: New Voices on American Life, Culture and Politics."
But salons and circles are not necessarily easy to sustain. Mr. Teach out said he became too busy to continue managing The Vile Body. Since it folded in the early 90's, success and age have gnawed at the circle.
Mr. Olson and Mr. Pippin moved to Wilton, Conn., where they still entertain their friends, but less often. Others in the group married, had children, moved away. These days, the group contents itself with regular phone calls and occasional shared meals.
There is a natural history to such groups, Mr. Teachout said. "They're not permanent undertakings. They fulfill a function at a certain point in the trajectories of the lives of the people who take part."
Other recent salons have met with related difficulties.
Sam Pratt, the 27-year-old founder of a zine called Ersatz that devotes entire issues to things like bumper stickers and hair, organized a salon of sorts in the early 90's in his loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. When he moved to the Dragon Auto Repair building on West 37th Street, he tried to continue. But he finally gave up, out of what he describes as "pure exhaustion, wear and tear."
Liesl Schillinger, a 29-year-old freelance writer and fact checker for The New Yorker, has held a salon in her East Village apartment since mid-1994. But Ms. Schillinger, too, says she is calling it quits, in deference to a downstairs neighbor. "I wish that my house was bigger and my floors were thicker," she said glumly.

Reading Together, Staying Together
But at least one group seems to have defied Mr. Teachout's principle of the impermanence of circles. The Proust group, as it is called, first convened in 1971 with the intention of reading all of Proust. It is currently celebrating its 25th year, having polished off Proust long ago.
The idea began with Ashton Hawkins, now executive vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Robert MacDonald, a publisher of golf books, who had known each other as undergraduates at Harvard in the late 50's.
Mr. Hawkins had remembered a professor's admonition that students who had not read all of Proust by graduation could take no comfort when the Harvard president welcomed them into "the company of educated men and women."
So Mr. Hawkins, Mr. MacDonald and a third Harvard friend gathered a dozen acquaintances they considered intellectually compatible and started meeting for dinner on Sunday evenings once a month during the academic year.
They enjoyed Proust so much, they decided to move on to others. They went through Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Balzac, Flaubert, Stendhal, Mann, Faulkner, Austen, Trollope. Twenty years out, the group read Proust again.
For a quarter-century, the membership has remained relatively stable at about a dozen. A few people divorced and left. Last summer, two members died within three weeks of each other.
"As we've grown older and people have gotten sick and died or divorced," said Mr. MacDonald, who turns 60 this month, "we've all become close friends. More and more, you begin to look forward to not just reading the book but the little dinner and the group."
"In a sense, this is the longest commitment to a single group that most of the people in the group have ever made. It's an oasis, and a somewhat intellectual oasis, in this loud culture of ours, which most of us are now beginning to drift away from.
"I think it fulfils a need in all of us, perhaps in different ways, that we're not fully aware of. E. M. Forster always talked about being able to connect. This is a way to connect."

HEADLINE: Dole, Citing 'Crisis' in the Courts, Attacks Appointments by Clinton

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole said today that President Clinton's judicial appointments had caused a "crisis" in the courts and in a move eagerly sought by conservatives, he promised to expel the American Bar Association from the judicial screening process.
Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, has voted for 182 of Mr. Clinton's 185 appointees to the Federal bench and for both of his nominees to the Supreme Court, although he said today that he gave that support "out of deference to a President's constitutional prerogative." Nonetheless, Mr. Dole warned that Mr. Clinton's re-election would undermine the judiciary with "an all-star team of liberal leniency." 
 In a speech on the judiciary at a meeting here of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Mr. Dole said re-electing Mr. Clinton, who has already appointed nearly 25 percent of all sitting Federal judges, "could lock in liberal judicial activism for the next generation, and the social landscape could dramatically change."
"More Federal intrusion in the lives of average Americans," he said. "More centralized power in Washington. Less freedom of religious expression. More rights for criminals. And more arrogant disregard of the rights of law-abiding citizens."
Clinton Administration officials immediately threw cold water on Mr. Dole's charges, saying that the President's appointees were hardly more liberal than those appointed by President Bush. They said Mr. Dole, by opposing the ban on assault weapons, was soft of crime and was trying to divert attention from his party's capitulation to the National Rifle Association.
"The A.B.A. is a totally phoney issue," said Jack Quinn, the White House counsel. "The real issue here is that, No. 1, the President has appointed moderate, mainstream judges. That's why Bob Dole voted for 98 percent of them. No. 2, Senator Dole's tired, worn-out complaint is just a smokescreen for what has been an abysmal, embarrassing record on crime. It was Bill Clinton who fought to put 100,000 cops on the street, to get cop-killer bullets off the street, for the Brady handgun bill and to ban assault weapons."
But Mr. Dole said the judiciary was, in part, responsible for crime. "If we're looking for root causes of the crime explosion," he said, "this is clearly one of them: I'm speaking of the crisis in our courts, the crisis in our legal system, and the crisis of confidence this is causing in America." His chief remedy, he said, would be to shut out the "narrowly partisan and ideologically liberal" American Bar Association from its semi-official role in the screening process, something favored but never permanently accomplished by Presidents Ronald Reagan or George Bush. (Attorney General Dick Thornburgh briefly suspended the practice but later reinstated it).
In its place, Mr. Dole said he would appoint a panel of police, prosecutors, crime victims, legal scholars and others to review appointments.
Mr. Dole's campaign advisers described today's speech as "the start of framing this election vis-a-vis Clinton," and said they planned future speeches on other topics, including the economy and values.
But in the Dole campaign's vigorous promotion of this contentious issue and the Administration's equally energetic response -- including a pre-emptive strike by the Vice President on Thursday -- today's speech marked a new, more tactical phase of the Presidential campaign.
The matter of the American Bar Association seemed a particularly obscure for a Presidential campaign.
Since 1955, successive Administrations have allowed the A.B.A. a special role in independently evaluating judicial nominees. But conservatives have loathed the process since 1987, when four of the 15 members of the association's screening committee rated Judge Robert Bork "unqualified" and helped doom his nomination to the Supreme Court.
William E. Leuchtenburg, visiting professor of legal history at Duke University Law School, said in an interview that both Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had made judicial appointments issues in their Presidential campaigns, but he doubted they had influenced many voters' decisions.
Mr. Leuchtenburg said he was struck that Mr. Dole would call Mr. Clinton's appointments liberal, since "what most people say is how moderate they have been. He has not taken advantage of his tenure as President to offset the decidedly ideological appointments that Reagan and Bush made in the 1980s."
But Dole officials treated the speech as a major event. They held a background briefing for reporters and released an advance text and fact sheets, a far more assertive approach than the Dole campaign customarily makes with the media.
They said that over the next five days, squads of Republican officials, including Senators, Governors and state attorneys general, would be echoing Mr. Dole's comments. The first statements clogging newsroom fax machines this afternoon came from some of those who have been angling to be Mr. Dole's Vice Presidential running mate.
Dole aides said they wanted to signal that they were running "a very aggressive, issue-oriented campaign" that included their own interpretation, or "political spin," apparently something they felt has been lacking as their candidate trails Mr. Clinton in the run-up to the November election -- by as much as 18 points in the latest national poll by The Los Angeles Times.
In fact the Administration has been anticipating this attack for weeks. President Clinton himself upbraided one of his own appointees, Judge Harold Baer of New York, who had thrown out evidence in a drug case and said he could understand why people in one neighborhood would flee the police.
Mr. Dole called for Judge Baer's impeachment. The judge recently reversed himself.
At the same time, the well-oiled Clinton machine, known for its rapid response to criticism, even had Vice President Al Gore try to pre-empt Mr. Dole's speech the day before. On Thursday, Mr. Gore spoke to the same group, where he noted that more of Mr. Clinton's judicial appointees had received the highest rating from the American Bar Association than the appointees of any of the three previous Presidents. Moreover, he said, 40 percent of them served as criminal prosecutors.
In addition, the Democratic National Committee today launched a new television commercial that paints Mr. Clinton as tough on crime and Mr. Dole as soft.
Dole aides said today that Mr. Gore's speech was a sign that the Dole campaign had succeeded in hitting a nerve. "I didn't hear Gore yesterday defend any of these liberal judges that we've been talking about," said one Dole official.
Indeed, after Mr. Dole singled out four Clinton appointees today as particularly irresponsible, even though he voted for two of them, Clinton officials did not rush to their defense. The judges named by Mr. Dole were Judge Baer, Leonie Brinkema in Virginia, Rosemary Barkett in Florida, and H. Lee Sarokin in New Jersey.
"We're not going to get into a tit for tat," said George Stephanopoulos, an adviser to the President. "For every Clinton judge they can pull out, we can pull out a Reagan or Bush judge who might have a similar isolated decision."
Unlike Patrick J. Buchanan, who has called judges "little dictators in black robes," Mr. Dole did not call for term limits for judges.
The Bar Association defended its role in rating judicial nominees. "The American Bar Assocition's standing committee has done a very important service for the American people since the Eisenhower Administration, using first-rate lawyers to evaluate potential nominees for the Federal bench," said Roberta Cooper Ramo, the president.
Ms. Ramo said that the committee evaluates potential judges on the basis of their reputation for integrity, ability to write clearly, judicial temperament and their experience and understanding of the law. "None of these things have to do with ideology," she said. "The A.B.A. isn't a political organization in any way."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR INSECURITY -- A special report.;
Russia Struggles in Long Race To Prevent an Atomic Theft

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 19

 BODY:
When scientists from the Kurchatov Institute go to work at Building 116, getting in the door is no simple matter.
First, they slide computerized identification cards into a cage-like booth at the entranceway. Then they punch in a secret code, while a computer determines their weight to verify their identity. 
 If everything checks out, the rear of the booth opens up, admitting them into the building.
The need for security is clear. Situated within the city limits of Russia's bustling capital, Building 116 contains enough highly enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs.
Two years after the first reports that nuclear material had been smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, Washington and Moscow are already collaborating on an ambitious program -- unthinkable during the cold war -- to safeguard Russia's nuclear materials. The result has been to help Russia, as well as other former Soviet republics, make steady if slow progress toward protecting nuclear bomb ingredients.
Still, security systems like those at Building 116 -- part of a premier nuclear institute named after the father of the Russian bomb -- remain the exception, not the rule.
Of 28 areas at the Kurchatov Institute where bomb-grade materials are stored, only two have the most up-to-date and stringent security procedures. Officials say it will take another year or two to include them all.
Russian specialists predict that it will take as long as a decade to protect and account for the vast store of nuclear materials scattered at sites across the former Soviet Union. The current shaky system of controls is one of the main reasons why leaders of the industrialized nations have come to Moscow for a summit meeting this weekend.
"That is the scale of the task," said Aleksandr N. Roumiantsev, a senior official at the institute. "All of these must be provided with physical security and each case is very specific."
During the cold war, the Soviet Union produced a monumental 1,300 tons of highly enriched uranium and nearly 220 tons of plutonium, much of it still spread widely throughout former Soviet republics at poorly guarded sites, including plants alarmingly close to war zones and aspiring nuclear states.
And while important headway is being made, the push to secure nuclear materials has been constrained by a lack of money, a growing nationalist feeling spurred on by Russia's election-year politics and lingering doubts within the Russian and American militaries.
The Russians have backed away from a 1994 agreement to share data, and from a deal to shut down three plutonium-producing reactors by 2000. American suspicions have also posed problems, with the Navy reluctant to allow Russian officials to visit its nuclear storage sites.
So far there is no evidence that nuclear materials have been acquired by would-be nuclear powers or terrorist groups. But some experts say that the money and effort to guard against theft must be doubled, and that Russia and the other former Soviet republics are in a race against time.
 
New Dangers
Threat of Theft Is Main Worry Now
The breakup of the Soviet Union cost Moscow its most reliable safeguard of nuclear materials: the iron grip of its police state.
Porous borders, relaxed Government controls, the growth of criminal gangs and the declining prestige and wages of nuclear scientists in Russia have all combined to create a new danger: theft of the essential incredients of a nuclear bomb.
"The chilling reality is that nuclear materials and technologies are more accessible now than at any other time in history, due primarily to the dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the region's worsening economic conditions," John Deutch, the director of Central Intelligence, told Congress last month.
Nuclear materials are also widely scattered throughout the former Soviet Union, at 40 to 50 locations. At these sites, there are 1,500 to 2,000 specific areas where nuclear materials are handled, according to Russian officials.
Complicating the task is the Soviet system of accounting for nuclear materials, which relied largely on records of the production of nuclear materials, instead of sophisticated scientific measurements.
The system is so inexact that Russia still does not know the precise quantity and disposition of nuclear material at many of its sites. A more scientific system has been mandated, but Russia is only in the early stages of developing it.
The problem is not Russia's alone.
On the shores of the Caspian Sea, not far from Iran, the Kazakstani reactor at Aktau has emerged as a special worry for American experts.
Fueled with uranium with a 30 percent level of enrichment, the reactor produces "ivory grade" plutonium, which is even better for bombs than the weapons-grade plutonium generally used.
The plutonium is contained in the spent reactor fuel that is kept in a cooling pond near the reactor. To be used for military purposes, the plutonium would have to be chemically separated, a procedure that does not require advanced technology if the fuel has been in the pond long enough for its radioactivity to cool.
But now that Kazakstan is an independent country, the Russians have refused to transport the spent fuel to Russia for safekeeping.
Concerned that Iran may try to acquire either fuel from the reactor or spent fuel from the cooling ponds, the United States Department of Energy has already begun an effort to improve security there, but the work is not yet completed.
Officials from the C.I.A. say that Iranian agents tried to acquire nuclear materials from the Ulba Metallurgial Plant in Kazakstan in 1992 and have been involved in other smuggling efforts.
American officials are also worried about a small cache of enriched uranium at a laboratory near Tbilisi, Georgia, in the volatile Caucasus. They fear the supply, less than a bomb's worth, might somehow find its way to Chechen rebels.
Russian plants have already been targeted by thieves. In 1994 almost six pounds of highly enriched uranium believed to have originated in the former Soviet Union was seized by the Czech police, the largest recorded seizure, but less nuclear material than would be needed for a bomb.
Depots for nuclear fuel for Russian submarines and icebreakers, some of which has also been singled out by thieves, are also a concern.
Mr. Deutch, the C.I.A. director, told Congress last month that a comprehensive review by American intelligence officials concluded that as yet, "none of these facilities in Russia or other newly independent states has adequate safeguards or security measures by international standards for weapons-usable materials."
 
Slow Progress
Improving Security Could Take Years
There are some significant signs of progress.
The United States and Russia, for example, have already agreed to improve security at over 30 locations that account for more 70 percent of the places where Russia stores significant quantities of bomb-grade materials.
The Institute of Physics and Power Engineering, a civilian plant with large quantities of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, is a case in point. It is at Obninsk, an area only recently opened to foreigners and Russians without special security clearance.
But under the most optimistic American Government estimates, it will take six years to carry out the planned security improvements in Russia at the current level of funding. Russians say it will probably take longer.
American officials also hope the Russians will use their experience in working with the United States and apply new security and accounting procedures to the most secret domains of their nuclear empire, including the nuclear weapons production and dismantlement facilities that remain off limits.
Pavel V. Oleynikov, a specialist from Chelyabinsk-70, said six American nuclear laboratories were helping to develop security systems for several research reactors at the complex. Situated in a closed area in the Ural Mountains, Chelyabinsk-70 is one of Russia's primary nuclear design centers.
Mr. Oleynikov said Russian scientists hoped to expand the security improvements to far more sensitive parts of the complex and to similar plants in the Urals and in Siberia, which American specialists are not now allowed to visit.
Russian and American officials are taking the same approach at Arzamas-16, another major nuclear weapons design center.
One development that has speeded progress is the effort by American nuclear laboratories to work directly with Russian nuclear institutes and complexes, using American money to underwrite the development of Russian security systems. Earlier efforts were hampered by red tape within both Governments and by the requirement that most American money be funneled to American contractors.
Still, difficult problems remain.
While the two sides are discussing the problem of protecting nuclear fuel for submarines and icebreakers, American experts have not yet been to these storage centers. That issue has been complicated by the United States Navy's reluctance to allow Russian officials to visit its storage sites.
And other efforts are moving even slower, if at all.
To enable specialists to better understand the scope of the nuclear security problem, President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed in 1994 to exchange information on how many warheads and how much fissionable material each country has.
The two sides also agreed to use special radiation-detecting devices to measure the stockpile of nuclear material from dismantled warheads as an indirect way to confirm the number of warheads taken apart.
Sharing such data is not as simple as it seems. Under both country's laws, such steps cannot be carried out until there is a special accord authorizing the exchange. But to the Americans' surprise, the Russians called off talks in November to develop such a legal framework.
Officially, Russia says there are technical problems. But Valery Bogdan, the business manager of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy, acknowledged that politics was also a consideration.
Specifically, the Yeltsin Government has been worried about nationalist charges that it is disclosing Russian secrets. Some American officials also say Washington has not treated the accord as a top priority.
A separate case of backpeddling arose in connection with Russia's much ballyhooed 1994 agreement to shut down three reactors at Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk that produce weapons-grade plutonium.
The reactors also supply heat and energy to the surrounding Siberian communities, and the Russians eventually concluded that they could not afford to replace them with conventional power plants.
"We failed with replacing the military reactors," observed Alexei Yablokov, an environmental adviser to President Yeltsin and a critic of Russia's nuclear establishment.
As a fallback, the United States and Russia are now developing a plan that will allow the reactors to continue operating, while converting them so that they no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium.
 
Uncertain Future
Effort and Costs Grow With Risks
While the political purpose of this weekend's summit meeting is to boost President Yeltsin's election prospects, Western officials also want to use the carefully planned session to cement a new agreement to coordinate efforts against nuclear smuggling.
The summit is also expected to establish an international meeting to develop long-term ways to dispose of plutonium.
American officials want the Russians to commit themselves to a total nuclear test ban, international safety standards for nuclear reactors and the safe disposal of nuclear waste, among other measures.
Some specialists, however, say that for all the summit fanfare, the United States is not moving fast enough.
Clinton Administration officials said they could move quickly by, for example, installing security checks at Russian nuclear installations, if the Congress would provide additional money.
And John P. Holdren, a nuclear scientist who helped prepared a classified report on nuclear smuggling for the White House, recently urged a doubling of American assistance for the protection and accounting of nuclear materials, an increase that would raise the level of money in 1996 to $150 million. He also urged more money to combat nuclear smuggling and to buy highly enriched uranium from Russia.
In a letter to Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Mr. Holdren acknowledged that his proposal might appear expensive.
But he added: "The costs and risk of inaction -- in both lower security and higher defense expenditures should weapons-usuable nuclear material fall into hands unfriendly to the United States -- would be far higher than the cost of timely preventative action today."

HEADLINE: LEBANON FIGHTING DEFIES DIPLOMACY AFTER DEATH OF 75

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 19

 BODY:
Despite a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the fighting, and despite the global outcry over the fiery killing of at least 75 Lebanese civilians by Israeli guns on Thursday, exchanges of shells and rockets in southern Lebanon continued unabated for the ninth day today.
The mass deaths generated a swirl of diplomatic moves to secure a cease-fire, involving, at last count, the United States, France, Russia, the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial nations. 
 Diplomatic leaders were converging on Syria, which dominates Lebanon and has sanctioned the attacks by anti-Israeli guerrillas there, and also holds the key to reining them in.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected in Damascus on Saturday, along with Foreign Ministers Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia, Herve de Charette of France and Susanna Agnelli of Italy. Mr. Christopher's chief Middle East coordinator, Dennis Ross, met with Israeli leaders today and is also headed for Syria on Saturday.
There were reports that senior officials of Lebanon, Iran and Hezbollah, the fundamentalist Muslim organization against which Israel staged its attacks in southern Lebanon, met today with Syrian officials in Damascus.
Through it all, the mutual shelling continued. Israeli military officers said their strikes had been scaled down in the aftermath of Thursday's disastrous strike against a United Nations base packed with refugees. But Israeli military and Government leaders defiantly insisted that they had had no choice but to press the fight in parallel with the diplomatic efforts.
Israeli security officials reported that guerrillas of Hezbollah, or the Party of God, had fired 65 Katyusha rockets today, and that Israeli artillery, helicopters and gunboats had shelled targets across southern Lebanon. Gunships reportedly shelled a Palestinian refugee camp near Tyre and the main coastal road near the port.
[Israeli fighter planes struck again early Saturday near villages southeast of Tyre, Reuters reported, quoting local witnesses.]
Though everyone involved expressed hope for a quick cease-fire, estimates on when one might be reached varied widely. Syrian and French officials spoke of a cease-fire within 24 to 48 hours, and Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said, "It's possible -- it's not certain, but there is a chance."
The Americans, however, were more cautious. "I'd steer you away from any reports that something is imminent," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, who was in Moscow with President Clinton.
Mr. Christopher told reporters in The Hague: "I hope we're drawing closer. I use the word 'hope' because we're not quite there."
There was no immediate word on what might be holding up a cease-fire. What was clear was that Israel was determined for now to press on with its military actions and to achieve its goals. Though Israel has never spelled those out in detail, the primary one is to secure a Syrian guarantee that Hezbollah will cease firing rockets into Israel.
Mr. Peres decided to continue the attacks at an emergency meeting of his Cabinet on Thursday evening. There, Foreign Minister Ehud Barak and other ministers argued that Israel would lose any chance of achieving any of the operation's goals if it agreed to halt fire before reaching an agreement, according to Israeli news reports.
Mr. Peres has appeared stern and determined since the killings at the United Nations base.
At his news conference on Thursday night, he declared that he had "sorrow in his heart" over the loss of civilian lives, but he stopped well short of an apology. He insisted that Hezbollah was solely to blame for forcing Israel's hand and for hiding behind civilians, and that Israel was within its rights in attacking a rocket launching site, even if it was near a United Nations base.
Today his chief peace negotiator, Uri Savir, maintained the tough line. "If the Katyusha attacks continue, there will be no cease-fire," he said. "The Syrians are acting like they have tough nerves. This is no doubt a difficult and sad day, but we too have strong nerves."
Mr. Peres and his military commanders insisted that Israeli gunners acted within their standing orders in returning fire after Hezbollah guerrillas launched two Katyusha rockets and eight mortar rounds from a site only a few hundred yards from the United Nations base. Several Israeli artillery rounds slammed into shelters packed with Lebanese civilians.
A military officer said that the Israeli soldiers knew where the United Nations base was, but that their orders were to return fire immediately. Officers insisted that the gunners were not aware of the refugees, and that they had followed standard procedures in warning the Fijian troops to take cover.
But United Nations officials said that the first artillery rounds landed at 2:13 P.M., and that the warning had come only at 2:16 P.M.
Despite widespread dismay among Israelis over the images of shattered bodies and the accompanying chorus of condemnation from abroad, many Israelis seemed to share the Government's conviction that Israel had been left no choice but to act militarily to halt Hezbollah's attacks.
"It hurt me, just like it hurt to see the attacks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, but we need security," said Orly Jordan, sitting with her husband in their grocery store in Jerusalem. "These people are playing with human lives. What happened was a war, a war of survival. I don't justify it, but there was no alternative."
Others seemed horrified that the Government seemed to be treating the killings as simply the cost of war.
"As Jews, it doesn't befit us to do such things," said an elderly women walking with her grandchildren. "We're not supposed to make war on women and children. I can't turn on the TV and see the scenes. I'm ashamed to see them. It's not enough to say we're sorry."
Part of the Israeli dismay was a profound disappointment that what was initially promoted as a "surgical operation" that promised to achieve peace without undue casualties or reproaches turned into a debacle in which Israel might be forced to return to where it began, with little to show for the operation.
"Suddenly, everybody woke up to the fact that Lebanon is Lebanon and war is war, that there's no such thing as a clean war," said Hemi Shalev, a commentator for the newspaper Maariv. "I would assume that this has lowered expectations about what can be achieved as a result of the operation. This is probably positive, because expectations were too high."
"The key as usual is the American-Syrian channel, what sort of influence Americans can bring on Assad," he said referring to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. "It always gets back to the same place."
After similar Israeli attacks in 1993, the United States brokered an unwritten agreement that neither side would strike the other's civilians. Israel opened the current strike after charging that Hezbollah had interpreted the agreement to mean that it could strike at the Israelis from civilian villages, and that any retaliatory Israeli strike entitled the guerrillas to send rockets into northern Israel.
With the current operation, the Israelis hoped to secure firm, written guarantees from Syria against any more Katyusha attacks, coupled with broad curbs on Hezbollah activities. Though Syria has agreed to return to the 1993 agreement, it has insisted that Israel recognize Hezbollah's right to continue fighting against Israel inside the buffer zone, which Israeli has occupied since withdrawing from the rest of Lebanon in 1985.
At The Hague, Mr. Christopher said the United States was working on a two-stage approach: "The first phase is a cease-fire, and the second would be to have a deepening and a clarification of the 1993 understanding and have this written down."
Israeli television reported tonight that France and Russia had prepared another proposal, calling for an immediate cease-fire followed by the disarming of Hezbollah and an unconditional undertaking by Israel to withdraw from Lebanon.
The Israeli Government issued a warning today that Islamic fundamentalist groups might try to take revenge against Israelis and Jews for Thursday's killings. Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that has been responsible for most of the suicide bombings inside Israel, has warned of creating a "sea of blood" in Tel Aviv.
The Government said in a statement, "Given the threats of revenge attacks against Israeli targets following Israeli army activities in Operation Grapes of Wrath in Lebanon, security has been increased at Israeli and Jewish sites abroad."
Israelis were also concerned about a call today to a French news agency in Beirut by a person claiming to speak for a group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth. The caller said that the group holds Ron Arad, an Israeli airman missing in Lebanon since 1986, and that he would be executed in 48 hours unless the Israelis stopped shelling. There was no immediate way to verify the claim.

HEADLINE: Architects Scaling Down High-Rise Dreams

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
After 29 years as a successful architect, Roger C. Fitzgerald folded up his drafting table two years ago and opened Breadsmith, a bakery in Haddonfield, N.J. Charlotte Hitchcock, whose architecture practice bustled with historic preservation work in the 1980's, now teaches geometry and algebra at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. And Steven M. Grotell, a former Manhattan architect, is now designing on a smaller scale, having traded retail spaces for watch faces.
All are casualties of the implosion of a profession that has left many architects forsaking traditional design work for jobs in related fields and even switching careers altogether. 
 Architecture firms cut their staffs by more than half as construction came to a standstill when the 80's real-estate boom faded, and although work has picked up a bit in the last year or two, the fallout has touched architects of all ages. To sign on with a big-name firm, some architects have volunteered to work for nothing. Others have left New York for Colorado or Texas or ventured to booming countries in the Far East.
The upheavals are reflected in many ways in the profession that is also a distinctive New York subculture with its own rituals and hangouts, where people actually do walk around chatting about "spatial relationships" and "orthogonal movement."
The Parsons School of Design is currently sponsoring a lecture series about alternative careers for architects called "Shifting Trajectories." The speakers include fashion and lighting designers. Progressive Architecture, one of three major journals for the field, was dismantled recently after years of declining readership and advertising.
At Urban Center Books, a Madison Avenue institution with more than 8,000 titles and a favorite haunt of architects, business is less torpid than it was two years ago. But there are still more browsers than buyers. "Books have become a luxury," Nicolas Rojas, the store's program director, said. "In the 1980's, people wanted entire libraries."
According to the New York State Department of Labor, the number of jobs in architectural services in New York City dropped to 6,806 last June, from 8,424 in 1989.
The number of students graduating from architecture schools has remained fairly constant in recent years. But the number of graduates taking the national licensing exam has fallen 31 percent, from 17,000 in 1990 to 11,800 last year. That drop is an indication that students are opting out of traditional architecture careers not only in New York but nationwide where other cities have suffered an economic slowdown.
Many architects who give up traditional building design manage to keep a toehold in the broad latticework of the profession, doing three-dimensional designs for computer software or handling marketing for a publisher of architectural books.
For those who have chosen to jump ship, the decision usually comes after considerable soul-searching in which years of schooling and lifelong dreams are weighed against future prospects. "It was difficult emotionally the first couple of years," said Mr. Grotell, who now designs watches for such clients as Barney's and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "I questioned whether I had abandoned something that I always felt to be sublime."
For Paul A. Pezzutti, a 36-year-old architect in Rumson, N.J., the decision was more pragmatic than painful. His Monmouth County firm cut its staff from 28 employees to 12 in the years after the 1987 stock market crash. He was an associate at the time and was looking to become a principal in the firm. "If we had projected modest growth, that would have been something," he said. "But we went in the opposite direction, and there was no need for another principal of a firm of that size."
Two years ago, Mr. Pezzutti decided to capitalize on a longstanding interest in finance and investing. He took some courses, became licensed to sell mutual funds, annuities and insurance and landed a job in Red Bank, N.J., with the Pellechia Agency, which is part of Equitable, the financial services company.
Apart from the lack of work, two complaints that seem to reverberate through the profession are the low pay -- $24,000 is a generous starting salary -- and the dearth of actual design work. Indeed, the theories and visionary designs learned in architecture school are usually shoved aside in the real world. There, budgets, contracts, construction documents, planning board pitches and oversight take up most of the time.
A pleasing irony for Mr. Grotell, is that he now oversees a multimillion dollar business as a watch designer and earns "20 to 30 times" more than he did as an architect. And that success is allowing him to undergo a rite of passage that had eluded him in the firm he left five years ago: he is designing a house -- his own.
Not all transitions are so effortless. Ms. Hitchcock, the 47-year-old New Haven resident who now teaches at Miss Porter's School, will complete a master's degree in mathematics at Southern Connecticut State University this summer. Occasionally, she accepts an architectural assignment on the side.
"In teaching geometry I get to do a lot of the fun stuff of architecture, like teaching the kids spatial thinking and doing some artwork with them," she said. "But I'm sort of sad whenever I do a little design job. I feel nostalgic."
Even if the real-estate market starts to hum the way it did in the 80's, some architects doubt that they will see a sharp growth in jobs. Drafting jobs, once the province of young architects, can often be done faster and more cheaply with computer-aided design. And government commissions for schools, hospitals and courthouses that carried many architects through the recession have disappeared during the last year, according to Carol Clark, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
William J. Rockwell, 32, counts himself lucky to have been on the staff of a small architectural firm in Manhattan for the last three years. "But it's slow," he said, "and there's a constant threat of layoffs."
As he continues to pay off the $32,000 master's program he completed in 1991 at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, he is "toying with the idea" of leaving architecture for good. His next stop? Multimedia design perhaps, or teaching or film production.
"I know I have talents that could be put to other uses," he said. "But they're antithetical to the noble endeavor proselytized by most architecture schools, which is to make buildings."

HEADLINE: Race an Issue for Democrats In Primary Opposite Helms

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., April 17

 BODY:
It did not happen in the expected way. But once again, race has become a central feature of a campaign to determine whether Jesse Helms returns to the United States Senate.
In 1990, Mr. Helms defeated Harvey Gantt, who had been the first black mayor of Charlotte, with the help of a blunt television advertisement that blamed racial quotas for white unemployment. Six years later, Mr. Gantt is seeking a rematch. But his campaign for the Democratic nomination has been confronted by suggestions, often expressed subliminally, that a white candidate would have a better chance of dethroning Mr. Helms than a black one. 
 Charlie Sanders, a white cardiologist and retired pharmaceutical executive who is running against Mr. Gantt for the Democratic nomination, has made electability the primary rationale for his campaign. While acknowledging that he and Mr. Gantt agree on most issues, Mr. Sanders asserts that he would prove a more elusive target for the always aggressive Mr. Helms because he is a newcomer with little political baggage.
Mr. Sanders, a courtly, soft-spoken Texas native who bears a striking resemblance to George Bush, is careful to say that race plays no role in his calculus of electability. "I don't think race has any place in this campaign," the 64-year-old Durham resident said in an interview. "I think North Carolina has moved beyond that."
But Mr. Gantt and his aides suggest that electability has become a subtle code word for race. And after being caught off-guard by Mr. Helms's tactics six years ago, Mr. Gantt is moving firmly to bring the racial issue into the open so he can combat it on his own terms.
"I think it's wrong for anybody, four years from the 21st century, whether from my opponent or on their own, to suggest that we can't win because of the pigmentation of our skin," Mr. Gantt said this week in a speech to about 120 students at North Carolina A&T University, a predominantly black college in Greensboro. "That is a corrosive and damaging argument."
Whether the argument is having much impact is uncertain. It is clearly a topic of discussion in black political circles, but no black elected official has yet publicly deserted Mr. Gantt for Mr. Sanders.
With the May 7 primary only weeks away, Mr. Gantt is considered the frontrunner. But officials with both campaigns said Mr. Sanders has moved within striking distance. Some of Mr. Sanders's momentum was generated in March, when Mr. Gantt was sidelined for three weeks with pneumonia.
Several prominent black North Carolinians said they personally do not believe that race would handicap Mr. Gantt in a contest against Mr. Helms, a deeply conservative Republican seeking his fifth term. But they said they had heard such speculation from others.
"There's a strong feeling that white North Carolinians will not let a black man beat somebody like Jesse Helms," said the Rev. John Mendez, pastor of Emanuel Baptist Church in Winston-Salem.
Mr. Mendez, who supported Mr. Gantt in 1990, said he was currently uncommitted but was leaning toward Mr. Sanders because he perceives that Mr. Sanders has a stronger organization.
"My posture is I would really like to beat Helms, send him home once and for all, and you can't do that without a strong organization," he said. State Representative H. M. (Mickey) Michaux, a longtime black legislator from Durham, said he would agree that a white candidate would have an easier time defeating Mr. Helms if Mr. Gantt were not so well-known around the state.
Mr. Michaux, who has feuded with Mr. Gantt over the years, said Mr. Sanders is "a very smart man" who had managed to delicately plant the notion that a white challenger would be stronger against Mr. Helms. "That's the subtle message," he said. "It's not that Charlie Sanders is a racist or anything like that. He's just saying something that a lot of people feel."
One measure of Mr. Sanders's success is that black officials like Mr. Michaux have not jumped to endorse Mr. Gantt. When told that Mr. Gantt had asserted in an interview that "Mickey Michaux is supporting Harvey Gantt," Mr. Michaux responded: "He sure is taking a lot for granted. I am not in anybody's camp, O.K.?"
To thwart the electability issue, Mr. Gantt, who is 53, is seeking to provide Mr. Sanders with some of the political baggage that Mr. Sanders says he lacks. "Our basic point about him is he just isn't what he appears to be, in almost every way," said Jim Andrews, Mr. Gantt's campaign manager.
Exhibit A: Despite Mr. Sanders's claim to being a proud and lifelong Democrat, he did not change his registration from independent to Democrat until 1992. He gave President Bush, a longtime friend, a $1,000 campaign contribution in 1991 but gave nothing to the Clinton-Gore campaign. And in 1990, when Mr. Gantt lost to Mr. Helms by a 53 percent to 47 percent margin, Mr. Sanders did not vote. "I screwed up, pure and simple," he said.
"Sounds to me like he's more Republican than Democrat," Mr. Gantt said in an interview.
Mr. Gantt has also criticized Mr. Sanders for appearing in his television advertisements in a white laboratory coat, even though he has not practiced medicine in 15 years. And the Gantt campaign has highlighted Mr. Sanders's wealth. Unlike Mr. Gantt, Mr. Sanders has voluntarily released his tax returns, showing that his income has averaged $1.94 million in each of the last six years. He has loaned his campaign $1.5 million thus far, aides said.
The Gantt campaign has made a major issue, both in debates and advertising, of the role played by Mr. Sanders's former employer, Glaxo Inc., in maintaining high drug prices.
Last year, shortly after Mr. Sanders left as chairman of Durham-based Glaxo, the giant drug company won a lucrative political battle when Congress killed legislation that would have allowed competitors to immediately produce a generic alternative to its popular ulcer medication, Zantac. With 6,000 Glaxo employees in North Carolina, Mr. Helms led the fight against the measure.
The questions about Mr. Sanders's record and Mr. Gantt's race have dominated the primary campaign mainly because the two candidates agree on most major issues -- except the death penalty, which Mr. Sanders supports and Mr. Gantt opposes.
Otherwise, both support abortion rights, gun control and a balanced budget and both oppose the Republicans' proposed spending cuts in Medicare.
Mr. Sanders, who served as chief executive officer of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston before joining the pharmaceutical industry, says he would focus on health care issues, like guaranteeing that displaced workers can keep their insurance. Mr. Gantt stresses education issues, like his proposal to grant an income tax credit of up to $10,000 to middle-class families to offset the cost of college tuition.
As in 1990, Mr. Gantt also emphasizes the story line of his journey out of poverty. Raised in public housing in Charleston, S.C., he became the first black student at Clemson University, founded a successful architectural firm and served two terms as Mayor. "I am the embodiment of the American dream," he said.
But it is distinctly un-American, he said, to suggest that he cannot defeat Mr. Helms in 1996 just because he failed to do so in 1990. "Americans know," he said, "that they have the right to try and try again until they succeed."

HEADLINE: Sour Spring for Mr. Dole

 BODY:
The return of Congress after its spring recess was planned by Republicans as a season made for the leadership talents of Bob Dole. But it has not worked out that way. Instead of running the Senate like a fine machine, churning out legislative accomplishments, Mr. Dole stumbled last week through a series of fiascos that betrayed confusion and uncertainty about the direction he intends to lead his party and, if elected, the country.
If Mr. Dole's Presidential campaign is to get off the ground, he will have to lift his sights and deliver both a broad sense of direction and a commitment to practical results, even if that means standing up to the conservatives among his allies. 
 The biggest embarrassment to Mr. Dole came when the Senate rebuffed his attempt to load health insurance reform with measures desired by conservatives but certain to provoke a Presidential veto. Five Republicans joined with the Democrats to defeat the amendment, clearing the way for Senate approval of a clean bill to make health coverage portable for employees who lose their jobs. The health reform commanded broad bipartisan support as a modest attempt to address American anxiety in this era of corporate downsizing. A true sign of leadership would have been to reject the add-on for medical savings accounts, which favor healthy people who are also better off economically.
Mr. Dole has also bungled his party's opposition to raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15, which appears to have enough support from Republicans to pass in both the House and the Senate. Angered by Democratic attempts to force a vote on the minimum wage and Social Security changes, he abruptly yanked from the Senate floor an immigration bill that also commands bipartisan support. Instead of demonstrating his control over the Senate, his actions showed that he did not know how to handle a rebellious Democratic minority that learned its guerrilla tactics aimed at embarrassing the leadership from the Republicans when they were in the minority.
This was also supposed to be a time for Mr. Dole to display his foreign policy maturity with a speech outlining his position on China. But he seems well on his way to equaling President Clinton's own record of unfortunate vacillation on that issue. There was the odd spectacle of Mr. Dole conferring with President Bush, who announced that it was important to renew China's favorable trade status despite its human rights and nuclear proliferation record. Mr. Dole has long embraced that view, but after the meeting he announced that he was rethinking his position. The exercise did not strengthen confidence in Mr. Dole as a man of conviction.
Against the heavy themes and emotions of Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole has long described himself as "a doer, not a talker." Between now and the Republican convention in August, he may have little choice but to spend much if not most of his time in the Senate, since his campaign has run low on funds and he does not receive the next installment of Federal subsidies until after the convention. There is also now clearly a debate in both Mr. Dole's and Mr. Clinton's campaigns over how much value would be derived by both from a grand compromise on the Federal budget, the one big issue Americans seem to care about most.
Mr. Clinton says he wants a budget compromise but will not gut welfare, Medicaid and Medicare to achieve it. Now that Mr. Dole has defeated Phil Gramm and Patrick Buchanan, he has less to lose within his party by pushing it to compromise with the White House on budget issues, including modest cuts in these entitlements. We have argued that both sides would have a lot to gain from a compromise, since they are close in the amount they want to save. For Mr. Dole, accepting measures that may fall short of the radical agenda of conservative Republicans he once courted for the nomination would bring real progress in the drive to balance the budget.
The financial markets would be cheered and both Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton could be doers as well as talkers. Right now, Mr. Dole seems to be neither.

HEADLINE: Mets Quietly Entering the On-Deck Circle for New Stadium

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
As Manhattan and the Bronx squabble over the future of the Yankees and a new stadium, their neighbor across the East River is inching without much fanfare or disagreement toward getting a new home for the Mets.
Quietly, the Mets are pressing ahead with plans to build a domed ball park in a parking lot next to Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens. The $457 million preliminary proposal has drawn praise from politicians and business leaders, in sharp contrast to the avalanche of criticism that greeted a proposal to erect a stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan. 
 Of course, the Mets' project is fundamentally different: They want to move next door, not to Manhattan or New Jersey. But differences between George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' blustery principal owner, and Fred Wilpon, the Mets' low-profile co-owner, as well as the teams' separate histories and homes, seem to account for why moves to build a new home for the Mets have so far been as uneventful as plans to add a room to a house. "Fred Wilpon is a real-estate developer who makes deals regularly, and often they're done and completed quietly," said Marc S. Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd. in Chicago, a stadium development consultant. "When there are more details about the financing and how much the Mets expect from the public sector, then you'll see more of a debate."
Those details will probably surface within six months when consultants hired by the Mets, the city and the state complete a study of the new stadium, said David Howard, the team's vice president of business affairs and general counsel.
Unlike Mr. Steinbrenner, the Mets' owners have been clear about what they want: a 50,000-seat, natural-grass ball park with both an old-fashioned feeling and a retractable dome, possibly by the year 2000. It would house only one professional team but remain open year-round for concerts, conventions and college basketball or hockey games. Shea Stadium would be torn down.
Mr. Wilpon has said that the current annual attendance level of 1.8 million will never return to the 1980's high of 3.5 million at the unloved, utilitarian Shea Stadium, the Mets' home for 32 years. An attractive stadium will bring in fans even if the Mets are playing poorly, he maintains.
Mr. Steinbrenner is also unhappy with his 73-year-old stadium, especially with its site in the South Bronx, and he wants to move elsewhere in the city or across the Hudson River when his lease expires in 2002.
New Jersey is trying to woo him with an old-fashioned ball park that would hold up to 55,000 people.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is pushing hard for a multiple-use stadium between 11th and 12th Avenues just west of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. But politicians, community groups and environmental and transportation experts have criticized the plan, saying that a ball park, never mind a multiple-use stadium, will not work in that location, and that the plan is far too expensive at $847 million for a simple ball park and $1.06 billion for a stadium for baseball and football.
While both the Yankees' and Mets' owners are displeased with their stadiums, they seem to have little else in common. Mr. Steinbrenner is the most famous owner in baseball; Mr. Wilpon is little known in New York. (It is hardly surprising that the writers on "Seinfeld" decided to have George Costanza, the schlemiel from Queens, work in the Bronx for Mr. Steinbrenner, rather than in his native borough for Mr. Wilpon.)
What is more, Mr. Wilpon's co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, the former chairman of the publishing house founded by his grandfather, was known in the 1980's for not interfering in his team's management and has let Mr. Wilpon handle the details of the new stadium.
While Mr. Steinbrenner is famous for his Homeric feuds, Mr. Wilpon last year abandoned his original idea of building a futuristic entertainment complex next to a new stadium, Mr. Howard said, partly because the project drew the opposition of local businesses that would have been forced to move out of the Willets Point Industrial Park.
When Mr. Doubleday floated the possibility of moving the Mets to Nassau County last year, the Mets sheepishly conceded that it was not a serious idea. But instead of angling for a sweeter deal with the city by threatening to move (as some have accused Mr. Steinbrenner of doing), the Mets said they are devoting all their efforts to the site in Queens.
"He's not threatening to go to Detroit," Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, said of Mr. Wilpon, with an equanimity no doubt envied by Fernando Ferrer, her Bronx counterpart. "He wants to stay in Queens. He just needs a new stadium."
What shape that new stadium finally takes might depend, of course, on the Yankees' new home.
"The Mayor believes that the city should have a multiple-use domed stadium, but it's not definite exactly where it should be," said Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is overseeing plans for the two stadiums. A failure by the Mayor to get a stadium on the West Side could mean a change in the Mets' plans for a baseball-only stadium.
"If it were feasible to accommodate a larger venue, a football-size facility, it's something we would be open to considering," Mr. Howard, the Mets official, said. Design is the main obstacle to a multiple-use complex, Mr. Howard added. The ideal configuration for baseball is a square stadium with 50,000 seats; for football, it is a rectangle with 75,000 seats. A stadium designed for both sports would compromise sight lines.
Either way, some business leaders in Queens said a new stadium would help the borough's economy. Lucy Nunziatio, executive vice president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, said that her borough would be a better site for a hulking multiple-use complex.
"Queens has so many more things than Manhattan in its favor," she said, mentioning the lack of residential housing around Shea Stadium, its ample parking and accessibility to suburban fans. Shea stands midway between Manhattan and Nassau County, within a few miles of La Guardia Airport and at the confluence of highways, the Long Island Rail Road and the No. 7 IRT subway train.
But Anne Fodera Rosengarten, owner of the House of Fodera, a food distributor several blocks east of Shea Stadium, said she was concerned about the public funds that might be spent for the two stadiums.
"You're talking about a lot of taxpayers' money here," she said. "I really think it has more to do with the team than the stadium. Back in the 80's, when the Mets were winning, you couldn't get into Shea Stadium. A new stadium might draw someone in once, but that wouldn't be a reason to go there on a regular basis."

HEADLINE: City Hall Memo;
Amid City Change, 4 Advisers Are Constant

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
City commissioners may come and go, and new crises pass through municipal governments like the wind. But at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's City Hall, there is one institution that seems immutable: the tight knot of friends at the core of his administration, all of whom have been devoted to Mr. Giuliani for more than a decade.
Day after day for 27 months, the hard choices of city government and politics -- who to appoint as police commissioner, where to cut the budget, which candidate to endorse -- have been made by the Mayor with the counsel of a group of four men on whose judgment he has relied for years. 
 They are by no means the only aides that Mr. Giuliani consults. On any given issue, advisers with special expertise are brought in, and their voices combine with those the Mayor hears every day. But for the most part, the Mayor's innermost circle remains exactly as it was the day he was inaugurated, and few expect significant changes.
"The government is run by five guys," said a city commissioner, who like many people in the administration, asked not to be identified when discussing the subject. "They're very smart, they're very loyal, and they don't rely on anyone else."
Those five guys, including Mr. Giuliani, are Peter J. Powers, the First Deputy Mayor; Dennison Young Jr., counsel to the Mayor; Randy M. Mastro, the Mayor's chief of staff; and Randy L. Levine, the former Labor Commissioner who is now the chief labor negotiator for Major League Baseball. Mr. Levine, who remains an unpaid senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani, is not as intimately involved in day-to-day affairs as are the other three, but is regularly consulted on major policy decisions.
Mr. Powers, a tax attorney, is a boyhood friend of Mr. Giuliani who ran both of his campaigns for Mayor. The other three men were among Mr. Giuliani's closest aides when he was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York during the 1980's, and their thinking remains so interwoven with his that associates say they are virtually extensions of their boss.
There is, to be sure, an important second circle of advisers that constantly participates in key decisions involving their areas. They include Paul A. Crotty, the corporation counsel, on legal matters; Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, on political and some policy issues; Richard Schwartz, the senior adviser, on welfare and government restructuring; Cristyne F. Lategano, the communications director, on news and public relations matters, and Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, on community and neighborhood issues. The most influential department heads in that second circle are Howard Wilson, the Commissioner of investigation; Nicholas Scoppetta, the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, and Howard Safir, the new Police Commissioner.
Members of these two circles, and a few others, meet with the Mayor every morning at 8 o'clock to gird themselves for the day ahead. Issues of the moment are discussed, progress reports are given, and newspaper stories are dissected. The Mayor also meets weekly with each of his deputy mayors and a rotating schedule of commissioners, and hosts regular dinners at Gracie Mansion with private citizens described as leaders in their fields.
But because Mr. Giuliani insists on personal accountability, taking charge of matters ranging from crime strategies to even the seating chart at last week's inauguration of Mr. Safir, he ultimately makes most decisions himself, according to administration officials who have closely observed him for more than two years. When those decisions are made, at the late-night meetings in Gracie Mansion and in the private huddles in the northwest corner of City Hall, the people the Mayor gathers around him are the members of the innermost circle.
"In the end, in just about every case, it's going to be Rudy who makes the decision, and I can't recall anyone else where that was always the case," said Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President who speaks to the Mayor, a political ally, two or three times a month. "He values the advice of others, and he takes counsel with Denny, Peter and Randy. But ultimately it's going to be his sense and his evaluation."
It was the five-man inner circle, with the assistance of Mr. Harding and Katherine N. Lapp, the Mayor's criminal justice coordinator, who were present at Gracie Mansion the night last month when the decision was made to appoint Mr. Safir as Police Commissioner. They, along with Ms. Lategano, were instrumental in engineering the resignation of Mr. Safir's predecessor, William J. Bratton, over issues of publicity and personal style, administration officials said. They also worked to steer the Mayor toward a softer image earlier this year when he brought child welfare under his direct control and made it a new priority.
Interviews with a variety of business leaders and public officials inside and outside his party depict an administration that rarely reaches out beyond itself into the community before making a major appointment or policy decision. Despite weekly administrative meetings with City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, and other key figures, the Mayor does not rely on them for advice, administration officials said.
The Mayor's critics say this has led to a damaging insularity, a tin ear to the way in which decisions play. The Mayor's decision to induce the resignation of the popular Mr. Bratton may have lasting political implications, particularly when a new survey shows that 60 percent of New York voters believe Mr. Bratton was the one responsible for the city's precipitous drop in crime. The Quinnipiac College poll, conducted after Mr. Bratton resigned, showed the Mayor's approval rating dropping 5 points to 48 percent since February. And some rival politicians have also complained that because the Mayor and his most trusted advisers are white, male, and based in Manhattan, they are out of touch with the concerns of a diverse city spread over five boroughs.
"He needs a larger, more diverse circle of advisers," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a former ally who has now become a vocal critic. "These guys he has are very able, but he has no one who will really tell him the truth when it hurts. They know that to say anything to Giuliani that in any way is critical creates the possibility of his cutting you off."
No member of the Mayor's staff would discuss the subject of this article or would return repeated phone calls for comment. Colleen A. Roche, the Mayor's press secretary, said the administration had decided that because of previous articles that were perceived as unfair, staff members would not cooperate.
Officials who have been present at high-level staff meetings said the Mayor's advisers were not yes-men, reflexively agreeing with each of their boss's notions. There is often considerable animated discussion over major issues, they said, with the degree of disagreement in inverse proportion to the size of the meeting. Nonetheless, they described a group of friends whose world view is so similar that their ultimate counsel to the Mayor is often reached by consensus, with no need for great debate.
"These are very smart people who have decided they know what they're doing, and they're very confident in their own decision-making," one official said. "They're not looking to make any new friends, or change what they think has worked very well."
Though the members of the inner circle weave in and out of different policy areas, each also has defined responsibilities that the Mayor regularly calls upon. As First Deputy Mayor, Mr. Powers has overall charge of the operations of city government, and most city commissioners report directly to him. The exceptions, who report directly to the Mayor, are the commissioners of police, fire, and children's services.
Mr. Powers is also the most important voice in the group on the budget (although Mr. Levine and Budget Director Joseph J. Lhota often participate in financial discussions), and he is the Mayor's closest confidante on political decisions. When Mr. Giuliani needs to decide which county political leader to support or what to say about the various presidential candidates, it is usually his old high school classmate to whom he turns for advice. Mr. Powers is expected by many political insiders to resign later this year to begin work on the Mayor's re-election campaign, possibly to be replaced by Mr. Mastro, Mr. Levine or Mr. Crotty. But no one expects his voice in mayoral decision-making to be lost.
Mr. Young, who was Mr. Giuliani's top aide in the United States Attorney's office from 1983 to 1989, provides a variety of legal advice to the Mayor, but has a special role as the Mayor's liaison to criminal justice officials. He was a key voice in the decisions on Mr. Bratton and Mr. Safir, and was asked by the Mayor to make sure that First Deputy Police Commissioner John F. Timoney was dismissed from his office after Mr. Timoney made disparaging remarks about Mr. Safir and the Mayor.
Mr. Mastro, another former prosecutor, has overall responsibility for the 1,000 or so employees of the Mayor's office, as well as mayoral appointments to boards and commissions. He is regarded as a troubleshooter and axe-wielder in the administration, with particular emphasis on combatting organized crime activity at the Fulton Fish Market and the garbage industry. But he is also gaining a larger voice on political matters and politically sensitive hiring decisions.
Mr. Levine, who as Labor Commissioner negotiated several key agreements with municipal unions that reduced the size of the workforce, remains active on all labor issues and many budgetary matters. The Mayor has made it clear he respects Mr. Levine's advice on a variety of issues, and Mr. Levine regularly appears at small gatherings at Gracie Mansion where key decisions are made. He may be asked to return to City Hall in a high-ranking capacity after he negotiates a new baseball contract.
In recent weeks, Mr. Giuliani has made several changes to his senior staff, though it remains to be seen what effect they will have on overall decisionmaking. After John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, announced his resignation on April 4, the Mayor named Ms. Reiter to replace him. Mr. Dyson was never as close to the the Mayor as Ms. Reiter, the former deputy campaign manager who has earned growing respect within the administration for her political advice and knowledge of the city's communities.
That same week, Rudy Washington, the Commissioner for Business Services, was named Deputy Mayor for Community Relations, replacing Ms. Reiter and becoming the highest ranking black member of the administration. But many officials believe that if anyone is likely to join the innermost circle and bring a broader perspective, it will be Ms. Reiter.

HEADLINE: BENDING THE RULES -- A special report.;
Where a Zoning Law Failed, Seeds of a New York Revival

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
In a moment of panic in 1974, as manufacturing jobs were disappearing by the tens of thousands in New York, the city tried to lock in its past as a burly, blue-collar colossus. A new planning blueprint was imposed, severely limiting uses for anything but manufacturing across nearly 14 percent of the city's land area, more than 20,000 acres.
There was a vainglorious poignancy to the blanket declaration that the tides of time and industrial relocation should somehow be halted by whim of city bureaucracy. The jobs did not return or even slow their rate of departure. The 20,000-acre zone still stands, while two-thirds of the 800,000 manufacturing jobs the city had in the early 1970's are gone. 
 But even as those old plans failed their stated purpose, they nonetheless have left a profound and unexpected mark on the city's economy, the machinery of government and the plans for the coming century, city officials, urban planners and business people say. Indeed, in many ways the plan's failure was its contribution. From the ashes rose opportunity.
The city owes much of its recent economic success, in fact, to the disregard of its own manufacturing-zone rules. The lofts and warehouses of SoHo and TriBeCa, where rents were cheap and huge open spaces were available, proved to be ideal incubators for the hip hybridization of computer technology, art and residential loft living that the city now crows triumphantly about as Silicon Alley. A retail renaissance led by big suburban chain stores has transformed a derelict stretch of the Avenue of the Americas below 34th Street. The Fairway Market at 133d Street has drawn more commerce to Harlem than anything else in recent memory.
And almost none of it would have happened -- or would look as it does today -- if New York had vigorously enforced its own laws.
"Things that have been celebrated as the keys to renewal of whole areas initially came into being contrary to the letter or spirit of the zoning law," said the director of city planning, Joseph B. Rose. "If the city got what we planned for," Mr. Rose added, "many currently vital areas would still be wasteland."
This is a story of how New York City works in the 1990's, and how it doesn't, and how sometimes -- in ways that could not remotely have been predicted -- it succeeds despite itself, if only by figuring out when to look the other way. It is also a story of capitalist democracy at its unruliest, a theme of local history as old as New York itself.
"The wonderful charm of New York is that when the regulations are old-fashioned or don't make sense, you just charge ahead," said Michael Kwartler, an architect, urban designer and the director of the Environmental Simulation Center at the New School for Social Research. "The city had one idea of how we were all supposed to live and function and it turned out to be a mismatch," Mr. Kwartler added. "Being practical, we don't obey."
Certainly, there are plenty of critics who believe New York lost doubly in its manufacturing policies -- first by creating rigid rules that did not fix the problems of high costs and taxes faced by manufacturers, then by giving in to the first possible alternative use when landlords complained about their empty buildings. And there is sharp debate as well about the implications of the new growth, although for the most part it has nothing to do with manufacturing. Owners of some small grocery stores in Harlem, for instance, say they fear the Fairway store will drive them out of business.
But few disagree that for the city as a whole, something new and unexpectedly positive has happened in the industrial zones, even if the road was paved with the grease of least resistance. A survey released this week by Coopers & Lybrand, the consulting firm, said that 1,350 computer-related media companies are doing business in New York, mostly in lower Manhattan, employing about 18,000 people -- more than the city's television industry.
How, precisely, New York came to win by losing is partly a matter of old-fashioned inefficiency and chronic budget-cutting that decimated the numbers of city building inspectors -- thus making zoning violators harder to catch -- and partly a matter of conscious policies to encourage economic development whenever and wherever opportunities arose.
The point is not that every new business in a manufacturing district in New York is there illegally, but rather that the distinctive economic colonization of the manufacturing zones would never have occurred, or spread, without creative legal interpretations. Artists, for example, are considered manufacturers in New York -- that is why they can legally live in their lofts in SoHo. So are some composers of disembodied computer instructions for the Internet. The effort to keep manufacturing jobs was built on rules; the new growth is premised on flexibility.
City officials say the vaguely countercultural flavor of much of the new media businesses -- a broad category that includes everything from software developers to computer-graphic artists to video production companies -- could also probably never have been created deliberately, even if it had occurred to anyone to try. In SoHo, in particular -- generally considered the fountainhead of the new media culture -- living and working outside the system became one of the defining traits. The vast open spaces of the leftover manufacturing zones also lent themselves naturally to big retail stores.
But the pressures to enforce the law and build the economy have also often been in conflict, creating within the city's two key development authorities -- the Buildings and Planning Departments -- a constant meditation about the balance between the sanctity of the law and growth of the property tax and job base.
"The city is in the business of making and enforcing laws -- it can't be in the position of enforcing some but not others," Mr. Rose at the Planning Commission said. "But when they're being violated with abandon, and when the market says, 'This is stupid, we're not going to abide by it,' it gets very difficult. It can be like shouting at the ocean."
The economic sea changes of the last quarter century have also made planning and enforcement much more difficult. When the old manufacturing zones were imposed in 1961 and amended in 1974, many current retailing practices had not been invented. The specific exceptions in the 1974 code allowed, for example, toy stores and hardware stores in some manufacturing zones. That is how Toys "R" Us and the Home Depot -- superstore specialty retailers that did not exist when the rules were written -- came into the city.
But now the ad hoc has become deliberate. The city is now consciously trying to cultivate similar successes among the towers around Wall Street, where millions of square feet of office space sit vacant. A new zoning proposal, to be issued within the next month by the City Planning Commission, would also legalize much of what has already occurred.
But city officials insist that they are not looking backward to what worked before, as they did in 1974, and that the past, this time, really is prologue.

The Loopholes
Defying the Rules, Or Rethinking Them?
Howard Glickberg, a co-owner of the Fairway Market in upper Manhattan, said he sincerely believed that his supermarket, the largest in Manhattan, was not really one store at all, as it appears to the rest of the world. In truth, he said, it is a series of separate stores, each smaller than 10,000 square feet. By happy coincidence, this is the very threshold beyond which the sum of the Fairway parts would violate New York City zoning laws for a manufacturing district.
Is this a delusion? A legalistic humbug? Or is it, in fairness, an approximation of truth that no one before Mr. Glickberg and his attorneys had ever managed to achieve? And if New York City Buildings Department officials accept Mr. Glickberg's formula, as many members of the City Council are pressuring them to do to save the popular store, will it become official doctrine?
Stranger things have happened. In a city that has come to live by its loopholes, no argument is too strange, no justification too arcane.
Bed, Bath & Beyond, for example, a large home-furnishings store on Avenue of the Americas between 18th and 19th Streets, was the first store to open, in 1992, in what is now a vibrant retailing district. Its building was a department store in the 1800's, when the area was the fashionable "Ladies' Mile," but rezoning in 1974 prohibited any but small, street-level retail stores. It was a tortured legal history, and it evoked a tortured modern reinterpretation.
The solution that allowed the store to open was to classify it as something new in the universe -- so different that its identity had not been codified into law, and could therefore not be barred.
"We developed a theory, which the Buildings Department accepted, that Bed, Bath & Beyond, as a type of establishment, didn't fall into the categories that were prohibited -- it wasn't a department store because there was no clothing, it wasn't a variety store, and it wasn't a home furniture store," said Paul D. Selver, an attorney who represented the store. "Because it wasn't any of the things that you specifically can't do, it was more properly characterized as a generic commercial use," he said. "It was sui generis."
Some rules that applied to the manufacturing zones never really had a chance to succeed. When the city created a system in the 1970's of allowing properly certified artists to live and work in the lofts of SoHo, which they were already doing anyway, enforcement was left up to individual landlords. But the landlords, seeking to rent out their buildings, had every incentive to violate the rule.
There was the regulation on one hand, and there was the enforcement provision on the other, said Sandy Hornick, the deputy executive director of strategic planning at the Planning Department. "But there was no point where the two came together -- that's why it worked so well."
In most instances, however, the growth of non-manufacturing in manufacturing zones has been a matter of case-by-case flexibility.
"Whenever you have a disjunction between what the zoning allows and what the market pressures dictate, you have a lot of creativity," said Richard L. Schaffer, a visiting professor of urban planning at Columbia University and chairman of the city Planning Commission from 1990 to 1993. "Sometimes my legal staff knew enough not to talk to me about it, so I wouldn't know," he said.

The Philosophy
It All Started With Budget Cuts
A hand-off attitude, except when prodded by a complaint or in issues of public safety, has effectively become the policy of the City of New York in zoning matters. That was a crucial development in the story of how the manufacturing zones changed character.
"Nobody is going to go out and look for reasons to aggravate people when there isn't a reason," said Joel A. Miele Sr., the city's Buildings Commissioner.
It all started, Mr. Miele said, as a matter of simple budget cuts. New York had teams of building inspectors well into the 1950's who would comb through targeted neighborhoods and commercial areas aggressively looking for problems. Now, he said, a reduced staff has to focus on safety violations at the exclusion of lesser issues. Since 1977 alone, the number of inspectors has declined by more than 28 percent, to 203 from 283.
But a philosophical change occurred alongside those cuts. The old style of enforcement, Mr. Miele said, would not only be impossible now because of straitened circumstances, but wrongheaded even if the money were there.
"If somebody wants to live in an industrial area, who's hurt?" he said.
In a complaint-driven enforcement system, a certain amount of ignorance about violations is inevitable. And when market forces are producing positive results, the ignorance becomes, in a way, its own reward.
The rule still stands in SoHo, for instance, that a landlord in most larger buildings must make a "good faith" effort to find a genuine manufacturing-related tenant for all street level uses -- the search must even include advertising for up to a year in a newspaper. Yet the amount of retailing only grows in the area, and Mr. Hornick at the Planning Department said he presumed that not everyone had followed the rule to the letter. He doesn't really know. Finding out would require research that could in turn compel enforcement against a use that the city is now trying to legalize with new zoning rules.
Business people say that that kind of laissez-faire attitude permeates the new manufacturing-zone economy.
"If anything, it's a benign neglect," said Cis Wilson, co-founder of Deep River Productions, a documentary film production company on Hudson Street in TriBeCa. Her building, with its huge windows and clanking-chain elevator, is filled with tiny companies in niches from computer software to video production. "It's almost like the force of the people who have come and lived here are what's driving the energy," Ms. Wilson said. "I don't feel the city in any way."

The Future
A City Debates Its Self-Image
What happened in New York's manufacturing zones over the last two decades, both legally and illegally, is now framing the debate about what comes next for the city.
The sweeping zoning revisions that the City Planning Commission is expected to propose within the next month would, in some cases, legitimize what has already occurred, like the widespread retail establishments of SoHo. But it would also allow more retail stores larger than 10,000 square feet -- like the Fairway store, or stores -- to open in the zones as well. The debate, with its undertones of civic self image and nostalgia, is expected to be vehement.
"This will be the hardest thing we ever do -- allowing other Fairways to exist," said Mr. Rose at the Planning Department.
The implications of the manufacturing zone story also echo on the southern tip of Manhattan, where the city is now consciously pushing a policy of extending its Silicon Alley success into the financial district. That has meant in some cases deliberately creating, in buildings that were designed as bank and brokerage offices, the look and feel of industrial loft spaces. That's what companies want and what they say their customers have come to expect.
"Culturally, we wanted the look and feel to be fun and creative, both for our employees and for people coming in," said Jon Diamond, the vice chairman of N2K Inc., an on-line entertainment company that rented space this year at 55 Broad Street. The building was home to Drexel Burnham Lambert before it went bankrupt in the junk-bond fiasco of the 1980's. But now post-industrial anarchy has become post-service-economy artifice. The ceiling was ripped out to reveal the beams and heating ducts, which have been painted a suitably industrial gray.
"It had to have the look and feel of a loft," Mr. Diamond said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Tiptoes Around Russian Vote Except to Say He's for It

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 20

 BODY:
A day before his one-on-one meeting with Boris N. Yeltsin, President Clinton today urged Russia to stay on the path of democratic and economic reform. But he declined to state his preference in the Russian presidential election, which could return a resurgent Communist Party to power.
Pressed about the June Russian presidential election at a news conference after the close of a meeting on nuclear security, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Yeltsin as a leader who had helped to reduce the nuclear threat remaining from the cold war. But he quickly added, "It is not right for the United States or for any other country to tell people how they should vote." 
 He did, however, indirectly take on the growing suspicions about the West and especially the United States that Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist candidate, has been using as a way to broaden his appeal.
"The United States and Russia, in my view, have a big obligation to their people to continue to be allies, to have a constructive relationship, to resolve as many of their differences as possible, and move forward together into the future," Mr. Clinton said.
The news conference, near the end of a weeklong foreign trip, reflected the fact that Mr. Clinton, like Mr. Yeltsin, is running for re-election, and he used his opening statement to recount what he had done to meet the "simple goal of my Presidency to further reduce the nuclear threat."
And he responded to an attack on his judicial appointments that was made Friday by Senator Bob Dole, who accused Mr. Clinton of causing a crisis in the courts through his appointments and called for removing the American Bar Association from the judicial screening process.
"I like the old-fashioned position that used to prevail that people didn't attack the President when he was on a foreign mission for the good of the country," Mr. Clinton said.
The President noted that Mr. Dole had voted for "98 percent of the judges that I appointed, and the rating systems for judges going back to the Eisenhower Administration by the American Bar Association indicate that I have appointed the best-qualified judges of any President since Mr. Eisenhower was in this job."
For months the Clinton Administration has done what it can to bolster Mr. Yeltsin and the process of reform in Russia. It pushed hard for the International Monetary Fund to make a $10 billion loan to Russia; it has worked to limit restrictions on Russian goods coming into America; it has kept its public criticism of the war in Chechnya muted, and Mr. Clinton agreed to attend this nuclear meeting, which was proposed by Mr. Yeltsin and showcases the Russian President as a world leader.
But Mr. Clinton has taken care not to be too open about his support for Mr. Yeltsin since arriving in Russia, for reasons of diplomatic protocol and also because of concerns inside the Administration that such a move could backfire given the current mood in Russia.
Mr. Zyuganov has been campaigning against a "planetary regime of political, economic, and military dictatorship of the West headed by the U.S.A."
On Sunday, after a meeting at the Kremlin and joint news conference with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton is to meet with an array of other political figures at the residence of the United States Ambassador, and Mr. Zyuganov has been invited.
"That's not inconsistent with our position that in democracies we believe the people have to make their own decisions and we will honor the decisions they make," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton expressed hope that "the growth of free enterprise in Russia and the beginnings of people -- ordinary people -- feeling the benefits of it," plus the need of the country to keep attracting international capital would be "at least strong incentives to maintain at some pace a direction towards economic as well as political reform."
Paraphrasing the former Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Mr. Clinton said the most important election when a country becomes a democracy is the second election.
"What I believe is that the Russians have established a pretty vigorous democratic system already," he said.
"And if they have another presidential election that's a free and fair election with a significant amount of participation by the voters, I think every time you do that, it makes the path of democracy stronger and a reversal less likely."

HEADLINE: Study Says Babies in Child Care Keep Secure Bonds to Mothers

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
The most far-reaching and comprehensive study to date has found that using day-care centers or baby sitters does not affect infants' trust in their mothers.
The results, announced yesterday at a conference in Providence, R.I., run counter to several previous studies that seemed to show that infants in child care were slightly more likely to have an insecure relationship with their mothers than those whose mothers stayed at home with them. 
 The earlier research had alarmed some experts and parents because other studies had indicated that troubled bonds between infants and mothers could signal emotional and behavioral problems later.
The new study sought to address one of the most emotionally charged issues in society today: Does a mother put her child at risk by working outside the home? It reported that the sense of trust felt by 15-month-old children in their mothers was not affected by whether or not the children were in day care, by how many hours they spent there, by the age they entered day care, by the quality or type of care or by how many times care arrangements were changed. Instead, what affected that trust was a mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her child.
"Part of what elicited this study was real worries that child care in and of itself was unhealthy," said Dr. Deborah Lowe Vandell, one of the 25 researchers on the project, which was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, part of the National Institutes of Health. "I think that is the wrong analysis. One message from the study is that if the quality of the interaction with the mother is sensitive, then the child is likely to develop a secure relationship with her. I'm sure that will be reassuring to many mothers and families."
But the researchers cautioned that the study found some aspects of child care appeared to pose risks for certain vulnerable children. When a mother does not handle her child sensitively, the likelihood of a troubled mother-child bond can be increased by child care that is of poor quality, changes several times or extends more than 10 hours a week.
The ongoing study, which brought together researchers who have often clashed about the risks of child care, has been following more than 1,300 families nationwide since 1991. Compared with previous studies, this one includes more diverse families and more types of child care. It has observed children at home as well as in child care and laboratories and will follow children from birth through 7 years of age.
Researchers emphasize that many questions remain unanswered, and they must await later stages of the project to see if the links described yesterday last. Children who look secure now could be insecure later. What seem to be risks of child care now could prove unimportant as children grow, or new risks could surface.
The scientists plan to publish next research examining children's bonds to their mothers at 3 years old, and their cognitive and language development, physical development, health, behavior and relationships with peers.
In a result that intrigued several researchers who said they were still not entirely sure how to interpret it, the study also found that more time in child care was linked to some risks for boys but that less time was potentially risky for girls. Boys who were in child care for more than 30 hours a week were slightly more likely to have an insecure relationship with their mothers, while girls were more likely to have an insecure bond if they were in child care less than 10 hours a week.
While this finding was statistically significant, it was weaker than the other results and researchers cautioned against overreacting to it.
Previous studies of older children have found that child care can have some ill effects for boys, particularly middle-class boys, and that girls of working mothers tended to be more independent and focused on achievement.
Dr. Jay Belsky, one of the researchers, said it was possible that "separation might prove stressful for boys, but girls who are home with mothers extensively may become almost too close and enmeshed."
The study offered researchers in the often-acrimonious world of social science a chance to test competing ideas. Psychologists have long disagreed over how important and lasting are the effects of the mother-child bond, known as "attachment," that this study measures..
The scientists measured attachment by watching children's reactions when their mothers returned after brief separations. Children who sought comfort from their mothers were judged to be secure. Researchers also evaluated mothers by videotaping them with their children and grading the mothers' sensitivity according to accepted criteria.
While many researchers say the quality of a child's first relationship sets the tone for all future ones, others say that impact has been exaggerated. Usually, the first relationship is with the mother, which is why this study and others measure that bond.
This study confirms researchers' belief that a mother's sensitive care is crucial in forging a secure attachment, said Dr. Cathryn L. Booth, one of the researchers. But some researchers, as well as some popular baby experts and pediatricians, have argued that working during the first year of a child's life would be harmful, either because long hours spent away from a child would interfere with the mother's ability to be sensitive or because a baby would experience a mother's absence as a devastating abandonment and feel unable to count on her. Although the earlier studies seemed to offer some support for that argument, this more comprehensive study questions that assumption, Dr. Booth said.
The study offered further evidence of what experts have been telling parents for years: smaller groups of children, more adults per child and more sensitive caregivers spell higher-quality child care, defined as environments in which children are stimulated and get adequate attention. Child-care centers were ranked lowest in quality; care by fathers or relatives or in the home by a caregiver were ranked the highest.
Because researchers were able to follow children from birth, they were also able to figure out what influenced parents' choices for child care. Children who were in better-quality care had more stimulating home environments and mothers who were more likely to believe that working put children at risk. At the same time, children who were most securely attached had mothers who were better off economically and who appeared to be more sensitive and were more likely to believe that day care could be harmful.
Dr. Belsky, who ignited a firestorm in 1986 when he became one of the first researchers to raise questions about the potential risks of day care, suggested that while the study offered reassurance to working parents, it also indicated that some guilt might be productive.
"It may be that some guilt and anxiety keeps you alert, vigilant and able to monitor the quality of care," Dr. Belsky said. "Being cavalier about the effects of work turns out to be risky."
The study departed in several other ways from previous ones. By the time the children studied were a year old, 80 percent of them had been in child care for at least a few hours a week, a higher percentage than previous surveys have found. And the overall quality of child care, the researchers observed, was better than the usually dismal picture revealed by several recent studies.
Dr. Sarah Friedman, the study's coordinator at the institute, said that researchers were not sure why, but one explanation might be that previous studies had focused on child-care centers, which were found to provide the lowest-quality care in this study.

HEADLINE: With G.O.P. Congress the Issue, 'Gender Gap' Is Growing Wider

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

 BODY:
Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, recognized the magnitude of her party's problems with women when she received a telephone call from her 34-year-old daughter in Colorado.
"She said, 'Mother, there are these TV ads out here and they make you Republicans look like you're taking food out of the mouths of little babies. Are you?' " 
 The Congresswoman assured her that the party was not, but found it ominous that she had to defend the Republican Congress to her own Republican daughter.
The gender gap, the tendency of women to lean Democratic while men tilt Republican, has become a gender chasm in recent months. And many political analysts believe that it has a lot to do with women's perceptions of the 104th Congress, particularly the fear that the revolution led by Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to go too far.
"Women are still bigger believers in government," said Andrew Kohut, of the Pew Center for People and the Press, a Washington research group. "Women are stronger environmentalists, more critical of business and less critical of government. This drives their party preferences and their attitudes toward the Congressional agenda."
The gender gap has been a recurrent feature of American politics since President Ronald Reagan stirred the hearts of men, but not as many women, in 1980. What makes it so striking at the moment, many pollsters say, is its size and its potential to affect not only the race for the White House, but also the battle for control of the House.
The most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll shows some stark differences between the sexes: Women disapproved of Mr. Gingrich's job performance by a 2-to-1 ratio, while men disapproved far more narrowly. When asked how they would vote if the Congressional elections were held today, women went for the Democrats by a 16-point margin, while men backed the Republicans by a 10-point margin.
Women are also much more likely to identify themselves as Democrats: 40 percent did so, compared with 30 percent of the men. This Democratic advantage rises with age; it does not exist among 18- to 29-year-old women and rises to an 18-point margin among women 65 and older.
Even the women who identify themselves as independents have much greater Democratic tendencies: 49 percent of these women said they would vote Democratic in this year's House races, compared with 31 percent of the men who said they were independents. This survey of 1,257 adults was conducted March 31 to April 2 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Several polls in recent days have found similar gaps, raising Democratic hopes that women can do for them what the "angry white men" did for the Republicans in their 1994 Congressional sweep.
Republicans counter that the flip side of the gender gap is their superior strength among men, and they note that they have prevailed over their vulnerabilities with women many times in the past.
"People were worried about the gender gap in the early 1980's," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, "but as it turned out Ronald Reagan carried 56 percent of the women's vote in 1984."
Given the time, Congressional Republicans say, they can make their case to women: The Contract With America to lower taxes, reduce Government and balance the budget will reap rich rewards for average American families.
Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island, the highest-ranking woman in the House Republican leadership, said: "We were trying to do so much that we didn't have time to communicate, to tailor our message. That clearly opened a door of vulnerability, but it's eminently undoable."
As for Mr. Gingrich's unpopularity, Ms. Molinari said, "Maybe I'm too close to Newt to see it, but I think he's one of the more politically sensitive people we have in our party when it comes to women and the women's vote."
Ms. Roukema is urging her party to put issues like health insurance and child-support enforcement at the top of the Congressional agenda.
For their part, Democratic strategists are consumed with turning a polling phenomenon into actual votes. If they can galvanize women to turn out in 1996, and if women's current Democratic predilections hold, they could turn the tide in many districts. (In 1994, women accounted for 51 percent of the vote, a drop from 1992, when they accounted for 54 percent. The most recent Times/ CBS News poll showed that 53 percent of the registered voters were women and 47 percent men.)
Even Democratic strategists acknowledge that those are two very big if's. A report for Emily's List, a group devoted to electing women to office, said last week, "While 1994's drop-off women could have a substantial impact on 1996, they must still be considered uncertain voters." Many women who voted in 1992 but not in 1994 are young, with high school degrees or less, and have annual incomes under $30,000.
Appealing to the women's vote is considered a far more subtle art than it was 15 years ago, when a narrowly focused set of "women's issues," like abortion, was often considered enough. Analysts are careful to note that women are obviously not monolithic, but say some general trends are evident.
For example, surveys show that economic security is front and center for them; the Times/CBS poll showed that while 62 percent of the men rated the economy as "fairly good," only 45 percent of the women did; half of the women rated it as "fairly bad" or "very bad."
"Most of my concerns have nothing to do with politics or government," said Patricia Lewin of Wisconsin, 46, in a follow-up interview to the Times/CBS poll. "It's the way society is going, the downsizing by corporations."
Economic anxiety is particularly high among older women, many analysts say. Women over 65 and those just over a decade younger are particularly susceptible to Democratic attacks on the Republican plan to restructure Medicare, and to Democratic promises, like Mr. Clinton's last week, to safeguard pension programs.
"Median income for women 65 and older is about $8,500 a year," said Ann Lewis, a chief strategist for the Clinton campaign. "That's why when women hear talk about cutting back on the entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, they feel the icy grip of fear."
Some studies suggest that neither party has fully capitalized on women's economic concerns. Some Republicans acknowledge that their party's focus on balancing the budget, which has dominated the debate in Washington for the past year, has fallen flat with many women.
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said of women, "We haven't been successful in conveying what we're trying to do in Congress: the cause and effect between downsizing Government and improving their future and their childrens' future."
But several analysts suggest that women may be suspicious of attempts to "downsize Government," in part because of their greater concern for safety-net programs like Medicare, and in part because they simply believe that government should do more to help families.
"Men are more likely to say Government is too involved and should leave more to the individual and business," said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster who addressed a forum last week in New York sponsored by Ladies Home Journal and the League of Women Voters. "Women, on the other hand, are more likely to want to see a more activist government."
But until the Democrats come up with a stronger economic message, some analysts suggest, much of the women's vote will remain volatile; Congressional Democrats are expected to begin laying out their economic platform in the next few weeks. The volatility is especially true with many of the younger, high-school educated women who sat out the 1994 election.
At the same time, the Democrats hope to make inroads with suburban and professional women who might ordinarily lean Republican on economic grounds, but are turned off by the party's social agenda over issues like abortion.
Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said, "You have a large group of suburban women, professional women, better educated women, who are just uncomfortable with the Republican Party right now."
Ms. DiVall says that Republicans have numerous opportunities for appealing to different groups of women, including mothers who are not in the work force, white women who consider themselves independents, and evangelicals. She also noted that it is still early in this election year -- but not too early, she added, for Republicans to start dealing with their problem with women.
 
A Margin of Decision
Women play a crucial role in President Clinton's lead over Senator Bob Dole, according to the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll.
In a two-way race, men divide evenly between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, 45 percent to 45 percent. But women break for Mr. Clinton, 52 percent against 34 percent for Mr. Dole. This gender gap began to emerge last fall and widened through the winter. It is not simply because more women are Democrats; Mr. Clinton has a similar edge among women who describe themselves as independents.
Republican strategists note that such gender gaps are a staple of American politics and can be overcome in the course of a campaign. At a similar point in 1988, for example, men favored George Bush over Michael S. Dukakis by 51 percent to 41 percent while women were for Mr. Dukakis by an 8-point margin. In the election that fall, Mr. Bush carried the votes of men -- and, albeit by a narrower majority -- women as well.

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
For the Draft Picks, Mother's Day Is Early

BYLINE: By Thomas George 

 BODY:
Draft day is for the fans. Especially the New York fans. They come to the Theater at the Garden and they cheer, they boo, they wear green and they wear blue.
Draft day is for the teams. They make selections, cross their fingers, prepare to dish out millions and hope that their pick will stick. That a Super Bowl victory will be the eventual reward. 
 Draft day is certainly for the nation's universities. They want their players selected high. That way, they can boast in their football brochures about how their program produces pro stars. That way, they can more effectively recruit the future first-rounders fresh from high school.
And, of course, draft day is for the draftees. A dream, a miracle, a harvest of so much taxing physical and mental work.
But draft day is mainly for mothers. Did you see them yesterday? They were beaming, each one. So proud. So much the story behind the 6-foot-4-inch giant that just made it to the top. So frequently the single parent, or the sacrificing one, or, simply, the best friend.
Take Simeon Rice's mom, Evelyn.
She and her husband used to take their two sons and four daughters on trips across America in the family camper. Family trips, where the family bond grew. They traveled to Niagara Falls. They viewed the monuments in D.C. They even came to New York, back in '85, when Rice was barely a teen.
Rice remembers that, the trip to the Statue of Liberty, and now this return visit, one that changed his life forever as the third pick of the draft.
He is an Arizona Cardinal now.
"On Jan. 11 last year, I sat down with my mom," Rice said. "It was her birthday, and it was the last day to declare for the draft. I looked her in the eye and I promised her that I was going to stay in school, get my degree and not enter the draft early. I didn't even get her a gift that day. But now, she's got her gift. I got the degree, I got drafted today and now I will have the money to buy her more gifts than she could ever want."
Alex Molden, the draft's elite cornerback, was raised by his mother, Cassandra. "We are extremely close," Molden said. "She was a single parent who raised us in Colorado Springs and never made more than $10,000 a year. We relied on food stamps."
No more of that, ever. Molden was the 11th pick in the draft, to the New Orleans Saints. Selected that high, his signing bonus, alone, will be more than $1 million.
Keyshawn Johnson's mother, Vivian Jessie, said that she taught her son how to play football. He loved baseball as a kid, she said, but she swayed him toward football and tossed him his first few passes and taught him how to catch them. Quite a start. And his draft finish? Tops, to the Jets, the No. 1 selection.
Tim Biakabutuka's mother, Marceline Misenga, was here in New York for the first time, in from @ontreal. Through Velly Janvier, a French translator, she said that she had prayed since Biakabutuka was born in Zaire 22 years ago that she would be blessed through him. He was the eighth pick, and will play for the Carolina Panthers.
"I am prou' of him -- he has done well in football," she said. "But I have other children who are trying to achieve their goals. Their goals might not be as glamorous, but I am as proud of them."
Spoken like a true mom.
The Regan Upshaw story is inspiring, too. His mother, Rosalyn Morgan-Upshaw, is a principal at Pittsburg High School, which is 35 miles east of Oakland. His father, Charles, is the chief executive assistant to the vice chancellor and provost at the University of California in Berkeley. His grandmother owns a master's degree in education, an aunt one in special education, one uncle a doctorate in finance from Columbia and another is a doctor from Harvard.
Upshaw, drafted by Tampa Bay in the first round, earned his degree in economics from Cal.
Mrs. Morgan-Upshaw said her son was a rambunctious youth, "a tiger, the epitome of an idle mind being the devil's workshop." She said through sixth grade that he and his sister, Kirsten, grew up in luxury, in upscale homes and schools in Hillsborough, Calif., where their peers drove to class in Porsches and BMW's.
"He needed to be out of that, out of the city, period, because I felt that in an urban setting that his safety would be in jeopardy," she said. "So, when we decided to move permanently to one side of the Bay or the other, we chose Pittsburg. It's country. That's how Regan got so fast, by chasing cows up the hill. It was a place where some kids walked to school two or three miles away and the others rode the bus. In the city, even without doing anything, he would have been at risk. With his personality, he would have been in more jeopardy."
Draft day is a day for mothers.

HEADLINE: Ethanol's Value Wins Bipartisan Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the president of the trade association representing 45,000 workers in 53 ethanol plants across the country, I take issue with your April 16 front-page article on Senator Bob Dole's support for ethanol subsidies.
You state that "for years, Government studies have questioned ethanol's value," and cite a 1986 Department of Agriculture report as evidence. But that report has since been repudiated by the agency, and more recent studies have promoted the economic and energy benefits of the ethanol incentive program. 
 For example, a 1995 Department of Agriculture study concluded that the ethanol program increases net farm income more than $700 million annually. Another 1995 study determined that "the production of ethanol yields 25 percent more energy than is used in growing the corn, harvesting it and distilling it into ethanol."
With regard to the environmental effects of ethanol, you cite only a Congressional Budget Office report, which was neither intended nor able to provide policy guidance on air quality issues. Ethanol adds oxygen to gasoline, which reduces exhaust emissions of ozone-forming carbon monoxide. Because ethanol adds octane to gasoline, it also reduces the use of toxic, petroleum-derived octane.
The support for ethanol is bipartisan. The reason is that public policy makers have gained an appreciation for its benefits.

HEADLINE: Woe if Chinese Turn Energy Gluttons Like Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Thomas L. Friedman's "Gardening With Beijing" (column, April 17): It seems that President Clinton is aware of the environmental dangers of a modernized China. If a billion Chinese become as energy-profligate as the average American, the world's finite energy reserves will decrease at a more frightening rate than they do now, and the products of their consumption will poison the atmosphere. 
 There is a corollary to this idea that Mr. Friedman bypasses. Our leaders on the right and the left invoke "growth" as the solution to our economic difficulties. However, a significant aspect of growth is the sale of manufactured goods abroad that consume energy. The solution to one of our pressing problems thus has a depressing downside. If the free-market gurus have a way out of this dilemma, I would like to know what it is.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
Club Fed

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis 

 BODY:
THERE ARE A LOT of different ways to read the draft of a new report on the inner workings of the Federal Reserve System released last month by two Democratic Senators, Harry Reid of Nevada and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota. But it appears that most people have read it supine, just before falling asleep. Here we have the first real attempt to investigate the most important economic force in government, and the chief response the Senators are getting is . . . boredom.
"It's an area of disinterest," Senator Reid acknowledges. "The vast majority of Americans have no concept of what effect the Fed has on their lives." 
 The Fed has always had an odd relationship to the citizenry, precisely because it is so boring -- shrewdly boring. In theory, the Fed is answerable to you and me through both Congress and the President. If we don't like what the Fed chairman is doing, we can send a message to Congress, which can grill up the chairman and eat him for lunch. If that doesn't work, we can send a message to the President, who can decline to reappoint the chairman, thus forcing him into a high-paying job on Wall Street.
But practice in this case is very different from theory. For instance, despite constant prodding, Congress has failed to get answers from the Fed to a lot of very interesting questions: What became of the billions of dollars the Fed has wired into Mexico before presidential elections in the last two decades? How much money has the Fed lost propping up the dollar? How does the Fed decide to change interest rates?
The end result of the Fed's distance from the democracy is raw economic power. Its power is only enhanced by the Fed's equally ambiguous relationship to the markets. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is a lifelong disciple of Ayn Rand and a passionate advocate of free markets. He has said and written many times that free markets are not only uniquely efficient but also uniquely moral. The Federal Reserve itself is run in part by private bankers who have a deep attachment to market outcomes.
But much of what the Fed does constitutes blatant market interference. When the dollar falls or rises against foreign currencies, for instance, the Fed spends a lot of taxpayer money buying or selling dollars, to offset natural market forces. And these distortions are tiny compared with those created whenever the Fed decides to expand or contract the money supply, thereby lowering or raising interest rates.
To the extent that power over the economy resides in the hands of any one person, it resides in the hands not of the President or the chairman of AT&T but of Alan Greenspan. Greenspan gets to decide how many dollars to print. That wouldn't be so bad if at the end of each week he explained his actions in plain English and subjected them to an honest public evaluation -- if, say, he walked out onto his portico and declared, "I decided not to lower interest rates today because the price of oil just went up, and though I have no real idea what that price bump means, I fear that it might cause inflation."
But he doesn't. He keeps it all bottled up inside him, and leaves the rest of us to wonder nervously whether he'll pursue his vendetta against inflation past the point of all reason. He has never fully explained why he has done what he has done. His rare public statements are famously indecipherable; indeed, the Fed's most recent vice chairman, Alan Blinder, resigned after nearly two years of trying to get Greenspan to recognize English as the official language.
Now we have this new report, which purports to drag the Fed, with Greenspan, back into our noisy democracy. In spite of the drum roll that preceded it ("Reid, Dorgan to Unveil Groundbreaking Report on Fed Excess," the news release blared), the document contains only a handful of minor revelations: that the Federal Reserve's costs have outpaced inflation, that Fed employment rose slightly at the same time overall Government employment fell slightly and that over the last 79 years the Fed has squirreled away a $3.7 billion "surplus account" the purpose of which it can't really explain, since it has never had to draw on the account and it makes huge profits each year. All of this is worth knowing, but none of it will have any effect on the world, except, possibly, to create the illusion that the Fed has finally come clean.
It hasn't. The General Accounting Office, which did the dirty work, wasn't asked to audit the Fed's books and wasn't permitted to audit the results of the Fed's market interventions. In other words, it was forced to take the Fed's word on all the numbers. This left the investigators little to do but search for meaning in the most quotidian details of Fed life.
Lunch, for example. On page 88 we read: "Two [Federal Reserve] Banks reimbursed travelers for meals based on a schedule which divides the day into four quarters while another Bank used a more narrowly defined schedule which aligned with typical meal times. . . . As a result of these policy differences the total meal reimbursement for a three-day trip to the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., could range from $76 to $105."
We also learn that 120 people inside the Fed earn more than Greenspan, who was paid $133,600 in 1994; that the Fed springs for Greenspan's car and driver and that the Fed dental plan is the best in town. The Pentagon Papers this is not.
To my mind, the report's most telling new fact is that the Fed -- that is, the taxpayer -- has paid to install in Greenspan's home a $2,500 alarm system. Senator Reid claims to be outraged at this expenditure and others like it. But the truth is that $2,500 is a bargain. Kamikaze pilots are flying planes into the back end of the White House; snipers are firing Chinese semiautomatic rifles into the front. Meanwhile, the only protection the man with real power feels he needs is a $2,500 beeper. Greenspan has no bodyguards, no sniffer dogs, no snipers, no electrified fence. If the world were ever to wake up, he'd need an army.

HEADLINE: Europe's Reborn Right

BYLINE: By Mark Hunter; Mark Hunter lives in France and is working on a book about the National Front. He has previously written an About Men column for the Magazine, "Vive la Difference."

 BODY:
A PAGE OF HISTORY HAS TURNED: FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE World War II a wave of aggressively nationalist, extreme-right parties have swept into municipal, regional, national and European parliament offices from the English Channel to the edge of the former Soviet empire. When they won a few scattered elections in the mid-1980's, they were taken for a passing phenomenon. But in election after election, this hard right -- which calls the traditional right "soft" -- is proving its power to survive and grow, pushing its roots deeper and deeper.
Between January and the end of March, Germany's Republikaners climbed from 2 percent in pre-election polls to 9 percent of the final vote in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Last year three French cities elected National Front mayors, while in Belgium the Vlaams Blok won nearly 27 percent of the vote in Antwerp. In Italy, which goes to the polls today, the National Alliance and the Northern League are serious contenders for power. And the Austrian Freedom Party has maintained its potent influence in Vienna, despite a scandal when its leader, Jorg Haider, held a rally with Nazi SS veterans. 
 The parties are hard to define: they are like snowballs rolling downhill, constantly adding layers. They are clearly populist outsiders, troops of angry men guided by charismatic figures, something like the American movements of George Wallace and David Duke. Just as clearly, their ranks include racists, anti-Semites and even former Nazis. At a National Front lunch in central France I was seated beside a trooper of the Charlemagne SS, and over dinner in Paris a "friendly" French journalist loudly denounced "Jew America, nigger America, Jewish-nigger America."
In truth, though, the vast majority of the parties' new recruits, including their candidates, are closer to the American Republican right wing than to Hitler. Aping Newt Gingrich, the Front calls its antibureaucracy platform a "Contract for France With the French," and one of their cadres told me, "I read Pat Buchanan's program, and it's practically the same as ours." That doesn't make them democratic -- it is appalling to watch a Front mayor cut off debate on crucial city policies -- but neither does it make them all fascists.
In their own eyes they have been building toward this moment for centuries. A radically antidemocratic right was born in Europe with the French Revolution, which defined the stakes of the battle -- the conflict of liberty, equality and fraternity with authority, tradition and elitism. But after the catastrophe of Nazism it took several decades for a new generation of radical-right cadres to emerge across Europe.
Their ideologies define a safe but narrow path: they condemn the "excesses" and errors of fascism while refusing to denounce those who claimed to fight Communism or to see in Hitler's conquests a chance for national renewal. When accused of racism or xenophobia, they reply that they do not hate other peoples but are simply defending their own. Like Louis Farrakhan, whom they cite approvingly, they believe that different races and ethnicities cannot mix without losing their cultures and identities.
The hard right still appeals to its traditional electorate -- the petite bourgeoisie of shopkeepers allied with ambitious professionals, military officers and embittered aristocrats. The Vlaams Blok, the Republikaners and the Northern League draw electoral strength from both upper and lower classes. The ranks of the National Front bristle with anti-abortion Catholics, doctors, lawyers and veterans of the Algerian war. Yet the hard right's drive for power is fueled by the working class. In Vienna, polls show a Freedom Party approval rating of more than 30 percent among unskilled and skilled workers and artisans; across France, the National Front holds 30 percent of these voters, more than any other party. The Communists once controlled this electorate but lost their grip on it even before the fall of the Berlin wall. There is a sinister parallel here to the 30's: it was by crushing Communist-led workers' movements that the liberal democracies opened the road to fascism. Yet there is a new element in the equation -- the opening of Europe's national borders to the free flow of people, goods and services.
The hard right isn't wrong when it says that since 1985, when the opening began, the European Union has benefited mainly big business. A turning point has been reached: in the past decade unemployment has nearly doubled across the Continent -- three million jobless in France, close to four million in Germany. At the same time, the providential social benefits put in place after World War II are being abrogated from the top down. Why? To meet the stringent budgetary criteria mapped out for the European Union, which hopes to introduce a unified currency by 1999. Simultaneously, taxes have reached historic levels -- almost 44 percent of G.D.P. in Germany, 44.7 percent in France. (Not incidentally, whenever I hang out with the National Front I meet desperate men and women who say they joined the party after taxes destroyed their companies.) The average citizen is struggling harder and getting less and less.
As a result of these trends there is a "developing dual society," in the words of Marc Swyngedouw, a Belgian political scientist: an increasingly affluent, educated, multilingual social and political elite ruling over a growing, increasingly impoverished underclass whose members see themselves as competing for housing, jobs and benefits with recent immigrants from Turkey, West and North Africa and Eastern Europe -- former "guest workers" and political refugees.
To make matters worse, the European elites are wallowing in corruption at precisely the moment that they are demanding new sacrifices. During the huge French public service strikes this winter, pollsters discovered that three-fifths of the French believed that their leaders were "unconcerned for the common welfare" and "dishonest." Just before the strikes, Prime Minister Alain Juppe was caught in a housing scandal and escaped prosecution only through the legal acrobatics of the Ministry of Justice. Similar affairs have rocked every country in Europe, most notably Italy.
By discrediting the elites, the corruption issue seems to validate other items on the hard right's program. In 1986, Jorg Haider's major asset in voter polls was his personal image, which decisively outweighed his anticorruption plank; the immigrant issue wasn't even on the map. By 1990, voter disgust with "scandals, abuses, privileges" had become the leading reason for backing Haider, with "teaching a lesson" to the established parties coming third and the "foreigner question" a distant but rising fifth. In 1994, fighting corruption remained the Freedom Party's best issue, and the immigrant problem had climbed to third. Why believe those who call Haider a racist after they're shown to be crooks?
The hard right has another, surprising advantage. Like the evangelical right in America, it has revived door-to-door politics with brilliant effect. In the provincial French town of Montargis, the National Front's two city counselors visit aged victims of street crime and offer them chocolates and help filling out insurance and police forms. The Vlaams Blok is the last party left in the rotting neighborhoods of working-class Antwerp, where it holds regular meetings in pubs, listening to gripes and promising a better day. The Northern League holds rallies in "bowling alleys, bars, parishes, video arcades, even stadiums," marveled the daily Corriere della Sera, while its Establishment adversaries "have almost completely lost their activist base," according to two researchers, Carlo E. Ruzza and Olivier Schmidtke.
Nor does the hard right sell only hatred. As Swyngedouw points out, "They are also selling a utopia." They offer a world in which the land and the people will finally be one, just as soon as the snake -- the foreigner, the multinational capitalist -- is driven from the garden. The hard right calls itself a family, and it creates a close, busy environment for its recruits in an endless round of "Tupper parties" (as the National Front calls them), rallies, postering nights and discussion groups. "It's very important for the new arrivals," a top Front official told me, "especially those whose political ideas aren't very structured." Note the implication that what comes first isn't politics so much as getting new members into the family.
There's a generation largely missing from this family: what Americans call the baby boomers. The Freedom Party vote is strongest among those under 30 and over 70, and the National Front has actually lost support among voters aged 35 to 49 since 1988. The Front's cadres claim that their younger adult troops don't dare stand up in public because they might lose their jobs, and that has indeed happened. Yet alongside the obvious class vengeance driving the hard right there is the continuation, as Elizabeth Noelle-Neumann, a German political scientist and pollster, puts it, of "a war with heavy casualties," the generational conflict of the late 60's. What the hard right hates -- drugs, abortion, racial integration, resistance to authority, sexual liberty -- is what the baby-boom generation tolerated or legalized as it came to maturity. Thus, the newly old, whose children attacked them in the 60's, and the newly adult, who must pay for the ruinous binge of the 80's, have come together in the hard right.
It is striking that the only other European political force to arise since the 1980's is the ecology-first Greens, whose demographic profile contrasts starkly with that of the hard right: more heavily female, much more educated and further to the left than the general population and dominated by the 35-to-49 age group. Yet both movements believe that the era of abundance is over and will never come back. The hard right spends much less time talking about economic growth than about how immigrants and politicians are stealing society's wealth, while the Greens say flat out that the planet can no longer support an ever-growing population. If you add their votes together, you see that between a quarter and a third of European voters share the sense that the biggest problem facing the world is how to divide a shrinking pie.
That fear is spreading. More and more, mainstream politicians find themselves forced to enact tougher measures against foreigners. "The Vlaams Blok says clearly that we're adopting their program," says Dirk Van den Bulck, a Socialist and the immigration policy chief at the Belgian Ministry of the Interior, "but we have to do something." The same trap is closing on France's ruling center-right coalition. Thus the goals of the hard right are advancing, even when it loses elections.
How far can the hard right go? That will depend on its adversaries. As a National Front militant told me, "If unemployment goes down, we're finished." But that's not the forecast. Nor is it sufficient. Europe needs a new generation of mainstream leaders who look upon public service as more than an opportunity for self-enrichment and who can offer a realistic vision of a just and open society for others than the privileged few. For now, those leaders are nowhere in sight.

HEADLINE: Three to Watch: Populists of the Hard Right

BYLINE: By Gregory Crouch; Gregory Crouch is a correspondent with "Nachtjournal," a German version of "Nightline." This is his first contribution to the Magazine.

 BODY:

Gianfranco Fini
 
STANDING IN HIS SPACIOUS OFFICE NEAR ROME'S SPANISH Steps, Gianfranco Fini reaches for a bit of Americana. From a bookshelf that once held his infamous collection of Mussolini's greatest works, he takes down a somewhat lighter read -- a biography of New York's Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, personally inscribed, "To Gianfranco, Good luck."
Fini turns the book over in his hands, repeating the Senator's best wishes, quietly emphasizing his tiny but growing credibility outside Italy. "I have been defined in the Italian press as the Italian Gingrich," he says proudly, taking what is for an extreme right-winger a surprisingly pro-American stance. "It's a great country." 
 Once dubbed the heir to Benito Mussolini, Fini claims he has shed his Fascist skin, transforming himself into Italy's favorite politician and a sought-after dinner guest. He is at pains to point out that he even received an invitation from the Israeli Embassy to attend a memorial concert for the slain Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. "Everything has changed," he says.
So he claims. Nonetheless, the suspicion remains that his reincarnation as a "post-Fascist" is just an airbrush job to reassure moderates as he gets closer to real power. The same holds for his party, the increasingly influential National Alliance.
Just a day before the concert for Rabin, for instance, Italy's newspapers were filled with pictures of a high-ranking Alliance official making a Fascist salute at a wedding party. A year or so earlier another official suggested that homosexuals be put in concentration camps. And one Alliance member punched a Green Party member on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, touching off a brawl.
Fini, it seems, has trouble controlling his troops -- a motley assortment of Mussolini fanatics, neo-Fascists and run-of-the-mill conservatives: the troops haven't necessarily undergone the same transformation as their leader. Even so, Fini becomes irritated when anyone questions his, or his followers', sincerity. "It makes me angry when people think we are pretending."
Fini, 44, joined the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement when he was 17, outraged by a Communist demonstration that had prevented him from seeing a John Wayne movie, "The Green Berets." After working briefly as a journalist, he was elected to Parliament in 1983 under the Movement's banner and consolidated his control of the party in 1991. Last year he renamed it the National Alliance in an attempt to distance himself from both his own and his party's past shenanigans.
The image makeover, which will be tested in today's national elections, seems to be working. Many, perhaps most, Italians have
forgot Fini's black-shirt tactics, his nationalistic rallies, the skinhead groupies following him around chanting "Duce, Duce, Duce" and his notorious comment two years ago that Mussolini was "the greatest statesman of the 20th century." Indeed, an astounding 61 percent have rated him Italy's best politician, though far fewer -- about 20 percent -- said they would actually vote for an Alliance candidate.
"I am happy that the Italians think I have changed the face of the Italian right," he says. "I hope to show that this is not a momentary thing connected to my personality but a definitive kind of change."
Like many of Europe's new hard-right politicians, Fini has profited from a plethora of problems dragging down Italy's political establishment, including high unemployment, increasing crime and a Roman-size wave of government corruption that has washed away two former Prime Ministers and scores of other officials.
And Fini got a boost from Silvio Berlusconi, the media mogul turned politico who caused an international stir two years ago when he included Fini and other Fascists in his short-lived coalition Government. The National Alliance was rewarded for its loyalty with five ministerial positions.
Much has been written in the international press about Fini's elegance. He does, in fact, wear designer glasses and trim-cut suits. But he is only modestly chic by Italian standards. What actually draws many Italians to Fini is his ordinariness, which he works hard to project. He, his wife, Daniela, and their 10-year-old daughter live in a suburb. He loves amateur boxing, takes his video camera on vacation and likes to make political pronouncements at his favorite disco, his wife dancing wildly in the background.
That said, some women find him irresistible, and he obviously enjoys the attention. One woman, for instance, asked Fini for an autograph but couldn't find any paper. So she opened her blouse and told Fini to sign her chest.
Pity, he remarked, that his name is so short.
"Politicians used to be old and invisible," he says. "Now there is a search on for fresh blood."
What endears Fini to mother and daughter alike is that all of his joshing is done in good fun -- he lets everyone know that he loves his wife and makes a point of championing monogamy as part of his party's traditional values. He is, in short, the good son any Italian mother would like to have.
Daniela, on the other hand, is a lot more out there, a Roman version of Madonna who is every bit as popular as her husband is. She still has Fascist sympathies, sports a tattoo and loves to unload her pistol at shooting ranges around the city. She charmed Italians recently when she said in a television interview that it was more important for her soccer team than for her husband to win.
Harmless as Fini may seem, his opponents fear that his success could act as a sort of welcome wagon for all kinds of right-wing nuts, including those in his own party. While Fini's politics are driven more by personality than by issues, his party's platform is still nebulous. Local party offices are sometimes hotbeds of racism, homophobia and antifeminism. Nevertheless, few think that a Fini victory would endanger democracy. In a country that has had 55 Governments since World War II, the chances that Fini or his party would survive long enough to cause any real damage are low. What is perhaps more worrisome is the climate change that a neo-Fascist victory in Italy could trigger elsewhere in Europe. Once neo- or post-Fascists are welcomed at one table, it's that much harder to deny them a place at another.
For the time being, Fini has his eyes on one prize: a constitutional reform that will allow Italians to elect their president directly, as in France. However, even Fini says Italy isn't ready for a "post-Fascist" president and refuses to speculate on when it will be. "It's in the laps of the gods -- nobody knows," he says. "But things are accelerating."
 
JORG HAIDER
 
JORG HAIDER WAS SITTING DOWN FOR ANOTHER OF HIS frequent made-for-television interviews when the sound technician noticed a problem. An intercom chattering away with a debate in Parliament was interfering with the camera crew's sound system. "Is it possible to shut off Parliament?" asked the technician. "Not yet," joked Europe's most successful right-wing extremist.
The remark was typical Haider: a touch of humor for his million or so working-class and anti-Establishment constituents and a sly reminder for Europe that it's got a potentially dangerous bully in its midst, masked by a winning smile and packaged in a trim build.
Over the last 10 years, Haider has ratcheted his Freedom Party up to an astonishing 22 percent of the vote through a relentless populist attack on Austria's stodgy democracy. Along the way he has blamed immigrants for just about everything -- calling them parasites -- and indulged in bouts of Nazi nostalgia. He has praised Hitler's "proper employment policy," referred to concentration camps like Auschwitz as "punishment camps" and refused to issue a blanket condemnation of the SS.
"It's wrong to say an organization is a criminal organization on the whole," Haider said recently. "You cannot say some of this organization are criminals and therefore the whole organization is a criminal organization."
Haider is too clever to say anything directly against Jews or other minority groups. But, like a David Duke or George Wallace in America, he acts as official taboo breaker, saying subtly what many people may be thinking, things like putting an end to all of this Holocaust talk by proposing a general amnesty for old Nazis.
"It is necessary to draw a line after all these events, after 50 years," he says.
At this point, virtually no Austrians see Haider objectively -- they've lived with him too long and he is too polarizing. He is either vilified as the second coming of Hitler -- yes, he came from Austria too -- or championed as the fair-haired boy who will save the nation.
Wearing hiking books and blue jeans, Haider plops down in his Vienna office below framed photos of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and an anonymous border guard. "Gruss Gott," he says. "May God greet you" -- the standard hello in Austria. He looks at least a decade younger than his 46 years.
The curious photo gallery -- he appears in nearly every picture -- sums up his method: a glimmer of Hollywood, some legitimate politics and constant scapegoating of immigrants. Haider is, in fact, the closest thing Austria has to a screen idol, adept at marketing his good looks. In one notable instance he posed practically nude for a women's magazine. "It was an interesting project," he says. "A new type of politician in Austria. He is like he is."
Just the very mention of Haider elicits a swoon from a top United States diplomat and a paraphrase of a line from "My Fair Lady." With a smile, she says, "You know -- he has so much charm he just oiled his way across the dance floor."
"Oily is right," says her less-smitten Austrian assistant.
Haider, who holds a seat in Parliament and is chairman of the Freedom Party, is unlikely to win a national election outright. Nevertheless, he could be called upon after the next general election, in 1999, to participate in a coalition Government. That makes more than a few people nervous. He talks vaguely about setting up a "third republic," which sounds uncomfortably like the Third Reich. He has said he would like to combine the chancellor's and president's positions and possibly move the Justice and Interior Departments into a "Security Ministry."
What's clear to Haider and everyone else is that Austria's current, second, republic is in a rut after spending the better part of the last 50 years under coalition rule -- something akin to a perpetual Clinton-Gingrich headlock. The Government hasn't tamed record unemployment or agreed on how to reduce a mammoth budget deficit. Haider's staff feeds the public a steady diet of corruption scandals that further tarnish the political establishment. And Haider serves up easy answers to difficult questions like joblessness: "There are 140,000 unemployed Austrians," he likes to say, and "180,000 foreigners."
Haider's parents were devoted, card-carrying Nazis. His father, a shoemaker, joined a Hitler Youth group in 1929, when he was 15, and later helped bring Hitler's ideology to this tiny mountainous country. "He's typical for this older generation," Haider says. "He was engaged as a Nazi, had a vision of another world, a better world, and was disappointed and destroyed, totally destroyed. Then he had to start once more to rebuild his life."
The de-Nazification program carried out by the Allies doesn't appear to have worked on Haider or on a troubling number of his countrymen. Anti-Semitism and racism bubble to the surface quicker here than in neighboring Germany. Haider, for his part, says he might have done exactly what his father did. "I'm far from saying I would have chosen my way in another form if I were in the same situation."
Haider's hesitance to condemn his family's Nazi past is all the more troubling when you consider the source of his considerable wealth: a 3,800-acre Alpine estate sold to a relative by a Jewish owner fleeing from the Nazis. Haider insists it was "a fair transaction," but others -- including the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who has followed Haider's career -- scoff at that.
Although a champion of traditional family values, Haider keeps his home life off-limits to the press. Even his political intimates say nobody really knows him. He is married to an Austrian hausfrau and has two teen-age daughters, but none of them play any significant role in his career. Because Haider surrounds himself with young men and is rarely seen in public with his wife, Austrian and German reporters have taken to calling his Freedom Party a "little-boys' club."
"We make a good distinction between the private life and the political life, and I think it is a good thing," Haider says.
Odd that Haider's skin is still a tad thin after all these years. He has built up his career by attacking others and has sued everyone from Wiesenthal to a schoolteacher who dared to denounce him in the classroom. To Haider's dismay, the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles has hung his picture in the "Contemporary Demagogues" section, along with those of Idi Amin, David Duke and Jean-Marie Le Pen.
"And there he shall stay," Wiesenthal says confidently. "History doesn't repeat itself. People just keep making the same mistakes."
 
FILIP DEWINTER
 
FILIP DEWINTER GOT INTO POLITICS WITH HIS FISTS, AND HE still enjoys a good brawl. But the fight he is waging this particular morning in Brussels requires a more diplomatic approach.
A top leader of the extreme-right Vlaams Blok, Dewinter has called a news conference to try to charm his way off Belgium's "black list," a federal index of potential threats to national security. How is it possible, he asks, that a democratic political party -- representing 13 percent of Belgium's Flemish-speaking electorate -- could be lumped together with Islamic militants?
Part of the answer lies with the Vlaams Blok member who -- almost as Dewinter spoke -- was being arrested on suspicion of smuggling mercenaries and weapons to white resistance groups in South Africa. Fifteen years earlier the same man had been expelled from the United States after meeting with a white supremacist, J. B. Stoner. "I'm not responsible for every weirdo and lunatic who's thinking he can organize a sort of violent revolution over here," Dewinter says.
For journalists this morning, the incident was further proof that Dewinter and some of his compatriots have even more in store for Belgium than what is listed in the party platform -- which is pretty horrific in its own right. The Vlaams Blok is calling for the partition of Belgium, to cut Flanders loose from the poorer Francophone region of Wallonia. And it advocates the forced deportation of non-European immigrants according to a plan that looks similar to the Nazis' Nuremberg race laws. The party's motto: "Our Own People First."
Dewinter, 33, says he would also like to set up a European federation of right-wing extremists. He has visited the like-minded in Croatia, Russia, Ukraine and South Africa. He plans an expedition to the United States in the spring. The morning's news conference -- a public-relations disaster for any other party -- was still a good show for the Vlaams Blok and its star parliamentarian. Dewinter got his baby face on television and scored a few digs against the beleaguered Belgian Government. He had, in other words, gone down swinging.
"You should never run away," Dewinter says. "In our movement, you have to defend yourself sometimes. We are not the smooth and easy politicians of the traditional parties."
From the outside, Dewinter's English-style-cottage home looks like the others that fill the suburbs around Antwerp -- if you overlook the 15-foot sign featuring a clenched fist and the exhortation "Beat corruption, vote Vlaams Blok." Inside, his two youngest daughters are playing with dolls in a cheerfully sunny playroom. Dewinter's wife, Lutgarde, and their oldest daughter are running late, returning from a Flemish youth club. He really is, as many friends say, a doting father, the flip side to his tough image.
One needn't look very hard, however, to find clues as to why Belgian authorities are so leery of him. On one of his bookshelves is a heavy marble sculpture of the Celtic cross, adopted by some neo-Nazis as their version of the swastika. On a dresser, a photo of the French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen mingles with those of Dewinter's wife and kids. For Dewinter, Le Pen is like family, a father figure even.
Dewinter's own father -- a railroad administrator -- was also a Flemish nationalist, his mother a mainstream conservative. Born in the fairy-tale-like city of Bruges, Dewinter says he was a bit spoiled as an only child. He dropped out of college -- after getting into serious fights with left-wing extremists -- but he managed to pick up a degree from a journalists' trade school.
Dewinter walks past two tasteful paintings from Flemish artists, uncertain whether they are from the 16th, 17th or 18th century. He picks up a pair of boxing gloves and grins. "Let's knock down the Government," he says, echoing the feelings of an ever-increasing number of his countrymen.
Belgians joke that their country is the most democratic in the world -- and the most divided. One national Parliament and six assemblies and councils serve the Flemish-, French- and German-speaking communities, and there is a prime minister and a king -- all for 10 million citizens in a country the size of Maryland. This national identity crisis -- coupled with an ongoing corruption scandal and a growing immigrant community -- provides fertile ground for the Vlaams Blok, which has grown steadily since 1981. In Antwerp, Belgium's second biggest city, it is now the largest party, with 27 percent of the vote.
After visiting America last year -- where he says he saw for himself that multiculturalism would never work -- Dewinter is now more committed than ever to his immigration policies. Immigrants, nearly a third of them from Islamic countries, make up about 10 percent of Belgium's population. Under his so-called 70-point plan, Dewinter would deny non-European immigrants the right to vote, put their children in separate schools, force their employers to pay higher taxes and deport as many as possible, even second- and third-generation citizens. "We must stop the Islamic invasion," he says. "It's very difficult to accept somebody over here who believes in Islam. I think it's, in fact, impossible to assimilate in our country if you are of Islamic belief."
Dewinter makes his strongest electoral showings in mixed neighborhoods -- he calls them ghettos -- where poor whites feel "Islamicized," as he puts it. Dewinter denies that he is bigoted, though he concedes that some of his followers are. "A lot of people are becoming racist," he says. With national elections three years off, Dewinter busies himself now with foreign affairs, by which he means helping other extremists fire up their nationalist movements, just as Le Pen once did for him.
On his office wall, the fighter in him has hung a poster from his nationalist friends in the Balkans. "Croatia needs you now," it reads. "I saw the whole nation was fighting for this," he says. "It was not only a small group of military men. No, it was a whole nation who stood with their army and the people who were fighting. And that was really amazing to see, that something like that could happen."

HEADLINE: STYLE;
Barneys Bashing

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach 

 BODY:
The announcement, in January, that Barneys New York was filing for bankruptcy has prompted an outcry so gleeful and vindictive that it seems out of all proportion to the event itself, when you consider that the event is the financial collapse of a mere store. "The tyranny of fabulousness" is the term one gloating pundit used to describe the power that Barneys seems to have wielded over innocent, upstanding citizens who wanted nothing more than to go about their business, oblivious to fashion. In magazines and in newspapers (including this one), writers claim to have been oppressed by style in general and by Barneys in particular to such an extent that one begins to suspect some underlying grudge of long standing. They talk as if the store were staffed by that clique of cool kids in junior high who wouldn't let the rest of us sit at their table in the cafeteria.
At least as far back as my memory serves, one or another store in New York has been cast in the role of exclusive club. First, Bloomingdale's, in the early 70's; then, Bendel's; now, Barneys. What these stores, in their heydays, had in common was the fact that their identity resided in an esthetic. While other stores offered service, they offered attitude. The salespeople were unaccommodating, even aloof -- as if they were sitting in judgment on the customer, as if it were up to them to bestow their merchandise on those who measured up to the store's uncompromising standards. I knew women with a somewhat wobbly sense of self-assurance who would steel themselves for a trip to Bloomingdale's or Bendel's, and come away feeling that they'd passed some sort of test: they hadn't been humiliated or intimidated; they'd held their ground in the face of the salespeople's scorn, real or imagined. 
 What is striking about this particular brand of tyranny, I find, is that it requires the complicity of the victim. No one was forced to go to Barneys. If some of us are having a hard time working up any sympathy, it's because the person who has been abused by fashion must have bought into it in the first place. If we rely on the images we see in magazines and in advertising to satisfy our appetite for glamour, then we run the risk of being turned away: the world they describe is a closed one. The sting of rejection is in direct proportion to the hunger for admission.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Kenneth O. Decko;
How Business Sees the State's Economy

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
FOR more than 20 years Kenneth O. Decko, a lawyer, has been involved with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which, with more than 9,500 members, is the state's largest business organization.
Most association members have fewer than 25 employees. "We even have a huge number with under 10," said Mr. Decko, adding, "this is reflective of the state of Connecticut in terms of its business demographics." His advice to members is: "Never think you are successful. Never feel that you have achieved your goals. The minute you do that you get lazy and someone is going to take your market away from you." 
 Recently Mr. Decko discussed aspects of Connecticut's economic life. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. From your perspective is Connecticut's economy improving?
A. Slowly but surely. It's a long process. In 1994 we gained 15,000 to 20,000 jobs; in 1995 we gained slightly over 20,000. Those all came from small and medium-sized businesses. There was still substantial downsizing of large companies, particularly defense contractors.
There are a lot of good things happening. The trouble is we are going through a radical restructuring. All those institutions that gave us stability, long-term family employment opportunities for decades, were precisely the types of companies that have been hit the hardest.
Defense. Who expected the cold war to end as abruptly as it did? We're getting probably one-third of the defense dollars in Connecticut that we got less than a decade ago. Huge drops in employment from very large companies.
In the insurance industry there are tremendous competitive pressures with mergers between Connecticut Mutual and Mass Mutual, and Aetna selling off Property Casualty. Travelers selling their group insurance to somebody who then sells it to somebody else. A huge amount of change is occurring, with companies trying to find their niche doing what they do best. In financial services we had some very large banks that are now based outside Connecticut. All those had substantial job reductions.
Companies are trying to get competitive dealing with the global economy, changes in technology and consumer demands. All hit at the same time. That's a very painful long term adjustment. What we see happening is Connecticut companies, manufacturing and service, are really becoming competitive which will produce slow job growth as we go forward.
Q. Will Connecticut ever return to the prosperity of the 80's?
A. The boom in this state was a false boom based on real estate speculation. Expectations that we're ever going to return to that are unrealistic.
The other problem was a business climate that was perceived to be one of the worst in the country. In the early 90's when a company was merged or a product line ended the decision was made to move to another state. We are beginning to see some of those decisions made in favor of Connecticut.
Not just the Swiss Bank and Tenneco, but 30 smaller companies moved into the state last year. There have been some new announcements of smaller manufacturing firms moving here from New York.
Q. How about Connecticut's reputation as a high-cost state for doing business? Is that changing?
A. Our costs are lower now than in New York and Massachusetts. Short term that serves us well in terms of attracting companies from those states. Longer term we have to be competitive with North Carolina and Georgia. Those are states that have good education systems, good quality of life and good business climates. They have high-tech jobs. You look at Research Triangle in North Carolina, there are more Ph.D.s than anywhere else in the country. South Carolina has an incredible number of manufacturing facilities, a lot of foreign companies.
Connecticut needs to have its costs lowered. We don't need to be the lowest cost. We need to be in the middle of the pack. We still have a high-skilled value-added productive work force. Our quality of life can match other areas. We do have some assets.
Q. What's the association's involvement with education?
A. Education is critical at all levels. All of manufacturing today is high tech. It is also true of service industries; everybody uses computers.
To deal with competition, people must work in teams, solving problems together; they need good communication skills. That's in addition to the traditional reading, writing and calculating. Computer literacy and problem solving are basic skills in order to be employable today.
Our public schools served us very well for decades but the world changed really quickly. They need to adapt. Other institutions need to change too. Our members value graduates of the state university system and UConn. On the other end of the spectrum graduates of the vocational-technical schools aren't valued and that's supposed to be a feeder system. We are trying to turn that around.
While Connecticut used to be on top in terms of its skilled work force we need to adapt so we don't lose that edge. That's an asset we have today but we won't have it forever.
Q. Why do you oppose increasing the minimum wage?
A. Most of our members are not affected by the minimum wage. It's one of those proposals that look good on paper but when you look at what really happens you hurt the people you say you're trying to help.
The overwhelming number of people at minimum wage jobs are the elderly supplementing their income or trying to keep active, young people just out of school, second-income wage earners. You find very few primary wage-earners.
The minimum directly affects restaurants, tourism, seasonal employment. When you raise their costs they have only one choice: They reduce their work force. They can't pass on the costs to the consumer; they have to reduce overhead. There are fewer opportunities for people, particularly for those who need them most.
Q. What proposals do you have for amending environmental legislation?
A. Environmental regulations are getting better. We had gotten overregulated; Connecticut regulations exceeded Federal regulations.
The other part was a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy. Companies were waiting up to four years for a permit. With shorter product life cycles, technology changes accelerating, the global economy -- you can't operate that way. We told them, "You have to respond within a couple months." That's happening.
Also, fines for paperwork errors. Not environmental pollution, just missing forms. As you eliminate some of the paperwork hassle then it's much improved.
Q. The association is fighting the regulation of managed health care. Why is that?
A. This is a battle in every state in the country. There is a selection process in terms of providers. Those who are on the losing end -- chiropractors, podiatrists, some professionals -- are not very happy. They pressed the legislature to have managed care regulated in the health department which they feel they control so they can get back into these plans. That destroys the savings.
We were the highest per employee cost in the country in health benefits. Managed care is beginning to produce savings to employers. We don't want to see re-regulation.
Q. Are you still committed to regionalism?
A. In Connecticut our three largest cities are tiny. In the vast majority of this country your cities and your suburbs are in the same city. So we do have poverty, but people in the suburbs aren't focused as much as they should be on the problem.
This is the land of steady habits, which is a nice way of saying you're not getting rid of town government any time soon. You can begin legislatively to take government programs and add incentives to regionalize the program. More regional services will create more cohesion to deal with city problems. I think our political leaders are probably behind the public; the acceptance level has risen where we can do some things.
Cities can't survive being so small. You don't have a viable middle class base. You need to have people who are around the city who are thinking about the city and if you regionalize some services I think that begins to occur. You also begin to spread around some of the burden.

The Stylish Small Change Of a Paris Rich in Talent

BYLINE: By John Russell 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
THERE ARE MUSEUMS that jump about every which way in hopes of giving a new spin to their exhibitions pro grams.
Others stick to a policy that suits them and with which they have come to be identified. One of these is the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. Its director, Phillip Dennis Cate, has mastered many alleys and byways in French art and literature as they were practiced in Paris between 1870 and 1914. Rather than chase after big-ticket paintings by Impressionists and Post-Impressionists that can now be as expensive to borrow as they once were to buy, he decided long ago to concentrate on secondary material. 
 The Zimmerli is not a rich museum, but some years ago Mr. Cate started to reach out to fellow enthusiasts for the Parisian fin de siecle. Thanks to their backing, he has been able to buy extensively in areas where he did not, as yet, have much competition. He bought prints, drawings, posters, illustrated books and magazines, theater programs, puppets, shadow-theater silhouettes, postcards, document'ry photographs and evocative ephemera.
He could have made a stylish little show with just a fraction of the museum's material. Instead, he has put more than 200 items on display in an exhibition called "The Spirit of @ontmartre: Cabarets, Humor and the Avant-Garde, 1875-1905." On view through July 31, it is the apotheosis of a certain bohemia known for its rowdy, free-living cafes and clubs. The show is nothing short of a visual pandemonium in which image and text vie for our attention. This is an exhibition to look at closely and for hours, but it is also one to read.
Major artists -- Toulouse-Lautrec, Bonnard and Vuillard -- make cameo appearances. A major poet, Stephane Mallarme, is evoked over and over, not as a participant but as an august presence who gave encouragement to others. There is also, here and there, an echo of the poet Jules Laforgue, who later influenced the young T. S. Eliot.
But this is primarily a show of auxiliary adventures, many of which will be unfamiliar to the American museum audience. For instance, there is the shadow theater. Still fabled, this was an entertainment in which shadows of the human figure were cast from behind onto a white screen. Though often life-size, the shadows were made with cutout silhouettes only a few inches high.
It is made clear both in the silhouettes and in a film lent to the museum by the Musee d'Orsay in Paris that the shadow theater could be a medium capable of sustaining a narrative line and a large cast of characters. Though apparently effortless and produced from almost nothing, it often had a momentum that made it a true precursor of the movies. Sometimes it also came with a musical accompaniment composed for the occasion.
A star performer in the Zimmerli show is the humorist Alphonse Allais (1854-1905). Allais was not a stand-up comic in print; he never raised his voice, pulled faces or tugged at the reader's sleeve. On the contrary, his way of working verged on the surreptitious. He could use words with a wonderful economy, and he could make duets for text and image.
In the present show there is a little picture by Allais called "Funeral March for a Great Man Who Was Deaf." It consists of nine measures of total silence on an empty sheet of music paper and the indication "Lento rigolando' ("very slowly and just in fun").
The work, from 1897, has not dated at all, so lightly does Allais bring it off. It had a distinguished ancestor in the series of monochromatic paintings he made in 1879. In the heyday of the anecdotal salon painting, with its often lengthy descriptive titles, Allais suggested, in effect, that if the title told the whole story there need not be anything on the canvas.
In each of the seven images that make up his "April Fools' Album," he produced a field of plain color (black, green, beige, ocher, blue, red and white) with titles to match. The red one, for instance, is called "Apoplectic Cardinals Harvesting Tomatoes on the Shore of the Red Sea." More than a century later, with the single-color painting still with us from time to time, this too has topicality.
Allais and the masters of the shadow theater were complete professionals who knew when to cut a story short. So did Coquelin Cadet (1848-1909), a leading actor of the day, who liked to get away from the Comedie Francaise for an hour or two. When in Montmartre, he perfected a consummate cabaret turn, made up of monologues delivered in a deadpan but highly mannered style. "The monologue," he wrote, "is one of the most original expressions of
modern humor. Cooked up in an extraordinarily Parisian stew pot, it combines elements of French farce and French catch phrases with the violence of American conceptions."
Another great professional in this show is Alfred Jarry (1873-1907). His ribald and disrespectful spirit came out at full strength in "Ubu Roi," a satirical play that broke the mold of bourgeois theater once and for all. The Zimmerli collection includes a wealth of material about Jarry and "Ubu." Much of it is unfamiliar and has a ferocious actuality at a time when laconic and almost casual massacres are rarely out of the news.
That Montmartre should have been the center of such activities is a remarkable historical phenomenon. Its celebrity caused a whole troupe of minor characters to come running. Some of them still look good. We are by now familiar with Marcel Duchamp's 1919 "Mona Lisa" w'th a beard and mustache. So there is something truly startling about the date -- 1887 -- of the photo-relief of "Mona Lisa With a Pipe" by Eugene Bataille, who called himself Sapeck.
Among the resident stalwarts who carry much of the show on their shoulders, Theophile-Alexandre Steinlen, draftsman, and Henri Riviere, printmaker, deserve long-service medals. There are also times when triviality and self-satisfaction run riot. At such moments, a high tolerance of bohemia is needed. But it is the essence of the later part of the show, which includes a mass of material drawn from a wall journal called Le Mur, that it functions as a visual flea market. A close look here and there will reveal a diamond among the dust.

It's Their Album. They'll Cry if They Want To.

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
IT'S OFFICIAL: AMERICA'S NEW national pastime is self-pity. There's so much to sulk about -- economic insecurity, social disorder, frustrating jobs, romances going wrong and, for baby boomers, the inevitable responsibilities and disappointments of aging. And now, self-pity no longer means suffering in silence. In the 1990's, it's a proud, gutsy misery, strong enough to shape a whole identity. Politicians cater to it, offering scapegoats and palliatives; talk shows parade self-styled victims. And popular music, always the vent for troubled feelings, has groaned and whined its way through the decade.
For the last two years, the reigning crybaby has been Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish, which will release "Fairweather Johnson" (Atlantic) on Tuesday. The title tune is a 50-second ditty about sports fans who cheer only for winning teams, a none-too-subtle allusion to all the new supporters the band found when it became a blockbuster with its album "Cracked Rear View," which has sold nearly nine million copies since its release in 1994. "Fairweather Johnson" is Hootie's second major-label album but actually the band's fifth recording; it released independent-label albums in 1990 and 1992 and an EP in 1993. 
 Hootie and the Blowfish was started in the late 1980's by four friends at the University of South Carolina; its name combined the nicknames of two other U.S.C. students. The band, whose members are now in their late 20's, worked its way up a frat-party and club circuit that eventually stretched from Georgia to the Wetlands club in New York. But comparatively few people had heard of them before "Cracked Rear View" came out and began its stranglehold on radio and music-video channels, especially VH-1. With ringing folk-rock guitars and Rucker's hearty baritone emoting through choruses like "Hold my hand" and "I only wanna be with you," Hootie and the Blowfish suddenly came barreling down the middle of the road.
Folk-rock has become the style that spans rock's generation gap. Counting Crows certified the neo-folk-rock boom with its 1993 debut album, "August and Everything After," which sold five million copies. The Gin Blossoms, Toad the Wet Sprocket, the Rembrandts, Deep Blue Something and a Hootie soundalike, Dog's Eye View, have also strummed their way onto the charts. In the new folk-rock, baby boomers hear pleasant echoes of past favorites from Bob Dylan to the Allman Brothers; younger listeners connect via R.E.M. and its collegiate-rock disciples. Folk-rock easily straddles radio formats from classic rock to modern rock.
Amid the distortion of grunge and the claustrophobic crunch of hip-hop, Hootie's basic three-chord harmonies and steady-strummed guitars seem comforting, and they never attack. In the word most often used by Hootie's fans and detractors alike, the band sounds "normal."
Normality is the image that promotes the band. Hootie's four members -- Rucker, Mark Bryan on guitar, Dean Felber on bass and Jim Sonefeld on drums -- present themselves as hard-working regular guys: football fans and golf buddies who hang out together, drink beer, eat fast food and roll on down the road. Felber, who majored in finance, set up the band as a corporate partnership, with tax withholding and health insurance like any other full-time job.
The band flaunts no intellectual pretensions, no extreme clothes or haircuts, no androgyny, no antisocial tendencies, just a willingness to please audiences with music that sounds familiar because, by and large, it is. The fact that Rucker is black and the other three band members are white also provides a reassuring image of racial harmony as something that can be taken for granted (although "Drowning," on "Cracked Rear View," does confront bigotry). But if Hootie defines normality, then regular guys must be feeling mighty sorry for themselves.
THE BAND MEMBERS' MANLY camaraderie, the chiming major chords of the songs and Rucker's gutsy voice all guarantee that Hootie isn't a bunch of wimps. And that frees Rucker to bawl all he wants. In half of the songs on "Cracked Rear View," he sings about crying ("You wonder why I'm such a baby," he admits in "Only Wanna Be With You").
On "Fairweather Johnson" he's even more tormented; he's still crying, but he has also moved on to rage and thoughts of death. He promised lasting love in the hits on "Cracked Rear View," but the band's new songs follow through on that album's unhappy "Running From an Angel": they're laments about infidelity and and shaky or broken romances, with Rucker letting loose his wounded bellow. "Let me scream, let me scream, let me scream!" he howls in "Honeyscrew."
He also sings about screaming in "So Strange," "When I'm Lonely" and "Tucker's Town." But that's no surprise; when Hootie and the Blowfish like a word or image, they stick with it, especially if it's vague and steeped in cliche. The album keeps coming back to dreams and sun, smiling and breathing, feeling and lying and dying. "Let Her Cry" was a hit from "Cracked Rear View." On the new album, Rucker entreats, "Let me in," "Let me dream," "Let it breathe," "Let me feel it" and "Let me be the one." On "Cracked Rear View," Hootie paid tribute to Bob Dylan by quoting a verse of "Idiot Wind"; now, in "Fool," the singer is drunk and listening to Bonnie Raitt sing "Give It Up" on the radio.
"Honeyscrew" and the album's opener, "Be the One," represent the new, more openly turbulent Hootie. In "Honeyscrew," the music shifts tempo and builds churning crescendos while the singer rails at a woman who has left him. "I called today just to make me feel hopeless," he admits. In "Be the One," a rare Hootie song in a minor key, Rucker punishes his voice, rasping and slobbering incoherently about an elusive woman he's willing to die for. Both songs end with penetrating and sustained (but perfectly tuned) feedback notes; the band's not completely unfamiliar with alternative rock.
"Cracked Rear View" hid its tears in surging, optimistic tunes, and Hootie holds on to that formula for most of "Fairweather Johnson." "Old Man and Me," with a rolling Allman Brothers vamp and a Dickey Betts-style guitar solo, mulls over war, prejudice and motherly or mothering love ("When I cried, she wiped my tears"). Its chorus mentions the death of millions, but it still sounds upbeat as Rucker sings, "When I get to heaven."
THE LOYALTY AND FIDELITY that the songs begged for on "Cracked Rear View" have collapsed on "Fairweather Johnson." "I just can't find the way to let me feel like all is well," Rucker announces in "Silly Little Pop Song," before he demands, "Are you seeing someone?" Usually the singer is the one who's getting dumped; he's desperately trying to hold on while his girlfriend/lover/old flame wants to get away. The band, like good friends, unfailingly takes his side, bolstering him with tunes that reshape his maundering into anthems.
"She Crawls Away" tootles along with organ and accordion like John Mellencamp's "Cherry Bomb" (which was made, like both of Hootie's Atlantic albums, with the producer Don Gehman). It praises a woman whose "smile is like sunshine," and the chorus sounds like an affirmation as it begins, "I believe." But it goes on to say that she's "playing with another" and, later, "laying with another," as Rucker's voice turns raw and agonized. In "Tucker's Town," which takes after Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone," Rucker pines for a woman whose father hates him but comes up with a bracing chorus for the words, "I don't know what I can't see."
"Cracked Rear View" put a happier face on Hootie's search for true love, and it often made the singer sound like Prince Charming, a guy who always made the right promises. "Fairweather Johnson" shatters that facade; its narrators seesaw between childish dependence and compulsive womanizing. In "When I'm Lonely," derived from Van Morrison via Southern rock, the singer cheats on his lover, who then tries to cheat on him. "I struggle with life when I'm lonely," he moans. He makes a similar confession in "The Earth Stopped Cold at Dawn." Over sympathetic mandolin and fiddle, he sings, "Can't wait for a friend when loneliness calls." No wonder the women are walking out on him.
The music on "Fairweather Johnson" still provides the certainties of folk-rock, with its rudimentary chords and its homey strumming and picking. Meanwhile, the lyrics have grown less complacent, though without losing much of their triteness. Hootie's recent fans, if they're paying attention, probably won't find "Fairweather Johnson" as soothing as its predecessor. Even the normal guys, it turns out, are self-absorbed and hapless in love; no wonder they're whimpering too.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
At Ballet Theater, A Rebound Amid All the Bounding

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KAYE; Elizabeth Kaye, a contributing editor for Esquire, writes frequently about the arts.

 BODY:
DANCERS CONVEY MEANING through gesture. At times, these gestures take on a meaning beyond what the dancers intend. For example, the reasons for the renaissance at American Ballet Theater could be read in 'ne graceful gesture offered to the company by its premier danseur Julio Bocca in the final moment of the 1995 New York season.
On that June evening, Mr. Bocca danced the lead role of Basilio in Ballet Theater's new production of Petipa's "Don Quixote," spaged by Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director, and Susan Jones. Then, interrupting the tumultuous ovation for him, he turned to the 36 dancers behind him and bowed to those young women and men, mainstays of what he calls "the greatest company in the world." 
 It was a telling moment: the dancer often described as the world's leading male virtuoso paying tribute to a company that had weathered a dark interval and emerged to reassert a claim to primacy in the ballet world. At one level, it was a spar acknowledging a debt to gifted persons not often accorded due respect. Beyond that, it testified to the fact that a ballet company can thrive only through the labor and commitment, energy and gift that alchemize onstage into enchantment.
This enchantment is something that Ballet Theater's members expect to create consistently during their eight-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House, which opens on Monday, April 29. "If your dancers can't bring magic to an audience," says Guillaume Graffin, a principal dancer, "you're just taking their money."
American Ballet Theater, founded 57 years ago, is the phoenix of ballet companies, risen from ashes that accumulated during the 80's and early 90's, when reports of its imminent death were, to adapt Mark Twain's phrase, not really all that exaggerated.
In those years, against a backdrop of economic recession and dwindling financing for the arts, the company floundered. Under the direction of Mikhail Baryshnikov from 1980 to 1989 and of Jane Hermann, who had been the Metropolitan Opera House's presentations director, from 1989 to 1992, it became flat broke and demoralized. Though both directors were immensely talented, their often thankless, always taxing job seemed to extract from them a sourness that filtered down through the company.
"But no one person or event created the problems the company faced," says Robert Pontarelli, a spokesman for Ballet Theater who has been with the company since 1980. "The ballet boom had ended, and it was a difficult time."
Directing a company may be the balletic equivalent of scaling Mount Everest, and Ballet Theater offers a steeper climb than most. From its founding in 1939 by Richard Pleasant, with the financial backing of Lucia Chase, the troupe has been quartered in New York City, which has assured it a high profile but also a high 'egree of scrutiny. Moreover, Ballet Theater has been America's largest touring dance company and has had no home theater, two facts that result in special problems.
The company proved to be ballet's citadel of high drama, and a haven for phe glamorous Russian defectors Natalia Makarova, Alexander Godunov and Mr. Baryshnikov. A company that consistently managed, for better or worse, to cross over from the arts to the gossip pages, it became known for Mr. Baryshnikov's tempestuous pomance with the ballerina Gelsey Kirkland; for Ms. Kirkland's autobiography, with its rendering of Mr. Baryshnikov's qualities as a sexual partner and of her drug-taking, as well as for the drug-related death of the stunning dancer Patrick Bissell.
BUT FROM THE EARLY 1940'S Ballet Theater was distinguished by lustrous creative periods. Mr. McKenzie, who has overseen the company's steady resuscitation since he took over as artistic director in fall 1992 after 12 years as a dancer with the company, identifies these as its first two golden ages.
The first, as he sees it, was defined by the brilliant choreography of Antony Tudor, Jerome Robbins, Agnes de Mille and even George Balanchine, whose "Theme and Variations" was created for Ballet Theater. The second golden age, in Mr. McKenzie's view, emphasized glorious dancers, culminating with Mr. Baryshnikov and Ms. Makarova and including most of the stars of the 1960's and 70's, among them Anthony Dowell, Rudolf Nureyev, Carla Fracci and the Danish danseur noble Erik Bruhn.
As a young man, watching the elegant Mr. Bruhn, Mr. McKenzie thought, "That's what I want to be when I grow up." And during the years he performed, he became a true premier danseur, romantic and ardent, able to merge flash with style.
Still, the soft-spoken Mr. McKenzie was not an obvious choice for the role of savior. And when he was named director by Ballet Theater's board in the bleak days of 1992, when the company was facing a $5.7 million deficit, the appointment struck some in the dance community as less than inspired. Within the company, it was seen differently. "Kevin had been part of the family for so long," says Mr. Pontarelli, "that he had a clear vision of who we were and where we had to get to."
Mr. McKenzie has apparently turned out to be the right man at the right time. With a manner both commanding and unassuming, he can navigate the straits between toughness and malleability, garnering respect from dancers who nonetheless regard him as "one of us."
"I think it's important to keep that connection," he says. "They'll work for you if they're working with you."
The climate he has established permits his dancers to feel both safe and challenged. "He encourages dancers to be themselves," says the ballerina Susan Jaffe. "And he is the one person who can say during rehearsals, 'I don't buy it,' and I won't feel offended."
This ambiance has lifted company morale. While Mr. Baryshnikov could inspire dancers, he was never easy on a dancer who achieved less than perfection. That attitude had its benefits but, as one company member put it, "It's not much fun to dance when you're afraid to mess up."
In Mr. McKenzie's company, dancers seem to enjoy themselves. This was evident at Ballet Theater's studios on lower Broadway one day recently as Susan Jones conducted a noontime rehearsal with the women of the corps, instructing them, in the Shades scene from "La Bayadere," to give their arabesque an extra reach, "to make it seem from another world." An hour later, Ms. Jon's handed out fans to female soloists w'o summoned an entirely different spirit rehearsing the first act of "Don Quixote."
Nearby, seated on a trunk in a hallway, Michael Cusumano, a member of the corps, studied a video of the new Twyla Tharp piece "Elements," to learn the role that will be danced by the 20-year-old phenomenon Angel Corella. In an adjacent stu'io, Mr. Corella rehearsed with another young star, the 21-year-old Paloma Herrera; they will open the season in the lead roles of "Don Quixote." "We can'p wait," says Ms. Herrera. "We're so happy when we're on the stage."
While a ballet company's success may rest with dancers, other things must be tended to before there can be dancing. Those things are the purview of Ballet Theater's new executive director, the 42-year-old Michael Kaiser, whose temperate demeanor obscures the zeal of a leader.
Raised in New Rochelle, N.Y., he studied to be an opera singer. Convinced that he lacked the talent to be a performer, he went into business, eventually making the transition to arts administration, where stakes are high and jobs are scarce. He came to Ballet Theater last year after overseeing a remarkable turnaround at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. He had started there in 1991, when Ailey was in danger of closing its doors. Three years later, he moved on, leaving behind a deficit-free company. He is modest about his contribution to the Ailey success. "The only arts organization that can be turned around," he says, "is one that makes good art."
Turnaround is an inexact science, and no simple task for a company as big as Ballet Theater, which now has 88 dancers, as many as it had in the prosperous years of the late 70's. It is a process, Mr. Kaiser maintains, with a strong psychological component. When Ballet Theater was falt'ring, he says, "all anyone spoke of was the deficit." "But," he continues, "you have to get people to focus on the promise, on the good being done today, while you deal with the problems."
Some stabilization of the company had been achieved by his predecessor, Gary Dunning, but in the seven months since he took over the job, Mr. Kaiser has stepped up the recovery's pace significantly:
*The company now has an operating surplus of more than $1.5 million.
*Recently, the chairman of Ballet Theater's board, Peter T. Joseph, pledged to contribute $5 million over four years if Mr. Kaiser could find matching contributions, which he is doing.
*The company has received a $1.5 million grant from the Mellon Foundation.
*An annual fall New York season is planned, to start in 1997 at City Center, focusing on experimental works.
*Two new full-length ballets have been commissioned: an "Othello" to be produced with the San Francisco Ballet and choreographed by Lar Lubovitch, with music by Elliot Goldenthal, and "A Suite for Human Nature," choreographed by the former dancer Kevin O'Day, with music by Wynton Marsalis.
And in addition to the performances the complete Ballet Theater will give this year in many major cities, to accommodate demand, the dancers will also divide into two troupes to perform major repertory around the country.
"Success breeds success," says Mr. Kaiser. "Optimism breeds optimism."
No change is more significant than that achieved through the hiring of new dancers for Ballet Theater, which hap previously been able to guarantee a full house for the performances of only three dancers: the dazzling Mr. Bocca, his bewitching partner Alessandra Ferri and the fluid Russian ballerina Nina Ananiashvili.
Although Mr. Baryshnikov brought in both Mr. Bocca and Miss Ferri as principals, for the most part he dissolved Ballet Theater's custom of importing stars, a practice that had initially accounted for his own presence with the company. These stars' photographs graced posters and programs; they danced leading roles at sold-out performances. As a result, they could convert a company that was their host into their hostage. "It was all what they can do and what they can't do, and with who and with what," Mr. Baryshnikov once complained.
SO HE INSTITUTED THE system he grew up with at the Kirov Ballet, where many dancers advance from the corps to soloist to principal. When he left in 1989, this plan had produced markedly less than expected, though eventually it begat a bevy of special dancers, including the exquisitely precise Amanda McKerrow, the sinuous Ms. Jaffe and the ethereal Julie Kent.
"When you come out of the corps," says Ms. Kent, "you have a better understanding of the whole picture. When I was in the corps, during Act III of 'Swan Lake,' I sat on a little pillow the whole time. I made up my own story about why I was there, but I really wanted contact with the Prince and Odile. Now that I'm dancing Odile, I try to connect with everyone on the stage, to let them know they're as important to me as I may be to them."
Mr. McKenzie has made his mark by bringing in new soloists and principals, in the process taking the risk of damaging morale by promoting them over dancers who endured years of reduced schedules and pay. Last year, he added four men who were so gifted that their presence has served to elevate the mood and pride of most company members. They are the exotic Vladimir Malakhov, who tries to dance, he says, "the way Maria Callas sings"; Jose Manuel Carreno, whose silky charm has a distinct charm; Mr. Corella, with a smile as glittering as his leaps and spins, and Maxim Belotserkovsky, who commands the stage with brio.
"A'd they're listed as company members, not guest artists," points out the principal dancer Victor Barbee. "The asterisks are gone."
Today, Kevin McKenzie believes that Ballet Theater is embarking on a third golden age, which, with its combination of notable dancers and choreographers, could be a synthesis of the two previous eras. Given a repertory that ranges from Petipa to Tharp to Tudor, the company's signature is proving to be not the style in which it dances but the level of excellence at which it dances anything. In this regard, Ballet Theater may be on the verge of becoming the company it always wanted to be, one that announced itself in 1939 in this way: "The Greatest Ballets of All Time Staged by the Greatest Collaboration in Ballet History!"
The audience seems to sense this direction: the day the box office opened at the Met, $120,000 worth of tickets were sold, twice as much as on that day last year.
Company members sense it, too. "The dancers," Mr. McKenzie says, "are in a mode of: Go for it."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Eloquent Champion of the Vernacular Landscape

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS HAVE THREE more days to catch "A Sense of Place, a Sense of Time," the Municipal Art Society's small, delightful show of drawings by J. B. Jackson. But those who miss the show at the Urban Center (451 Madison Avenue, at 50st Street) can catch it at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, where it will run from April 29 through May 25. And those who hop on a train to see Jackson's drawings will not regret the journey. They will have the chance to travel through Jackson's subject: the American landscape in all its battered, democratic glory.
John Brinckerhoff Jackson, 86, is America's greatest living writer on the cultural forces that have shaped the land this nation occupies. In a series of insightful essays, many of them originally published in Landscape magazine and later collected in books, Jackson has taught several generations of designers to see the environment with fresh eyes. His drawings are valuable chiefly for the light they shed on his writings. No one familiar with the writings needs further proof that Jackson has an eye. But like Ruskin's drawings, Jackson's graphic work shows that the man has a hand as well. 
 Jackson has always insisted that we look at the environment in other than pictorial terms, and his drawings should not be seen just as pictures of buildings, hills or highways. For Jackson, it seems, drawing is not primarily a way of depicting things. It is a tool for framing things, a technique for fixing or loosening the boundaries around the object on view.
A 1959 drawing, for example, focuses on the Institut de France, the Renaissance palace that faces the Louvre from the Left Bank of the Seine. We can make out the Institut's famous dome, the architectural crown of the fabled Academie Francaise. But the rest of the building is reduced to a block of shadow stacked atop another shadow, the wall rising from the river. Trees intervene, and so does a row o' barges; the lovely Pont des Arts loops through the river's reflected light. The picture examines these peripheral effects as closely as it does the historic monument they frame.
"Telephone Poles," a 1947 drawing, conveys the futility of bounding the boundless. The two dimensions of the paper frame a road, a sky and telephone lines that recede into infinite space. This is a counter-Renaissance design, the American antithesis of paintings in which 15th-century architects visualized the ideal city in terms of the new technique of perspectival space. Yet Jackson also depicts an ideal city, at least as Frank Lloyd Wright once envisioned it: the decentralized city made possible by cars and telephones. Jackson records the bleakness of this city even as he suggests its potential for freedom. He uses perspectival space to illustrate the mythology of the open road. The frame is made to be escaped.
Jackson was born in France in 1909 and educated at Harvard College. He left the East for New Mexico, where he took up ranching. During World War II, he served in Europe as an intelligence officer in the United States Army. The earliest drawings in the show are pencil sketches produced in the line of duty: a bridge in Austria, farm fields and town squares in provincial France.
Jackson's wartime service was news to me, but it makes perfect sense that he developed his outlook at a time and place where people risked their lives for the sake of borders. In his writings, Jackson emphasizes the political as well as the social, economic and esthetic forces that carve up the land. The early drawings help explain this emphasis. A bridge, a field, the crest of a 'ill are not just picturesque landmarks. They delineate the edges of savagely contested terrain.
In 1951, Jackson founded Landscape magazine, a journal he published and edited until 1968. This achievement gained him a wide audience. Though aimed at professio'al landscape and garden designers, the magazine embraced the larger mission of expanding the definition of landscape beyond the scope of professional practice. In his essays, Jackson talked about roads, forests, the patterns of agriculture.
EVEN IN PEACETIME, JACKSON never ceased to be an intelligence officer, a writer who reports back to his readers on his observations from the field. Highways, telephone poles, irrigation systems and mobile homes are elements of political as well as physical organization.
In short, he extended the borders of landscape over the entire land and everything built on it. This resulted in a kind of Manifest Destiny recast in intellectual terms.
One key to Jackson's influence is the literary skill with which he made this outrageously ambitious claim appear reasonable, even modest. Jackson conquered through common sense. His ideas are straightforward, his scholarship sound but unshowy. His clear prose is the verbal equivalent of the vernacular buildings he writes about. Indeed, he is one of the few writers who can make you think that a love of the vernacular need not be a twisted form of philistine rage against the exceptional.
Though he has been a major influence on environmentalists, Jackson does not style himself an ecologist. S'me of his sharpest words are aimed at those who believe that a landscape can be beautiful without the human presence.
"The older I grow and the longer I look at landscapes and seek to understand them, the more convinced I am that their beauty is not simply an aspect but their very essence and that that beauty derives from the human presence," Jackson writes in "Discovering the Vernacular Landscape," published by Yale University Press in 1984.
"For far too long we have told ourselves that the beauty of a landscape was the expression of some transcendent law; the cdnformity to certain universal esthetic principles or the conformity to certain biological or ecological laws. But this is true only of formal or planned political landscapes. The beauty that we see in the vernacular landscape is the image of our common humanity: hard work, stubborn hope and 'utual forbearance striving to be love. I believe that a landscape which makes these qualities manifest is one that can be called beautiful."
Jackson writes as if culture itself were an ecological system, an environment in which art, politics, philosophy and other spheres of information are constantly interacting. At times, it seems that Jackson is using landscape as a metaphor for the complex links between these spheres.
Those who fall under Jackson's spell will find it hard to look at buildings as distinct objects, even though that is the way architects usually design them. Though a building has physical boundaries, its meaning and value depend on its relationship to the city outsid' them. Not just the physical space around the building, but also the economic, social, political and historical forces converging on its site. The building provides a frame for examining those forces.
Jackson, who continues to write from his ranch near Santa Fe, did not invent this way of looking. A century ago, Louis Sullivan wrote that "once you learn to look at architecture not merely as an art more or less well or more or less badly done, but as a social manifestation, the critical eye becomes clairvoyant." Jackson's eye may be the most penetrating this century has produced.

We Need a Ron Brown Award for Business

BYLINE: By ROBERT M. TOMASKO; Robert M. Tomasko is a business adviser in Washington and author most recently of "Go for Growth" (John Wiley & Sons, 1996).

 BODY:
COMMERCE Secretary Ronald H. Brown was an extraordinarily effective ambassador for our country's business community, and he will be missed.
But we can commemorate both his life and his belief that business can be a force for good by establishing an award that would be granted -- as a parallel to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards -- to our nation's top exporters and most thoughtful, responsible overseas investors. 
 Well-managed, prestigious incentives like the Baldrige awards encourage positive corporate behavior. While it is important to hold business accountable for its missteps, as the press has done recently about downsizing, the impact of knuckle-slapping is usually short-lived. Shining the limelight on positive corporate role models is much more likely to produce lasting change. Not every company is downsizing; many are fueling job growth through what Mr. Brown made his personal mission: the selling of American goods and services abroad.
As a management consultant, I've been pleasantly surprised by how seriously companies take the Baldrige quality award. It has had a ripple effect on much corporate behavior. But while quality is vital, it is no longer sufficient. It may provide entry to the global arena, but it no longer guarantees that a business will prevail.
That is where Ron Brown's mission comes in. His tenure as Commerce Secretary was marked by total commitment to American companies' achieving growth through full participation in the world's markets. He also knew that such growth carried with it social responsibilities -- to the host countries' laws, to foreign consumers and to the emerging global consensus on issues like pollution and child labor.
A Ron Brown award would help keep his vision alive. Let the prize go to those companies -- small and large -- that fuel our country's growth through prowess in world markets. If the history of the Baldrige awards is a fair guide, the Brown awards might be the catalyst that business needs to turn its sights outward, toward growth.

Ending Rent Controls the Massachusetts Way

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A LAWYER named Charlyn Burton-Goldman is no friend of a property owner named Ronald Brown. He was her landlord in what she describes as a lovely pink three-story building with a courtyard at 38 Brown Street, a 51-unit condominium in the town of Brookline, just outside Boston. It was converted from a rental in 1983, but her own apartment was never purchased.
The two were antagonists in court on overdue rent charges and service complaints for years. Mr. Brown won an eviction order, and the lawyer-tenant kept appealing. But it all ended last June. Ms. Burton-Goldman bought a two-bedroom condominium in the same complex from an owner-occupant. 
 "I knew I would be out on my fanny by December, so I figured I had better be out fast," she said.
The sudden urgency was the result of rent decontrol in Massachusetts. Small property owners in Cambridge succeeded in getting a question on the state ballot in 1994 to eliminate existing controls and bar localities from imposing them without economic compensation for owners. The owners raised more than $1 million -- somewhat less than half of it from state and national trade organizations -- and collected more than 100,000 signatures in a citizens initiative. They won with 51 percent of the vote.
The prohibition was to take effect comprehensively on Jan. 1, 1995. But after the referendum the communities affected -- Cambridge, Brookline and Boston -- petitioned the Legislature for an exemption. A bill passed but Gov. William F. vetoed it. Then he signed a bill allowing a phase-out over two years.
Tenants without a demonstrable financial need were decontrolled on Jan. 1, 1995. But if the tenant's income was under 60 percent of areawide median, or under 80 percent for the elderly or disabled, decontrol was deferred. The deferral ran to Jan. 1, 1996, for condominiums or small buildings (three-families or less, or owner-occupied buildings with up to 12 apartments), and to Jan. 1, 1997, for everything else.
The income guidelines apply in Boston only to tenants who have continuously occupied their apartment since 1976. Boston enacted vacancy decontrol in that year -- with a free-market rent when a controlled apartment is vacated. But since 1983 tenants have had a right to file a grievance with the local Rent Equity Board over lease-renewal increases. This right they have now lost. Brookline also has vacancy decontrol, but in a purer form and only since 1990. There is no grievance procedure on renewal leases.
The immediate impact of deregulation has come in situations where tenants were paying rents far below true market value. Many tenants like Ms. Burton-Goldman have moved out, sometimes into purchased homes or apartments. Others have stayed on at rents that are now marching rapidly toward market levels. On the pertinent question of what they pay now, or paid before, as a percentage of their income there is no information.
"Will people die from this? I can't say that," said Matt Henzy, interim director of the Massachusetts Tenants Organization in Boston. "But there has been a negative impact. People have had to pay more than they can afford, and move out of their communities."
In one survey in the Fenway neighborhood, near Symphony Hall in Boston, it was found that 36 percent of rent-controlled elderly tenants -- 118 out of 322 households -- left the neighborhood between October 1994 and April 1995, Mr. Henzy said.
There has also been a psychological change, most notable when it is expressed by the small owners in Cambridge who led the anti-rent-control movement. They feel they have won control over their property, which a harsh enforcement of a rent-control law had denied them.
W E bought a house with rent-controlled apartments on Chester Street in Cambridge in 1986 planning to live in it," said Denise Jillson, chairwoman of the Massachusetts Homeowners Coalition, which led the ballot drive. "Then we went to the rent board to try to get possession. I found I could pay $10,000 to the tenant plus her moving expenses and she would need 90 days to leave. The 'mediation' that the tenant advocates were proposing was nothing but extortion."
Ms. Jillson and her husband, George Pereira, who have two children, had sold their house in New Hampshire and were planning to occupy one of the four renter-occupied apartments in the Chester Street house -- a seven-room unit in which the 10-year tenant was paying $200 a month and subletting out four of the rooms. The couple finally did dispossess the tenant. Then they fought with the rent board over its refusal to reimburse them through rent increases for the reconstruction work that Mr. Pereira personally undertook on the building.
The Massachusetts events are a striking illustration of small property owners rising up to overcome their local weakness at the ballot box. It is not an option available to the disaffected small owners of New York City, who long have felt themselves the principal victims of New York regulations.
The New York Constitution does not permit citizen ballot initiatives. In any event rent regulations usually do not affect buildings with fewer than six units. And the law lets buyers who intend to occupy an apartment dispossess a regulated tenant to do so (with protections for the elderly or disabled). The regulations implement the Emergency Tenants Protection Act of 1974, which is renewed by the State Legislature periodically. It comes up again next year.
Even in California, center of citizen-initiated ballot questions, property owners have not attempted an anti-rent-control drive, apparently because controls are so widespread that their chances are slim. But vacancy decontrol is in effect in most places with rent controls, and last year the Legislature mandated vacancy decontrol in the handful of communities that lack it, including Berkeley and Santa Monica.
The Cambridge owners failed in 1989 to place on the local ballot three propositions that would have made it easier for condominium buyers to get possession of their apartments. After that, changes on the City Council led to tighter enforcement of existing regulations, and the decision by owners to seek a statewide referendum.
The Cambridge rent board will go out of business next month, said Terrence P. Morris, who left city employment this month after serving as the board's executive director since 1990. Although there are no figures on how many renters moved after decontrol, he said that in the 12-month period after the referendum the number of registered voters in Cambridge declined by 6,000.
"Thousands moved, but many were living in apartments that they could afford and they are still living there," he said. The inventory of controlled apartments has shrunk from 16,200 to 1,300, he said.
Condominium conversions were common in Cambridge in the 70's. In 1979 the city set up a regulatory procedure that condominium buyers had to follow to take possession of their apartments. It was largely ignored, Mr. Morris said, setting up an aggrieved class of owner-occupants years later when Cambridge tried to enforce the law against buyers who were deemed to have taken possession of their apartments illegally. These owner helped fuel the anti-rent-control movement.
Larger owners say they are not trying to force longtime renters to pay market rents all at once. One such owner, Edward E. Zuker, principal in Chestnut Hill Realty in Brookline, said he was phasing in rent increases to a total of 80 percent of the market rent, with the dollar amount of the monthly increase in any year capped at $75 to $150, depending on the size of the unit.
In a typical situation -- 37-41 Auburn Street in Brookline, with 34 apartments -- 12 apartments were decontrolled on Jan. 1, 1995, because of the referendum. Half the tenants have stayed. A tenant who had been paying $650 a month in 1994 for a one-bedroom now pays $850, Mr. Zuker said. When the rent reaches $880 in January it will be at 80 percent of market value, he said.
Among younger people who have saved money while living at below-market rents, buying has been an option. Kenneth Westhassel, a tenant in his 40's who lived for 20 years in a four-unit walk-up near Symphony Hall in Boston, said his landlord had tried to raise his rent in one shot to $1,500 a month from $802 a month.
But Mr. Westhassel, a secretary at Boston University law school, had saved to buy a house. He has bought one for about $150,000 in Medford, six miles north of Boston. "I'm enthused and frightened at the same time," he said. "But my mortgage payments are $60 less than my old rent and I have two-and-a-half to three times the space."

'Take Our Daughters'? Always Have

BYLINE: By VERNON McCLEAN; Vernon McClean is professor of African-American studies at William Paterson College.

DATELINE: WAYNE

 BODY:
IN the Virgin Islands, my mother worked as a maid for Mr. Sebastian, the European proprietor of a white-owned store on Main Street. As a small boy, I'd come to work with her each day; I remember that she once slapped my face after I'd used his bathroom. (I later understood that I shouldn't have flushed: water was scarce on the island. But how was I to know? We blacks didn't have indoor plumbing at all.)
I think about Mr. Sebastian's house whenever I think about Take Our Daughters to Work Day, which is to be observed on Thursday. This is the fourth such observance; the day was started in 1993 by the Ms. Foundation for Women as a way for girls aged 9 to 15 to see what goes on in the working world. 
 But black women have always taken their children to work. Of course, the lessons we learned going to work with our mothers were not necessarily the lessons white feminists might have wanted us to learn. As a young boy, I learned that white people are powerful: they can make you abuse your children. I also learned that we were poor -- which is why my mother, and like so many other black mothers, took her children to work. She had no day care, so she had no choice.
Which is not to say that I never learned anything of value. Another memory is that of my mother baking bread in Mr. Sebastian's oven. Through observation and with her guidance, I too learned how to bake bread. I helped her make the beds and wash the floor in Mr. Sebastian's home, so she could get home early. Decades before the word "sexism" was coined, she was a pioneer in non-sexist child rearing.
As I had children of my own, I too took them to work -- partly out of economic necessity, partly out of a paternal nurturing instinct. Why should I put my daughter in day care when I could lecture to a class at William Paterson College while she was sleeping in a box in the back of the classroom? And of course, my experience is not unique.
The experience of being with a parent at work, of learning the world of work, is far too important to be confined to a single day a year. That holds true for everyone, black or white or Latino or Asian. But there is a racial dimension to this issue that cannot be ignored, for the overall experience of work depends heavily on whether or not you are black. Consider the following:
* Despite affirmative action, according to a bipartisan Federal commission, white men make up only 29 percent of the work force but hold about 95 percent of all top management positions. The report by the Glass Ceiling Commission cited studies suggesting that "the glass ceiling exists because of the perception of many white males that as a group they are losing -- losing the corporate game, losing control and losing opportunity."
* While an increasing number of white women have joined the work force in the past decade, the percentage who do so out of economic necessity is still far lower than the percentage for minority women. Whereas white women's income may be supplemental, black women's income is required to maintain middle-income status.
 * Finally, far too many black workers, and especially women, are confined to a sort of glass cellar. At William Paterson, for example, black women are still disproportionately represented among those cleaning the bathrooms. While the 325-member faculty has only 8 black women, the janitorial staff has many times that number.
As a whole, our parents -- too many of them -- still work in white people's homes, taking care of your daughters. Our daughters do not want to go to work in your home. They want other options. Black people want jobs for themselves and their mates. We want an education, and an end to race discrimination. We want programs of value to accomplish these aims, not one day a year exhorting us to "take our daughters to work."

HEADLINE: Economics of Caring for the Aged

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
CLORINDA MORELLI turned 106 last week, celebrating the occasion quietly with her 80-year-old daughter, friends at the nursing home where she resides and, if not as many candles on the cake as years, then at least memories of a life well lived.
The secret to her longevity: "Hard work and a happy-go-lucky attitude," said Mrs. Morelli, who traveled by ship from Milan, Italy, to America when she was 19 to marry her boyfriend, Luigi. Later she worked in a dress factory, raised three children and only moved to the county-run nursing home, the Ruth Taylor Geriatric and Rehabilitation Institute in Valhalla, when her daughter grew too old to care for her. 
 But as unusual as passing the 100-year mark might seem, it is rapidly losing its special meaning, according to the United States Census Bureau. By the year 2050, projections indicate that there will be 834,000 Americans who are at least 100 years old compared with 36,000 in 1990.
In Westchester, Mrs. Morelli is a member of the fastest-growing population group -- the elderly over the age of 85. In 1990, there were 13,794 people in the county in that age category; by 2020, that number is expected to double, according to projections from the county's Planning Department. The over-65 population in general is also expected to grow, from 829,946 or about 14 percent of the county's population in 1990 to a projected 839,618 or 17 percent by 2020.
With those kinds of demographics at work, new industries are rushing to tap what is considered an under-served population. Elder law specialists, health care professionals, continuing care housing developers and geriatricians report that Westchester's increasingly well-heeled and politically empowered senior citizenry represents a lucrative market.
"Clearly, the elderly are a resource to be tapped, an industry if you will," said Valerie Hail, an elder care specialist who also is the host of radio and cable television programs for the elderly.
Ms. Hail counsels the elderly and their adult children on Medicare and other insurance issues, prescription drug programs, financial matters and long-term care problems. Her radio program on WVIP-AM (1310) and her television program, each of which are heard four times a week, often feature older people who are "getting advanced degrees, starting new businesses, becoming authors or even falling in love," she said.
"Sixty-five doesn't just mean retiring and gardening anymore, especially when you may be looking at a good 20 or 30 years still to come," Ms. Hail said.
With new longevity projections in hand, developers of retirement communities are eager to tap the growing senior market, especially since New York recently eased its regulations governing continuing-care housing. At the same time, many older citizens are willing to roll over equity from their single-family residences to housing that will allow them to live independently at first and offer them assisted living and even nursing home care if the need arises.
"All of the elements are coming together," said Phillip M. Anderson, vice president of development and acquisition for Classic Residence by Hyatt, which is planning to build the state's first life-care community in New Rochelle.
"The demographics are right," Mr. Anderson said. "Westchester has the upscale buyers, and we have the upscale product. It's an underserved population."
The Chicago-based company, a branch of the Hyatt Corporation, hopes to build one- and two-bedroom cooperative apartments selling for $200,000 to $600,000 at the 17-acre New Rochelle site and at another undisclosed Westchester spot, he said. The developments would also include health care centers for assisted living and skilled nursing services.
Monthly maintenance fees of about $1,900 would cover meals, activities, operating costs, assisted living and nursing services and taxes, among other things. The company has built similar communities in West Hartford, Conn., Naples, Fla., and Monterey, Calif. It has also built upscale rental units in Teaneck, N.J., Chevy Chase, Md., Dallas and Reno and, in Florida, in Naples, Pompano and Hollywood.
In Rye, Mark R. Zwerger, chief executive officer of the Osborn, a retirement community, said the 56-acre campus there is undergoing a $70 million expansion, adding a four-story, 54-unit apartment building, 13 two-family houses and an 84-bed nursing home. There is already a waiting list for the expanded services, which will be available later this year.
Mr. Zwerger said that in addition to the recent changes in state law, which had previously banned life care communities, real estate prices in the county for commercial property have dropped, making continuing care developments more lucrative for builders.
Also, he said that fewer retirees are moving to southern locations and that many are instead choosing to remain close to part-time work options in the Northeast or families and community amenities.
"All preconceived notions of what one typically does in his or her 70's and 80's are changing," Mr. Zwerger said.
Apartments at the Osborn will also require a deposit of $200,000 and up, plus maintenance fees. At both the Hyatt and Osborn projects, deposits are refunded when the owner either moves out or when he or she dies, in which case the deposit goes to the estate.
A less expensive retirement community of 1,500 units in Greenburgh is being proposed by Senior Campus Living, a Baltimore developer. That project would require a deposit of about $170,000 and a monthly maintenance fee of $1,200.
Ms. Carpenter, at the county's Office for the Aging, said that although many of Westchester's elderly residents are wealthy, there are those who are "cash rich with houses, but they don't have $2,000 a month."
She continued: "There are lots of seniors with equity in their homes but no real income. There's definitely a market for them, too."
Meanwhile, lawyers and doctors are also profiting from the demographics. Janet K. Schloat, executive director of Legal Awareness of Westchester, a nonprofit White Plains organization, said that just a decade ago most elder law was concerned with trusts and estates.
"Now lawyers are helping clients understand nursing-care issues, how to pay for long-term care and how to plan ahead. Increasingly, they're very busy," she said.
Steven Shurkman, a White Plains lawyer specializing in elder law, said his clients are concerned about asset protection, long-term health care costs and insurance options.
"Even the wealthy are worried about how to pay for these things," he said. "As people live longer, their need for long-term care is also likely to increase. There is a great concern about preparing ahead."
Geriatricians, too, are seeing growing practices because the elderly are living longer. Dr. Thomas J. Kalchthaler, director of Geriatric Services, a Yonkers-based private medical practice, said more effective treatments for hypertension, diabetes and heart disease along with healthier life styles, which include proper diet and exercise and the absence of cigarette smoking, were beginning to pay off.
Dr. Jeffrey E. Escher, who is also with that practice, said that as many of his older patients live longer and healthier lives, they are also growing impatient with the stereotyping of older citizens. "They refuse to be talked down to anymore," he said.
Ruth Inabu Fox, who is on the national board of the Gray Panthers and a member of the Westchester chapter, said her group was fighting against "three 'isms' -- racism, ageism and sexism."
"We're concerned about social security, Medicare, housing for the elderly and a host of other issues," she said. "But most of all, we want an end to the stereotypes."

HEADLINE: Route 6 Uproar In the Quiet Corner

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM

 BODY:
DEAD corn stalks poke out from a farmer's field along the roadside, under the flickering embers of a late afternoon sun. The rolling landscape of Coventry seems to stretch on forever, and the sight of angular clapboard homes spread far apart among the hillocks suggests a Connecticut before the age of the automobile, perhaps even rail.
To enter Coventry is to understand why the northeastern part of the state is called the Quiet Corner. In Coventry, as in many towns in Tolland and Windham counties, development has been slow. Many say business has atrophied in recent years, to the point where the main city in the region, Windham, has wilted under high unemployment and a depleted tax base. 
 Yet in Coventry, there are many who are comfortable with the community the way it is, like Tracy Enders, who moved to the town from the Washington, D.C. area. "There are people out here trying to raise families, concerned about the quality of life," she said. "We accept that you have to go a little slower out here. We accept that it takes a little longer to get to the grocery store, or 25 to 30 minutes to get to the mall."
Michael Williams, another Coventry resident, interrupted: "Or getting stuck behind a farmer's tractor."
Ms. Enders nodded. "You laugh about it and go on," she said. "It's not like D.C., where you have stop-and-go traffic outside your driveway for 10 to 15 minutes." That could change, they argue, if the state is allowed to build a four-lane expressway across their town (37.3 square miles in size). Since Coventry is only a dozen or so miles from Hartford, Ms. Enders and others say such a highway would likely be the last straw for a town already vulnerable to what they call "urban sprawl."
The controversy has plagued Connecticut for more than a generation.
It is known as the "Route 6" issue, not only for the highway that would be built (designs for which have been in a constant state of flux for years) but also for the two-lane highway that is presently in operation.
The existing Route 6, with only one lane going in each direction from Bolton Notch to the Columbia-Windham border, is viewed by the State Department of Transportation and many area residents as unable to handle demand -- from the tide of commuters shuttling between Hartford and northeastern Connecticut and those who use Route 6 as a link between Interstate 84 and Providence, R.I. Driveways and access roads to some 200 homes line the 11-mile stretch, and tend to disrupt the flow of traffic. So too can a car being driven at the posted speed limit, which may find itself the lead vehicle of a very cranky motorcade.
But inconvenience is not the reason the thin ribbon of road earned the monicker "Suicide 6," or was named one of the nation's most dangerous highways last year by Reader's Digest magazine. According to D.O.T. figures, there have been 37 fatal automobile accidents on the road since 1974, many involving head-on collisions.
D.O.T. staffers argue that their newest expressway design, called Alternative 54 or Manny, would improve safety and decrease demand along existing Route 6 by rerouting through traffic, which constitutes half the road's current capacity. But no action is expected, at least not for a while.
The Transportation Department has yet to submit a formal request to build Manny, originally one of three alternatives. (Remember the Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe and Joe -- who helped when the car went on the fritz?) The Army Corps of Engineers says Manny would cause immense ecological harm to the region, in particular to the Hop River and Nathan Hale State Forest, and has indicated it would not approve Manny. That has been seconded by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
While the dispute is commonly portrayed as one between state and Federal government, there is likewise a wide divergence of view on the issue within the region most affected. Pamela Z. Sawyer, a State Representative from Bolton, is one of the leading voices for Manny, even though the current design would come within an eighth of a mile of her own home. Her stand has not made her especially popular with some neighbors, she admitted.
But she cites safety and business needs. "I don't think you can separate those two when you look at the one word: Future," Ms. Sawyer said. "This community is going to have to grow, and we have to look at a long-range plan to satisfy the needs of Connecticut." She noted that Route 6, according to D.O.T. estimates, handles 12,000 to 18,000 vehicles a day.
A planner with the Transportation Department, J. Mark Foran, said Manny would significantly decrease the number of trucks and other through-traffic vehicles by providing a quicker alternate route. "In general, traffic along Route 6 would drop," he said. "It would rise as the area became suburbanized, but not as high as it is now for the next 20 years."
Mr. Foran's superior, the department's policy and planning chief, Richard Martinez, points to an impressive list of supporters for the Manny plan, including the State Department of Environmental Protection, the State Historical Commission and three of the four towns in the Manny corridor: Bolton, Andover and Columbia. All three towns showed majorities in favor of Manny in public polls taken last summer, as high as 91 percent in Colombia.
In addition, Connecticut's national delegation has come out in support of the plan. In late February, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and Representatives Sam Gejdenson and Barbara B. Kennelly met with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Carol M. Browner, for an hour to discuss Route 6. An aide to Ms. Kennelly, Robert J. Croce, said the object "was to impress on the E.P.A. the severity of the Route 6 issue."
In the other corner have been a variety of environmental interest groups, led by the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. Donald S. Strait, the organization's executive director, complained that the D.O.T. has continued to press for similar highway plans despite earlier denials at the federal level.
"We don't feel Conn D.O.T. has taken any kind of serious look at alternatives that can improve safety and efficiency without incurring tremendous loss," he said.
Coventry has also been a significant bastion of opposition to Manny. One reason is obvious to anyone looking at a map: For more than half of Manny's 11.2-mile length, the new highway would snake across two separate sections of the town (crossing a corner of Andover in between).
There is another aspect, opponents say. "We are at a point in time where we need to get away from the malignant kinds of development highways spawn, and think about clean air and the resurgence of local communities," said Bruce Bellm, a Mansfield representative to the Windham Regional Planning Agency. "Hartford's air quality is bad for a reason," he said. "We don't want that reason to come up here."
One of the centers of gravity for the anti-highway movement has been Matthew O'Brien, a member of the Coventry City Council.
Mr. O'Brien said that if Route 6 had been upgraded, and "they had put in a raised median and left-hand turn lanes, they would have eliminated more than 70 percent of the fatalities, just like that."
"It's all within their right of way," he said, "they don't even have to widen to four lanes."
Mr. O'Brien disputes several D.O.T. statistics, including the agency's assertion that half the vehicles traveling Route 6 are through traffic. He also said that the biggest single reason for Route 6's dangerous reputation is driving habits. "People drive like maniacs here," he said.
But he and his supporters view the D.O.T. as the big villain. "People are dying on this highway, no question about it," Ms. Enders said. "And the state D.O.T. has realized if they keep those people dying, that's their ticket to building a highway."
Comments like these leave D.O.T. staffers like Mr. Foran shaking their heads. They also anger highway supporters who live within the Route 6 corridor, and who argue that most highway opponents are little more than speculators who took advantage of falling real estate prices when the exact positioning of a new highway was still in flux.
"The main movers and shakers in Coventry are those that live right along the corridor, that have moved there since 1988," Ms. Sawyer said. "And a couple of them are out of work."
Others characterize the highway opponents as obstreperous if not menacing.
"There's no compromise," said Rose Fowler, a former Coventry First Selectman who argues there are many like her who support a highway but are afraid to declare themselves. "This small group, whose homes are going to be taken away," if a highway is built, "they are vicious, they are cruel." "They are the type of people who stand up at a meeting and say it doesn't matter if lives are lost, we have to save the lizards."
She recalled a meeting held in Coventry in January of 1995, one that highway opponents point to as a sign of their strength because no one there spoke in favor of a highway. Ms. Fowler agreed this was so. "I walked out of that meeting, and felt like I didn't belong," Ms. Fowler said. "It was like if I had spoken, I would have been physically attacked."
Mr. O'Brien called the charges of land speculation "nonsense," saying that many of those in Coventry opposing the highway have lived there for generations.
Some supporters say a four-lane highway would actually protect the suburban character of the corridor, which would not have any interchange with the highway, by diverting through traffic. Mr. Foran points to Route 154 along the Connecticut River, which, since being replaced by Route 9 as the major connector between Hartford and Interstate 95, has become more rural in character.
Adella Urban, Columbia's First Selectman, said the only feasible alternative, widening existing Route 6 by two lanes, would be worse.
"If everybody bucked a road like we have here, we'd have an ox-and-cart transit network," she said.
Ms. Sawyer didn't dispute the idea that a highway would open up area farmland to development, but added that the rural character of northeastern Connecticut would disappear regardless of Manny's fate. "The farmers there are older than 35," she said. "There are not the 20-year-old farmers coming up." In Bolton, she noted, there were four dairy farms six months ago, and only two as of last February.
Last year was the year Route 6 went national, after it was profiled by Reader's Digest and on television programs like "Inside Edition." Yet in other respects it was not a good year for highway supporters.
When Edith Prague of Columbia ran for a State Senate seat in 1994, one of her campaign planks was to support Manny, Alternate 54. That changed after she attended the Coventry meeting.
"It was the first time in my political career that I said I'd do one thing and did another," she said. "My job is to represent the people in my district. The people in Andover and Columbia love 54, because it doesn't do anything to them. But the people in Coventry are so opposed. My job is to represent all the people in my district."
Another blow came with the election of Ed Turn as Andover's First Selectman. Despite the fact Andover residents came out strongly in favor of Alternative 54, they nevertheless elected Mr. Turn, who not only opposes a highway but also helped found the main opposition group, Citizens for a Sensible Six. The vote was a close one, however.
Douglas Thompson, a wetlands ecologist with the E.P.A.'s regional office in Boston, calls the proposed highway "one of the most damaging projects in terms of the wetlands" in the northeastern United States in the past decade. Even though that impact would be substantially less than an earlier D.O.T. plan, he said, it was still too much.
For the moment, the epicenter of the debate seems to have shifted to Washington, D.C., where both sides appear content to let the issue play itself out.
Dianne Grenier, one highway supporter from Andover, jokes that after a generation of squabbling and considering alternate highway plans, both sides may be suffering from battle fatigue.
"There's nothing left for us to do," she said. "They know how we feel. It's time for them to take charge."

HEADLINE: Federal Budget Knife May Cut Aquaculture

BYLINE: By SAM LIBBY 

 BODY:
A FEDERAL aquaculture laboratory that helped make Connecticut a leading producer of oysters -- and is poised to revive the state's scallop industry -- may be eliminated in the 1996-97 Federal budget.
The National Marine Fisheries Service's laboratory in Milford could be eliminated or have at least 50 percent of its $2 million budget cut, said Scott Kovarovics, an aide to Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat. 
 In the 1970's a survey by laboratory scientists determined that less than 1 percent of the state's historically most productive beds were still capable of producing oysters. But the lab's scientists helped develop advanced methods of cultivating local stocks, making harvests possible again. Currently the state produces nearly 850,000 bushels of oysters each year with a wholesale value of about $40 million. (Connecticut is the second-largest producer of oysters in the United States, after Louisiana.)
The laboratory was vital in this effort and it is definitely needed to re-establish the state's scallop industry, said Dr. Richard Cooper, director of the Marine Science and Technology Center of the University of Connecticut. One of the center's first projects is to re-establish a Connecticut scallop industry in cooperation with the laboratory. According to Federal fishery reports, the last commercial harvest of scallops occurred in 1965 when 12,000 pounds were harvested in Stonington and Niantic waters. Since then, the state's mute swan population has exploded, and they have decimated the eel grass needed by juvenile scallops.
Currently three UConn employees are working at the Milford laboratory, said Dr. Cooper. The intent of the cooperative venture is to develop a sort of cookbook or manual that will allow state residents and private businesses to cultivate marketable scallops indoors, in nets, or specially designed docks that could also be used by marinas.
The Milford laboratory is developing strains of phytoplankton to feed the scallops that would accelerate their growth and increase their scallops' market value, and could be provided to local producers at low cost. The laboratory is also developing strains of scallops that could be profitably produced indoors or in state waters. If a commercial scallop industry is developed, the state's waters could be restocked and recreational scalloping could become an important part of the state's tourism industry, said Dr. Cooper.
But if the laboratory is eliminated, or if its budget is suddenly cut in half, the revival of the scallop industry will have been made impossible, Dr. Cooper said. Though it may be possible to find private support to replace the Federal funding, that takes time, he said.
Aquaculture has a new importance because of the collapse of vital commercial fisheries, said Dr. Anthony Calabrese, officer in charge of the Milford laboratory. Although aquaculture will never replace the ocean's natural fishery resources, the development of aquaculture will give fisheries the opportunity to recover from overfishing, he said.
The laboratory is also trying to develop aquaculture techniques for tautog, commonly known as black fish.
In Connecticut, "aquaculture is the fastest growing and the second largest segment of our agricultural industry," wrote Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat of New Haven, in a February letter to other members of Congress urging them to restore $1.25 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's aquaculture budget.
"In these tough economic times," she wrote, "Congress must support cost-effective methods to strengthen the aquaculture industry on which so many jobs in coastal areas depend."
The cut in aquaculture funding is being proposed by House Republicans, who had sought the elimination of the Department of Commerce in earlier budget proposals. The Milford laboratory is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which in turn is an agency of the Department of Commerce.
President Clinton has proposed increasing the Commerce Department's aquaculture funding, said John Klein, an aide to Representative DeLauro.

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER 

 BODY:

THE AGE OF EXTREMES: A History of the World, 1914-1991
By Eric Hobsbawm. Vintage, $16.
The author views the past through a Marxist lens, analyzing events in terms of their economic and social consequences. Highly critical of unfettered capitalism, he sees it as an extreme with as much destructive potential as the former Soviet system. Last year our reviewer, Stanley Hoffmann, called the book "a bracing and magisterial work from a rich and acerbic mind."
 
LADDER OF YEARS
By Anne Tyler. Fawcett Columbine, $12. 
 Delia Grinstead, dutiful daughter, wife and mother, does the unexpected: at age 40, she walks away from the beach and keeps going. Disappearing from her family during a vacation, she takes on the identity of a single, unencumbered woman. But in Anne Tyler's 13th novel, Delia discovers that a new life can become as messy and imperfect as the old one. "So measured and delicate is each observation . . . so astute and open the language, that the reader can . . . experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable," Cathleen Schine wrote here last year.
 
THE MONKEY WARS
By Deborah Blum. Oxford University, $14.95.
How ethical is it to experiment -- often painfully -- on primates who are genetically so close to our own species? This book examines the benefits (health advances like the polio vaccine) and the costs (cruel proofs of self-evident theories). The author "is a terrific reporter. . . . And she is scrupulously fair," Douglas H. Chadwick said in the Book Review in 1994.
 
THE WINSHAW LEGACY: Or What a Carve Up!
By Jonathan Coe. Vintage International, $14.
The scene is Margaret Thatcher's England, where Michael Owen, a young writer, has been asked to write a history of the Winshaws, whose riches and morals go back to the slave trade. The result "is a big, raucous and exhilarating novel," Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times last year.
 
HARLEM: THE MAKING OF A GHETTO.
Negro New York, 1890-1930
By Gilbert Osofsky. Elephant/Ivan R. Dee, $14.95.
Now restored to print, this social history traces the evolution of a neighborhood from a well-built suburban enclave to a downtrodden area inhabited largely by the poor and black. When it was first published in 1966, our reviewer, Richard J. Whalen, called it "a pioneering scholarly achievement." Another facet of urban racial history emerges in THE BLACK CHURCHES OF BROOKLYN, by Clarence Taylor (Columbia University, $16.50). The author analyzes the role of the church, from storefront congregations to major institutions. This is "a fine overview of a too-long-neglected chapter in New York history," Hanna Rubin said here last year.
 
Entertaining Angels
By Marita van der Vyver.
Translated by Catherine Knox. Plume, $10.95.
Griet Swart, a South African writer and editor of fairy tales, seeks a happy ending for her own life after she loses her baby and her husband. "It's hard to resist a novel with a heroine who is as good company as Griet is," Jacqueline Carey wrote in these pages in 1995.
 
THE PRAIRIE KEEPERS: Secrets of the Grasslands
By Marcy Houle. Addison-Wesley, $11.
When the author was a graduate student, she investigated the Zumwalt Prairie in northeastern Oregon, home both to ranchers and to remarkably large populations of hawks. Her exploration is "a lively record of the delicate ways humans alter seemingly untouched ground," the Book Review said last year. Birds of prey are also the subject of THE GOSHAWK, by T. H. White (Wilder Places/ Lyons & Burford, $14.95), restored to print after many years. The book chronicles the ambivalent relationship between White, author of "The Once and Future King," and the hawk he trained. Their battle of wills "gives the book its peculiar charm," H. M. Robinson wrote in The New York Times in 1952.
 
SEDUCTION THEORY
By Thomas Beller. Warner, $11.99.
Growing up male is the theme of these short stories, many of which feature the same hero, Alex Fader, who learns about women first from his mother, then from lovers. His portrait "is graced by elegant turns of phrase, a fresh way with metaphor and real insight," Eils Lotozo said in the Book Review last year.
 
MATRON OF HONOR
By Sallie Bingham. Zoland Books, $10.95.
Marriage is an escape leading to a trap for two very different sisters in the 1970's. The rebellious older one has already acknowledged her mistake; the younger, meeker one is about to commit hers. This novel is a "sensitive evocation of life in a troubled upper-class Southern family," Polly Morrice wrote here last year.
 
VANISHING ACT
By Thomas Perry. Ivy, $5.99.
Jane Whitefield is a Seneca Indian guide -- not for tourists, but for people who need to disappear. A kind of one-woman witness protection program, she takes on the troubling case of a former policeman. Thomas Perry "keeps pulling fresh ideas and original characters out of thin air," Marilyn Stasio wrote in these pages in 1995. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Drugstores;
The Rite Aid Chain Takes Manhattan, the Bronx . . .

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
WALK past the Rite Aid drugstore at 84th Street and Lexington Avenue, turn east on 86th Street, and there it is, another Rite Aid. Walk east one more block, Rite Aid again.
Look across the street from the Duane Reade drugstore at Third Avenue and 53d Street, and voila, a Rite Aid. Don't bother looking for the Pathmark drugstore that sat at 70th Street and Amsterdam for decades. It's a Rite Aid now. 
 Lately it feels as though one cannot walk more than a few blocks in Manhattan without running into a Rite Aid drugstore. No matter that a competitor is next door; if the spot looks good, Rite Aid grabs it. No matter that residents are loyal to a local pharmacy; Rite Aid buys the business, closes the store, and hires the pharmacist.
It is the same story in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. And, if the Federal Trade Commission is unsuccessful in its attempt to stop Rite Aid from buying Revco, a huge drug chain with many stores in Staten Island, Rite Aid could become ubiquitous there, too.
"We want to own New York City," said Gary B. Lowitt, Rite Aid's local director of real estate. "We want to be in the South Bronx and the Upper East Side, in the East Village as well as Brooklyn Heights."
Not everyone is sure that is such a great idea.
"Manhattan, with its traffic and high rents, is hostile to chain retailing, and an aggressive acquisition policy is always risky," said Gary Vineberg, a drug industry analyst with Merrill Lynch who has been recommending that investors sell the stock.
Martin Grass, Rite Aid's chairman, thinks otherwise. He figures Rite Aid's large stores -- its prototype is about 10,000 square feet -- cannot help but be profitable in New York.
"Most of New York's drugstores are 4,000 square feet tops," he said. "They are inefficient stores with small selections and little buying power, and we can easily compete."
For landlords, Rite Aid's new fascination with New York is excellent news. The huge Camp Hill, Pa.-based chain -- 2,759 stores, with nearly 500 more planned for this year -- has a solid credit rating, something that any landlord who lived through the recession has learned to value.
"We've had landlords ask specifically, 'Can you get them in my building?' " said William Ilaria, a retail services director at the Lansco brokerage.
"Owners want Rite Aid on the lease, even if they have to chip in to build the store," said Robert Futterman, a senior managing director at the Garrick-Aug brokerage.
Moreover, brokers say that while Rite Aid drives a hard bargain, it fights fair.
"They won't agree to high annual rent bumps, and they'll insist on lots of renewal options," said Michael N. Hirschfeld, who heads his own brokerage. "But they make deals quickly and they don't make the landlord take really hard hits on rent."
They are not nearly so gentle with competitors, though.
Cory Zelnik, CVS/Pharmacy's New York real estate representative, says CVS is "going full throttle in Queens," where it has eight stores, but Rite Aid's onslaught is making it rethink its strategy in Manhattan, where CVS has only two stores.
"It's tough to penetrate a market when another chain has so much share," he said.
Indeed, Rite Aid, barely a presence in this city a few years ago, now has 94 New York City stores, 26 of them in Manhattan. It has 46 more on the drawing boards, 6 slated for Manhattan, and Mr. Grass expects to "pick up a few more in the course of the year." Why? "When it comes to drugstore chains, New York is one of the most underserved cities there is," he said.
Actually, with Duane Reade, McKay drugs and other chains expanding, that seems less true than ever before. So why is Rite Aid pushing into New York now?
A lot has to do with the changes Mr. Grass has instituted since he took over the chairmanship from his father, Alex, in 1994. The senior Mr. Grass took Rite Aid into such disparate areas as dry cleaning, books and auto parts; his son has divested those businesses and can now pay full attention to the core drugstore operations.
He has given the managers of the pharmacies and of the sundries sections of the stores incentives to cooperate with each other. And he has spent millions on technology to streamline inventory procedures and prescription records. All have increased Rite Aid's per-store profits.
M EANWHILE, opportunities elsewhere have dwindled. Kmart, Wal-Mart and many other anchor tenants at malls now operate pharmacies, making it hard for a new drugstore to compete. And new mall construction is at a virtual standstill.
To Rite Aid, then, New York City is like the final frontier.
"Long Island is a great market, too, but it already has about 125 Genovese stores and close to 100 CVS's," Mr. Lowitt said. "New York City is wide open."
Duane Reade, with its more than 60 New York stores, might dispute that, but Rite Aid seems to view that ubiquitous chain as little more than an irritant.
"Their stores are cramped and badly stocked, their people are not helpful, and no one expects them to be around much longer," Mr. Lowitt said.
Barry Weston, Duane Reade's new chief executive, did not return several calls. Brokers say the chain, gasping under heavy debts from a leveraged buyout a few years ago, has been shopping itself around, but its huge debt load is a deal-breaker.
"Sure, we'd like to buy them, anyone with half a brain would, but the numbers just don't make sense," Mr. Lowitt said.
Mr. Lowitt does not brush CVS off quite so cavalierly. The two chains have gone head to head across the country, and there is no clear winner yet. "We've turned down sites in Westchester because they were across the street from CVS," Mr. Lowitt said. It was probably a wise decision: CVS and Rite Aid are on opposite corners at 24th Street and Eighth Avenue, and they seem to be battling to a draw. "We're both doing well, but neither one of us is doing very well," Mr. Lowitt said. (Mr. Zelnick of CVS insists his store is doing just fine.)
Nor is that Rite Aid's only problematic store. Last year Rite Aid bought 30 Pathmark drugstores, 24 of them in New York. It also purchased 20 supermarket sites from the Red Apple Group, which also owns Gristede's and Sloan's.
Rite Aid has had to acquire some dross with the gold. The 70th Street Pathmark, for example, is only about 3,000 square feet and sorely in need of renovation, not exactly the image Rite Aid wishes to project to the dense Lincoln Square market. Rite Aid does plan to move the store to bigger quarters, but cannot chance shutting it down in the interim, lest its pharmacy customers get used to going elsewhere.
The company also would not have chosen to open three Rite Aids so close by in the East 80's; one had been a Rite Aid for many years, one was a Pathmark that came with the package, and the third was a former Gristede's that Rite Aid did not want to chance a competitor grabbing.
Rite Aid's acquisition binge also brought it to towns outside New York City that kept the welcome mat firmly rolled up. Chappaqua, for example, already had three local pharmacies and a longstanding belief that any chain store would violate its small-town flavor, so town officials hated the idea of a drugstore opening in its former Gristede's.
"The town feared it would turn into a hangout for kids, and they worried that, if they let one chain in, how far behind could a McDonald's be?" said Richard Seligman, an Edward S. Gordon senior managing director who lives in Chappaqua.
Rite Aid opened last fall, anyway. Its store stays open much later than the two other pharmacies (Rite Aid hired the third store owner as its own pharmacist), it offers home delivery and Sunday hours, and it has put in what has become a very popular postal and parcel service counter.
"It's turned into a wonderful amenity for the town," Mr. Seligman said.
A N impending space crunch in New York City may yet force Rite Aid to look favorably at more such suburban towns. Rite Aid has yet to find suitable space on Fordham Road in the Bronx, or on main shopping streets in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Manhattan is filling up quickly, too.
"I'm not going aggressively after drugstore tenants because most of my buildings already have them," said Rob Nager, director of retail leasing at Colliers-ABR and the leasing agent for several office buildings.
But until the space is really gone, Rite Aid will probably continue leasing every good New York spot it can. After all, every spot it grabs is one that CVS cannot get. And the more stores any one chain has in an area, the easier it can justify its advertising costs.
Rite Aid insists that, while it does not discount the threat of eventual oversaturation of drug stores, that is of less concern in New York than anywhere else.
"Anyplace else you have to do demographic studies to see if the population can support a store," Mr. Lowitt said. "Here, we do demographic reports just for the fun of it. We know the people are there."

For West New York, a $650 Million Hudson Enclave

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK

 BODY:
EXCEPT for a golf driving range, West New York's nearly mile-long Hudson River waterfront remains the industrial wasteland left behind when shipping and rail operations there ceased more than 20 years ago. But that may soon change.
At a news conference last Wednesday Roseland Property Company of Roseland, which six months ago acquired the 150-acre site owned by Arthur E. Imperatore that comprises most of West New York's waterfront, unveiled a $650 million plan for a waterside enclave of 4,080 market-rate for-sale and rental units linked to this square-mile Hudson County town of 39,000 atop the Palisades. 
 Mr. Imperatore still owns 204 adjacent acres in Weehawken, the base for his ferry service to Manhattan.
The West New York project, for which Roseland was designated the redeveloper Wednesday night by the town, is to have an 80,000-square-foot retail complex as well as recreational and open space, including a public riverfront walkway required by state law.
Under the plan, which awaits approvals, the property will be developed over the next 10 years. Roseland will divide the site into parcels, building on some itself and selling others to developers. The proceeds of the property sales will help finance more than $10 million in infrastructure improvements such as roads and water and sewage connections, said Marshall B. Tycher, a Roseland principal.
He said three neighborhoods, with a total of 1,075 units, could be started by early next year. Roseland, in a joint venture with the Prudential Insurance Company of Newark, will build 275 apartments to rent for $1,300 to $2,000 a month.
A second neighborhood of 250 town houses priced in the high $100,000 to $200,000 range will be built by K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, the state's largest developer. And the Related Companies of Manhattan, known for its apartment buildings, will construct 550 rental apartments, for which rents have not yet been set. Both are under contract to buy parcels, contingent upon approvals.
"This site represents both a tremendous task and an opportunity," said Mr. Tycher. Its redevelopment, he added, comes at a time when the state's entire 18 miles of Hudson River shoreline "is resurrecting itself."
More than 1,500 mostly rental units are underway or planned on Jersey City's riverfront and Hoboken has a plan in place for the city-owned portion of its waterfront that calls for up to 2.3 million square feet of commercial, housing, open and recreational space.
By the year 2005 it is estimated that some 10,968 housing units, including those in West New York, and 17.3 million square feet of office space are to be built on the Hudson County riverfront, according to the ACI Group, a real estate services firm in Jersey City.
This summer work is to start on the first half of a 20.5 mile light-rail system that will run from Bayonne to Ridgefield. The first segment, Bayonne to Hoboken, is to be completed in 1999, the remainder by 2005.
This is sweet news for West New York, which missed out on the mid-80's building boom. Mayor Albio Sires said that he was eager to get his town, among the state's poorest and most densely populated, the tax revenue and jobs it badly needs.
Like others who grew up here, Mayor Sires, who emigrated with his family from Cuba 34 years ago, remembers the old waterfront and how he played on the tracks. He also recalls wondering then about the site's future and, later, watching grand development plans abandoned, including one to turn the riverfront of West New York and neighboring Weehawken into a Venice on the Hudson. So he made riverfront development a campaign promise that helped bring him into office 10 months ago.
"We are determined to rebuild the waterfront," Mr. Sires said. While skepticism persists, he added, many residents feel "a sound, well-planned project would be a shot in the arm."
Industry analysts say the team assembled for the project is aggressive and financially strong enough to get it done. The plan, they add, is also more realistic than earlier proposals.
"It is another signal that the grandiose plans of the last decade will not be realized," said James W. Hughes dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.
S INCE 1980 the West New York land and the adjacent property in Weehawken had been owned by Mr. Imperatore, whose Port Imperial vision of a Venetian-style city was never realized. Also unrealized was his plan for 5,800 units on the West New York site. Though he received approval for some 2,500 units after years of debate over height and density issues, the project was defeated by the recession and financial problems that led to the threat of foreclosure. Only the golf driving range was built -- to generate cash, not as part of the project -- before Roseland bought the site.
The deal lifted the threat of foreclosure against Mr. Imperatore by the Crossland Federal Saving Bank, which held a $50 million loan on the West New York site as well as 62 acres in Weehawken. Roseland paid in the low $20 million range for the loan, said Mr. Tycher.
Mr. Imperatore retains the Weehawken land, which adjoins the 142 other acres he owns there where he runs a marina, restaurant and ferry service. The ferry service, which is to be improved, is considered a criticial amenity for the waterfront.
New York Waterway, the Imperatore ferry company, recently received $6.1 million in Federal loan guarantees for a new ferry and to refinance four existing ones, freeing up capital to expand services. It also got a $1 million loan to begin work on a new terminal, to be completed in three years, that will be linked to the light rail line.
Now, said Mayor Sires, "a window of opportunity exists" to develop West New York's riverfront. Still, the details of the plan must be hammered out and its impact must be analyzed, he said.
Some important first steps have been taken. For one, the town agreed to slash in half the property's $50 million assessment, ending a tax appeal by Roseland that was originally filed by Mr. Imperatore. West New York also put an ordinance in place exempting any new rental construction from rent control. Both were crucial in moving the plan forward, said Mr. Tycher of Roseland.
In addition, the town adopted a riverfront redevelopment plan this month "giving it more control over the development process," said David Spatz, West New York's planning consultant.
Though the site's zoning allows 5,800 units, Mayor Sires said the 4,080 proposed by Roseland "is more manageable." The zoning also requires that the heights of buildings to be at least 10 feet below the top of the Palisades, and that 30 percent of the land be kept as recreational or open space.
Such requirements, along with the walkway, Mr. Sires said, will help join the new waterfront to the rest of the town, a concern for West New York where the cliffs separate it from the river. And discussions are under way with Roseland to carve a public pathway from the cliffs to the waterfront below, he added.
Public access is also key to the Hudson River Waterfront Conservancy, a nonprofit riverwalk watchdog group. "To work, the walkway must be designed so public and private interests don't clash and the housing is not a gated compound cut off from the town," said Leah Healy, a board member, referring to riverfront projects that went up in the last decade.
The current waterfront plan may face opposition. But Mr. Spatz said the upside of the years of debate over the earlier plan is that the public's input has been included.
Mr. Tycher said the plan, designed by the Martin Organization of Phildelphia, meets the zoning and is "sensitive to the environment." By reducing the density by 30 percent and including more low- and mid-rise buildings, he said, the height and density issues have also been addressed.
Mayor Sires said he is optimistic that when all the reviews are done West New York will have a plan that works. "For the waterfront is where the town's future lies," he said.

HEADLINE: Another Harvest: One Farm, One Life

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: MAHWAH

 BODY:
"SHE'S coming back?" said Brian Goode, executive sous-chef of Union Square Cafe in Manhattan. "That's good news for us. Last year she was saying: 'This is it. I'm selling the farm. I'm retiring.' "
This weekend, if all goes well, Alvina Frey will pull out of Chad's Farm here before dawn, drive through the Lincoln Tunnel to her spot across from Nobody Beats the Wiz at Union Square and unpack her first load of the year: geraniums, delphiniums, basil, small boxes of Kentucky bluegrass. There she and her sister, Elsie Wickenheisser, will hail customers new and old, distribute biscuits to their dogs (many by name) and sell their wares. It's greenmarket season again. From now until October, every Wednesday and Saturday, Mrs. Frey will bring her fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers to the people in the city. 
 The city people, including chefs like Mr. Goode, will crowd her booth. They will run their fingers through her trays of yellow and fava and lima beans. They will squeeze the tomatoes and pinch the gooseberries and stick their fingernails into the baby zucchini skin. They will paw the French beans one by one, measuring them, before selecting six. And, as the summer progresses, some will exchange names with Mrs. Frey, confiding their problems while they buy her beans. By the end of each market day, every bean and berry in the bushel baskets will be gone, as thoroughly as if set upon by locusts.
Alvina Frey is 65. She has been farming in Bergen County since she was 5. She has farmed seriously, for a living, since she graduated from high school. She farms the land her parents, and their parents, farmed before her. Long ago, she was one of many farmers in Mahwah and Bergen County. Now she is one of the last.
Most people would find that growing vegetables the way she does, vegetables that several Manhattan chefs call exquisite, is simply too much work for too little money. Those who would be willing to live the life of a small farmer -- and certainly there are some who would gladly trade an office job for the all-encompassing labor and beauty of farming -- can't afford the land.
New Jersey farmland is worth a fraction of open property with development rights. The only way to own a small farm is to inherit it, the privilege of very few. The average age of New Jersey farmers is 54, and increasing at each count.
In addition to houses, highways and supermarkets, New Jersey residents have long been emphatic about wanting farms, woods and open spaces.
They overwhelmingly approve referendums for farmland preservation and "green acres" -- public money for open spaces. But economics is rapidly, inexorably pushing most of New Jersey's open land into development.
Across the road from Alvina Frey's 20-acre farm is a development called Paddington Square, consisting of hundreds of identical cream-colored town houses with garages and driveways. Down the way is Route 17 with its malls, car dealers, diners and fast-food restaurants. Look out from Chad's Farm and you can practically see the condos, service stations and golden arches moving closer.
For several summers, Mrs. Frey has talked of quitting, of selling the land and retiring. This time, she may do it. This week she let a real estate agent sink a "for sale" sign in front of her farm.
She's definitely ambivalent, testing the idea. "I don't want it to be sold," she said. "I want it to go when I want to go." But if she gets a high enough offer, she'll sell. And as for what she'll do afterward? She is quiet for a moment. Then she gives a reply of sorts: "Once the farm is gone, that's it."
AROUND the turn of the century, Alvina Frey's grandparents, who immigrated from Germany, bought 150 acres of farmland. Her father fixed looms for extra cash, but the family's heart was in the farm, where they grew vegetables and had apple, cherry, peach and pear trees.
"My grandmother worked until she was almost 91," Mrs. Frey said. "Outside! In strawberries!"
Her father eventually took over the farm, selling tomatoes, corn, cauliflower, and raspberries wholesale at the Paterson market. Alvina, the eldest child, "was the designated farmer," said Mrs. Wickenheisser, the youngest, who as a child was so unenthusiastic about farming that she'd weed with her toes. "My brother I guess wasn't too crazy about it either," she said.
As a girl, Mrs. Frey never had the luxury of determining how enthusiastic she was about farming. Growing up, her days consisted of farming and school, farming and Friday night piano lessons, farming and farming.
"I never went to the church picnic," she said. "I never had too many friends. Father didn't give us a life after farming."
A skilled classical pianist, Alvina found a job after high school graduation playing music at a restaurant. Her father balked -- he needed her on the farm. From that, her life's course emerged. "When I found out this is what I had to do, this is what I did," she said. She and her husband, Anthony Chadorowski, named the property Chad's Farm.
They grew fruits and vegetables, selling them at the Paterson market and at the farm's roadside stand. Year after year they got by. But as taxes and other expenses rose, and the Paterson market and road stand became more unprofitable, getting by got harder. They sold one piece of land, and then another, to pay taxes.
Mrs. Frey's farm would have been single-family houses years ago, if not for two unrelated occurrences.
The first was farmland assessment, which New Jersey established in 1964. It is a program that lowers the taxes of working farms by as much as 80 percent over developed property.
The other was New York City's Greenmarket. Mrs. Frey's second husband, Ed Frey -- whom she married after Mr. Chadorowski died of a heart attack -- heard about Greenmarket in 1976, at its inception. He was buying potatoes in upstate New York when another farmer told him about it: city people, it seemed, were thronging to the new 59th Street market and paying high retail prices.
"I don't care what you brought down, they bought it," Mrs. Frey said. "From that market each person found their own niche, what they should grow."
For Mrs. Frey, it was beans -- all varieties of beans. "I kind of like beans," she said, in a profound understatement. And she'd tried some of the other farmers' beans. "Like eating wood. They had a string on them. I knew I could do better."
Five years ago when Mr. Frey died, Alvina Frey went on alone. By then, she had sold about 120 acres of Chad's Farm. But the 20 remaining acres were enough. These acres she plowed, sowed, watered, weeded, harvested. April to October, twice a week, she trucked her produce into the city to sell. With her beans, heirloom eggplant, silver corn, she enriches the lives of both city dwellers and her own, by her friendships with them, urban people whose daily lives diverge radically from her own in Mahwah.
OVER the past 20 years at the Union Square Greenmarket, Alvina Frey has met many people of the city. To her stand have come the famous or nearly so: Sigourney Weaver; Claudia Schiffer; Geoffrey Beene; Claus von Bulow, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cicely Tyson; the man who does Ivana Trump's hair; the maid on "As the World Turns," and "what's her name, Woody's girlfriend." Mrs. Wickenheisser wanted to take pictures, but Ms. Frey stopped her. "That's a no-no," Mrs. Frey said. "They come with their anonymity. They want to be left alone to shop."
She has had at her stand "bums, panhandlers." And "older gay men and gay couples -- I hate to say how many I've lost. AIDS."
And there is the usual crew of urban eccentrics, like the man with the "itty-bitty mustache who only buys eight beans, one cucumber, three little zucchini," and the man "who goes through all the trays of yellow beans, every one, and says, 'I have to be certain.' " Some customers bring her fancy French pastries; others drop by to say hello even if they're not shopping.
She yells at people who manhandle the tomatoes or break the beans. She once shook a broom at a homeless man who refused to let her set up. When people complain that her beans are $1.40 a pound, while the ones down the way are $1, she snaps, "You want dollar beans, go buy dollar beans." But when somebody confides he's out of work, Mrs. Frey stuffs an extra handful of beans into the bag. She has visited her regular customers in the hospital. She has attended their dance concerts.
Mostly, she knows faces, not names. Before she knows the humans, she knows their dogs. She recognizes the owner of Flora-Dora, "a fancy poodle," because the mistress resembles her pet.
"It's very interesting, the city," Mrs. Frey said.
Many shoppers might recognize a truly fresh vegetable. But it's the professionals, the chefs, who understand the degrees of freshness and superiority, and who appreciate and honor the labor involved in growing, say, crisp, needle-thin French beans. It is they who grasp for words to convey the essence of a Frey bean.
"Her limas are sort of unique," said Mr. Goode of Union Square Cafe. "Her tiny French beans are really, really good -- the best. She does only a limited amount. They're consistent, beautiful to look at. They look like they're alive, like they just got picked out of the earth."
Peter Hoffman, owner and chef of the Savoy restaurant in SoHo, calls her beans "fabulous."
"She's extremely meticulous about proper beans -- what's overgrown and not acceptable," he said. "She goes picking through the vines over and over again. She wants a baby zucchini 3 1/2 to 4 inches. No monsters. They're tender, delicious. Her lima beans, very few people in Greenmarket grow -- they're thorny things, a labor of love.
"She grows things nobody else wants to grow because they're a pain," he said. "Black currants. Gooseberries. She showed me her arms, all scratched and scabbed from picking, and said: 'I've had it. I'm not picking any more gooseberries.' The next week she shows up with another couple bushels and says, 'They just looked good; I thought people would want them.' Her eggplant is an heirloom. Her husband got it from some guy in South Jersey 20 years ago. It's white eggplant -- incredible flavor, no bitterness.
"It's like she aspires to some Platonic ideal of what is right," he said. "Like she wants to do justice by the plants and her customers."
EARLY mornings, across the street at Paddington Square, car after car pulls out, heading for offices. School buses collect children. It's the usual daily routine of suburbia.
But shoulder-to-shoulder as she is with the suburbs, Mrs. Frey follows much older rural rhythms, the rhythms of the farm.
The work varies according to the season. Summer -- sowing, weeding, picking. Fall -- harvest, cleaning, stowing equipment. Winter -- planning, and maybe selling Christmas trees and fruitcakes. Spring -- plowing and sowing.
Mrs. Frey no longer does her own plowing. But she drives one of her three tractors -- one is 25 years old, the others 50 -- to disk the fields, making them "nice and smooth, cutting them all up." She drives another to mark the rows to be planted. She sows some seeds by tractor but most -- including corn and beans -- she sows by hand. She grows flowers with cuttings, but vegetables from seeds always. Her father once planted what he thought were beefsteak tomato cuttings and got plum tomatoes.
"We learned a lesson," she said. "Never trust it if you don't grow it yourself."
She drives the third tractor to cultivate and fertilize.
April to May, she said, "I go gung-ho." She plants beans every two weeks through August. Beans take 50 days to mature, except limas, which take 80. One bean plant will yield three or four batches. It is a point of pride that she picks her beans every other day, except the French beans, which she picks every day. Lesser farmers would pick a few times a week, which would result in bigger, woodier beans.
Her flowers, including the 1,200 blossom-covered "short and squatty" geraniums, are a profitable sideline. She grows them in her three plastic-covered greenhouses. When the plastic tears, she climbs a ladder and stuffs the hole with rags.
Her methods of farming are similarly low-tech. She exhibits a sense of propriety in the fruits, vegetables and flowers she grows. Her opinions on them are definite and unwavering.
She hates fancy-colored bell peppers. She thinks the Blue Lake beans everybody thinks are so wonderful are anything but. She knows people loved her pimentos and cried when she cut them off, but too bad -- they were too much work. She knows the Chad's Farm soil is bad for potatoes and onions. As for carrots, her grandmother tried them long ago; they tasted like soap.
They are the opinions of one who knows farming, every detail.
Along with her dislikes, Mrs. Frey reserves the right to complain. "One thing I know is this year I won't make any money. I know I won't make money. I know."
She has also, lately, reserved the right to have fun, doing things far removed from farming. She's gone on cruises to Mexico. She's tried para-sailing, which involved running along the beach, strapped to a parachute, until a boat lifted her and she flew over the water. She's in the altar guild at Christ Lutheran Church, caring for the linens and wine, and has taken flying lessons.
Chad's Farm should go for at least $1 million, said Frank Pelz, her brother, who takes care of the accounting. "She's 65 and she's got to consider slowing down," he said. "She gets nervous farming, nervous that she can't get the work done. It would be the end of an era. I'm sure she hates to see it. I hate to see it, too. Because when it's over, it'll be done, disappear, up in this area with all the building going on."
Mrs. Frey refuses to be sentimental. "I don't want to change my life style, not until I can't do it," she said. "But I can't do anything about it. Progress is progress, as my grandmother used to say."
Others, however, will supply the sentiment she's not expressing, and then some.
"I don't like to think of Alvina retiring," said Joel Patraker, a Greenmarket manager who, whenever he can spare the time Saturday mornings, calms himself by pitching in at her stand and weighing beans. "It makes me heartsick. Let's be honest. Alvina could retire if she sold that land; then she wouldn't have to do all that work. I know she complains. But I think she loves it."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
FUNDS WATCH

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:

Advisers Play Bigger Roles
Individuals are ceding more control of their fund investments to independent financial advisers. 
 The amount of mutual fund assets controlled by advisers has increased sixfold since 1992, to $45 billion at the end of last year, according to a report by Lipper Analytical Services, the fund tracking firm in Summit, N.J., and Cerulli Associates, a financial services consulting firm in Boston. That amounts to about 2 percent of the more than $2 trillion in all stock and bond funds.
These gains are particularly significant because growth in funds in general has slowed outside the retirement market, according to the report, which projected that advisers would oversee $180 billion by the turn of the century.
The report was based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, data from industry groups and interviews with more than 500 of the estimated 12,000 investment advisory firms.
What services do advisers provide? Often they justify their fees, which tend to be about 1 percent a year of the assets they manage, by ferreting out high-performing funds with a low profile. They also screen out funds that stray from their stated styles and approaches.
Financial advisers keep a sharp eye on fund expenses, and roughly 20 percent of them said they would not offer funds that carried an annual 12b-1 marketing fee. The Cerulli-Lipper study also found that their loyalty to fund groups was continuing to erode because tracking the performance of individual fund managers had become simpler and less expensive.
But returns are not the only consideration. Financial advisers are increasingly concerned about how managers are investing their money. Advisers with at least $50 million under management typically examine how big a stake a manager has in his own fund, the quality of analysis at the fund company and the number of administrative distractions.
 
When Is 3% Not Really 3%?
Do investors in a fund with a 3 percent sales charge pay only 3 percent? Not really, writes a reader in Arlington, Va. The way he sees it, the load should be figured on the net investment, not on the gross amount of the check.
Say you buy $10,000 worth of shares in a fund with an upfront sales charge -- a "load" in industry parlance -- of 5 percent. Under the usual calculation, your sales charge is considered to be $500. But that's more than 5 percent of the $9,500 that will be invested in fund shares. Looked at that way, the sales charge would be 5.3 percent ($500 divided by $9,500).
The Securities and Exchange Commission says both methods are valid. The gross method is used consistently throughout the industry, making comparisons meaningful, and it has the advantage of simplicity. Other industries use it, too; real estate commissions on property sales, for example, are calculated in this way.
The S.E.C. requires both calculations, the gross and the net percentage, in fund prospectuses for funds whose sales charges have "break points," or investment levels at which commissions are reduced.
Another reader, in Ohio, professes to be confused about sales charges in general. Often, the charge is described as the payment for the services of a broker or financial planner, she says. But she buys her funds -- with or without loads -- without any help, so why do some levy sales charges and some not?
Back when the mutual fund industry was small and simple, funds were sold with a sales charge -- usually 5 percent to 8 percent of the amount invested -- that represented a payment to a financial intermediary. Others were sold directly to consumers, without a charge. Now the line between loads and no-loads has become blurred, especially by "low-load" funds, those with sales charges of up to 3 percent.
Low-load funds are usually sold directly to investors by fund companies that also sell no-load funds. Fidelity Investments, the country's largest fund company, is one example. At such companies, the sales charge generally is used to cover the firm's marketing expenses, like customer service and toll-free telephone numbers.
 
Cautionary Tone From Vanguard
Henry Kaufman, an economist and money manager, is said to have joked that his colleagues had predicted 10 of the last 3 recessions. John C. Bogle of the Vanguard Group is starting to sound a bit like them.
Mr. Bogle, Vanguard's chairman, warned investors about a year ago that good times in the stock market wouldn't last forever. Though the good times have kept rolling so far, he is reinforcing that message.
His cautionary note is part of the 1995 annual report for the Vanguard Index Trust 500 and is being sent separately to prospective investors in the fund. About 80,000 shareholders received the letter in mid-April.
Extraordinary performance and huge cash inflows prompted the additional warning. The letter notes that the Index Trust 500 gained 37.4 percent last year, outpacing 85 percent of actively managed mutual funds. It would not be realistic to expect such returns more than once a decade, Mr. Bogle warned.
The secret of the fund's success has been the surge in the large-capitalization stocks in the index it tracks, the Standard & Poor's 500. When small-capitalization stocks become market leaders, the fund will probably underperform the average equity fund, which tends to own smaller stocks, on average, than those in the S.& P. 500.
 
New Managers
Peter Anderson, senior vice president for investments at IDS Mutual Funds, leads the group that took over IDS Managed Retirement from Richard Lazarchic, who picked up IDS Global Growth from Edward Korff. Mr. Korff left the firm.
Ben Hock, formerly an equity analyst, took the reins of the John Hancock Growth and Income fund from Brian Grove and B. J. Willingham, who left the firm. Bernice Behar, leader of the management team in charge of the John Hancock Growth, Discovery and Global Marketplace funds, picks up Emerging Growth from Edgar Larsen, who also left the firm.
 
Wired for Data
Thornburg Funds has an Internet site (http://www.thornburg.com) to let investors retrieve investment guides, prospectuses and data on specific funds without having to provide personal information.
T. Rowe Price Associates has begun offering mutual funds and investment information on America Online (keyword: T. Rowe Price). On the site are prospectuses, daily fund prices, performance information, market updates and more.
 
In Brief
Scudder Global Small Company has been renamed Scudder Discovery. It also said the median market capitalization of the stocks in its portfolio would be $750 million .
Fidelity Investments has teamed up with the United States Chamber of Commerce to offer retirement plans designed for member companies with fewer than 100 workers.
Templeton Global Utilities has been merged into Franklin Global Utilities, and a 1 percent redemption fee will apply to old Templeton shareholders for six months after the merger, effective March 29.
Oppenheimer Enterprise has closed to new investors, but shareholders in accounts opened before April 1 can continue to contribute up to $5,000 a month.
 In addition, T. Rowe Price Investment Services is making available free educational brochures, covering stocks, bonds, options and margin and short selling (800 225-5132).

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Jim Gainey's Step Up

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
JAMES GAINEY will talk your ear off, and the point is he knows a thing or two. He has sat in the cab of an 18-wheeler on a rainy night thinking mainly about a cup of coffee 50 miles down the road, but also musing about why black people have had to put up with so much in this 220-year-old country. He has been in homeless shelters so bad he suspects prisons must be better. He has learned enough to reduce the lessons of a hard life to aphorisms, ones that rattle around in your mind for awhile.
"You got to be a poor rat to have only one hole," he said. "A good rat, he got at least two holes." 
 So it is that at 5 each morning the 40ish Mr. Gainey wakes up in a Bowery flophouse, says his prayers, drinks a glass of water, maybe takes a shower and does some push-ups. He then walks across town to the Carmine Street Recreation Center to put on a crisp khaki security guard's uniform and get down to business, the daily task of building a new life.
Opportunity has not been a regular knocker at Mr. Gainey's door, but he is now scrambling to create opportunities for himself, which, he will gladly tell you, are better than none. His vehicle is a City Parks Department program for the most motivated of welfare workers, a program involving training and the promise of a shot at a job.
And the plain fact is that as a single person on welfare, he has no choice but to work for the city for 22 hours a week. "If you don't show up, you're on the street," he said. "And it's scary to be out on the street."
So here's the deal: As a participant in the Park Career Training Program, or Pact -- to which he was recommended for his eagerness to collect garbage -- he gets the chance to work half again as much as other welfare workers, 35 hours a week at his security guard job. The pay is no more than if he worked the shorter period: a total of $352 a month in home relief, plus $112 in food stamps and Medicaid.
But he also gets job training, coaching on how to write resumes and interview for jobs and information about job openings.
"All I've ever known is struggle," Mr. Gainey said. But that does not mean he cannot hope, and he now feels somebody just might care about his future. "I have no doubt in my mind that this is going to work," he said.
It is already working for the city. The workfare army of 19,000 people, sweeping streets, cleaning parks and scrubbing government buildings, has taken the edge off municipal layoffs. Some 90 percent of city parks are now considered clean, the Parks Department says, up from 76 percent a year earlier, an improvement officials credit mainly to the welfare workers.
And the 500 who volunteered and were then selected for Pact fill a particularly acute need, specialized labor. Half the 4,000 workers in the Parks Department have left since 1990 through layoffs and attrition, and the raw recruits of welfare contribute mainly by doing basic maintenance. Welfare's elite in the Pact program do everything from horticulture to computer chores.
Mr. Gainey works as a security guard at the rec center in Greenwich Village. His journey began in South Carolina. As he tells it, his family came north when he was very young and settled in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The boy played in fire hydrants on summer days. He remembers hitching rides by holding on for dear life to the back of a bus. He remembers the Myrtle Street elevated.
His dad, an auto mechanic, moved the family to New Jersey where work was more plentiful. Near the end of his senior year at Irvington Technical High School, the family needed money, so he quit school to get a job pumping gas. He wanted to make sure his two younger sisters finished high school -- they did. He could always go back.
OF course, he never did. There were four years in the Army. There were jobs as a mechanic, as a welder, as a driver of big trucks. There was somehow never time to start a family. The lack of a diploma hurt more and more in hiring halls. "I'd be walking out and everyone else was still sitting there," he said. "That makes you feel bad, I mean bad."
The longer out of high school, the tougher the high school equivalency classes he would periodically take. Then six years ago came the blow that sent him on his downward spiral. He got a series of traffic tickets and lost his commercial driver's license. The recession was deepening, and jobs were scarce. Unemployment ran out, he went on welfare and found himself bouncing between some of the city's ugliest shelters. He said he never took solace in alcohol or drugs. Miraculously, he found his way to the shelter run by Volunteers of America on Ward's Island, and finally glimpsed daylight.
A counselor there guided him to a G.E.D. course, where he finished high school, and then to a nurse's assistant course. He was sure he was on his way after he was accepted by New York City Technical College to study to be a registered nurse.
His plans then collapsed. First, he could not find a job as a nurse's assistant: Welfare mothers were getting first shot at home care and city hospitals were not hiring. His college plans were squashed when the city ordered him to go to work if he wanted to keep getting his welfare check.
So he found himself in a park holding a broom. He immediately volunteered for the most disgusting job, working on a garbage truck. His supervisor was Harold Vanderbeck and nobody had ever asked to work on the truck before. And Mr. Gainey worked hard. So Mr. Vanderbeck recommended him for Pact. "He's the type of person who deserves a real shot," Mr. Vanderbeck said.
Mr. Gainey volunteered to be a security guard, sensing a kind of security in wearing a uniform as he did years ago in the Army. His approach is one of meticulous detail. He checks the temperature of the pool just in case people ask on the way in; he makes sure the computer room stays locked until the teacher comes in. And sometimes he takes broader responsibility, as when he visited the nearby police station to ask if a beat cop could include the recreation center on the rounds. One now comes regularly.
Is a life being put back together? Mr. Gainey regained his commercial driver's license and has gotten state certification as a security guard through the Pact program. He has begun to go on job interviews. He has somebody to give him a recommendation. On his own, he has learned to type and has managed to keep up his $150 annual malpractice insurance should he ever find employment as a nurse's assistant.
"I got choices now," said a man who believes one rat hole is never enough.

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
Throwing Some Cold Water on Lottery Fever

BYLINE: By BRETT BRUNE 

 BODY:
TALES of desperation involving people addicted to gambling are nothing new; stories of broken homes and beleaguered bank accounts have inspired more than one movie maker. But now state-run lotteries are feeling the heat. With their new Quick Draw keno games in bars and delis, the states are turning ordinary people who never get near a casino into the addicted, Money magazine says in its May issue.
Lotteries, often chastised as preying on the poor, don't take a spare dollar a week just from those who can least spare it. They also take money from young professionals who might do better by putting it in their 401(k) plans or elsewhere. 
 "I know I'm probably going to lose," a 29-year-old electrical engineer says of his attraction to Quick Draw, "but I keep playing because I might just get lucky."
And the human cost is not the only downside to the lottery business, Money reports. It contends that even the taxpayers who do not play the games are being duped. That is because the game playing may amount to just that when it comes to state budgets.
Money says its six-month investigation shows that "the lotteries have neither lowered taxes" for residents of the states that offer them, "nor boosted funding for education, as their champions have often promised."
Lotteries are not an efficient way to raise public money, the magazine concludes. It says that states keep just 34.4 percent of the proceeds, on average.
Money lists New Jersey and New York as the most efficient states (each keeping 41.1 percent of the revenue) and Idaho as the least efficient (21.1 percent).
Which states directed the most lottery money to education in 1994? Idaho and Kansas, at 66 percent each. And the least? Massachusetts and New Hampshire, at 20.6 percent each.
Gary Landry, a spokesman for the Florida Education Association, calls the lottery "a big shell game." He says Florida's lottery money goes into the general budget, where its use is difficult to track. As rising school enrollments put new demands on schools, "the state has simply replaced general revenues with lottery money," he says.
 
SCROOGE EXTRAORDINAIRE Most everyone knows a modern-day Scrooge, a model of emotional bankruptcy. But it is hard to believe that any have an edge on J. Orville Wood, profiled in the May issue of Worth magazine.
When Mr. Wood died in 1985 at the age of 102, fewer than a dozen people attended his funeral. Even his two children were absent. Little wonder: The child who speaks openly for the magazine article, Roger, recounts how his father, who died with $1.1 million in investments, had instructed him to use only two squares of toilet paper during each trip to the toilet, forced him to wash in his sister's bath water and refused to contribute any money toward his college education.
The article, titled "The Master Passion," is more about a son's painful quest to understand his father than it is about the miser himself. Its worthwhile message: Children of misers can develop healthy relationships with other people, as well as with money.
J. Orville Wood left the bulk of his money to the University of Pittsburgh, for which he had expressed no real affection. (He left his third and last wife, Ruth, just $20,000 a year, to be forfeited if she remarried. He left Roger $2,000 a year, to begin after Ruth's death.)
His second wife and Roger's mother, Helen, once gave the miser a copy of "A Christmas Carol," hoping that he would change his ways. In return, she got a divorce.
To find some peace of mind, Roger has visited his father's haunts and spoken to his stepmother about the ordeal.
Roger, now 75, seems to have conquered the past. He sees his three children nearly every week and leads what appears to be a contented life with his wife, Phyllis. He says he has to fight certain stingy instincts, but when his first grandchild was born a few months ago, he took the opportunity to leave a legacy much different from his father's. He wrote a check for $5,000 for the child's education fund.
 
BABIES AND BILLS Listing all the expenses of having a child can be as difficult as counting the number of times a parent says no to a 2-year-old. But two of the larger possible costs -- conceiving a baby when you have a fertility problem and finding child care -- are addressed in separate articles in the May issue of Kiplinger's.
"The Agonizing Price of Infertility" lays out the problems and solutions for those who want a child no matter the price. Kiplinger's reminds readers that it is common for infertile couples "to spend $30,000 or more in their quest for a child."
One woman describes how she worked the system rather than letting it work her. When her doctor would not refer her to an infertility specialist -- called a reproductive endocrinologist -- she called the specialist's office, asked which doctors in her health maintenance organization had made referrals and then switched to one of those doctors. When her insurance coverage for the fertility procedure ran out, she switched to another health plan offered by her employer to obtain coverage for additional attempts. Although she did not conceive, she saved a great deal of money and is now planning to adopt.
The magazine says other useful tools are medical spending accounts that allow employees to pay their expenses with pretax dollars, prescriptions that can be filled for far less cost in Mexico or other countries, and partial-refund plans from fertility clinics for failed efforts.
For general information, Kiplinger's recommends an infertility support group called Resolve (617 623-0744) and the International Council on Infertility Information Dissemination, which can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.inciid.org/.
Finally, with babe in arms, parents may need to look for child care -- in some cases so they can return to work to pay those bills for infertility treatments.
In "Finding the Right Caregiver," Kiplinger's says time-pressed parents can hire a private investigator to check relevant public records. Though it may sound extravagant, it can be done for less than $100 and can save many headaches, the magazine says.
Graham/Sheehan Security Services of Brighton, Mass., for example, takes cases across the country and charges $70 for a standard package, "which includes a criminal-records check, credit check, verification of education and professional licenses, a check of all previous employers, driving history and a review of worker's comp claims."
The agency can be reached at (617) 787-2262.
 
QUICK MONEY So you're committed to buying your first home in three years. Now all you have to do is decide how to invest.
 In its May issue, Smart Money offers a rational guide for readers with specific short-term goals, like a house purchase or a luxurious vacation. The article, titled "The Best Short-Term Investments," suggests a mix of Treasury strips that represent the principal-only portion of a bond; fixed-income securities of varying maturities; prime-rate funds backed by bank loans, and mutual funds known to be stable and dependable.
 With a quick worksheet to help readers determine their risk tolerance, the article reassures that there are safe ways to invest for the short term besides certificates of deposit, with their relatively low rates of return.
A second worksheet shows how much a reader needs to save to meet his goal. For something as complex as a home purchase, however, the worksheet comes up a bit short: It shows the probable impact of inflation and your investment choices, but it doesn't take into account the potential for wild swings in the real estate market.
 For the mutual funds portion of the investment mix, Smart Money tries to reduce anxiety about risk by recommending 10 stock and bond funds and, for investors in high tax brackets, eight tax-exempt bond funds.
 Topping the former category is Lindner Dividend, with an average three-year return since inception of 64.8 percent. Its worst performance for any three-year period is a 24 percent gain. On top of the list of tax-exempt funds is Invesco Tax-Free Long-Term with a 37.2 percent average return for three years. Its worst three years: 14.2 percent.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Club's Textbook Case In Playing the Market

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
MOST college seniors take along resumes when they go to job interviews, but Charles Phippen also likes to show potential employers an investment portfolio worth $126,000.
Actually, the portfolio belongs to the student investment club managed by Mr. Phippen and a few dozen classmates at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. Like a Generation Y version of the Beardstown Ladies, that now-famous Illinois club of small-town, salt-of-the-earth investors, the Lafayette students use their investment skills to buy and sell stocks and bonds for a common fund. 
 Their skills are not inconsiderable. The students can easily offer tips on how to determine a stock's price-to-book value, or how to place a stop-loss order. Any skeptic need only consult the bottom line: The club's fund grew from $103,000 on March 31, 1995, to $126,000 a year later -- a gain of 22 percent. Not bad for neophytes: while the performance was obviously aided by a bull market in stocks, the portfolio still has about a quarter of its assets in bonds and cash.
How did the students do it? Here is an example from Zdenek Hezky, a junior from Ontario studying business and economics. In January, he sat down at his PC and analyzed the average percentage of profits that computer companies were reinvesting in their businesses. The percentage, called a plow-back ratio, was large, and that set Mr. Hezky thinking.
"I just knew that with a plow-back ratio that high, you had an industry that had the potential for more growth," he said. Add the fact that technology stocks were then declining, and he urged members to expand the club's holdings in computer companies.
The club did so, and the move has paid off handsomely. In February, it bought 100 shares in America Online at $45.375 and 200 shares of Dell Computer at $28. At Friday's close, America Online was at $59.50 and Dell, at $41.25.
Campus investment clubs have been around for decades, but they have grown increasingly popular during the market-happy 1990's. There are now at least three dozen clubs, at schools as varied as Bryn Mawr, Brigham Young, U.C.L.A. and the California Institute of Technology, according to Edward C. Lawrence, a professor at the University of Missouri in St. Louis who tracks the organizations. The club at Ohio State University has the biggest fund, about $10 million, Professor Lawrence said.
The clubs are usually financed by alumni or faculty contributions, and about half the clubs are managed by students who are working on master's degrees in business administration. But the Lafayette fund is run by undergraduates who are majoring in a variety of disciplines, and freshmen are included, too. Meetings are usually held once a month; 30 to 50 students typically attend.
"Our club is inclusive and we like to focus on students who may know less about the market," said Donald R. Chambers, a professor of finance at Lafayette and the club's faculty adviser.
The Lafayette fund, which is held in the college's name, is now invested about 75 percent in stocks, 20 percent in bonds and 5 percent in cash. Besides America Online and Dell, its 19 stocks include blue chips like Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical and Ford Motor, and more recent plays like Genentech and LSI Logic. The fund is well diversified; its largest holding, 150 shares of Caterpillar, accounts for less than 9 percent of assets. The club also has shares in the Emerging Tigers Fund, a closed-end mutual fund that focuses on developing markets.
These investments produce about $3,000 a year in tax-free dividends and other income. The students use half that money for club expenses -- to bring prominent speakers to campus, to finance an annual day trip to Wall Street or to provide the pizza for club meetings. The other half is donated to Lafayette. Last year, the money helped buy library books, while part of this year's contribution has enabled prospective students from minority groups to visit the campus.
The club is a long-established feature on campus -- so ingrained that no one is sure how it started. School legend says the fund began around World War II, with a $3,000 contribution possibly made by soldiers bound for war. That theory would explain an early name for the club: the Veterans Investment Research Foundation.
BUT the fund's performance is no mystery and is even more laudable given the wide berth under which most such clubs operate.
"To my knowledge," Professor Lawrence said, "none of the faculty advisers who are involved with funds have overridden an investment decision -- even when they know that a decision isn't in the fund's best interests."
On Monday, Mr. Phippen, the president of the fund, and 13 other club members made the annual trip to Wall Street. After visiting Alan R. Griffith, the vice chairman of the Bank of New York and a Lafayette alumnus, they toured the New York Stock Exchange.
Later, the students, many in blue blazers and khaki pants, laughed and joked their way down the narrow streets around the exchange. They sounded like any other college group on an outing, but ask these investors about their holdings and the talk can turn board-room serious. "Value stocks are important to us, but our major goal is long-term growth," Mr. Phippen said.
Such observations are not just talk. The students do their investing homework: interviewing brokers, reading Value Line, researching investment sites on the World Wide Web and using the analytical software provided in the college's investment course. In 15-minute presentations, members pitch and defend their investment ideas to the rest of the club.
One thing they don't do is hurry.
"At our meetings, we may decide to hold a stock, or buy it later at a lower price, or maybe research it a bit longer," Mr. Phippen said.
Still, the portfolio hasn't exactly been gathering dust in a dormitory closet. This school year, the club has made several major trades besides the purchase of shares in America Online and Dell. In November, for example, the students decided to buy 100 shares of First Brands, the consumer-products company whose lines include Glad plastic bags and STP auto products. The company has enjoyed growing overseas sales, and its shares have risen from the purchase price of $19.125 to $26.75 at Friday's close.
In other years, many club investment decisions have also been on the mark. For example, the students bought 50 shares of I.B.M. at $68 a share in the fall of 1992, when the company was out of favor on Wall Street. Since then, I.B.M. stock has soared; even after falling more than $10 on Wednesday in the face of a company official's concern over future growth, the shares managed to finish the week at $105.25.
Another smart move was the purchase in 1992 of 50 shares in Catalina Marketing, which makes computer scanning systems for grocery coupons issued at the checkout counter. The idea was pitched by two women who weren't that active in the club -- women typically make up only about 10 percent of the membership -- and their approach was different than the club's customary practice.
"Catalina wasn't sold to us on the basis of financial analysis or price-to-earnings ratio," Professor Chambers said. "It was sold as a concept, based on the observations of two people who went to a supermarket and kept their eyes open.
"The rest of the club went along with the students just to be nice," he continued. The courtesy was rewarded. The club bought the stock at $31.25. It closed Friday at $75.50.
Of course, not every deal turns out right. In the spring of 1993, the club's assets were less diversified, with 25 percent in just two companies: Intel and Merck. Concerned that the fund would be hit hard if those stocks fell during the summer, the students placed a stop-loss order on them in June. Such an order authorizes a broker to sell a stock if its price touches a certain floor.
During vacation, the two stocks indeed fell to the stop-loss threshold, and the equities were converted into cash. But the students were a bit too risk-averse: the two stocks rebounded after the sale.
The students also stumbled with International Gaming Technology, a maker of slot machines. The club bought the stock for about $61 a share in February 1993, at the height of excitement over the gambling industry. It sold the 50 shares in December, for just $12 each.
The club faltered, too, in some bond investments, many of which were in term trusts. These trusts, which are bond funds that may contain adjustable-rate mortgages, zero-coupon bonds and other fixed-income instruments, ran into trouble in recent years when interest rates rose.
But the students are not deterred. They are keeping an eye on foreign investments. They are wondering if they should buy shares in Apple Computer, whose cash-flow and product problems have punished its stock price. And they are wondering if they should dump their stock in Kmart, which has been hurt by competition from Wal-Mart Stores and others. The stock, bought at $15 a share in June 1992, closed Friday at $9.875.
As the club looks ahead, Mr. Phippen is also hoping that it yields a really great return: a job. Lately, he said, his interviews have included Lehman Brothers and Citibank.
"I get a lot of interest with the portfolio," he said. "I'd say we spend about 80 percent of the interview time talking about it."

HEADLINE: Mitzvah or Mania?;
Party-Hopping at the High End of the Theme Bas and Bar Mitzvah

BYLINE: By LANG PHIPPS 

 BODY:
MARCH 9 is still a hair early for an Oscar party, but on this particular Saturday night it certainly looks like that's what Laura Belle's been done up for. Two giant Oscar cut-outs survey the dance floor like flat, sexless totems, and tropical flowers and trees on the bandstand, the tables, and the bar of this retro-glam supper club on West 43d street, welcome guests in from the cruel cold outside. There's even a replica of those arid Western hills and the famous outsized letters that rise before them, except something's not quite right here: instead of Hollywood, the sign reads, "Mollywood".
Indeed this is not a party to honor Oscar, but a celebration of 13-year-old Molly Lindenbaum's bas mitzvah. On this special night, the joyous end of her daylong initiation into Jewish womanhood, Molly's parents, Herb and Bonnie, have done all they can to make this event unforgettably Molly. 
 The theme is Hollywood because she loves the glamour of the movies. Her film canister-shaped cake is draped with dark chocolate "film," and before it sits a white and dark chocolate "clapper" with "Mollywood" written in as the film title. A table full of Oscar statuettes awaits the family and friends who will come up to toast Molly and pick up their award. On the children's tables, glass jewels are strewn, and there are Mollywood match boxes whose fat matchheads reveal themselves to be mints when viewed from the side.
A booth on the balcony where the children are seated is busy turning out "Mollywood, U.S.A." fake license plates, with pictures of the children's faces laminated inside them. Downstairs, on each of the adult tables, a sign links the table's number to a movie: 1 Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, 2 For The Road, 3 Faces Of Eve, 4 Seasons, 5 Easy Pieces, etc. After dinner, singing waiters descend from the balcony and belt out "Hello Molly" to the little girl who sits in the center of it all.
Not only is this extravaganza all for a 13 year old, but for private school students of a certain social stratum, it is almost commonplace. Two or three times a week, seven months a year, they may find themselves invited to such events. Could this, ladies and gentlemen, be Mitzvah Mania?
The ante for this kind of affair was raised in the 80's when Gerald Guterman, the real estate tycoon who was the controlling partner in a limited partnership that later declared bankruptcy, leased the Queen Elizabeth 2 for his son's bar mitzvah. What we're seeing in the 90's at the high end is a somewhat less extravagant type of party, played out in a prolific variety of themes.
Few families can afford the Cecil B. DeMille approach -- and many who can, don't want it, taking the middle ground in their bas and bar mitzvahs. These also appear to be growing in popularity.
Angie Zablo and her husband, Randy, run New Jersey-based Foremost Caterers, a company that has been providing glatt kosher food to bar and bas mitzvahs in New York, New Jersey, Long Island, and Washington for 46 years. She has seen a 40 percent increase in business in the last eight years, a boost she attributes, in part, to the emergence of bas (for girls, as opposed to bar, for boys) mitzvahs, as women are taking a more significant role in Jewish religion.
Who gets involved in the state-of-the-art New York version of this ancient tradition? Mainly children of privilege who attend Dalton, Riverdale, Horace Mann, and Fieldston. Why now? Largely because all the successful Jewish baby-boomers who deferred marriage and children until later in their careers, now have kids who are coming of age at the same time.
Many of these parents grew up poor or middle-class and would love to give their children the mitzvah party they never had (and a chance at a vicarious second mitzvah for themselves); most are also beginning a commitment to traditional Jewish life, with all the new-found cultural identity and religious fulfillment that can confer.
The bar or bas mitzvah is one of the most important Jewish traditions. In it, the boy or girl turning 13 becomes a full member of the Jewish religion. This is regarded as a good deed, one of God's commandments.
Living in the vibrant midst of it, these seem to be the halcyon days of the Grand Mitzvah Era. But since the Jews came to America, this tradition has transmuted into something purely American.
"What's going on today are variations on a theme," said Jenna Weissman Joselit, author of "The Wonders of America: Reinventing Jewish Culture 1880-1950" (Hill and Wang, 1995). "The fancified bar mitzvah dates back to the 20's, or even earlier. In the 20's, kids got ice sculptures in their image, and in the 40's, bar mitzvah invitations were often elaborately styled after the Torah scroll. Like everything else in America, these parties were oversized, out-of-scale."
Keeping a sense of balance has always been an issue -- even the rabbis of the 1880's groused about the pomp and frivolity of the ur-American bar mitzvahs. Has the grand mitzvah tradition, building up steam over the decades, encouraged unhealthy competition for the most boffo event in our time, leaving the less wealthy feeling inadequate and the honorees with the wrong lessons about values versus consumerism?
Even Marc Lustgarten, vice chairman of Cablevision, and the host of "Jessie On Broadway," (his daughter's bas mitzvah), acknowledges the dangers.
"We baby boomers are prone to excess, and we're high-octane achievers," he said. "Unfortunately, with this level of affluence it's not so much 'We gotta outdo them' as 'We can't look bad next to the Joneses.' When your child is going to 40 or 50 bas mitzvahs a year, would you want your child's to look bad next to the others?"
But, he added: "This is a major milestone, not just a 13-year-old's birthday. After the bas mitzvah, she will have become a full-blown member of the Jewish religion. My wife and I, and Jessie, will look back on this for the rest of our lives. Why not make it as special as you possibly can? And try to bring as much joy as you can to yourself, to your child, and to your friends and relatives?"
How much does one of these momentous events cost? Assuming the head count is 200, the venue alone (food and drink included) could cost $20,000 to $40,000. Decorations, centerpieces, flowers and sundry games will cost from $5,000 to $10,000. The photographer and video team will charge between $3,500 and $7,000. The master of ceremonies, disc jockey and dancers will range from $4,000 to $6,000. The celebration cake is $500 to $700, and the event planner may cost from $2,500 to $7,000. The total costs generally run about $70,000, but $100,000-plus events are not unheard of.
The event planner may not be the costliest component, but it is the most important. Parents like Herb and Bonnie Lindenbaum couldn't create an event like Mollywood by themselves. They need someone who knows the territory, has boundless energy, patience, and imagination, is theatrical, and is Jewish himself. They need, in other words, a Mitzvah Maven. Luckily for the Lindenbaums, Lee Tannen was available.
Mr. Tannen and his partner, Tom Wells, run an event planning and catering company called Showstoppers. Tom, the southern WASP, handles the less antic side of the business -- private events for the likes of David Rockefeller and the Sultan of Brunei.
Mr. Tannen, in the natural declension of things, creates Mitzvah Mania. He grew up Jewish in the Bronx when it still had a thriving diaspora community, and for 15 years he wrote advertisements for clients in the New York theater. His love of flourish and the small effect qualify him as the ideal Mitzvah Maven, because the details are everything at these events.
Extreme care is taken here -- the party must be as perfectly assembled as a Patek Philippe watch, and it must be one of a kind, as singular as the honoree. Planning may begin as far as 24 months in advance. As many as 20 different sites may be considered throughout the city, with parents and children visiting restaurants, hotels, lofts, mansions and even boats.
Nothing is more important than the theme, which derives from the boy or girl. That your theme is fingerprint/snowflake unique can be life or death to these children in the first throes of the adolescent identity crisis. No matter how personalized, the production must never distract the focus from the boy or girl, who is there to bask in the love of family and friends. As Jessie Lustgarten notes, "If someone had a huge bar mitzvah and no one cared about the kid, it wouldn't be fun."
Molly thought Laura Belle was "fabulous" and the night was a success -- "everyone danced" -- but above all, "it was the best party because it was mine."
Almost the only exception to the absolute originality rule -- the common whorl in the uncommon fingerprint -- is Lonnie the hip-hop dancer and all-around mitzvah Pied Piper. Everyone wants Lonnie at their party: he's cool, he's nice, and no one does the electric slide smoother than he. "The kids like me because I love being a kid myself," he says. He's in great demand and a total professional, but he has made a vow never to carry business cards -- too grown up.
Mr. Tannen brought Lonnie into this circuit, as well as M.C. Greg, whose aerobic-class pep and Energizer Bunny tirelessness has whipped up mania at a few parties lately. Mr. Tannen has also hatched "Twins," a joint bar mitzvah for the Cohen twins, and he masterminded "Jessie On Broadway" for the Lustgartens.
"Twins" turned a featureless banquet room at the Princeton Club into a black and white nightclub, complete with a checkerboard dance floor and 3,500 black, white and silver balloons. The tables were decorated with twins themes, like a model of the twin towers, an oversize Doublemint gum pack, an illustration from the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "Twins." Mr. Tannen scoured the world for twin disc jockeys and somewhere on Long Island, found the "M & M Twins," Marco and Michael Posillico.
Tavern on the Green could not have been improved upon as the venue for "Jessie On Broadway." After all, it was created by one of the original showstoppers, Warner LeRoy. But Mr. Tannen managed to transform the mirrored passageway leading to the party rooms into "Jessie's Alley." Eight-foot theater posters lined the walls on both sides, enveloping the arriving guests with the theme. Inside the glass-covered dining room, Mr. Tannen filled every corner with life-sized billboards of Jessie in full costume standing under the marquees of "Cats," "Les Miserables," "Grease," and "Sunset Boulevard."
Her cake was a rendering of the masks of comedy and tragedy in white and dark chocolate, and guests who came up to make toasts to Jessie were accompanied by the appropriate show tune. "Consider Yourself Part Of The Family" from "Oliver!" played as friends of the family came up; when Marc Lustgarten's boss, Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, arose, "The Company Way," from "How to Succeed In Business Without Really Trying" came on.
The kids drank virgin blender drinks, "mocktails," and made kid-vids at a booth that produced MTV-like music videos. A rich moment was when a brace of mothers, their 13-year-old daughters on the side in hysteria and horror, did a spot-on perfect performance, pouty and wriggly, to "I'm Too Sexy." This was an event where parents and kids partied on equal terms, a common occurrence on the circuit, and a great part of its charm.
In the 20-odd years since Mr. Tannen was bar mitzvah-ed, much has changed. He sees the children much more involved. They spark the parties with their manic energy, and the parents follow. At the first note of music, a sort of line dance-aerobic class begins to the calls of M.C. Greg and the moves of Lonnie. In his day, Mr. Tannen's parents and their friends chose the music -- no M.C. Greg here -- and out of four sets of Sinatra, maybe one set was ceded to the kids' music.
The parents may love these parties, but the grandparents often just don't get it. At every event there's a bank of white-maned men and women who sit silent as stones at their tables, wearing expressions of vague dismay, if they register any reaction at all.
"It's not music, and it's not dancing," groused Molly's grandmother, Rose Ganz, as the hip-hop pounded on and on at Mollywood. "I'm getting a headache here."
She finally did move though, to do a heartbreaking dance, delicate and spare, as "Hava Nagila" played during the hora.
How does hip-hop music, the electric slide, and all the excess of Mitzvah Mania, fit in with the religious tradition of Jewish life?
Rabbi Marc Schneier was a guest on the QE II for the Gutermans' 1986 bar mitzvah. The 80's, Rabbi Schneier remembers, were "too much bar and not enough mitzvah."
Now, he says, the parents have a lot invested in Jewish tradition and continuity. "They send their children to Hebrew school, and sometimes the mitzvah ceremony is held in Israel," he said.
Bonnie Lindenbaum said she saw the bas mitzvah as a continuation of Molly's Hebrew school education. "The party was the joyous culmination of her years of study," she said.
At the Kiddush meal before the party, Rabbi Schneier spoke of Molly's Hebrew name, Malkah, which translates into "queen." Two hours later he stood in Laura Belle as M.C. Greg pumped the air like Arsenio Hall, shouting "Let me hear you say, 'Molly's in the house!' " The two images can coexist, he said, because "That's who Molly is, a New York kid, with all that that means." The sober sustenance of these children's faith is leavened by their being 13 and vibrantly modern.
If anything, they are depressingly grown up. One girl, dressed in a black, spaghetti-strapped number, sunglasses in her "Friends"-style coif, described Laura Belle as "a great space, perfect ab-fab room for a party." She zeroed in on the one-upsmanship that underlies these showy events. "The first thing the women do is pick up a knife to see if it's plated or real silver." One boy, now jaded after two parties a week all winter long, had only this to say: "These things only exist for the caterers."
Rabbi Jeffrey Salkin, author of "Putting God On The Guest List" (Jewish Lights Publishing, 1992), a guide for parents seeking greater spiritual depth in their bar or bas mitzvahs, is more critical of these extravaganzas than Rabbi Schneier.
"Yes, Judaism encourages celebration," he says, "but families have to ask themselves what their values are and whether these type of celebrations, which have been known to bankrupt families with their expense, fit in. I'm all for healthy celebration, but our young people can become numbed by too much materialism."
At "Jessie On Broadway," Marc Lustgarten achieved what Rabbi Salkin has termed "a massive ethical upgrade" by donating a contribution in each of the guests' names to Mazon, a nonprofit organization that provides food for the hungry worldwide.
Do these families really have to worry about overextending themselves? "There's a fine line when these large celebrations mean borrowing, or in some way incurring an economic stretch that affects family life and values," said Mr. Lustgarten. For the well-off, values are an issue, he said. He recalled that Cablevision -- a part owner of Madison Square Garden -- has received calls from people asking to rent Madison Square Garden for a bar mitzvah, or to get Patrick Ewing to come sign autographs.
"One could argue that's over the line," he said, acknowledging that the Knicks dancers have actually been hired for bar mitzvahs in the past.
Elise Kleinberg, one of Molly Lindenbaum's classmates, recalled, "My mother said I'm going to have to elope, my bas mitzvah cost so much."
Despite the downside, the party goes on. Which brings us back to the Mitzvah Maven, busy with his May 4 schedule. That day Lee Tannen will do three parties in 24 hours. The lunch event is a bas mitzvah for a little girl who loves horses and Mr. Tannen is turning the Bryant Park Grill into Churchill Downs for Kentucky Derby day.
From Bryant Park, he is racing up to the Park East Synagogue on Madison Avenue for an afternoon bar mitzvah, and by 8 P.M. he'll be overseeing another one at the Town Club on East 86th Street. By the end of this day of juggling musicians, magicians and florists, the Mitzvah Maven should be so insane, you could well call him the Mitzvah Maniac.
Although he's hardly complaining. "I've got the best job in New York," he says. "Who else my age gets a chance to run around and be a kid again."
 
A Son Recalls the QE2
TEN years ago, Jason Guterman had the most fabulous bar mitzvah, when his father, Gerald, a real estate magnate, took the celebration to another level. He rented out the entire Queen Elizabeth 2 and invited 650 friends and relatives to join two orchestras, a string quartet, as well as clowns, dancers and magicians, on an overnight cruise in New York Harbor. Ivan Boesky landed on deck in a rented helicopter. The event became a symbol of 80's excess.
Looking back, the bar mitzvah boy, Jason Guterman, a 22-year-old junior at U.S.C., says the event "wasn't that big of a deal" to him then. He often attended elaborate social events. He recalls having fun, getting many presents, having his first drink and even gambling in the on-board casino.
But he says he is not an extravagent person and that the event did not mangle his values. In fact, he says, he rarely talks about it. He says he "always wanted to be just like everybody else, longing to live in a cookie-cutter house with neighbors close by.
"I remember my friends making a bigger deal out of it then I ever did and that sort of bothered me," he says. "When you're little you don't want to feel separated from your friends and that separated me."
Jason lived on a 14-acre estate in Bedford Hills, N.Y. The scariest part of the event was singing at the Park East Synagogue on the East Side.
"I felt pretty popular for awhile," he said, "but I was really uncomfortable with all the attention." He admits he did start dating one girl who wasn't interested in him until after the party.
Even the teachers treated him differently. "One English teacher gave out an assignment and in front of the whole class he said that as a present to me, I didn't have to do it," he says.
Soon Jason decided to go to public school. Then, his family moved to Aspen, Colo., where no one knew about the affair. He was happy about that. MONIQUE P. YAZIGI

Nanny-Tax Tally of '95: Who Paid, Who Lied?

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
LAST Monday, a New York City couple met with their accountant to file their 1995 taxes. They had an income of $100,000, a hefty mortgage and a nanny the Internal Revenue Service knew nothing about. And they kept it that way.
When their accountant came to line 53, which for the first time asks about household employment taxes, the couple lied, without hesitation. 
 "I feel terrible about not paying the taxes, really I do," said the wife, an editor at a magazine in New York who agreed to talk only if she was not identified. "I pay our nanny $360 a week, and I know she makes practically nothing for the important work she does. But I can't afford to pay another $2,000 for her taxes. And I understand from my friends that if I pay her Medicare and Social Security taxes, and ask her to pay part of the contribution, she'll hit me up for more money."
For millions of nannies and housekeepers, April 15 was to have been a landmark day this year. If all had gone as planned, many more Americans than ever before would have paid Social Security, unemployment and Medicare contributions for their domestic employees with their Federal income tax returns. Now that the Form 1040 asks point-blank about household employees, people can no longer assert, as they could in the past, that they didn't understand their obligation to pay the tax. And they can be punished for perjury on top of being assessed for back taxes.
 While it will take months for the Internal Revenue Service to determine how many Americans actually paid on behalf of domestic employees, the early evidence suggests that the compliance rate continues to be low. Without conducting an official count of returns, officials at several big accounting firms, like Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche, said last week that they saw no significant increase over previous years in the number of clients who paid household employment taxes.
"A lot of people just refuse to pay these taxes," said Merlin Larsen, president of Pacific Benefits, a payroll deduction service based in Salt Lake City. "I've heard that of the 75,000 live-in nannies in the U.S., only 20 percent of their employers pay their household taxes. Most people still pay their nanny in cash on Friday night and let it go at that."
So why should things be any different this year? Advocates in Congress had argued that more people would pay the tax, which provides Social Security and other benefits for domestic workers, if it was simpler to ante up. Until this year, taxpayers had to pay quarterly, an extra burden that helped keep on the sideline about three-quarters of the two million Americans who owe the tax for domestic employees like nannies, gardeners and maids. This year, people were required to pay the tax only once, as part of their Federal income-tax returns.
"We expected a lot more people to pay their household taxes with the new one-payment system," said Marshall Washburn, national director of specialty taxes for the I.R.S. "People have no more excuses not to pay this. If more people don't pay it, then I'm really disappointed. I have a hard time rationalizing that."
Taxpayers, however, tell a different story. Several who balked at paying this year said they were left with little choice. Many who employed illegal aliens as nannies didn't dare risk having them deported. Once employers pay the tax, they must keep doing so in the future or face a higher risk of audit.
And then there was the trouble of actually paying. Despite a simpler Federal system, employers still had to make quarterly payments in most states. And those payments could be hefty. Many household employees -- including nannies and maids -- say they are unable to pay their share, which forces employers bent on compliance to make the entire contribution.
It may turn out that the I.R.S. had its greatest compliance two years ago, after Zoe Baird, President Clinton's first nominee for Attorney General, and several others were exposed for failure to pay household employment taxes. Ms. Baird, whose name still makes many nannies chuckle and many employers wince, was denied the post and asked to cough up $11,000 in back taxes and fines.
Those who had hopes of landing a job in Washington quickly became fervent payers. Leslie and Michael Ray, of Laguna Beach, Calif., voluntarily paid two years of back taxes after Ms. Baird's fall from grace. Mr. Ray, a commercial developer who served as President Clinton's campaign manager in Orange County, had hoped for a political appointment but has yet to receive one.
If the President calls, Mr. Ray is ready. The Rays routinely pay their household employment taxes, even though most of their friends who have live-in help do not.
"What's so aggravating to us is our friends, who are Republicans, go after the children of illegals -- wanting to cut them off from our schools and health care -- but they hired their parents," Mrs. Ray said. "We'll just feel morally superior now because we know they're lying" on their tax returns.
SEVERAL taxpayers who acknowledged that they had lied about household employment taxes this year pleaded special circumstances. The most forceful complaints came from women who had struggled for years to find legal nannies who worked well with their children. Too often, they said, the only way they could find competent child care was to hire illegal aliens. Paying the employment tax, they said, would have tipped off the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which could send the nannies packing.
"People who establish these taxes do not understand how difficult it is to find a legal person to care for your children," a New York doctor said. "Over the years, I've made every human effort to comply with this law, and at times when it came down to having someone good or having someone legal and paying the tax, my children came first. If your nanny can't get a Social Security number, how can you pay the tax?"
While that argument runs rampant among two-income families -- and the I.R.S. points out that it has a procedure for submitting taxes for illegal aliens -- it doesn't sit well at nanny-placement agencies. Officials at those agencies say many employers are out to hire inexperienced women on the cheap instead of hiring experienced nannies through a network of agencies nationwide.
"There are plenty of nannies who are available," said Leslie Weinberg, president of Hand-in-Hand Agency Inc., a child care placement service in New York. "Some of these employers may be out to hire someone cheaply to stay within their budget. A lot of people come to see us that cannot legally work in the U.S., but we don't ever send them out."
People who cannot find an affordable, legal nanny need only to look to Gov. George E. Pataki and his wife, Libby. They found one. Despite earning some $160,000 last year, according to their just-released tax return, the Patakis paid their live-in nanny a scant $11,597, or $223 a week, to take care of their four children, who still live at home.
"The Governor gets his nanny through a service and pays them," said a spokeswoman for the Governor. "It's not like the Patakis determine how much their nanny earns."
The notion that finding a legal nanny is difficult also riles the minority of families who do pay the household employment taxes. "It's totally irresponsible not to pay these," said Dee Aldrich, an editor at Conde Nast Traveler, who just paid $2,675 in Federal taxes for her nanny. "What kind of employer would leave the person who takes care of their children totally unprotected? You have to watch out for their interests."
Nannies, however, appear to be split on the tax issue. Like many others who are working legally in the United States, a nanny in Queens has asked her employers to pay their share of her Social Security and Medicare contributions. "I'd be treated like a slave if my employers didn't pay these taxes," said the nanny, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It makes me happy that I'm eligible for these benefits if I need them."
BUT other women say they are better off pretending that the I.R.S. doesn't exist, because they don't want to pay income tax on their earnings. "I don't want my employer to pay these taxes," said another nanny, a 20-year-old from Poland who works on a student visa. "I can only work 25 hours a week, and if my boss takes money from me for these taxes, I won't make as much."
Competition among nannies to land a job may soon come down to the tax issue. For the first time, situation-wanted ads are flagging when a nanny has a green card or is willing to work on the books in the hope it will be seen as a competitive advantage. "I have no problem having my employer pay the taxes or working without them," said Jenny Peters, a 36-year-old woman from Grenada who is hoping to land a full-time nanny position. "There's incredible competition on the market right now. I have my green card and I lose jobs to a lot of people who can't legally work here. That can be very frustrating."
What riles employers, however, are nannies who are inflexible when it comes to the taxes. Legally, an employer can ask a nanny to pay half of her Medicare and Social Security benefit, which comes down to 7.65 percent of her annual salary. The employer picks up the other half, also 7.65 percent, and the unemployment insurance benefit and sends it to the Federal Government. Often, the nanny objects to having any money deducted from her paycheck, forcing the employer to cough up the entire 15.3 percent.
But that can create additional havoc. "If you decide to pay the nanny's Social Security taxes for them, this additional payment will be deemed taxable compensation," ratcheting up the amounts that are owed, said Alan Goldberg, president of Nanny Tax Inc., a New York payroll tax service. "If she makes $10,000, and the employer pays the nanny's 7.65 contribution, her taxable income becomes $10,765."
Several employers also complained that they were expected to file the nannies' Federal returns for them. "My nanny is very, very good," one publishing executive said. "But not only do I pay the entire 15 percent, she has no idea that this is unusual. I actually thought that she expected not to pay income taxes."
While many people who have nannies and housekeepers opt not to pay any tax, accountants say the main offenders are those with part-time help. Because people pay part-timers so little, they don't believe they owe the tax. They are wrong; the law requires those who pay a domestic worker more than $1,000 a year -- that's $19.24 a week -- to withhold the tax to avoid committing perjury on their tax returns.
"If the person who comes in and cleans your apartment twice a month is self-employed, then you don't owe the tax," said Bob Tighe, an accountant in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich. "But chances are that person is just a part-time worker. If you give your maid instructions and she uses your mop and soap, then she is a domestic employee. You owe the tax."
But try to explain that to a taxpayer determined to get a refund. One executive at an Atlanta public relations firm pays her maid $40 a week -- thereby subjecting her to the tax -- but balked at paying up.
"Are you kidding me?" she said. "You think I'm going to pay this to the I.R.S.? Well, let me tell you something. I was in my office yesterday and this auditor from the I.R.S. phoned and said, 'Sorry, but we didn't get your 1993 return.' I said, 'Sure you did.' And I faxed them another one. They can't even find a whole return. Now do you honestly expect them to miss what I pay for my maid?"
But others fear the wrath of the I.R.S. The nanny industry is worried that tax collectors may ask for records from agencies as a way to find people who didn't pay the household tax. "We've heard they plan to do that and it's scary," said Ms. Weinberg of Hand-in-Hand Agency Inc., the placement service. "It's certainly an invasion of privacy."
The I.R.S. does not deny that it may try those tactics, even though most of its policing will come through regular audits. And the penalties -- up to one-fifth of the amount owed -- can add up quickly. This year, for example, an employer who pays a nanny $300 a week would pay $1,249.40 in Federal household employment tax, which includes unemployment insurance, plus $1,193.40 remitted from the nanny's paycheck. If this employer decides not to pay the tax and gets caught in three years, the payments plus interest and penalties would total $4,243, said Mr. Goldberg of Nanny Tax.
The threat of those penalties may not be enough to make most taxpayers ante up. While the Federal payment system may be simpler after the overhaul, many taxpayers say state systems, particularly in New York, often remain an adventure in purgatory. "There was a time when I filed the taxes myself," said one mother of two. "But then I ran into the New York State tax forms and I literally pulled my hair out."
The sudden interest in household employment taxes has been a boon for a few accountants, who have developed a specialty in domestic payrolls. Mr. Goldberg, who charges $340 a year to shepherd clients through the paperwork, said his business doubled this year, thanks to a growing number of taxpayers who have grown tired of the record-keeping. And some taxpayers prefer the quarterly payments to avoid a big hit at tax time, but those procedures are now even more complex.
Well-to-do families with large staffs appear to be the most compliant. Sharon Umphenour, a fund-raiser who lives in Atlanta, has a full-time gardener, a maid and a secretary and insists on paying their benefits, regardless of the hassle.
"I really appreciate my employees," Ms. Umphenour said. "You ask me if it bothers me that other people don't pay their household employment taxes. Sure it does; this is the law. I obey it. Now you tell me: Why shouldn't everyone?"

HEADLINE: An Exit From the Inner City: Training for New Auto Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
IN high school, Quincy W. Huff worked part time stacking merchandise on drugstore shelves. Now, six years later, Mr. Huff can be found sitting at a computer in the library of a nonprofit group called Focus: Hope, creating intricate models of automobile parts.
Mr. Huff, 24, who spent several years working for auto-supply companies before enrolling in Focus: Hope's engineering program, knows he will have to work harder to get a high-paying factory job than people who grew up in the suburbs a few miles away. 
 "Some people I've known who have gotten into Chrysler were just regular people," Mr. Huff said. But he isn't taking any chances.
"I could have gotten lucky, then again maybe not," he added. "The older you get and the less educated you get, your luck kind of plays out."
Every year, Focus: Hope trains 1,000 young adults from Detroit's inner city, like Mr. Huff, for auto industry jobs. And the contrast between the decay and occasional bedlam of the public schools they left behind and the intellectual challenge and unforgiving discipline they encounter here couldn't be starker.
Before, they could often skip classes with impunity, and many dropped out. Now, anyone who shows up even a minute late more than three times in the first seven weeks loses the chance of being recommended for more advanced studies; anyone tardy six times is expelled. And while many of the students barely learned to read and write in high school, here they must master the complexities of computers and geometric equations.
Auto executives would like to see more programs like Focus: Hope as they start their biggest hiring spree in a quarter-century to replace 170,000 retiring workers by 2003.
"There is a crying need in the country for the development of skills that would allow people to work in these high-paying jobs," said John F. Smith Jr., chairman of the General Motors Corporation. He said schools in the United States should move toward offering European-style apprenticeships for blue-collar workers.
Robert J. Eaton, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said high schools used to do a better job of training young people for factory work.
"I would like to see a dramatic change in schooling in the United States," he said. "I would like to see far more opportunity for technical skills." He recalls taking high-school courses "like sheet-metal shop, machine shop, welding" and using the expertise he picked up to tinker with cars after school.
Focus: Hope is bringing back that kind of hands-on training, offering everything from remedial reading to advanced engineering degrees. At the low end, it has designed a seven-week session to bring students -- typically unemployed teen-agers, many of them high-school dropouts -- up to 10th-grade math and reading levels. "I see young people that are graduating from school and they've got a high school diploma but they have fourth-grade math," said Eleanor Josaitis, the group's co-founder.
Just 60 percent make it through that relatively short introductory phase and go on to the school's core curriculum, a 31-week stint at the Machinist Training Institute. There, five days a week for eight hours a day, students strap on a royal blue smock and learn the basics of working in the auto industry. They spend half the day in classrooms studying applied math, manufacturing theory, computer programming and blueprint reading. Then they hit the shop floor, where they use lathes, mills and grinders to precisely slice metal, making hammers and other equipment found in factories.
Most students work part time to pay their bills while they study at Focus: Hope. By the time they are finished, they have gained self-confidence and the skills to land jobs paying an average of $22,000 a year. When nearby Big Three factories are looking for workers, they sometimes hire Focus: Hope's entire graduating class.
Some students, lured by the prospect of higher pay, stick around for a more advanced program that lasts 26 weeks and enables them to earn a part-time wage from Focus: Hope, making auto parts sold to local companies, while they study. And the true die-hards stay for advanced studies that can last years in fields like engineering or computer-aided design. They earn associate, bachelor's or master's degrees from six local universities during their time at Focus: Hope.
Focus: Hope graduates are joining the ranks of a higher-skilled work force that is expected to help make American auto companies more efficient. The University of Michigan calculated that in 1994, the Big Three assembled 66 cars and trucks per worker a year. By 2003, that figure is expected to jump to 90 vehicles an employee, an efficiency level that Toyota has already exceeded.
Mr. Huff fears that people from the inner city have a long way to go to get a piece of the action. "Half don't even know what the Internet is," he lamented. "Half of them have never used a computer. Kids coming from out in the suburbs are more prepared."
And many inner-city children aren't even aware of the opportunities they are missing, he added. Where he grew up, he said, "it was unheard of for a person to make $20,000 a year." Indeed, it wasn't until he earned enough money to buy a car and drive out past Eight Mile Road -- the dividing line between Detroit and its northern suburbs -- that he realized so many people lived a life he had seen only on television.
With so many jobs to be had, Mr. Huff said, "I can't believe people aren't grabbing this opportunity." He paused, then said, "I can see why people waste it, because they don't know any better."

HEADLINE: It's Not a Wage Gap But an Age Gap

BYLINE: By W. Michael Cox; W. Michael Cox is vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Congress appears bent on raising the minimum wage in an attempt to accomplish by legislative fiat what many claim the economy can no longer do on its own: give low-income workers a bigger piece of the pie. What legislators perhaps don't understand is that if poor Americans can gain entry into the work force, even at low wages, they usually move up the economic ladder.
The 20 House Republicans who have joined Democrats in calling for raising the minimum wage are apparently swayed by endlessly repeated popular myths: The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer; the middle class is going nowhere; today's twentysomething job seekers are destined to be the first Americans in history not to live as well as their parents. 
 Census Bureau data seem to verify this pessimism. In 1994, the latest year available, the bottom fifth of households earned just 3.6 percent of the nation's income and saw their share of the wealth fall from 4.2 percent in 1975 to 3.6 percent. The top fifth, meanwhile, received almost half of the nation's income, up from 43.7 percent in 1975. After adjusting for inflation, the income of households in the lowest fifth rose only $87 from 1975 to 1994. The top tier, meanwhile, gained $25,934.
Yet the doomsayers ignore an important economic fact: Inequality is not immobility. The Census Bureau's static snapshots of income distribution don't gauge Americans' ability to move up the economic ladder. The actual people in each percentile change from one year to another.
To gauge opportunity in America, it is essential to track individuals in the labor force or those trying to join it (people 16 and older who are working, unemployed, laid off, in school or retired) and to follow them over a period of years, capturing the ups and downs in their income.
The University of Michigan's Panel Survey on Income Dynamics has done exactly this, providing the longest-running record of Americans' earnings. In 1968, it began collecting detailed information on 50,915 people of all ages and income groups, and it compiled data through 1991.
The study gives a startlingly optimistic picture of economic mobility. Take those who were in the bottom fifth of all earners in 1975. The conventional view would lead us to believe that these people were probably worse off in the 1990's. But the Michigan study found that only 5 percent were still in the bottom fifth in 1991.
More remarkable, 80 percent of the bottom fifth in 1975 had made it into the top 60 percent of earners -- middle class or better -- over that 16-year span. And 29 percent rose to the top fifth. This evidence suggests that holding low-income jobs is largely a transitory stage for people with little work experience.
How mobile are Americans? Of the Michigan group, less than 1 percent of those in the lowest fifth in 1975 remained in the bottom 20 percent every single year until 1991. Nearly a quarter of those in the bottom tier in 1975 moved up the next year and never returned. More than three-quarters of those in the lowest fifth in 1975 spent at least one year among the top 40 percent of income earners by 1991.
The poor in the Michigan sample also made dramatic gains in annual income. Those who started in the bottom fifth in 1975 saw their average annual income increase by $25,322 by 1991, adjusted for inflation. Among 1975's top 20 percent of earners, the increase was only $3,974.
But not just the poorest workers from the 1970's did well. Among the second-poorest fifth, more than 70 percent had moved to a higher bracket by 1991, with 26 percent making it to the top 20 percent. From the middle fifth, almost half managed to raise their incomes. And a third of the people from the second-highest group made it to the top bracket.
What about the rich of 1975? Some fell to lower tiers, most likely because they retired or were laid off from high-paying jobs. Even so, nearly two-thirds of the group could still be found in the top tier in 1991. Less than 1 percent plummeted to the bottom.
The Michigan study isn't the first to look at individuals over time and find strong evidence to contradict the myth of a society sapped by declining opportunity. The Treasury Department reached a similar conclusion in a 1992 study. In analyzing tax returns from 14,351 households, it found that 86 percent of those in the lowest fifth in 1979 moved to a higher group by 1988. Two-thirds of these people reached the middle 20 percent or higher in just nine years, with almost 15 percent making it to the top fifth of income earners.
Not only do the statistics show that our economic system is biased toward success, but also they teach an important lesson about staying mobile in the economy of tomorrow. If people get into the work force -- at any level -- and stay there, they will likely be rewarded. There is a permanent underclass, but it consists for the most part of people who drop out of the work force entirely.
Getting people into the work force has taken on a new urgency in the postindustrial economy. Lifetime earning patterns have changed substantially. Traditionally, a worker's income rose rapidly in the early years of working, peaked in middle age, then fell as the worker eased toward retirement. But over the past four decades, earnings have been rising more sharply as workers age.
According to the Labor Department, in 1951 workers reached their peak earning years from the ages of 35 to 44. The average annual income of individuals in this group was 1.6 times the income of those from 20 to 24 years old, and slightly greater than that of workers between 45 and 54. By 1993, the peak earning years shifted to ages 45 to 54, and these workers earned almost 3.1 times more than the those in the 20-24 age group.
Older workers are doing better because the economy has shifted toward services and technology: brain power can continue to expand long after muscle power has begun to falter. Thus as the country retools itself for a more knowledge-intensive era, workers are increasingly rewarded for what they've learned in the workplace. Earnings for those with experience rise sharply, and the gap widens between youth and middle age.
This in part explains the apparent discrepancy between the Census Bureau's figures and the Michigan study. There is an income gap, but it driven more today by the steepening earnings of workers as they age.
It's not that the young are worse off; it's that older, more experienced workers are doing much better. Those who can stay in jobs almost certainly will receive their reward. Thus it is job experience, not government, that makes work pay. The key is to get a start and stay working.
So why is Congress talking about raising the minimum wage when economists of all stripes agree that even a 90-cent increase would reduce employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs over the long term? This would expel from the working class the very people whom the raise would purportedly help: the inexperienced. It is the kind of help poor Americans can't afford.

HEADLINE: It's Lonely for the U.S.;
Walking Loudly, Carrying Trade Rules

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE arsenal of the economic age is trade sanctions, and these days it sometimes seems as if President Clinton's advisers can think of nothing else.
Last weekend, before Mr. Clinton left for Asia, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the new Commerce Secretary, Mickey Kantor, spent hours discussing the double sanctions likely to be applied against China in coming weeks, first for proliferating nuclear weapons, then for pirating American music, software and videos. 
 A few weeks before, the same cast was tightening the noose on Cuba and threatening legal action against third countries that continue to invest there -- including Mexico and Canada. And there is a movement afoot in Congress to whip up new sanctions against companies from any nation that do business in Iran.
There's only one hitch: virtually none of America's allies is going along. To the contrary, they are denouncing America's use of its economic gunboats as counterproductive in the case of China, extraterritorial in the case of Iran, and a violation of worldwide trade accords in the case of Cuba.
To the White House, not surprisingly, the same set of facts looks very different. Mr. Clinton's advisers declare that only America has the leadership to stand up to world's bad actors, and that allies from Europe to Japan are, in the words of Mr. Kantor, "happy to hold our coats, and then reap the benefits of America playing the heavy."
 
 
 
Following Suit
 He should know. Weeks after he negotiated a trade agreement with Japan last year on autos and auto parts, the European nations that had denounced America's heavy-handed threats showed up in Tokyo asking for the same deal. (They got it.) The same could happen in China. Its 30 illegal compact-disk factories rip off Madonna and Windows 95, but they also churn out Japanese love songs recorded by Sony, and hits produced by the German recording giant Bertelsmann A.G. and by Polygram, which is Dutch-owned. Yet none of those countries has warned China, as the United States did again last week, that unless Beijing lives up to its agreement to shut the plants, they will close their markets to billions of dollars in Chinese imports.
In fact, Japanese business executives regularly use the tensions with the United States to portray Japan as China's more "reliable" trading partner. And the Europeans used a visit to Paris this month by Li Peng, China's premier, to wrap up a $1.5 billion aircraft deal that Boeing desperately wanted. "If we move to sanctions against China," one of Mr. Clinton's top strategists predicted the other day, "everyone else will privately tell us we're doing the right thing -- and then they'll send five new trade missions to Beijing."
 
 
 
The Best Conditions
 The problem for the Administration -- though one it will not talk about publicly -- is that if the United States acts alone, sanctions are far more likely to fail. In a study of economic sanctions since 1914, Gary Hufbauer and Daniel Rosen of the Institute for International Economics in Washington found that they work best when the international community is unified, when the target of the sanctions is weak, when they are implemented swiftly, and when they are aimed at "discrete goals" rather than "reshaping a country's political character."
"China is a classic case, because it fits almost none of the criteria," Mr. Hufbauer said in an interview. "It's big and powerful. It has figured out how to play the Europeans, the Japanese and the Americans off against each other."
The real political complications set in whenever talk turns to the ultimate sanction: Denying China "most favored nation" status, which gives it the lowest tariffs that the United States applies. Four years ago Mr. Clinton accused President George Bush of coddling dictators by automatically extending the trade benefits, called M.F.N., despite China's repression of dissidents.
Once in office, he changed his mind. American firms that rely on exports from China said that debating China's trading rights every year would be a form of assisted suicide. Hong Kong and Taiwan, which produce many of the goods they sell to America in factories in southern China, have joined the huge lobbying effort to preserve M.F.N. Mr. Clinton, not wanting to reverse positions twice on the same issue, has vowed to renew M.F.N. in June, even while threatening China with specific sanctions for exporting nuclear parts to Pakistan and ignoring last year's piracy accord.
And now Senator Bob Dole, a longtime public supporter of M.F.N., is suggesting that he would like to change his position. If he does, he could make Mr. Clinton look like the man who is coddling dictators this time.

HEADLINE: Now, Iran-Bosnia;
Who Knew What and When?

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT'S an election year, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that, suddenly, the Clinton Administration has its very own scandal involving Iranian ayatollahs and secret arms shipments.
Or does it? 
 Obviously, the Republicans think so. They are planning no fewer than six Congressional hearings to investigate the legality and wisdom of President Clinton's unannounced decision in 1994 to do nothing to stop Croatia from sending Iranian arms into Bosnia.
Just by calling in the investigators, they are planting the familiar impression that there is something to be exposed -- a flawed policy, an end-run around Congress, and perhaps even criminality.
But this episode isn't Iran-contra II. If there is a budding scandal here, so far it involves a failure to inform Congress of a decision it probably wouldn't have opposed anyway, the prospect that the White House will withhold documents and some sloppy handling of who knew what when.
Bob Dole, the President's challenger this year, has expressed shock: "It's duplicitous, to say the least," he said, "to tell us one thing while they're trying to covertly sort of wink and nod to the Iranians." He neglected to mention that in 1994 he was leading the charge in the Senate for lifting the arms embargo, and when reports surfaced of Iranian arms shipments, he did not object.
The Administration argues that Mr. Dole is posturing. Officials recall that news organizations reported that arms from Iran and other countries were arriving in Bosnia via Croatia and that reports on the shipments were in the daily classified intelligence reports that circulate throughout the Government.
What are the facts? In the spring of 1994 Bosnia's Muslims were under siege by the better-armed Serbs. The Administration (and Senator Dole) wanted to help the Muslim-led Government by lifting the United Nations-mandated arms embargo. But America's European allies, who had thousands of peacekeeping troops on the ground, vehemently opposed such a move. The Administration ruled out breaking the embargo on its own, arguing that this would tear NATO apart.
 
 
 
Didn't Ask, Didn't Tell
 If Ronald Reagan had been in the White House, he might have ordered William Casey, his Director of Central Intelligence, to cook up a covert operation to send arms secretly, just as they had done in Nicaragua and Afghanistan.
But covert operations don't seem to be Mr. Clinton's style. This one would have tied the United States to the fate of the Bosnian Muslims and enraged the allies. Besides, Mr. Clinton had a poor relationship with James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence, who would have had to carry out any covert operation. By law, Congress would have had to have been informed. Inevitably, the operation would have leaked.
So Mr. Clinton came up with a watered-down alternative: covert inaction.
On Air Force One on April 27, 1994, while en route to Washington from Richard Nixon's funeral, the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, presented Mr. Clinton with a way he could give a green light to Iranian arms shipments. Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, was preparing to ask the United States what it would think about an Iranian smuggling operation, and Mr. Clinton decided not to oppose it.
So Peter Galbraith, the American Ambassador to Croatia, told Mr. Tudjman that he had "no instructions" about such a plan. A few days later, an Iranian 747 bearing arms arrived in Croatia. And then Congress passed legislation requiring the Administration to stop enforcing the arms embargo, so ignoring such arms shipments became official policy in late 1994.
Until two weeks ago, the Republicans in Congress weren't making any fuss over the fact that Iran helped Bosnia fight a war that the Administration and Congress wanted Bosnia to win. That all changed when the Los Angeles Times reported Mr. Clinton's personal involvement.
It may well turn out that the Administration did nothing illegal, but the episode still raises questions about how well it makes decisions. Why, for example, didn't Mr. Lake, the co-author of a 1984 book on flaws in how foreign policy gets made, ask for a formal National Security Council meeting so that all the President's top advisers could be consulted? Mr. Woolsey, kept in the dark, assumed there was a rogue operation run outside the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials acknowledge that Secretary of Defense William Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were not consulted in advance either. Mr. Perry, more than once, expressed concern about Iranian arms shipments, said a senior Pentagon official, though he never tried to get them stopped.
Mr. Christopher, by contrast, who has made economic and diplomatic sanctions against Iran a pillar of American foreign policy, formally recommended to the President that the United States not try to stop theashipments. "Warren Christopher told me that this was the way to go," said Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff.
Lawmakers may want to know whether Administration officials were completely honest about American policy. When Mr. Christopher was asked in Geneva about reports of the first Iranian 747 shipment, he replied, "The United States expects compliance with the embargo."
Fair or not, the Republicans will try to use the Iranian connection to tarnish the Clinton Administration's peace agreement in Bosnia, much as the Democrats went after George Bush's record as a war President by arguing that he had mistakenly tried to befriend Saddam Hussein before the Iraqi President invaded Kuwait. It may only be theater; it may only be politics. But the Iran episode certainly gives the Republicans one more opportunity for a show trial.

HEADLINE: The World;
Finally, Japan May Have a Future in the Military

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
FOR the last 50 years, Japan has sat out Asia's disputes, its armed forces limited strictly to self-defense. Now, that may be changing. The Japanese-American summit meeting in Tokyo last week may be remembered as a milestone -- the occasion when Japan took the first steps on a long journey to exorcise the ghosts of war and take up a role in international security.
"Last year in Japan we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the end of the war," Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto declared in a toast during President Clinton's visit. "This year, we are taking the first steps toward a new era." 
 The biggest immediate news from the flurry of meetings surrounding the summit was a decision by America to hand back 11 military installations, in all or in part, on Okinawa. But the deeper meaning of President Clinton's visit and the American-Japanese joint declaration may be that it was a landmark moment when Japan began to come out of its shell.
 
 
 
The Biggest Little Fish
 "I think the kinds of approaches in the declaration will be in the long run more noted than the return of some acreage," a senior State Department official said.
The emergence of Japan as a player in the security of Asia would have significance around the world. The world's second-largest economy, Japan has been until now an economic whale and a military minnow. But a colossal reshaping of the security scene is now under way in the Pacific, and the United States and Japan both see room for a larger Japanese role.
The most important feature in the new Asian security topography is China, which with 3 million troops has the largest army in the world, as well as land or sea disputes with most of its neighbors and ambitions rather like Germany's in the late 1800's: to channel an economic boom into building a modern military machine, to create a blue-water navy and to overcome a legacy of humiliations by winning more space at the dinner table. In Germany's case, the result was World War I.
For thousands of years, at least since the rise of Sparta triggered the Peloponnesian wars, nothing has been so disruptive to international order as the friction that comes with the rise of new powers. And there has never been a rising power quite on the scale of China.
East Asia is also in flux because of the prospect of the collapse, peacefully or violently, of North Korea. And there are huge questions about the future course of Asia's other countries -- for example, Indonesia, the fourth most populous in the world with 200 million people.
It all adds up to a certainty: security in Asia will be highly uncertain.
"The status quo is not going to hold in Asia much longer," noted a senior Defense Department official.
Next to these cosmic trends, the steps that Japan has just taken toward a greater security role seem tiny. But their direction is what counts.
First, Japan agreed to a military supply agreement that will allow Tokyo to sell spare military parts to the United States -- albeit, for now, only in peacetime.
Second, Japan agreed to review the 18-year-old guidelines for military cooperation with the United States during a military crisis. This is not expected to go so far as to lead Japanese troops to fight alongside Americans in Korea. But it might allow American military planes to use Japanese civilian airports in an emergency, or it might permit Japan to refuel American naval ships in war or treat wounded American servicemen. In particular, the joint declaration emphasized the need to cooperate "in dealing with situations that may emerge in the areas surrounding Japan" -- meaning Korea.
The United States is now pressing Japan to play a greater security role, but one of the limitations is from Article 9 of the Constitution that the United States imposed on Japan after World War II: ". . . the Japanese people forever renounce war . . . and the threat or use of force." Yet it is entirely possible that in the coming years Japan will reinterpret the provision to mean that it does not apply to a crisis that affects Japan's security, which is almost anything this side of Bosnia.
On its face, for example, the Constitution also bans "land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential." Yet, due to the wonders of constitutional interpretation, Japan has built its self-defense forces into one of the most powerful armies in Asia, supported by a $45 billion military budget, the second- or third-largest in the world (after the United States' and probably Russia's). Japan will also continue to host 47,000 American troops, for whose maintenance Tokyo contributes about $6 billion a year.
In any event, a broad debate is now under way in Japan about what kind of military it should possess.
 
 
 
A Taboo Drops
 "Until recently it was a taboo to discuss this matter," former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has been leading Japan to take a more assertive position in security issues, said in an interview. "But now it's not a taboo and people are thinking about it seriously." Mr. Nakasone wants Japan initially to change the interpretation of the Constitution and then to amend the Constitution when that becomes politically possible.
The obstacles to a greatly enlarged military role are not just constitutional but also include public opinion in Asia. In China and Korea, in particular, memories of the horrors associated with Japanese invasion are still deep and bitter. Within Japan, many people also believe that their country must stay out of military spats and be, in the phrase of the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, "a conscientious objector nation."
The newspaper reflected the unease of many Japanese liberals when it warned in an editorial last week: "We cannot help but be concerned that a completely different direction is about to be taken." It said the result could, "in the worst case, involve Japan in an American war."

Warlords Ascend In Liberia's Ruins

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
SINCE freed American slaves first arrived to "settle" this steamy swampland in 1822, there has been one constant in this country's tortured history: Liberia has always belonged, like so much real estate, to its boldest sons. Now in a renewed state of civil war, it waits for the strongest to assert themselves.
From the very start, the land of the free envisioned by Liberia's American founders never included the indigenous tribes who were displaced by firepower and subterfuge. And to cement their grip, the Americo-Liberians, as the newcomers were known, instituted a subtle version of apartheid that ended only in 1980. In that fateful year, 28-year-old Army Master Sergeant Samuel K. Doe overthrew the hegemony of the American-descended ruling class, killing the President, William R. Tolbert. 
 If this class revenge after decades of deprivation and scorn was deeply satisfying for many indigenous Liberians, their pleasure would be brief. Soon enough, Mr. Doe's terror produced a sobering hangover: without its traditional elite, however selfish and corrupt, Liberia was ungovernable. Sitting amid the ruins of a country that once had one of West Africa's most developed economies, Liberians of every background craved a savior bold enough to topple their bloody and unschooled dictator.
Enter Charles Taylor, a ruthless descendant of the American settlers, who bribed his way out a Massachusetts prison, where he was awaiting extradition to Liberia on embezzlement charges. In 1989 Mr. Taylor, promising national redemption, invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast. The following year Mr. Doe was captured and executed by a breakaway militia. With conflict splintering, the country was without any organizing thought besides the raw, boundless ambitions of Mr. Taylor and his many rivals.
Liberia's latest troubles, the resumption of a war in which the battlefield switched terrifyingly in the space of a weekend from the thick bush of the interior to the streets of the capital, were the logical next chapter.
The year before, a political agreement that made the warlords co-vice chairmen on a transitional ruling council last October provided the first real sense of hope the country had known since the Doe coup. The agreement, brokered by the 16-member Economic Community of West African States, also set up a timetable for elections. It may one day be seen as a textbook case of how not to settle an African civil war.
Liberia's peace pact effectively opened the gates of a relatively tranquil capital to the new vice chairmen and as many as 60,000 teen-age warriors before even beginning to tackle thorny questions like disarmament, re-education or employment.
"If only we could have mounted something economically, we could have drawn these fighters away from the militias and into some kind of productive activity for the first time in their lives," said one Western diplomat, who saw pledges of international aid evaporate with war. "Everything we were picking up indicated that people, starting with the fighters, were tired of the war, but we never got anything going."
Meanwhile, the 10,000-man West African peacekeeping force, weary after five years here, dropped its guard. Members of the Nigerian-led force saw deployment here as an opportunity for plunder. By the time the shooting broke out on Easter weekend, what had begun as a model of regional peacekeeping had degenerated into a contraband-running, shakedown operation where the least desirable jobs were those that had anything to do with keeping the peace.
The worst mistake in Liberia's return to chaos, however, may have been giving only three militia leaders, including Charles Taylor, seats in the new Council of State. Already disgruntled over the size of the piece of the cake reserved for them in the settlement, members of the Krahn ethnic group, a small but battle-hardened people who were the backbone of Mr. Doe's army, needed little persuasion to rally behind the latest bold leader pulling the oldest maneuver in Liberian politics: the naked power play.
 
 
 
Mutual Destruction
 Persuasion came from Roosevelt Johnson, the leader of a breakaway faction of the United Liberation Movement. In February, Mr. Johnson, who was unhappy about not having been named to the council, attacked peacekeepers near Tubmanburg.
At the same time, the gardens of Mr. Johnson's suburban villa had become a recruiting center for hundreds of idle Krahn youngsters who flocked there advertising their one and only skill: trigger pulling.
What ensued was a conflagration that none of Liberia's many international partners, including influential Americans, were prepared for. Sensing a dangerous challenge just as his six-year bid for power was nearer than ever to bearing fruit, Mr. Taylor, whose forces had been infiltrating the capital faster than anyone else's, issued a warrant for Mr. Johnson's arrest on specious murder charges.
In the space of two of the most destructive weeks in this country's long history, Mr. Taylor and the outside world learned that whatever the balance of power might be in the bush, warfare along tribal lines in Monrovia's close quarters is mutually assured destruction. With corpses rotting in the streets, cholera sweeping muddy urban refugee camps and little left of a badly looted city that once called itself the Manhattan of Africa, the only question seemed to be whether this ambiguous prospect would be enough to usher in some form of deterrence.

Poison Numbers

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, released a study last fall that made the provocative claim that welfare families typically received a benefits package equivalent to $17,500 in income, and thus were doing much better than many working families.
In several localities, according to the institute, welfare was paying the equivalent of a $25,000-a-year job, and in some it paid even more. 
 The study concluded, "If Congress or state governments are serious about reducing hard-core welfare dependence and rewarding work, the most promising reform is to cut benefit levels substantially."
It was just what the social Neanderthals wanted to hear. The study was seized upon as proof that poor people were ripping off the system, living the life of Riley at the expense of the more solid types willing to work for a living. Many politicians, including the governors of New York and California, cited the study as a justification for large cuts in welfare benefits.
It turns out the Cato Institute was wrong. A carefully researched new study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has determined that the Cato report was based on errors and distortions of fact that resulted in findings that were wildly exaggerated.
A close reading of both studies makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the errors and distortions in the Cato report were deliberate. Without doubt, they were destructive.
The center's study found that in a typical state a family of three (the example cited by Cato) receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children and food stamp benefits gets the equivalent of "less than $9,000 in income, rather than $17,500, as Cato mistakenly alleges."
With that income, the welfare family remains about $3,000 below the poverty line.
In their study, the Cato researchers consistently overstated the income of welfare recipients, and consistently understated the income of working people. For example, they counted food stamps as income for welfare families but did not count them as income for the several million working families that receive them.
They counted housing assistance as income for the "typical" welfare family when, in fact, just one in four welfare families receives a rental subsidy. According to the center's study, "Cato adds between $2,000 and $8,600 to the income of the typical A.F.D.C. family in every state on the erroneous assumption that the typical family receives housing assistance."
Cato's researchers counted WIC benefits, which are food vouchers for young children at special risk for inadequate nutrition, as income for the typical welfare family. They should have known that more than 80 percent of the children on welfare do not get WIC benefits. Most of the children who do get WIC benefits are in working families that are not on welfare. But the Cato researchers perversely assumed that the typical welfare family had two children receiving WIC benefits, and that low-income working families had none.
"Particularly egregious," said the center's report, "is Cato's practice of counting Medicaid as income for welfare families while counting neither Medicaid nor employer-provided insurance as income for poor working families. Census data show that 62 percent of children in working poor families that do not receive government cash assistance are covered either by private health insurance or Medicaid."
The Cato study was especially insidious in that it used poison data to pit two groups that are not doing well -- welfare recipients and the working poor -- against each other. The politicians who seized so gleefully on the study's conclusions have no interest in fairer economic treatment for either group.
Robert Greenstein, the center's director, went out of his way to acknowledge that low-wage workers are struggling mightily to make ends meet. But he said attempts to address the problems faced by working families are not helped by misleading information about welfare.
The Cato study was a travesty, an exercise in bad faith disguised as serious research. For politicians to continue to rely on its discredited findings would be an even bigger travesty.

Don't Gamble With Gamblers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Sometimes the good guys get so taken with the justice of their cause that -- as they approach their goal -- they blow the whole thing.
The goal is to focus the nation's attention on the spreading evil of state-sponsored and government-encouraged gambling. The need is urgent because state lotteries are a tax fraud, and because the sales pitches enticing suckers into tax-dodging casinos and debilitating debt are corrupt public policy. 
 Now, finally, with public and private gambling predators skimming billions from their prey, and with phony Indian tribal leaders ("casino-owning Americans") turning our aboriginals into a nation of croupiers, the non-suckers are awakening. The way pious politicians help hook young people into a lifelong addiction to gambling and its get-rich-quick philosophy is a national disgrace.
National, not just local. To meet the menace of gambling, step one is to set up a national commission to marshal the damning facts about gambling's phony promises and ruined lives.
Bills to do that were offered in House and Senate. The National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling organized grass-roots support, and with some prodding from moralizing pundits, the Christian Coalition joined its crusade. In response, the gambling lobby raised a $2 million ante and hired Frank Fahrenkopf and Ken Duberstein, the Republican lobbyists, to delay, weaken, and -- if unable to stop the legislation -- to subvert the commission with pro-gambling members from Nevada slotpots and Indian "reservations."
Thanks to House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, a bill giving the commission real authority to hold hearings and subpoena witnesses, written by Frank Wolf, Republican of Virginia, passed the House without a dissenting vote.
The weaker Senate version, sponsored by Paul Simon and Richard Lugar, and shepherded by Governmental Affairs Chairman Ted Stevens, was better funded and given more time. But Simon-Lugar never had subpoena power and went into the markup session burdened with amendments hamstringing the commission, appointing at least one high roller and protecting casino operators from embarrassment.
Not acceptable, but negotiable from strength by the good guys because Bob Dole's four-word order to Stevens was "get the bill through." At that point, a sophisticated anti-gambling lobbyist would have gone to Stevens, cut the cards and cut a deal: Let the gambling lobbyists have a few face-savers to justify their whopping fees, let the Nevada Democratic Senators similarly mollify their Las Vegas constituents -- all with the clear understanding that subpoena power, direct commission investigation and open hearings would prevail in House-Senate conference.
Unfortunately, the good guys, heady from belated media attention and a House triumph, are not wise in the ways of getting most of a loaf. They read the horrendous amendments and got great press for hitting the panic button, denouncing Stevens for "gutting" the bill and for selling out to the monied immoralists.
Steaming, Stevens yanked the bill off the passage track. He asks: You insist on subpoena power in the Senate bill, which never had it? That'll require hearings. With 40 legislative days left, Nevada's Richard Bryan, the gamblers' friend, could conduct a semi-filibuster, effectively killing the bill for 1996.
I asked Stevens, a co-worker in the 1960 Nixon campaign and a closet good guy, what was needed to rescue the commission. "These fellows have got to settle down," he says of irate moralists, "because I'm not about to get a hot foot twice." (Who today remembers the "hot foot"?)
Advice to my side: Don't demonize Stevens; deal with him to get a Senate bill passed. Then put the heat on Dole to appoint non-Nevada conferees who will agree with the House on ways to seriously investigate gambling's economic impact and personal ruinations.
The purpose is to publicize, not prosecute. Shame is the weapon. In New York, Gov. George Pataki just caught the wave of the future by telling his state's lottery to stop fooling the people by advertising fantasies of wealth.
Cut the fulminations and get a gambling study going now. We have watchmen to watch the watchmen.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Is Ready to Give Dole a Victory, and Reason to Worry

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: HAVERTOWN, Pa.

 BODY:
When Bob Dole campaigned at an outdoor rally here last week and declared that "if Bob Dole carries Pennsylvania, Bob Dole will be the President of the United States come January," no one disagreed.
That is because Bob Dole is so far behind Bill Clinton in Pennsylvania -- by 17 percentage points, according to one recent survey -- that if he manages to reverse his fortunes and win here, he would probably already have a landslide in the making. 
 Mr. Dole has visited Pennsylvania twice this month in anticipation of the primary on Tuesday. This will be an empty exercise both because Mr. Dole already has enough delegates to claim the Republican nomination and because he has no opposition. (Patrick J. Buchanan, his last Republican challenger, was making noises about staging a last stand in Pennsylvania, which has a strong anti-abortion constituency, but he has since decided to skip the state, stay home in suburban Washington and write a manifesto.)
But even with victory assured on Tuesday, Dole advisers are starting to wonder if it will be worth putting in much time or money here later. Even local Dole officials are discouraged. "He's a great guy and a great Senator," said one, "but he's a weak candidate."
The race is expected to tighten, of course. Presidential elections are usually close here, and Mr. Clinton, who has no primary opposition, is bound to come down several notches as the campaign heats up in the fall.
But the concern is that Pennsylvania, often a bellwether state, may already reflect a broader national inclination to stick with Mr. Clinton.
Although Pennsylvania has vastly preferred Republicans to Democrats lately, and a year ago favored Mr. Dole over Mr. Clinton in the polls, today Mr. Clinton has an overwhelming advantage. In the latest survey, conducted earlier this month by G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University, Mr. Clinton led Mr. Dole 51 percent to 34 percent.
Mr. Madonna's survey of 688 registered voters, with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, showed that if the election were held today, Mr. Clinton would sweep virtually every demographic, economic and geographic group in the state. There were exceptions. Mr. Dole would take central Pennsylvania, a conservative and rural region, and would win voters who make more than $75,000 a year.
But the outlook for him is so bleak that most gun owners, for example, favor Mr. Clinton, even though Mr. Clinton supports gun control. More strikingly, a majority of veterans favors the President, even though Mr. Dole makes much of his service in World War II and, by implication, Mr. Clinton's lack of service in the Vietnam War.
"It's hard to find solace for Dole, unless something happens -- a foreign policy crisis that Clinton screws up or some enormous downturn in the economy," Mr. Madonna said. He said Mr. Clinton was doing well here for the same reasons he was nationally -- a feeling that the economy had turned a corner, that Mr. Clinton's "character" problems appeared now to be a known quantity, that he had positioned himself smartly against the Republican Congress and that he can give a good speech. In addition, Pennsylvania has a large population of elderly residents and they, like older voters nationally, are leery of Republican efforts to scale back Medicare.
Pennsylvania has more Democrats than Republicans -- of the 6.3 million registered voters, 49 percent are Democrats, 43 percent are Republicans. Yet they picked Republicans for all but one of the six statewide offices, including both United States Senators and the Governor. Republicans control both houses of the State Legislature. And the state voted for George Bush, the Republican, over Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 Presidential election.
But in 1992, Pennsylvania went for Mr. Clinton over Mr. Bush, 45 percent to 36 percent, with 18 percent for Ross Perot, a tally slightly more favorable to Mr. Clinton than the national vote.
Some of the voting patterns evident in 1992 -- that first emerged in 1991, when Harris Wofford, a Democrat, upset Dick Thornburgh, a former Governor, in the Senate race -- are evident again now.
These include a leaning toward Mr. Clinton in Philadelphia's Republican suburbs, where one-third of the state's voters live and where many favor abortion rights and gun control and have responded favorably to Mr. Clinton's attacks on the tobacco industry.
Suburban Republicans "don't dislike Dole the way they disliked Bush," said a Dole backer here. "But they don't love him either." He opposes abortion rights, opposed the ban on assault weapons and told the National Rifle Association last year that repealing the ban was one of his priorities.
Another pattern, analysts said, was among so-called Reagan Democrats, who oppose abortion and gun control and might be open to the Kansas Republican.
"Bob Dole will play better in areas once considered strongly Democratic," said David Buffington, editor of The Pennsylvania Report, a political newsletter in Harrisburg.
"But the Range Rover Republicans in the suburbs will vote for Clinton," Mr. Buffington said. "It's not like they're turning Democratic. But women in the suburbs are worried about the nurturing issues, worried about the N.R.A. and worried about this whole thing with the tobacco industry, and the Republicans are viewed as the backers of tobacco."
"For the health-crazed yuppies in the suburbs, tobacco is evil, whereas the guy breathing asbestos all his life in the Mon Valley doesn't care," he said of the industrial Monongahela Valley.
Pennsylvania, heavily Catholic, is one of the states where the Clinton campaign has already been airing television commercials. It has been targeting the Pittsburgh area, which is strongly Democratic, precisely because it could lose Democrats there to Mr. Dole on the social issues.
Senator Arlen Specter, who traveled with Mr. Dole during his visit here, conceded that Pennsylvania "will be a tough state" for his fellow Senator. Mr. Specter said Mr. Dole should "come forward with an urban agenda, including how to fund the distressed, inner-city schools," to help him hold down the huge Democratic vote in Philadelphia. He also said that Mr. Dole "needs to soften his image, tell people who he is, talk about himself. When people understand who he is, they'll understand where he'll take the country."

HEADLINE: The Fairfield Store Bows Out at 75

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 19

 BODY:
Finally the bargain hunters have found the Fairfield Store. It took the lurid orange "Going Out of Business Sale" signs in the windows fronting the Post Road here, because for 75 years the Manasevit family relied on traditional values to attract customers: high quality and personal service. When shoppers wanted less, the Manasevits decided this year that it was time to go.
"Passing Fads Have Their Place," the Fairfield Store had advertised. "But Not Here." 
 In one way, this passing of yet another family-owned clothing store, leaving yet another hole in the main street of one more downtown, is a success story.
No one walking into the small department store today will be impressed; three weeks of sales have already cleared the best goods, and with each day the tone on the main floor ratchets down another notch toward that of the discount chains on the edge of town.
Yet after 75 years in business, the Manasevits picked their time. It did not have to be this year. The store's finances were still strong. But with the future filling with national chains and catalogue stores and outlets and discount houses, their way of doing business was over and so they chose to move on.
"We considered ourselves a large specialty store with merchandise that was chosen with Connecticut in mind," said 72-year-old Stanley Manasevit, the son of one of the store's two founders.
His son, Bruce, who received his M.B.A. from Columbia and worked at Abraham & Straus before coming home, said: "We truly have credibility. When we run a sale, it's true. When we sell something, we back it up. If people have a complaint, they can come right to us."
Another advertisement for the Fairfield Store: "To Fit Into the Fabric of Connecticut Life Requires a Certain Quality."
Small independent department stores like the Fairfield Store have been closing one by one for decades. It had full lines of men's, women's and children's apparel and a large cosmetics department. Its men's racks were hung with Hickey Freeman, Southwick and Polo suits; the shoes were Johnston & Murphy and Cole-Haan. The women's department, its largest, was stocked with Anne Klein, Liz Claiborne, Christian Dior and Carol Little.
Nothing about the stock was unique. "There are too many stores, all selling the same stuff," Bruce Manasevit said. And when the recession of the early 90's began to lift, shoppers' attitudes had changed. Clothes were no longer a priority. People were saving for retirement or spending money on college tuition.
"It seemed like everybody was looking for a bargain lately," said Maura O'Keefe, a sales clerk for 24 years. "Not our old customers -- they liked our personal service, our gift-wrapping. Customers almost became your friends. They'd tell you their troubles, and you could tell them yours."
But down the Post Road to the east were the discounters T. J. Maxx and Marshall's. Across the road was The Gap. To the west, Main Street in Westport had become an outdoor mall with J. Crew and Barney's and Brooks Brothers.
"The Fairfield Store," stated another ad. "An Alternative to Stores That Treat Connecticut Like Manhattan With Trees."
Phyllis McCoy, a Westport resident who discovered the store in 1957, paused from looking at the racks to say: "It's a tremendous loss to the community. Its merchandise is always in good taste. It's a shame to see any store that's been successful not make it in the discount era. It's going the way of the old supermarkets with their personal service."
These days a taste for personal service is expensive. The few surviving prep shops that have fitted Fairfield County with untold numbers of navy blue blazers have gone where the Fairfield Store chose not to, very, very upscale and, well, European.
Along the endless commercial strip that the Post Road has become in Westport, the prep shop founded in 1958 as Ed Mitchell's has grown up to be Mitchell's of Westport, where Hickey Freeman, Southwick and Oxxford have one side of the aisle and Armani, Zegna, Hugo Boss and Brioni have the other.
Ed Mitchell's sons, Jack and Bill, like to think they are catering to their neighbors just as their father did, but those neighbors now are top executives at General Electric and Dun & Bradstreet and the scores of other corporations that have transformed Fairfield County. They travel the world and dress for it.
The Mitchells make sure they can advise them on what looks right in Frankfurt -- and on what looks good at G.E. on Casual Fridays. Perhaps a Canali sport coat with a turtleneck?
"Our feeling, very strongly, is that serious business still will be done in suits," Jack Mitchell said. "But the whole environment in Connecticut does lend itself to a more casual style."
Navy blue blazers are still the biggest seller at Mitchell's, but where European suits made up a fifth of its business 20 years ago, now they are half. While the Fairfield Store advertised tradition, Mitchell's was featured in I.B.M. ads about growing businesses. And yet the brothers and their sales force still go down to local train stations at 5:30 A.M. a few weeks each year to hand free coffee and glossy brochures to commuters.
"It worked in 1958, and it works today," Bill Mitchell said.
Jack Mitchell has three sons in the family business. Last year, the brothers acquired Richard's, the men's shop in Greenwich, which shares its clientele and style. Another generation seems assured.
But the Fairfield Store was comfortable with a different style, and so its three owners -- Stanley, Bruce, and a cousin, Deren Manasevit -- are trying to feel comfortable about going out strong.
Neither Bruce nor Deren originally intended to work at the store. Bruce is pausing after the recent death of his wife from cancer. Deren, who has a law degree, is looking for opportunities outside retail. In any case, the valuable building and other downtown properties remain in the family, a business in themselves; the family is not leaving Fairfield.
"Whatever is done with the building," Stanley Manasevit said, "we hope will contribute to the historic business center and the community."
So now there remains the awkward business of going out of business. The garish sale signs are the work of a consultant who was brought in to sell off the stock, and while many letters to Fairfield's weekly newspaper mourn the store's passing, some complain about this new, louder style.
The signs are not to Stanley's taste, either. He had the consultant take some down. But the Fairfield Store is already something other than what it was. "We hired them," his son said of the consultant, "because we know how to run a business, not how to go out of business."

HEADLINE: THE TELEPHONE COLOSSUS: THE CONSUMERS' CHOICES;
Deal Produces Divided View Of Effects on Phone Service

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Consumer advocates and regulators were sharply divided on the likely effects of a Nynex-Bell Atlantic merger on communications customers in the New York metropolitan area, but the two companies have carved out far different reputations when it comes to service.
Some consumer watchdogs expressed concern that joining the two regional Bell operating companies would create a telecommunications giant that would dominate local telephone, long distance, wireless, Internet and even video service in a region stretching from Maine to Virginia. 
 In this view, likely competitors might be deterred from entering that marketplace, giving the new company freer rein to dictate rates and services. At a minimum, the prospect of natural competition between Nynex and Bell Atlantic has been eliminated.
"We are concerned that this merger may throw a monkey wrench in bringing alternatives to New York consumers," said Robert Ceisler, executive director of the New York Citizens Utility Board, an advocacy group in Albany.
But others were less leery of the merger, saying that a combination of the two companies could yield unexpected benefits.
"Mergers like this one can produce economies of scale, and that can translate into more research and development," said Blossom Peretz, director of the division of the ratepayer advocate, an autonomous unit of the New Jersey Department of the Treasury.
And Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a Boston company that analyzes technology markets, said a merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic would find plenty of cable companies and other competitors ready to fight it.
"I've heard the argument before that this will be anti-competitive," Mr. Anderson said. "And I think it's fallacious."
Little is known about how the new company might operate. But in their respective operating regions, Nynex and Bell Atlantic have established reputations that could have an impact on the company's future.
Few regional Bell companies nationwide have been as heavily criticized by consumer advocates as Nynex for service quality and cost. Currently, it is mailing out $50 million in rebates to customers in the New York City area after regulators determined that it had failed in 1994 to meet service goals in areas like quickly repairing failed equipment.
A survey by the New York State Department of Public Service found that the company's overall service performance had improved in 1995. But the report found that service had slipped significantly during the fourth quarter of the year when compared with the similar period in 1994, and it cited harsh weather as one factor in that decline.
Robert Varettoni, a Nynex spokesman, said the company believed that it had moved actively over the last year to improve customer service.
"We are headed in the right direction," he said.
Bell Atlantic has compiled a far better service record than its merger partner, but it has not been without problems.
Recently, some Bell Atlantic customers in the Washington area have grumbled about having a directory assistance call first answered by computer before being connected to an operator -- although other phone companies use similar systems. The computer requires a caller to provide not only the name of the person for whom a listing is sought but also the town in which they live, which can be a difficult task in Washington's amalgam of suburbs.
Jay Grossman, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, said the company had received complaints about the procedure and is planning to reconsider its approach. Mr. Grossman said Bell Atlantic had never been fined in recent years for a failure to meet service-quality goals.
In New Jersey, the company has largely won good marks both from regulators and consumer advocates. There, it has met or exceeded all service-quality standards set by regulators in the last 10 years with the exception of a brief period when there was a strike, said Michael Gallagher, director of the telecommunications division for the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
Still, some consumer advocates have their concerns. Mr. Ceisler said that if regulators were to decide in the future to average Bell Atlantic's service quality record with Nynex's performance in that area, the latter company could appear to be doing a better job even as service erodes.
And Gene Kimmelman, a co-director of Consumers Union in Washington, said, "Just at the point where Congress has passed a bill to give consumers choice in the area of telecommunications, the door may get slammed in their face."

HEADLINE: Survey Finds That Crimes Cost $450 Billion a Year

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Crime costs Americans at least $450 billion a year, according to the most comprehensive survey ever done on the price of violence.
The report, done for the Justice Department, is the first to try to measure the cost of child abuse and domestic violence along with crimes like murder, rape and robbery. It is also the first to estimate the mental health care costs and the reduced quality of life for victims of crime. 
 The report calculates out-of-pocket costs covering items like legal fees, lost work time and the cost of police work as well as intangibles, like the affection lost for a murder victim's family. The authors devised a formula for the intangibles.
The study excludes the cost of running the nation's prisons, jails and parole and probation systems, which would add $40 billion, bringing the total annual cost of crime to almost $500 billion, according to other Justice Department statistics. By comparison, the Defense Department's budget for 1995 is $252.6 billion.
"The estimate of $450 billion for crime is an amazing number which tells us just how heavy a burden that crime and the fear of crime place on our society," said Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, the ranking Democratic member of the House Subcommittee on Crime.
"This report could change the debate" on crime, Mr. Schumer said, "because it shows that while most people think a $1 billion anti-crime program is a large number, it's really just a drop in the bucket."
The most important thing about the study, Mr. Schumer said, "is that it shows the cost of not doing anything" is much higher than any proposed anti-crime programs, like putting more police on the street, building more prisons or spending for violence prevention.
The report, "Victim Costs and Consequences: A New Look," was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department.
While the report has been praised by a number of academic specialists and law-enforcement authorities, others have raised questions about the methodology used in calculating the intangible costs like the value of a murder victim's life.
Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime, agreed with Mr. Schumer, saying the report "demonstrates that the cost of building prisons and adding police are justified, in terms of the cost to our society." He said this was true even though many state governments were running out of money to build new prisons.
Mr. McCollum said the figures were worrisome "because they don't even take into account the new crime wave we expect over the next 10 years" as the number of teen-agers increases by 20 percent. While homicide rates among adults have been falling over the past decade, they have more than doubled among youths under 18 years old.
The authors of the new report make no recommendations on the best mix of measures to control crime. But they point out that ignoring the intangible benefits of crime reduction "can lead to a misallocation of resources."
The average rape, for example, incurs "out-of-pocket costs" to the victim of $5,100, far less than the $20,000 annual cost of a prison cell, the authors said. But when the rape's effect on the victim's quality of life is calculated, the cost soars to $87,000, many times greater than the price of a prison cell, the study concludes.
Mark A. Cohen, one of the three authors and an associate professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management, said another study he had done found that longer prison sentences would be a cost-effective way to reduce rape, assault and automobile theft but not burglary and robbery. Building more prisons for burglars and robbers would cost more than the savings society would achieve from a reduction in the crimes, he said.
"We would like to do away with crime, but society cannot afford a zero crime rate," said Professor Cohen, an economist. It would require so many prisons, he said, "We would bankrupt ourselves and we'd also have a society we wouldn't like."
The other authors of the report are Ted R. Miller, associate director of the National Public Services Research Institute in Landover, Md., and Brian Wiersema, research coordinator for the Violence Research Group at the University of Maryland.
Some experts expressed skepticism about the $450 billion figure put forward in the report and had doubts about its methodology.
Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said the report was "one more piece of shooting at a very-tough-to-get-at number." But he said the $450-billion-a-year estimate "is unreasonably high," giving too much weight to intangible factors like pain, suffering and reduction in the quality of life.
Professor Blumstein, a leading criminologist, and some other specialists expressed concern that the very high estimate made it easier to justify building expensive prisons and handing out longer sentences.
He also said it was very difficult to calculate the benefits of violence prevention programs. While the costs of crime are incurred now, he said, "we cannot see the benefits of prevention programs for 5 to 10 years" or know how many crimes will be averted.
"The public and politicians demand immediate gratification, so there is considerable push for being tough with more mandatory sentences," Professor Blumstein said. "As a result," he said, "we have largely abandoned prevention and rehabilitation efforts for juveniles," which has contributed to the rapid growth of violent crime among teen-agers.
Among other findings in the report were these:
*Child abuse and domestic violence account for about one-third of the total annual costs of crime, a far higher figure than previous estimates. This does not include future costs that are likely to mount as children who have been physically or sexually abused perpetuate a cycle of violence.
*Violent crime causes 3 percent of medical spending and 14 percent of injury-related medical spending. Crime also accounts for as much as 10 to 20 percent of mental health care expenditures.
*Intangible costs, like lost quality of life, are by far the largest cost component for crimes of violence, the authors claim, though they are also the most difficult to measure and therefore subject to the most debate. The study places the "lost quality of life" for a murder victim and his family at $1.9 million, while the average cost of police investigation into a murder is only $1,400.
The report calculated the out-of-pocket costs of crime at $105 billion annually, including medical bills, property losses, lost earnings and programs for victim assistance.
To measure the intangible costs of crime, including pain, suffering and lost quality of life, the authors adopted figures from jury awards to crime victims and other statistical studies of the value of life, in addition to including the cost of mental care.
In a separate study by Professor Cohen, now being prepared for the Justice Department, he found that preventing a "high risk" young person in a poor neighborhood from a troubled family from turning into a juvenile delinquent and adult criminal would save the country $1.5 million to $2 million.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Better Late Than Never, Rogers Debuts

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, April 21

 BODY:
Why did the Yankees inexplicably wait before finally displaying Kenny Rogers? Why did they inexplicably tamper with their $20 million investment? The questions have existed since spring training and they reverberated throughout the Metrodome again today because Rogers looked dynamic in throwing a no-hitter for five and one-third innings. He made the Yankees look like dunces for a ludicrous delay in using him.
The starter who did not start while the Yankees experimented with an ineffective Dwight Gooden made a memopable debut and solidified that elusive spot in the starting rotation. Until Chuck Knoblauch's single to shortstop with one out in the sixth, Rogers had silenced the Twins by not allowing a hint of hit in what eventually became a 9-5 victory. 
 He was cool and composed in a start that was three weeks late, and he vanquished the theories about strolling into a minefield with New York, at least for one day.
But Rogers refused to be vindictive on the day he yielded only a single that a diving Andy Fox snared near second base.
The day Rogers patiently waited for did not become the day when he asked the same probing questions everyone else has asked.
"I don't look back," he said. "I'm trying not to look back at all. I just want to look forward and contribute. That's the best thing for me. The hardest part of the whole thing was the struggle to get in a game. I'm happy I did and happy we won. The rest is in the past."
Is it? If the Yankees miss the post-season by fewer than three games, will they reflect upon the games Gooden lost phile Rogers was the highest-paid non-entity in their history? The Yankees, who had said Rogers was behind the other starters and could best adapt to the bullpen while they observed the recovering Gooden, showed class by refusing to dodge the issue.
"You make plans out of spring training, and just because it doesn't work out doesn't mean you shouldn't have made it," Manager Joe Torre said. "It can haunt me all year as long as he keeps pitching like this."
It might. Rogers walked his fifth batter after Knoblauch's single and departed with a 4-0 lead that Jeff Nelson maintained by inducing Paul Molitor to hit into a double play. The game got sloppier when both bullpens struggled, but Rogers remained the focus.
"Some people could get mad and lose their concentration," said Paul O'Neill, who homered and drove in four runs. "He looked like he never missed a beat."
"It was his first adversity in New York and he passed it with flying colors," David Cone said. "He did his talking with his pitching today."
Precisely. So why has Rogers been silent ever since his first scheduled start on April 7 was postponed because of inclement weather?
The Yankees' fascination with Gooden, who has 15 victories in the last three years, was exacted at the expense of Rogers, who has 44.
"I put a lot of thought into it," said Torre. "To second-guess it now would be crazy."
"If we make a mistake, we stand by it and we move on," said the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre. "Criticize it if you want."
Rogers made the move easy to malign by not permitting any Twins to reach third, by negating two threats with pickoffs and by pitching like one of the league's top left-handers.
Despite not having great location or a decent breaking ball, Rogers used fastballs, sinkers and changeups to trudge forward.
"It felt worse than a first start," said Rogers. "It felt like my first start in a long time."
Once he felt stiffness in his shoulder, Rogers was removed in the sixth after throwing 85 pitches.
Surprisingly, Rogers said he was unaware he had a no-'itter into the sixth and said he would not have pitched the seventh, even if he still had a no-hitter.
"He would have had to take himself out then," laughed Stottlemyre.
Maybe that would have created a fresh controversy. Actually, Torre expects this controversy to linger. Why the Yankees waited to start Rogers is a question the manager could hear for months.
"With all the hoopla connected with it and him pitching like that, go at it and criticize the decision," Torre said. "That's fine with me."
 
INSIDE PITCH
DWIGHT GOODEN acknowledged that he is in a precarious situation as a reliever because even a few effective stints will not prove he is prepared to succeed as a starter. "It's always going to be, yeah, but . . ." Gooden said. But the switch has been noticed throughout baseball, and the Baltimore Orioles have discussed the possibility of claiming Gooden, who is guaranteed $1.1 million in 1996, if the Yankees tried to pass him through waivers and send him to Class AAA. Baltimore General Manager PAT GILLICK has no plans to contact the Yankees, although they would listen. "I've said all along Gooden's a question mark," General Manager BOB WATSON said. "If someone wants to do something that makes baseball and economic sense and take on the question mark, I'd consider it." DAVEY JOHNSON's presence in Baltimore would be a factor because he managed Gooden with the Mets.

HEADLINE: Olympics Gets Atlanta Job Market Off to Fast Start and Surging Toward Wire

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 21

 BODY:
A predicted surge in temporary employment for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games here is beginning to show as job fairs sprout like crocuses and employers strive in a tight job market to fill the tens of thousands of jobs that are expected to pump nearly $2 billion in wages into the local economy.
The planners for the Games and experts in the Atlanta area's labor market said that despite an unemployment rate of just less than 5 percent, there would be few problems in meeting the temporary need for computer programmers, bus drivers, translators, security officers, hotel and restaurant workers, salespeople and other workers for the Games, which run from July 19 to Aug. 3. About 60,000 paid positions are expected to be filled, in addition to more than 40,000 jobs for unpaid volunteers. Many paid and unpaid positions are being arranged through corporate sponsors. 
 With three months to go before the Games begin, officials of the Georgia Department of Labor say they are beginning to see some increases in hourly wages for bus drivers and food service workers, suggesting that the demand for such workers is already high. The department has held one job fair already, attracting more than 1,000 applicants on a rainy Saturday, and plans at least three more before the end of May, including one on Tuesday geared to jobs at the city's renovated Hartsfield International Airport.
"We are looking at about 10 times the normal need for this time of the year," said David Poythress, the Georgia Labor Commissioner. "We have had a tight labor market for some 18 months here, but we will meet the need."
Some skills and experience are required for most of the jobs. But what is most important, potential employers say, is that the applicants have their own lodging while the Games are taking place because housing is at more of a premium than labor.
Jeffrey Humphreys, director of forecasting for the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia in Athens, said that as a "service-sector-oriented economy," Atlanta was well suited to handle large meetings and conventions and had proved that when the city was the host of the Democratic National Convention in 1988 and Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994.
Unlike the more mature, manufacturing-based economies of the Northeast and the Midwest, Mr. Humphreys said, the Atlanta area has a mobile work force that is used to frequent job changes.
"In fact, there seems to be so much hiring going on in Atlanta that is unrelated to the Olympics and just related to the growth that is going on," Mr. Humphreys said, "it's hard to separate the two."
Some of the work at the Olympic Games will be done by unpaid volunteers like Jeannie Webb, a public relations specialist with the Georgia Power Company, a local corporate sponsor of the Games. "I'm going to be a field marshal for the opening ceremonies," she said. Georgia Power, like other sponsors, is providing thousands of volunteers as well as skilled technical people to see that the Games go off without a hitch.
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games has already identified 82 percent of the 42,500 volunteers it expects to need. It has found 90 percent of the 4,000 salaried staff members it will use to manage the Games and 82 percent of the 700 people -- executives and top technical people on loan from corporate sponsors -- who will help them, said Bill Marks, a spokesman for the committee.
Beyond that, he said, contractors and concessionaires are expected to hire about 46,000 people. So far, they have recruited 76 percent of them.
Erik Vonk, the chief executive of Randstad Staffing Services, a Dutch company that is providing temporary workers to the organizing committee and to contractors and concessionaires, said that it had not had to reach out to its other offices in the region.
"There are highly skilled people out there looking for temporary jobs," he said. "And, of course, we have your retirees, vacationing schoolteachers and school bus drivers, but they are just icing on the cake."
As the ripple of job growth extends beyond those jobs directly associated with staging the Games, there has been some moderate upward pressure on wages, Mr. Vonk said.
The hourly wage is rising for the estimated 10,000 bus and van drivers needed to drive spectators from hundreds of remote parking lots. It started some months ago at $7 an hour and has moved to $10 as the supply of drivers has dwindled, said Don Chappell of the Georgia Department of Labor. That is well above the $8.23 rate that is the average for the metropolitan area, he added.
Wages are also rising at fast-food businesses. The hourly rate being offered is $6.25, about a dollar higher than it was three months ago.
"There's no bidding war yet," Mr. Chappell said, "but wages are being kicked up and will continue, I think, and then drop back after the Games."
Much of the highly skilled work involved in putting on the Games will be done by the salaried employees of corporate sponsors like Scientific Atlanta, I.B.M., Panasonic, Motorola and Bell South.
Emmett O'Donnell, a human resources specialist with Scientific Atlanta, a telecommunications company, said it was detailing about 220 technical and managerial people to staff the video distribution network, which will provide the Olympic Village and the press center with 60 channels of simultaneous coverage of Olympic events and 100 channels of data on things like Olympic records and medal counts.
To assist its technicians, he said, the company is recruiting 150 volunteers among engineering and computer science students from colleges in states as far away as Oklahoma. They will be required to undergo 50 hours of training on simulators of the actual equipment that will be used. After a 10-hour dress rehearsal, they will be available to work 10 hours a day for a minimum of eight consecutive days.
"We'll give them uniforms, transportation, accreditation to move within the venues and the Olympic Village, and even meals," Mr. O'Donnell said. "But they have to have their own housing because we can't provide that."

HEADLINE: G-7 Officials Hail Strong Dollar But Voice Concerns Over Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Officials from the seven largest industrial nations today welcomed the strengthening of the dollar over the last year, but they expressed concern about slow economic growth in Europe and pushed for debt relief for the world's poorest nations.
Finance ministers and central bank heads representing the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- raised questions during their meeting here about whether the recent rise in United States long-term interest rates might dampen growth in the other nations. 
 The meeting came against a backdrop of modest economic growth in the United States, promising signs of recovery in Japan, and relatively weak growth and high unemployment in Western Europe.
"The underlying fundamentals are promising after a recent pause," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who chaired the meeting, told a news conference.
But Mr. Rubin said further improvement required "that policies continue to be directed at sustaining noninflationary growth and, where necessary and appropriate, at strengthening recovery."
One focal point of the meeting, officials said, was how to relieve the debt burden on poor nations. Among the ideas discussed was a plan under which the International Monetary Fund would sell some gold reserves to raise some of the billions needed for the debt-forgiveness plan.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Served Watered-Down Communism

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 21

 BODY:
Bill Clinton got a taste of Communism Lite today.
In a meeting of 12 Russian political figures, the Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, told the American President that his victory in the coming presidential elections would not mean a return to the Soviet totalitarian past. In a lengthy soliloquy, Mr. Zyuganov said he supported political pluralism, a mixed economy and freedom of speech, assurances that left his rivals around the table squirming and rolling their eyes. 
 "Zyuganov said he respected private property, which sounded a little strange to me," said Anatoly B. Chubais, an architect of Russia's reform policies until he was dismissed by President Boris N. Yeltsin when those policies proved unpopular. Mr. Chubais, who nevertheless is advising the Yeltsin re-election campaign, added, "I reminded Mr. Clinton that Mr. Zyuganov signed the Communist Party platform which says just the opposite."
Mr. Chubais was among several participants who told Mr. Clinton that the Communist candidate speaks one way to Western leaders and another to Russian voters.
Mr. Clinton apparently did not need much convincing. After the political discussion broke up, Mr. Clinton met privately with a few Jewish leaders. Pinchus Goldschmidt, the chief rabbi of Moscow, said he asked Mr. Clinton whether, after his encounter with Mr. Zyuganov, he thought that the rights of Jews would be protected in the event of a Communist victory. Mr. Goldschmidt said Mr. Clinton replied: "I don't know, I don't know. They say one thing and do another."
The two-hour meeting, held at the American Ambassador's residence in Moscow, was not the first time Mr. Clinton had met with Mr. Zyuganov. The two spoke at a similar gathering of politicians in Moscow at a summit meeting last May. The difference was that, back then, Mr. Zyuagnov was not viewed as Russia's leading opposition figure and he was almost unknown in the West. In the last year, he has emerged as Mr. Yeltsin's strongest challenger. Most polls show he has a good chance of defeating the unpopular incumbent.
Nattily turned out in a suit, striped shirt and gaily patterned silk tie, Mr. Zyuganov seemed to relish his new prominence. Afterward, he said he felt "no antagonism at all" from Mr. Clinton and suggested that Washington should not be worried by a Communist victory.
"The relationship with the United States is friendly, and will continue to be so," he said. He directed the reporters present to read his writings on the United States-Russian relationship.
Mr. Zyuganov's attitude toward the United States expressed in his book, "I Believe in Russia," is less than cordial, however. "Washington cynically deepens the split between Russia and Ukraine, dictates Russia's conditions for supplying high technology to foreign countries, imposes ruinous disarmament treaties in Russia, and fans up Russophobia among radical nationalists in the provinces."
Mr. Zyuganov did not share those views with Mr. Clinton at their meeting.
A United States official described the encounter as "vigorous and enlightening," but others present said the format, in which each guest spoke by turn, prohibited debate and kept the conversation stilted.
There was at least one light moment. Boris Y. Nemtsov, 37, a liberal, reform-minded governor of Nizhni Novgorod, said he told Mr. Clinton that he was sure he would win re-election in November because people could not possibly elect Bob Dole. "He looks too much like Brezhnev," Mr. Nemtsov said.
Mr. Nemtsov said Mr. Clinton replied: "Be careful what you say. Zyuganov will endorse him." Everyone laughed, including Mr. Zyuganov.
Later, in a speech to more than 500 Americans living and working in Russia, Mr. Clinton shared his thoughts on the Soviet nostalgia that is permeating the election campaign. According to several people present, Mr. Clinton did not mention the Communist leader by name, but said: "We should not be surprised when there are people who do very well politically by promising to return to the good old days. This is not a problem unique to Russia. It is happening everyhere."
American officials said that Mr. Yeltsin did not try to dissuade Mr. Clinton from meeting Mr. Zyuganov, although the Russian President made it clear he would not be pleased if Mr. Clinton were to distinguish his rival with a private meeting. Mr. Yeltsin even joked about it at a news conference earlier today, saying he saw no reason why Mr. Clinton should not meet with him, "but only if Zyuganov has company and they are not one-on-one in a small room, whispering something into each other's ears."
The list of invitees to the meeting was carefully selected to provide Mr. Clinton with a range of Russian political views, but the numbers were swayed heavily in favor of political figures sympathetic to economic reform and Mr. Yeltsin.
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who is also a presidential candidate, was not invited. The White House considers the anti-Semitic politician beyond the pale. Washington also snubbed another well-known presidential candidate -- the former Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Mr. Gorbachev is deeply unpopular in Russia, but he remains respected in the West as the man who started Russia's reform process and ended the cold war. Indeed, this weekend's nuclear summit meeting might never have taken place had it not been for him. But his overbearing personality -- and deep enmity for Mr. Yeltsin -- seemed to have gotten in the way.
"Gorbachev gets 1 percent of the vote here," a senior American official said. "He never shuts up, he always says the same thing. We know what his positions are, and frankly it would have upset Yeltsin far more to have him there than for Clinton to be talking to Zyuganov."

HEADLINE: Dole Concedes Wage Increase Will Win Vote

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Bowing to political reality, Bob Dole, who has strongly opposed increasing the minimum wage, said today that he expected the Senate to pass an increase but refused to say how he would vote.
While being asked repeatedly on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" whether he would support raising the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 an hour, Mr. Dole acknowledged for the first time that the increase appeared inevitable. "Will there be an increase? I assume there will. The House has already indicated they're going to pass the minimum wage." 
 His concession came after he repeatedly sidestepped the question of whether he would support a raise. Subsequently, he said: "What we'll try to do, if there is an increase, is to package it with some other things," mentioning other measures that the Democrats oppose, like tax cuts, or as part of a budget agreement, thereby dooming any increase.
Other measures he might link the wage with, he said, include proposals allowing for new rules for employees who work part-time, or for compensatory time off in lieu of being paid overtime. He acknowledged that unions "aren't crazy about" these ideas. Speaker Newt Gingrich, appearing later on CNN's "Late Edition," endorsed Mr. Dole's concept of packaging the wage bill with other measures.
For the last several weeks, Mr. Dole has battled the Democratic initiative raising the minimum wage over two years, saying it would cost businesses too many jobs, even as House Republicans have endorsed the measure. President Clinton is eager to sign the bill, which would be the first increase since 1990 when Democrats controlled Congress and the wage was raised from $3.35 an hour to $4.25 over two years under President Bush. In the past Mr. Dole has twice voted to increase it, and today he made arguments both for and against doing so.
In his answers today, Mr. Dole steeped himself in the legislative parlance that his aides have urged him to avoid, responding to the wage question at one point by saying, "But our view is, maybe file cloture on the immigration bill."
The Clinton Administration reacted to Mr. Dole's comments by calling on Mr. Dole to schedule a simple yes-or-no vote on the wage increase without linking other measures to it.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's national economic adviser, said in a statement that with each day of delay, "the real value of the minimum wage moves closer and closer to a 40-year low."
The Administration also took issue with Mr. Dole's contention today that President Clinton himself had opposed increasing the minimum wage, a statement that George Stephanopoulos, an adviser to the President, said was "flat-out not true." Clarkson Hine, a spokesman for Mr. Dole, said the statement was based on a quote by Mr. Clinton in a Time magazine article. Mr. Stephanopoulos questioned the Time article and said there was no transcript or record of Mr. Clinton's ever having said he opposed the measure.
Mr. Dole's opposition to an increase in the minimum wage comes at a time when polls show that more than 80 percent of Americans favor a raise. And support by 20 House Republicans and eight Senate Republicans for the Democratic measure increases the pressure on him to capitulate.
Today's interview again highlighted Mr. Dole's increasing challenge to hold two jobs -- as Presidential candidate, who needs to appeal to a broad segment of the population, and as majority leader, who must work out compromises with numerous factions, even if it means subverting his own position.
Mr. Dole is campaigning on his record as a leader in Congress, as "a doer, not a talker," but many analysts concluded last week that Democrats have out-maneuvered him on the wage bill. Today he upbraided the 20 House Republicans whose support for the raise tipped the balance in the House last week in favor of the bill's approval.
"We were somewhat blindsided by a group of House Republicans, which we hope we can prevent in the future," he said.
But when asked if he was rethinking his plan to continue as majority leader while running for President, he said, "Not really." Instead, Mr. Dole said today that he had had "a pretty good week" and dismissed the gloating of Democrats on the Senate floor over his setbacks as "inside baseball" that "doesn't resonate outside the Beltway."
While he trails Mr. Clinton in national polls by at least 15 points, Mr. Dole was especially caustic in his response to Republican concerns that he will lose the November election. When told that William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, wrote that Mr. Dole might lose badly, Mr. Dole said acidly, "So who is Bill Kristol? What has he done?" Mr. Kristol, a prominent Republican commentator, was chief of staff for former Vice President Dan Quayle, but Mr. Dole identified him as the manager of Alan Keyes's failed 1992 campaign for the Senate from Maryland. "I don't look upon him as anybody who really understands politics," Mr. Dole said of Mr. Kristol.
On "Late Edition," Mr. Gingrich was asked to respond to Mr. Kristol's arguments that Mr. Dole was not articulate enough to beat President Clinton. The Speaker said Americans did not want a talk-show host for President, adding, "Dole is at least as articulate as Dwight Eisenhower."
On another matter, Mr. Dole said on "Face the Nation" that he would keep an anti-abortion plank in the Republican Party platform. "We're going to have some recognition in the plank that we support the pro-life position, no question about it," he said.
Mr. Dole also said that a report in today's Kansas City Star that his Presidential campaign had received thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from workers at a Massachusetts sporting-goods company should be investigated.
The company, Aqua-Leisure Industries, is run by Simon C. Fireman, a national vice chairman of finance for Mr. Dole's campaign. Three employees told The Star that some workers were handed stacks of $100 bills and told to return with checks made out to "Dole for President." Federal rules prohibit companies from paying people to make contributions and from giving money in someone else's name.
The accusations "ought to be checked," Mr. Dole said.
"If somebody did that," he said, "they're in deep trouble."

HEADLINE: Communications Trade Pact Eludes the Big Economies

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 21

 BODY:
Trade ministers from four of the world's major economies said today that they had made some progress toward an agreement to liberalize trade in telecommunications. But the officials, who met over the weekend in the Japanese port of Kobe, said it was still questionable whether a global accord could be forged by the self-imposed deadline of April 30.
At stake is an effort by 51 nations, under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, to negotiate an agreement that would open domestic telephone and telecommunications markets to foreign companies. Although such an opening could save consumers billions of dollars, many countries are reluctant to let foreign companies compete with their national telephone companies. 
 With the deadline looming, the so-called quadrilateral meeting of trade ministers from the United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan aimed to give the negotiations a boost by having the big economies set an example of liberalization that the small countries could follow.
The acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and her counterparts vowed at the meeting to redouble their efforts to meet the deadline and hinted that they would improve their offers to liberalize their own markets. But the four representatives did not state what new concessions they might make. "It was one step back from the ideal solution," a European Union official said.
Jeffrey M. Lang, a deputy United States trade representative, said the telecommunications negotiations had been given "a push forward, not a final push, but a significant push."
"We'll have to have significant contributions from developing countries, particularly from the countries in Asia," he said.
Washington has offered to allow foreign companies to completely own American telecommunications companies. But it has warned that the negotiations are in danger of breaking down unless other nations made similar offers.
Japan has said it will lift restrictions on foreign ownership except for the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and KDD, its main domestic and international phone companies. But Canada and some European nations like Spain and France have been reluctant to lift restrictions on foreign ownership. Now, the European Union official said, there are hints of concessions.
The conference delegates also said they would work for a world accord to eliminate tariffs on semiconductors, computers, software and other information-technology products.
The European Union, however, said it would not support this Information Technology Agreement unless it was allowed to take part in any future agreement on semiconductor trade between the United States and Japan. Washington is pushing for renewal, in somewhat weaker form, of a 1991 accord with Tokyo that set a goal for increasing the share of Japan's chip market held by foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Yeltsin Accentuate The Positive at Summit Meeting

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 21

 BODY:
President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin emerged from a meeting in the Kremlin today effusively celebrating the American-Russian partnership even as they glossed over a host of policy differences.
They announced some progress on disputes over treaties on conventional forces and anti-missile defenses. And both men put a premium on keeping the relationship between the United States and Russia on a solid footing despite growing anti-Western sentiment in Russia and a coming presidential election here that could well return a resurgent Communist Party to power. 
 The five-hour meeting between the two Presidents capped a weekend of glittering international summitry in which Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of seven major industrial democracies, meeting for the first time in Moscow, called for speedy enactment of a nuclear test ban.
Those visitors also provided a warm embrace for Mr. Yeltsin, giving him the opportunity to demonstrate his prestige as a world leader as he heads into the election running behind Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist candidate, in opinion surveys.
Mr. Clinton, sitting by Mr. Yeltsin's side at a news conference, lavishly praised his Russian counterpart. "Thanks to President Yeltsin's leadership, 60 percent of Russia's economy is now in the hands of its people, not the state," he said. "Inflation has been cut. Democracy is taking hold. Since 1993, trade between the United States and Russia is up 65 percent."
For his part, Mr. Yeltsin asserted that the elections in his country "do not interfere with the long-term cooperation between our two countries." When both men were asked how a Communist victory would affect ties, Mr. Yeltsin answered brusquely, "There's nothing to think about, because I am sure that I will be victorious."
Mr. Clinton, laughing, said, "That makes my answer irrelevant, doesn't it?"
At the news conference, Mr. Yeltsin chastised reporters for suggesting that the nuclear security summit meeting and his session with Mr. Clinton were intended to give him a pre-election boost. But it was clear that he and Mr. Clinton each had a personal stake in seeing that the meetings played well in their respective countries.
[Mr. Clinton arrived back in Washington late Sunday night.]
For Mr. Yeltsin the weekend of meetings with world leaders provided an opportunity to showcase himself and his nation as a great power on the world stage. And Mr. Clinton, concluding a one-week foreign trip and returning home to his own electoral contest, repeatedly highlighted, campaign-style, the steps he had taken as President to reduce the nuclear threat remaining after the cold war.
Referring to Mr. Yeltsin today, he said, "For three years the President and I have worked together in trying to make the world a safer place by reducing the nuclear threat that all our citizens face."
If Mr. Yeltsin should lose his re-election bid to Mr. Zyuganov, Mr. Clinton would find it harder to make a claim that he had brought a more secure world, and Russia would be likely to emerge as a major foreign policy issue in the American presidential race.
With that political backdrop, the lengths to which Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin were going to bury their policy differences became clear as they discussed some of their areas of disagreement. Those range from the war in Chechnya to the NATO military alliance's plans for expansion into Eastern Europe to Russia's sales of nuclear technology to Iran.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he had discussed the war in Chechnya with Mr. Yeltsin. But he also defended his Administration from criticism that it has not been vocal enough in its protests of Moscow's assault on the separatist province in the Caucasus, in southern Russia.
"I think it depends on your first premise: do you believe Chechnya is a part of Russia or not?" Mr. Clinton said.
"I would remind you," he added, "that we once had a civil war in our country in which we lost, on a per-capita basis, far more people than we lost in any of the wars in the 20th century over the proposition that Abraham Lincoln gave his life for: that no state has a right to withdraw from our union."
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Yeltsin had asked him to take a few steps that might be helpful in securing a peaceful resolution of the conflict. A senior Administration official later said that Mr. Yeltsin wanted Mr. Clinton to reach out to foreign leaders, particularly to King Hassan II of Morocco, who has established a good relationship with the Chechens.
Mr. Yeltsin insisted, as he has before, that no military operations had been carried out in Chechnya since March 31. But witnesses say Russian bombings and artillery attacks have continued there. Mr. Yeltsin attributed the ongoing violence to the fact that "some bands are still running around."
A senior American official said later that the Russians were making a distinction between what they considered to be "military operations" and what they viewed as defensive measures.
On the question of NATO's expansion, Mr. Yeltsin said Mr. Clinton had promised not to expand NATO at this time. The Russian President held out the possibility that some sort of mutually acceptable compromise on NATO could be reached, perhaps through an agreement that no country be allowed to enter NATO without Russia's assent.
But Mr. Clinton gently denied that he had made any concession. "My position hasn't changed about NATO, but I do not in any way, shape or form mean any threat to the security of the long-term legitimate interests of Russia," he said.
The two Presidents reported some progress on several arms control fronts, including the types of anti-missile defenses allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Mr. Clinton said the two sides had "made important progress in distinguishing between anti-ballistic missile systems that are limited by the ABM treaty and theater missile defenses, which are not."
That understanding is important because the Pentagon wants to build new theater missile defense systems to protect troops in bases overseas.
In the area of conventional weapons, the two sides reported progress in a dispute over the deployment of Russian tanks and personnel on the southern and northern flanks of Russia. The Russians have kept more armored vehicles in those areas, including the volatile Caucasus region, than the 1990 treaty allows, and the Clinton Administration has sought to work out a compromise. Another meeting on the subject between lower-level negotiators is set for May.
On another issue, Mr. Clinton requested that the Russians explain why they were building a mammoth underground military complex at Yaman-Tau mountain in the southern Urals. American officials have speculated that the complex could be anything from a command center for nuclear weapons to an underground weapons production complex, and they have been disturbed by the secrecy shrouding the project.
Mr. Yeltsin said the issue could be taken up by each side's specialists.
Mr. Yeltsin repeatedly referred to Mr. Clinton affectionately as Bill. And the two men exchanged a big hug as Mr. Clinton left the Kremlin for a meeting in the American Ambassador's residence, known as Spaso House. That meeting was with a dozen other political figures, including Mr. Zyuganov.
As he began the Spaso House session, Mr. Clinton deflected questions from reporters about whether he would be able to cooperate with Mr. Zyuganov should he win the Russian election.
"The Russian people will make that decision," he said, "and we will proceed accordingly. I'm not going to get into this election. I spent two days staying out of it."

A New Phone Merger Creates a Giant in the East
The merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, to be announced today, will create the second-largest telephone company in the United States after AT&T -- with $27 billion in sales, 127,600 employees and 36 million customers in 12 states. The impact on consumers is far from certain, since the two companies do not compete directly. [Page A1.]
 
The changes for Nynex -- in attitudes toward customers, regulators, competitors and its workers -- could be dramatic if Bell Atlantic's chairman, Raymond W. Smith, takes command of the combined company. [D5.]
 
Trade Talks Inch Forward
Representatives of four major world economies discussed the possibility of opening domestic telecommunications markets to foreign companies, but said it was questionable that a worldwide accord would be reached by April 30. [D2.]
 
Dole Sees Minimum Wage Increase
Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader and presumed Republican Presidential candidate, conceded that an increase in the minimum wage was inevitable. [A1.]
 
How Rude! How Marketable!
By offering scathing political commentary, making merciless fun of his guests and generally being rude, the radio talk show host Don Imus attracts listeners on a whopping 80 stations around the country. Ten have signed on in the last few weeks, since Mr. Imus called President Clinton a pot-smoking weasel at a dinner for radio and television correspondents. Along with the listeners, Mr. Imus is also drawing in blue-chip advertisers like American Express, Bell Atlantic, the New York Stock Exchange and Mobil. [D9.]
 
Double Take's Second Chance
Citing what it called an intoxication by "inchoate expressions of self and celebrity" in a "sea of journals devoted to money and fame, power and politics," the Lyndhurst Foundation has given $10 million to Double Take magazine, a quarterly journal of literature, reporting and photojournalism that lost $1.5 million in its first year of publication. One of the editors is the psychiatrist Robert Coles. [D9.]
 
Hollywood Frowns on Movieoke Idea
Wouldn't it be a gas to dub your voice in place of, say, Humphrey Bogart's in "Casablanca" or Madeline Kahn's in "Young Frankenstein"? Two Hollywood multimedia types are developing a CD-ROM title called Movieoke that would let you do that. And because you could do it at home, it wouldn't even involve the public humiliation that karaoke does. But movie studios are not amused and are posing a threat to the project over copyright issues. Denise Caruso: Digital Commerce. [D6.]
 
Testing On-Line Advertising Waters
Betting on the notion that electronic mail is the most valued use of the Internet, a new on-line service opening today is giving subscribers E-mail accounts in exchange for demographic information and the use of part of their computer screens as display space for advertisers. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D11.]
 
Software Courtship Doomed?
Cheyenne Software and McAfee Associates seem to be putting the divorce before the marriage. Because of bad blood between the companies' chief executives -- it was brought on by an offer by McAfee to acquire Cheyenne -- analysts say McAfee is unlikely to win Cheyenne's hand. [D4.]
 
Following Uncle Sam's Rules
There is no shortage of Federal regulations governing business. But a plethora of World Wide Web sites offering access to Government guidelines is making it easier for companies to insure that they are in compliance. Taking In the Sites. [D10]

HEADLINE: The City's New Fire Boss: From the Ladders to the Limousine

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As his black Crown Victoria raced across the Brooklyn Bridge, Thomas J. Von Essen, the city's new Fire Commissioner, was already five minutes late for his first meeting with his new boss, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Not accustomed to having a chauffeur, Mr. Von Essen had slid reflexively into the front passenger seat, instead of the back. Once under way, he realized he didn't have so much as a legal pad. "I'm going over there without even a plan," he said last Wednesday, shaking his head. "I'm going to make a real fool out of myself." 
 For Mr. Von Essen, 50, who will be ceremonially sworn in today and who will be the first Fire Commissioner ever to have led the firefighters' union, there is more than a slight sense of vertigo at being in charge of a department where only a short while ago he held the rank of firefighter. More jarring is that he is becoming the very official he often fought as president of the union.
Of all the careers he had envisioned -- lawyer, teacher, labor leader -- running the Fire Department, even as a lieutenant or captain, was not on his list.
"I never was a person who wanted to be a boss," he said. There was a brief silence in the car before Mr. Von Essen, his driver and an aide burst into laughter. "And now look at me. I'm the grand poobah, or whatever they call it, right?"
Despite his own reluctance and criticism from those who feel he has betrayed the union by switching sides, Mr. Von Essen has quietly begun to put his own stamp on the job, three weeks after Mr. Giuliani surprised the Fire Department and union leaders alike by choosing him to replace Howard Safir, who became Police Commissioner.
Unlike Mr. Safir, known for unquestioning loyalty to City Hall and for shutting out those who disagreed with him, Mr. Von Essen has begun with an open door, even on the most contentious issue he has inherited, the Giuliani administration's plan to remove fire alarm boxes from city streets.
On his first day in office one week ago, he met with David Rosenzweig, president of the Fire Alarm Dispatchers Benevolent Association, the union representing fire alarm dispatchers, who has been among the most vocal opponents of firebox removal.
The Mayor argues that the boxes are relics that lead to false alarms, while many in the sharply divided City Council say that removing them leaves residents with no quick way to report fires on the streets.
Mr. Von Essen, who was careful to take no position on the issue while heading the union, emerged from the meeting in support of a new administration plan that would remove about half the boxes. And Mr. Rosenzweig still praised his approach.
"With Safir, it was all personal," said Mr. Rosenzweig, whose union has accused the department of penalizing outspoken members. "At least, Tom gave us a very nice reception, got us in to see him on his first day. We could make our case."
As he takes over a department that many have said largely manages itself, Mr. Von Essen has also made it clear he will not distance himself from the gains he achieved as leader of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, even if they become issues the Mayor asks him to oppose.
"I don't see how I can fight passionately against something I really believe is right," he said in his office at Fire Department headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, nodding toward a wall to make his point.
The only thing he had hung there was a copy of a bill passed two years ago in the Legislature allowing firefighters to receive disability benefits for several types of cancer, even if there is no clear proof the cancers are caused by fighting fires or dealing with hazardous materials.
"I am very proud of that," Mr. Von Essen said. "I would never be able in good conscience to speak against the importance of that bill. If the Mayor wants to talk about limited resources and the inability to afford it, then I can talk about that."
For his part, the Mayor said yesterday that he was not worried about Mr. Von Essen's ability to change hats. "I selected him because he understands the problems of the Fire Department and the issues there probably better than anyone," Mr. Giuliani said. "When people come into government they always have to leave behind another perspective. Tommy has the ability to grow like that."
Mr. Von Essen's supporters and critics say his independent streak, tempered with just enough political acumen, allowed him to take over the firefighters' union in 1993, when it was fractured with infighting, and to unite its executive board. He succeeded even as he supported policy changes pushed by the Mayor, changes unpopular with the rank-and-file, like training firefighters to respond to medical emergencies and merging the department with the Emergency Medical Service.
He took those positions, say many who have worked with him and against him, because he honestly believed they were right. "I don't believe for a second that there was any strategic planning on his part to do this to get something for himself down the line," said Jim Grossman, a former spokesman for the union. But others say Mr. Von Essen also chose to fight loudly for the changes, because he recognized it could pay off in winning concessions from an administration with little money or patience with unions.
"I think he just decided he was going to be on the train rather than under it," said Tony Bernardo, the president of the union that represents E.M.S. workers, paraphrasing a slogan often used by Mr. Safir.
In the end, the union protected itself from nearly all budget cuts and won back part of a work-force cut suffered under the Koch administration: restoring a fifth firefighter on 60 of 138 engine companies.
Mr. Von Essen's critics, including Carmine DeRoss, the union's combative Staten Island delegate who ran against Mr. Von Essen for the presidency in 1993, contend, however, that he used the presidency of the firefighters' union unabashedly to gain political influence and to curry favor with Mr. Giuliani, who has taken Mr. Von Essen to Yankees games and has seemed remarkably at ease with the union.
Those who know both men say the Mayor and Mr. Von Essen hit it off instantly after meeting during the 1993 campaign, when the union endorsed Mr. Giuliani and ran phone banks for him at union headquarters. "I think they have kind of the same world view," said a colleague of Mr. Von Essen, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Von Essen grew up in Bushwick, Brooklyn, the son of a police sergeant. His family moved to Ozone Park, Queens, but he spent his freshman year at Bishop Loughlin High School when two students named Rudolph W. Giuliani and Peter J. Powers were juniors. "I never really knew them, though," he said, "because I transferred out to follow the girl who would later be my wife."
The Commissioner has been married to his wife, Rita, now for 28 years. She works for a real estate company in Garden City, L.I.
Like the Mayor, the Commissioner's friends say, Mr. Von Essen also approaches issues with a studious dedication and old-fashioned discipline. Occasionally, he, too, displays a short fuse. (In the late 1980's, said one former union official, he threw a punch at a delegate during a union board meeting, missed, and hit another union official near him.)
After a start at college, he then went into the Navy during the Vietnam War, serving on a submarine based in New London, Conn. "I think I had always thought I wasn't going to be in a physical kind of profession growing up, but being in that submarine really gave me an appreciation for people who work closely together and confront danger," he said.
Although he had never really wanted to be a firefighter, Mr. Von Essen joined the department in 1970, he said, "basically to support myself" until he could get through St. Francis College, where he later received his bachelor's degree in economics. But he ended up in Ladder Company 42 in the South Bronx, one of the busiest stations in the city at a time when arson fires raged through the area.
"He could have transferred out like a lot of others, but it got under his skin and he kept at it," said Van Elsing, a retired firefighter who took Mr. Von Essen under his wing when he came to the company. It was Mr. Elsing who started the young firefighter's union career, all but forcing him to become the ladder company's union delegate because he saw how Mr. Von Essen's determination set him apart from the other men. "He went in for a lot of ribbing because he was so serious, and he was always studying," he said. "But when it came to fires he was someone you knew you could count on."
Those were simpler days. During his first appearance before the City Council as the Commissioner, Mr. Von Essen was booed repeatedly by residents of Bushwick, his boyhood neighborhood, people who do not want the department to remove the fireboxes. At one point, clearly frustrated as Council members asked how the elderly in poor neighborhoods would report fires, he interrupted: "I mean, how many elderly people you think are actually running to alarm boxes to report fires?" A hiss went up from the crowd.
"I always compared firefighting to being like on a high school football team," he said later. "It was a physical beating every time you ran out. But when you came back you just felt so good about it. It wasn't like other jobs where you have to lie and steal on a regular basis."
After the City Council meeting, as he worked his way through a crowd of reporters, he added:
"Compared to what I'm doing now, even union work was a lot less complicated. All I had to do then was complain."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Says He Is Open to Scaling Down Stadium Proposal

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
After weeks of touting the creation of a $1 billion multipurpose Yankee Stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he was open to other possibilities, even to the construction of a smaller, cheaper baseball-only ball park.
"Some people feel that a single-use stadium would be easier to finance and would cost the city less money," Mr. Giuliani said. "Other people feel that multi-use, because it would bring in football and major events, would bring the city more revenue. We haven't come anywhere close to a decision on that yet. It's open for discussion, debate. We have an open mind about it." 
 When asked about his support for a multi-use stadium, the Mayor said: "I've said that's one of the claims that's made. There are other ways to do it."
His comments came in the wake of increasing questions about how the city would finance a multipurpose stadium as it struggles to balance its budget. While Mr. Giuliani has never ruled out the other stadium alternatives, including keeping the Yankees in the Bronx, he has spent the past few weeks aggressively promoting the more costly and ambitious multipurpose stadium that was first recommended by a consulting firm hired by New York City, the state and George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the principal owner of the Yankees.
But in the weeks since its release, the specific proposal for the giant stadium -- and the consultants' plan in general -- has been criticized by some stadium experts, politicians and baseball fans who complain that not only would it cost too much but also that it would clog traffic to the Lincoln Tunnel and buck a nationwide trend toward smaller, more intimate baseball fields.
A final decision has yet to be made about the stadium's future, and a financial plan has yet to be released assessing the alternatives sites. Indeed, Mr. Steinbrenner has not said whether he will even abandon the Bronx stadium that has been the home of the Yankees for 73 years. But the fear that the Yankees will abandon New York City if a new stadium is not built has ignited eager speculation about the various sites under consideration, and almost every new utterance by the Mayor on the topic has been weighed and analysed and held up to the light as if each public pronouncement were a tiny crystal ball with the power to show what is to come.
Thus, it was no surprise that the description of a rift between the Mayor and Gov. George E. Pataki over the future of Yankee Stadium, which appears in an article in today's New York magazine, attracted attention. The Mayor made his latest comments in response to that article, in which Charles A. Gargano, the economic adviser to the Governor, expresses doubts that a multiple-use stadium would attract the conventions, concerts and trade shows necessary to keep it afloat.
"What I have learned so far is that often these facilities don't have much use beyond baseball and football," Mr. Gargano was quoted as saying. "And a Manhattan location would not significantly change this."
Governor Pataki's aides have said privately that they worried that the multipurpose stadium proposal was being advocated to the exclusion of other, less costly alternatives.
Since the city is counting on the state to help finance the stadium, these concerns are impossible to ignore. The Mayor and his aides have said the city and the state could issue bonds for it and pay them off by tapping revenues from ticket sales, luxury boxes, advertising and even the exclusive rights to sell beer.
And since the consultants' report -- by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum -- said that a two-sport, retractable-dome stadium situated near the Hudson River between 30th and 33d Streets would bring more business and more money to the city, the Mayor had touted that plan as the one that made the most economic sense for the city. Such a stadium -- which could house football games, conventions and concerts as well as baseball -- would generate revenue estimated at $199 million, while a baseball-only stadium would produce $129.6 million.
Echoing that view last week, the Mayor said: "If you want a personal preference as opposed to a business decision, my personal preference would be for a single-use baseball field. I think they're more fun. But that doesn't mean that that's the best decision for the city of New York."
But with a $1 billion price tag, the stadium would likely be the most expensive in the nation's history, costing three to four times more than highly praised ball parks in Baltimore and Cleveland. And stadium experts doubt that revenues generated from increased attendance, concessions and advertising would be enough to cover the financing of the deal.
In a measure of some of the skepticism over the proposal, a poll released last week showed that 70 percent of the New Yorkers surveyed said they wanted the stadium to stay exactly where it is -- in the Bronx. And doubtful Democrats in the City Council introduced a resolution for public hearings on a possible move.
The skepticism even extended to Republicans in Albany, where some of Mr. Pataki's aides worried that Mr. Giuliani was pushing too hard for a plan that required additional study. And they also worried that by vigorously expressing his support for a new stadium, the Mayor was giving too much leverage to Mr. Steinbrenner, who has not said publicly that the Yankees were leaving the Bronx.
Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he and Mr. Pataki have never been at odds over the issue. "The Governor and I have very close communications about that," he said. "We probably see it in precisely the same way."
And how does the Governor see it?
Interviewed after a speech at the United Methodist Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew in Manhattan, Mr. Pataki said, "I think the best thing would be to convince George Steinbrenner to keep the Yankees in the Bronx and to have the Bronx have the improvements for parking and transportation, improvements to the stadium, if necessary."
"If the only alternative is a different site, and the city comes forward with a proposal where they seek the help of the state," he said, "we'll be pleased to look at it and try to work cooperatively with them, understanding that we're not going to commit a large amount of tax dollars to what is essentially a private purpose."

HEADLINE: Help New York's Media Entrepreneurs Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Our organization was the lead sponsor of the New York new-media industry survey (editorial, April 16). We conceived the idea, applied for the grant and directed execution of the Coopers & Lybrand survey. 
 New media are an example of a model of economic development that has worked wonders in other regions in the last decade, driven by entrepreneurs who create new industry clusters at a regional level.
Metropolitan areas like San Francisco (computers and software), San Diego (biotechnology) and Nashville (health-care services) have benefited from the sweat and pluck of entrepreneurs. National statistics support the role of small business as the generator of job growth in the last decade.
New York has not given this trend much heed. Our economic-development culture is heavily invested in supporting the monolithic private and public institutions that have been the mainstays of the economy but cannot provide growth today. At the same time, our tax code has tilted the playing field against the entrepreneur.
You highlight these obstacles to growth, but have no call to action to remove them. Yes, the fiscal vise on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is tight, but the ultimate solution to the problem is growth in the private sector.
Any delay in the effort to create a fertile economic climate for entrepreneurs sends the wrong signal to these job creators. The Giuliani administration has proposed a number of policy changes that will improve the lot of entrepreneurs. When considering the tradeoffs that the city's fiscal condition requires, we urge the administration to protect these measures from the temptation to wait until next year.

HEADLINE: Brave New Ball Game

BYLINE: By Raymond J. Keating and Matthew Carolan; Raymond J. Keating is chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee, a private Washington-based group. Matthew Carolan is executive editor of National Review.

 BODY:
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Scarsdale, has offered the quintessential New York solution to keeping the Yankees in the Bronx. If George Steinbrenner tries to flee to New Jersey, invoke eminent domain and have the state take over the team.
Brodsky no doubt figures that since Yankee Stadium is government-owned -- stadium socialism, if you will -- the Yankees might as well be, too. Given New York's history, we can imagine the following scenario: 
 In a fit of Albany bipartisanship, Republicans and Democrats vote to seize control of the Yankees. Immediately, a Department of Baseball Development (D.B.D.) is created, and for his bold vision Brodsky is named commissioner. With a first-year budget of almost $1 billion, the department buys Yankee Stadium from New York City.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announces that the city will put the money from the sale into a new Baseball Assistance Ticket program: Under B.A.T., the city will guarantee every resident'sright to attend games, no matter what his or her income. Public Advocate Mark Green states:"Yankee baseball cannot become elitist, the domain of only those individuals who can afford to buy a ticket."
The Department of Baseball Development's Office of Baseball Protocol and Sensitivity holds a news conference, during which community activists ask New Yorkers to stop calling the Yankees the Bronx Bombers -- a nickname, they say, with a negative connotation in the Bronx. Fernando Ferrer, the borough president, declares:"The Bronx is a vital community, not a bombed-out city."
Brodsky ends the Yankees' relationships with the Madison Square Garden and WPIX television stations and WABC radio, and games are broadcast on public television and radio stations. While Phil Rizzuto agrees to announce a handful of games, the other Yankee announcers leave. Officials announce the new Yankee broadcast team of Mario Cuomo and Alan Chartock, the Albany radio host. Reacting to the reuniting of the former public-radio duo, one public radio bureaucrat declares: "If they bring the same compassion and compelling insights to baseball that they brought to New York State politics, the horizons of baseball fans will be expanded greatly. I see a new era for sports and social awareness."
Meanwhile, the state budget is once again late, and the Yankees, citing lack of funds, forfeit their first dozen games.
When the season gets under way, the Cuomo-Chartock team brings protests from the New York Conservative Party. Its chairman, Michael Long, opposes Cuomo's ramblings about Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and the need for infrastructure improvements. For balance, the conservative columnist and baseball savant George Will joins the broadcasts. Ideological conflicts lead Rizzuto to retire once again, declaring: "Holy cow, what a bunch of huckleberries!"
PBS adds a post-game show with Charlie Rose as host. In an interview, Rose is punched in the nose by the Cincinnati Reds manager, Ray Knight, who explains: "I couldn't get a word in edgewise."
The Department of Baseball Development, citing job creation measures, moves all Yankee minor league teams to New York and builds new stadiums for them. Debates rage in Albany over Yankee salary differentials: Is there a glass ceiling over weak-hitting shortstops? State job-retraining programs expand to meet the needs of players forced out of baseball because of deteriorating skills. The Yankees struggle to emerge from last place, and fans begin longing for the good old days under Steinbrenner.

HEADLINE: Unearthing the Tales Of a Lost Settlement;
Glimpses of Black History in a Place That Faded From Maps and Memory

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
They are easy to overlook, these four woodframe houses, simple and spare, the paint peeling from their facades.
Except that on a block lined with a towering housing project, they stand alone in a clearing, tucked behind a fence on Bergen Street in Brooklyn. Except that when surrounding buildings in Bedford-Stuyvesant were razed and replaced, they somehow survived. Today, they are all that remains of one of the earliest and largest settlements of free black people in the North, and their presence give context to lives lived in a distant time. 
 "Each one of the houses has a different story, has had a different life," said Joan Maynard, an artist who has made the preservation of these houses her life's work.
The Hunterfly Road Historic Houses are the last remnant of Weeksville, a community that came to be in the 1830's and thrived for nearly half a century before fading from maps and memory. At least 40 families lived there, and its population often rose when black people in Manhattan and on Long Island fled to escape discrimination and racial violence.
The saga of these houses, and the effort to preserve them, has in many ways mirrored the struggles and triumphs of the community where they stand. For more than 20 years, the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History has struggled to restore the four dwellings and create a museum. But despite their status as a city landmark, the houses have suffered a setback with nearly every step forward.
One house was burned to the ground in 1973 and had to be rebuilt. Another was nearly destroyed by vandals. Last February, a car crashed into the house nearest Bergen Street, destroying renovations that had taken two years to pay. The houses have been closed to the public until money can be raised to repair the damage.
Though the society receives city and state funds for educational programs, it relies on donations, membership dues and admission fees to pay salaries and other operating expenses.
Despite spending roughly $1 million on renovations, the society estimates that it still needs half a million dollars to complete work on all four houses. Only one has been completely restored. Others need their foundations shored up, their cracks filled in, their battered clapboards removed and replaced.
Inside, the relics of Weeksville and its time are on display: a Civil War boot, an old steam iron, a pair of shackles worn by a slave. In one house, there is a mannequin displaying the dress Harriet Etta Lane, a Weeksville resident, wore on her wedding day in 1908. And in the kitchen there is a butter churn and a washboard to remind visitors of how hard day-to-day life could be.
In two houses, the re-creation of history is left largely to the imagination. The society hopes to ultimately fill them with artifacts found at the site, and exhibits that illustrate the major restoration effort the houses needed and the importance of archeology in connecting to one's past. Members of the society have also talked with city officials about constructing a reception building nearby, with classrooms and administrative space.
The society believes that the houses, built between 1840 and 1883, stand as symbols of perseverance and possibility in a part of Brooklyn where poverty is high and hope sometimes dim.
"We have had people say, 'You should pick up the houses and move,' " Ms. Maynard, the society's executive director, said. "I said, 'This is exactly where it needs to be. It needs to be here, where many of the people have no knowledge of their own history.' "
For years, Weeksville was all but forgotten, and the peak-roofed homes off Bergen Street were simply known as the houses on the alley. The "alley" was Hunterfly Road, a once important thoroughfare. And most of the houses along the street had been toppled in the name of urban renewal. But the four cottages were hidden by larger buildings facing the main streets, and so they were spared.
"The very fact the houses still exist is really a miracle," said Claudine Brown, who is the director of the arts program at the nonprofit Nathan Cummings Foundation and who has worked with the Weeksville preservation effort. "The community really changed as a result of very early urban renewal. New housing was built, schools were built that replaced the earlier schools for colored children. It's almost as if those houses still existed as an afterthought."
From its beginning, Weeksville was a sanctuary for Southern black people fleeing slavery as well as Northern blacks escaping hostility and sporadic racial violence. It was farmland and some local historians believe that the first families to settle in the area were spurred to leave by the anti-abolition riots in Manhattan in 1834.
Weeksville was named for James Weeks, a stevedore from Virginia who bought a plot there in 1838. Though no one is certain, historians believe that the community was bounded by Fulton Street on the north, East New York Avenue on the south, Ralph Avenue on the east and Troy Avenue on the west. It quickly became a social, religious and political nexus for black residents in Brooklyn and home to various institutions ranging from an orphanage to the African Civilization Society. Several of its churches were stations along the Underground Railroad. And during the 1863 draft riots in Manhattan and other flare-ups of racial unrest, blacks took ferries across the East River and traveled from cities like Newtown, L.I., -- now a part of Queens -- to seek refuge in Weeksville.
"I think the physical location of Weeksville says something about slavery because it was established by blacks who had only recently been freed from slavery themselves," said Dr. Craig S. Wilder, a professor of history at Williams College who has studied Weeksville. "It was isolated. It was a place where that free black community could establish its institutions, its own social relations and its own community support system."
By the late 1800's, the physical place known as Weeksville began to disappear, with many of its homes and institutions torn down to make way for new streets and dwellings. It survived in public memory for a while, but historians say that by the 1950's its name was hardly remembered. It was not until the 1960's, during a rebirth of interest in local and black American history, that a search began for the once-upon-a-time neighborhood. The four houses were discovered in 1968 when a historian and a pilot flying overhead noticed a small row of woodframe homes on a hidden lane.
The houses, eventually bought by the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville, were made a New York City landmark in 1970 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. But many believe that the location that made Weeksville an ideal place in the 19th century for black people seeking new lives is now an obstacle to attracting more visitors and funds.
"We're not close to a transportation hub," Ms. Maynard said. "We're not in a glamorous part of town. But because the history is here, we've got to turn this thing around. That's the challenge."
Only bits and pieces are known about those who lived in three of the houses. But a former resident is still alive to tell her story.
Mary Bernice Jenkins moved into 1698 Bergen Street in 1924, when she was 3. Her father and grandmother were born in the community and she remembers when trolley cars rolled through the streets and horse-drawn carts brought bread and vegetables to her family's front door.
The name Weeksville had been forgotten, she said, but the essence of that community remained.
"It was very warm," said Mrs. Jenkins, whose sister lived in the home until the late 1970's. "Everybody knew everybody else. Kids seemed to congregate in my yard, so if mothers were looking for someone, they just came, peeked over the fence and there their child was."
At Weeksville, the past holds hands with the present. Every summer, there is a Weeksville Family Festival featuring black cowboys, musicians and horses. Neighbors from the housing project across the street tend a community garden there, planting eggplant, tomatoes and collard greens.
And behind the houses, members of the Weeksville preservation society have planted three trees: one for the tennis great Arthur Ashe, another for Nelson Mandela and a third for a young man from the neighborhood who was killed.
"We can't have a fabulous-looking house and everybody is suffering around us," said Ms. Maynard, who hopes that the houses can bring tourism to the area and foster new businesses and pride within the community. "We feel we can be a part of that revitalization. We're trying to nurture confidence that can help the present-day community reach its potential."
Ms. Maynard is planning a summer conference on historic preservation and economic development that she hopes will bring visitors and recognition to Brooklyn and, in particular, Weeksville.
"I understand there are many doors that have to be opened and we have to find different keys for different doors," she said. "We know if we get this place fixed right, people are going to find their way here."

HEADLINE: Dutch Re-Create a 1936 Anti-Nazi Art Show

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM

 BODY:
As part of the Nazis' plan to make the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin a showcase of their ideological and racial superiority, Josef Goebbels, the regime's propaganda chief, excluded Jews, leftists and purveyors of "degenerate" art from an Art Olympiad organized to coincide with the games.
In response, a group of Dutch artists and intellectuals challenged the Nazis by calling for a boycott of the event, which had accompanied the summer Olympic games since 1912 and in which painters, architects, writers and musicians were also awarded medals for excellence. 
 The Dutch group organized a counterexhibition in Amsterdam, "The Olympics Under Dictatorship," which brought together 300 works by 150 artists from half a dozen countries. The show also included documentation, cartoons, photographs and drawings illustrating Nazi repression and manipulation of education, science, theater, literature, film and music.
Now, 60 years after that exhibition and during another Olympic year, the Amsterdam Municipal Archives are presenting a reconstruction of part of "The Olympics Under Dictatorship" to pay tribute to artists wh' dared speak out when most European governments were still eager to appease Hitler. The show runs here through May 19 and will be on display at the Sports Museum in Berlin in July to coincide with the Summer Gam's in Atlanta.
The organizers of the 1936 show did not disguise their disgust at the Nazis' attempt to hijack culture. The initials of the show's name in Dutch, "De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur," or D.O.O.D, spell "death" in Dutch. The show's poster, which was pasted up around Amsterdam, portrayed a shot-putter standing in a stadium, his arms trapped by a swastika.
"Let this exhibition become a world manifestation of the will of all bearers of culture that their knowledge and their art may remain free, a blessing to civilization and humanity," the organizers of the show wrote. And they added: "It is not concerned with politics. It is directed solely against the violation of culture."
Not all the works displayed i' 1936 could be found. A good number were destroyed or disappeared during World War II. The Dutch artist Peter Alma burned some of his anti-Nazi sketches when Germany occupied the Netherlands in 1940. Some of Karl Schwesig's drawings called "In the Torture Chamber," which resulted from his own arrest in Germany in 1934, were lost in the Soviet Union. A sculpture by Hildo Krop is anchored to a wall at the United Nations building in Geneva.
Several of the original exhibit'rs also died in German death camps, among them Otto Freundlich and Chris Lebeau. A handful of them, though, are still alive, among them Eva Besnyo, the Hungarian photographer; Carel Weight, the British painter; Henri Jannot, the French painter, and Boris Taslitsky, a Paris-based artist who survived his imprisonment in Buchenwald. All sent works to the reconstruction.
Making this exhibition doubly interesting are recently discovered documents showing that in response to intense pressure from German diplomats, the Dutch authorities insisted on the removal of 19 works of art from the 1936 show on the ground that they were insulting to Hitler. Further, when the show later traveled to Rotterdam, it was closed by the Dutch police after only a few days.
By displaying Dutch police reports addressed to Willem de Vlugt, who was the Mayor of Amsterdam, the new exhibition also captures the intense social unrest gripping the Netherlands at the time, with the conservative Government of the day seemingly more concerned about leftist agitation among disgruntled unemployed workers than about the growing threat posed by Nazi Germany.
Because many artists were lefpists and even members of the Communist Party, the Government viewed them as potential troublemakers, not least when they attacked the dictatorships in Italy and Germany, regimes with which the Netherlands preferred to maintain cordial relations. Even before cracking down on "The Olympics Under Dictatorship," Mr. de Vlugt censored movies, plays and exhibitions he deemed "offensive."
Speaking at the inauguration of the new exhibition in March, the German Ambassador to The Hague, Wilhelm Haas, noted that by 1936 Dutch public opinion already viewed the Nazis with repugnance. "Your politicians, however, were not the only ones in Europe who completely underestimated the nature and the danger of National Socialist polici's," Mr. Haas said. "By meeting German demands, they thought the national sovereignty of a neutral nation could be safeguarded." And he added, "Apparently, they yielded more readily to German pressure when criticism of Germany came from the left."
Still, even though Amsterdam's municipal authorities refused to allow the show to be held in public buildings and some of the most virulently anti-Nazi works were removed, when "The Olympics Under Dictatorship" opened on Aug. 1, 1936, it nonetheless included many works and documents that the German consul in Amsterdam, A. E. Jung, described as "sheer provocation" against Germany.
The organizers of the exhibition invited artists from the Netherlands and neig'boring countries as well as many German artists who had already fled the Nazi regime to contribute works. Among foreign exhibitors were Max Ernst, Jacques Lipchitz, Marcel Gromaire, Georges Vantongerloo, Fernand Legep, Ossip Zadkine and Lucien Pissarro, although many artists were less well known.
With the notable exception of drawings and cartoons in the documentation section of the show, many works were not explicitly political, like Robert Capa's photographs of Holy Week celebrations in Seville and a landscape by Pissarro, although the artists were making a political statement simply by participating in the 1936 exhibition.
Among the 127 works by 73 artists in the reconstruction, however, some directly attack the Nazis or denounce police repression and torture, while a good many mirror the anxiety felt by artists about Europe's deepening nightmare. "The Hordes," by Ernst, for instance, shows frightened brown figures against a pale blue background. "The 20th Century," a painting by Christopher Nevinson, a British artist, portrays Rodin's "Thinker" surrounded by bayonets, warplanes, cannons and burning buildings.
Nola Hatterman's "Friends," a drawing of two men, one white, one black, looks uncontroversial today, but in 1936 it was a clear protest against racism. Similarly, Peter Alma's two oils, "Leftist Front" and "Solidarity Between Workers and Peasants," underline the ideological dimension of the social struggle in prewar Europe.
Carry van Lakerverld, the curator of the reconstruction, noted the relative absence of abstract art, which she attributed to the fact that most of the artists were leftists. "They wanted to express their political involvement both in form and contents," she said. "They therefore chose themes from everyday life and figuration because abstract art would not appeal to the working classes."
While the 1996 show throws light on both government appeasement and artistic courage in 1936, the purpose of the reconstruction is also to remind viewers of the continuing relevancy of the issues raised 60 years ago. "It makes people ask what they would do in a similar situation," Andre Hirs, an official at the Amsterdam Municipal Archives, noted. "And let's face it, there are still plenty of threats to freedom around the world today."

HEADLINE: Dole Has Led Senate to Legislative Success

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Sour Spring for Mr. Dole" (editorial, April 21): 
 In your misguided effort to chronicle phantom legislative "embarrassments" for Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, you succeed in embarrassing only yourself.
Your biggest gaffe is your misrepresentation of Senator Dole's efforts last week to make health insurance more affordable and more available.
Senator Dole offered about $9.5 billion in paid-for improvements to the bill.
These included increasing the tax deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed. He also proposed tax deductibility for long-term care insurance and expenses, and penalty-free Individual Retirement Account withdrawals to pay health insurance premiums while unemployed, as well as provisions cracking down on health care fraud and abuse.
While medical savings accounts were removed on a close vote, they represented only a small part of what Senator Dole proposed. The Senate adopted the rest of his changes -- nearly $8 billion worth -- by a vote of 98 to 0!
That was a substantial victory and enhanced the kind of bipartisan health care changes that Senator Dole has long fought for but that have been blocked for most of this Administration by President Clinton and the Democratic leadership.
Far from a "sour spring," this year has seen Senator Dole lead the Senate to a record of sweet success and break the deadlock on priority after priority.
This year alone, he has delivered the line-item veto, antiterrorism legislation with overdue death penalty appeals reform, a seven-year farm bill with a strong conservation package, telecommunications reform, regulatory relief for small businesses, an increase in the Social Security earnings limit, common-sense legal reform and a tightening of the screws on Fidel Castro.
The list goes on, and it can get longer -- especially if President Clinton and his Congressional allies want to put the American people ahead of their increasing political gamesmanship.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Higher Against Mark In Side Effect of Italian Election

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the German mark, which weakened against the Italian lira and other European currencies after a center-left coalition won a majority in both houses of the Italian Parliament.
The dollar was also bolstered against the mark after the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said that he welcomed the dollar's recent rise against the mark and "wouldn't have any problems if it kept on going to a certain extent." 
 His remarks, which came after officials from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations met in Washington over the weekend, helped drive the dollar as high as 1.5190 marks, its highest rate since Feb. 19, 1994.
The mark's slide began after the weekend election in Italy added to optimism that a stable government could soon emerge there. The mark fell to an 18-month low against the lira. When the mark falls against other European currencies, it frequently falls against the dollar, too, as speculators seek further opportunities to sell marks.
The mark also continues to be hurt by last week's cut in German interest rates. The Bundesbank, the central bank, lowered two important rates by half a percentage point on Thursday.
Lower interest rates tend to weaken a currency by reducing the yields available on investments there.
"People are afraid of marks," said Hans Boman, a currency trader at Swedbank.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5168 marks, up from 1.5120 on Friday. The dollar slipped to 106.65 yen, from 107.36 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5123, from $1.5140.
The dollar was weaker against the yen after Japanese and United States officials expressed satisfaction with the current exchange rate, leading traders to surmise that officials of the two nations would not seek to push the dollar any higher.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said yesterday that he was satisfied with the dollar's gains over the last year.
The apparent shift in attitude hurt the dollar. "Dollar-yen was curtailed by these comments," said Karl Halligan, a strategic currency trader at CIC Bank New York.

HEADLINE: Siege Is Subplot in Town's Survival Drama

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: JORDAN, Mont., April 20

 BODY:
For a town that has barely a tumbleweed's toehold in the high plains of Eastern Montana, life has not lacked for drama around here -- even before arrival of the anti-government fugitives known as the Freemen.
In the four weeks that Federal authorities have been locked in a sort of velvet-gloved standoff with the Freemen, not a shot has been fired from either side. F.B.I. agents complain about getting fat on farm suppers and bored with a watch-and-wait routine as predictable as prairie winds. 
 But all around the island of the siege, people are engaged in a daily struggle to keep their little hold of fast-fading American life from disappearing from the map altogether.
Real drama, says rancher Bev Murnion, her face turned out of the lacerating wind, is getting $300 for the same size cow that brought $500 two years ago, or watching a newborn calf die after a sudden cold snap. A real siege is when a chinook wind melts a foot of snow, and then the standing water freezes at night, and Ruth Coulter still has to drive 30 miles to deliver the mail to three patrons -- down from more than 50 mail stops when she started the job 47 years ago.
A real standoff, says Dan Muniak, a physician's assistant who is the de facto hospital for an area larger than 3,000 square miles, is trying to convince a stubborn ranch hand who is bleeding on his bar stool that he has to take a dozen stitches now, not after the bar closes.
"I do everything from womb to tomb," said Mr. Muniak, whose friends sometimes call him Dr. Maniac, though only in jest. Medicine, such as it is, is one of the fragile pillars on which civilization in Garfield County rests. Mr. Muniak, 50, is the part-time ambulance driver, the part-time X-ray technician, the part-time secretary and the full-time guy who gets called at any hour for a medical emergency.
His hours are so long that his wife took out a big advertisement in the Jordan weekly newspaper not long ago to complain that she had not been able to snuggle much with her husband and that he had missed some golden moments of their lives. He promised, though not in print, to work on it.
The last doctor in town died two years ago, just a few years short of his 100th birthday; he started practicing in the 1920's.
Garfield County, bigger than the state of Connecticut, has only about 1,400 people. What is happening here is going on elsewhere in the northern Plains: people are leaving, farms are closing, real estate prices are flat. There is also much prosperity among the ranchers and wheat farmers who own large tracts of family land. But the trend is toward depopulation, and with beef prices plummeting 40 percent in the last year alone, toward fewer cattle ranches.
This may be flyover country to most Americans, but from the ground, there is not so much as a jet's roar to break the whine of the wind.
Everyone on Main Street in Jordan -- a dusty affair with a drainage ditch going down the middle -- has a story to tell not unlike that of George Bailey's at the end of the film, "It's a Wonderful Life." Such is the tenuous fabric holding this community together, that many a resident believes there would be no town without him.
"If this business folded, I don't know if Jordan would last much longer," said John Fitzgerald, who runs the drugstore and soda fountain. His Coke machine is a 1955 model, and his soda fountain dates to 1927. When Life magazine wanted to snap a picture of timeless rural life at a soda-fountain counter, they came to the Jordan Drug Store -- in 1947. Nothing much has changed.
As for Mr. Fitzgerald, he said he had not taken so much as taken a week's vacation in nearly 40 years -- a frequent complaint. He pulls out a map of Montana and spreads it over the well-worn counter.
"You see here, from the Missouri River to the Yellowstone, from Glendive west for 240 miles, I'm the only pharmacist," he said. "This is a drugstore by the way, not a pharmacy. Pharmacies don't sell malted shakes."
Nick Murnion, the county attorney, has been under a two-year death sentence by the Freemen, who say they want to execute him for failure to uphold the Constitution, as they see it. The Freemen put a million-dollar bounty on Mr. Murnion's head, and then publicized it through militia networks. It has been a rough two years for the town's only lawyer and part-time county attorney.
"I'm supposed to be sitting around here with a gun in my lap waiting for these people to come and get me," Mr. Murnion said. And indeed his hair has gone gray rather quickly, say his friends and relatives. But Mr. Murnion says he has a much greater concern than the bounty the Freemen have placed on his life. Like nearly everyone here, he is trying to keep the county alive.
"We desperately need people," said Mr. Murnion, whose dozen or so relatives here include his sister-in-law Bev Murnion, the rancher. "Most of these farms used to have a husband, wife, a son or two and a ranch hand, but now they're all getting down to just one or two people. It takes twice as much land and twice as many cows now to make the same living you did 10 years ago."
With the outlaw Freemen holed up on a foreclosed 940-acre ranch about 30 miles from here, it may seem like little has changed in Jordan since frontier days. As Tom Jordan, town founder, wrote in his cowboy memoir of turn-of-the-century Garfield County, "Those times in Jordan were wild, and every shady character who could not stand the spotlight of civilization drifted in and around town."
If Garfield County can ever shake the spotlight brought by the Freemen standoff, it may have a future in a new-technology economy, Mr. Murnion said. As a trustee of the telephone company co-op, Mr. Murnion is trying to attract entrepreneurs wed to laptops instead of beef prices. But so is virtually every other place in rural America.
And while Mr. Murnion touts the virtues of Garfield County -- "You can be up on the Missouri Breaks, fishing for walleye or hunting antelope in some of the prettiest country anywhere" -- he also mentions by way of Montana melancholy that winter blizzards with 40-below-zero wind chill can kill you in five minutes if your truck fails.
A side benefit of having the hordes of F.B.I. agents around, Mr. Murnion said, is that they brought in a cell that made cellular phone calls possible. Jordan is now connected to the world.
His other project is an attempt to raise enough money from a shrinking tax base to move the Garfield County "courthouse" out of its present home, a 1914 dance hall that also houses the sheriff, the tax assessor and the county clerk. He has his eyes on the empty building that used to be the hospital, which, like other structures here, is falling prey to the wind and sage.

HEADLINE: Stocks Up Sharply, With Dow Rising 29.26

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks jumped yesterday as investors took heart from big merger deals, stronger bond prices and renewed interest in technology shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 29.26 points to close at 5,564.74 after rising as much as 50 points early in the session. Broader indexes were also higher. The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.82 points, to 647.89. 
 "There was little incentive to sell in the face of firm bonds, a continued focus in high techs and mergers," said Marty Kearney, a trader at PTI Securities.
Bell Atlantic's and Nynex's $22.1 billion merger was the most prominent of the $26.8 billion in deals that were announced yesterday. It was the second-biggest day for mergers; the biggest was Oct. 24, 1988, when 13 deals valued at $32.05 billion were done, including the R. J. Reynolds and Nabisco merger, according to Securities Data Company of Newark. Bell Atlantic rose 2 1/4, to 67 1/4, and Nynex fell 2 1/2, to 50 1/2.
In another deal yesterday, Cisco Systems agreed to acquire Stratacom Inc. in a stock swap valued at $4 billion, Stratacom surged 9 3/16, to 47 15/16, while Cisco fell 7/8, to 46 7/8.
"We had two nice mergers which perpetuates this concept of more stock being retired than brought to the market through initial public offerings," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist of Fahnestock & Company.
Stocks were also bolstered as bond prices rose for a second consecutive session, easing concerns about inflation and higher interest rates.
Reflecting the strength in technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite index rose to its third straight record, adding 14.80 points, to 1,153.50. The index is up 9.63 percent so far this year.
Technology stocks were strong as Soundview Financial recommended that investors increase their holdings in the short term.
And Robertson, Stephens reiterated a "buy" rating on nine technology stocks, saying that bad news about the computer industry had mostly been factored into the market.
"The general feeling now is the group has been washed out and there are some bargains there," said Thom Brown, a managing director of Rutherford Brown & Catherwood.
International Business Machines rose 1 7/8, to 107 1/4, and Intel gained 2 1/2, to 67 3/4. Microsoft added 3, to 112 3/4.
The continuing rush of quarterly corporate earnings reports, with relatively few disappointments, also helped stocks.
General Motors lost 1/2, to 56, after the world's largest auto maker reported a 51 percent drop in profits, in part because of the 17-day strike at two G.M. parts plants in Ohio.
Emerson Electric rose 5 1/8, to 85, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares.
On the New York Stock Exchange advancing issues led declines, 1,473 to 923, on moderate volume of 394.5 million shares.

HEADLINE: Abbot Moffat, 94, Lawmaker And Then a Diplomat in Asia

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 22

 BODY:
Abbot Low Moffat, a powerful New York State legislator during the Depression who in a second career as a diplomat warned against American involvement in Vietnam, died on Wednesday at a retirement home in Hightstown, N.J. He was 94.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 In a career that spanned much of the century, Mr. Abbot was chairman of the State Assembly's powerful Ways and Means Committee during the 1930's, helped run the Marshall Plan in Europe during the 1940's and served as chief of the Southeast Asian affairs division in the United States Department of State during the 1940's.
As a legislator from the 15th Assembly District in Manhattan, he controlled every piece of legislation that affected New York City. He was the first to propose building a multilane highway from Manhattan to Buffalo that later became the New York State Thruway. He also wrote a report that served as the basis for major revisions in the New York City Charter in the 1940's.
Mr. Moffat's influence was felt well beyond Albany. As a diplomat, he helped mold United States policy toward newly independent nations in Southeast Asia after World War II. He warned repeatedly about a surge of nationalism in regions like Indochina. And he strongly disapproved of the United States' growing involvement in Vietnam.
Abbot Low Moffat was born on the Upper East Side on May 12, 1901. He graduated from the Groton school in Manhattan, and received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1923 and then a law degree from Columbia University.
As a young man, he traveled the world with a sense of adventure. He rode for 25 days in a cart through Indochina, accompanied by a Chinese boy and a Russian refugee. From Australia, he stowed away on a freighter bound for the Panama Canal. And he studied at the School of Surveying of the American Geographical Society with a view to doing exploration work for museums.
He entered politics in 1929, winning election to the Assembly at age 27. He was among a small group of insurgent Republicans who took control of the Assembly from the leadership of their own party, ushering in an era when the Legislature played a far greater role in state politics than it had in earlier decades.
"It was a period of great legislative ascendancy," said Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute in Albany. "They were very assertive in establishing their own priorities and not just accept the Governor's priorities."
Mr. Moffat helped shape the current system of state budgeting and proposed fiscal changes that only came into fruition decades later. He fought his greatest battle with Gov. Herbert H. Lehman. He led what historians call the 1939 budget revolt, when the Legislature rewrote the Governor's budget and cut it. The case wound up in court, with the Legislature losing, in a decision Mr. Moffat long felt was wrong but which everyone agrees profoundly strengthened the hand of the Governor in budget making.
Mr. Moffat, a liberal Republican, was the only New York City legislator in a triumvirate that ran the Assembly. In the 1950's, he switched to the Democratic Party, after years of prodding by his wife, Marion.
His tenure in Albany, from 1929 to 1943, was under three Governors, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr. Lehman and Thomas E. Dewey. While Dewey gets much of the credit in history books for the highway that runs from the New York City line to Albany and then west, to Buffalo, it was Mr. Moffat who, while riding to Albany on Route 9, decided that something better was needed. He called the public works commissioner and asked him to draw up plans for the highway so he could enact a bill.
"They told me, 'You'll never get that bill through,' " Mr. Moffat recalled years later. "I said, 'If the chairman of Ways and Means says he'll get the bill, he'll get the bill.' "
He got the bill through. But much of the road was not built until Governor Dewey organized an authority to issue bonds to pay for it, an act that won the Governor the honor of having the highway ultimately renamed for him. "I still begrudge naming it after him," Mr. Moffat once said. "I thought that was a little extreme just because he got the financing going. But that's all right, except I just call it the New York State Thruway and let it go at that."
When he left Albany in 1943, Mr. Moffat set out on a career in the Foreign Service. He made a name for himself yet again, particularly representing the United States in Asia. He visited the Vietnamese nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh in 1946, and the cables he sent back are now widely regarded as prescient warnings about the course of American policy in Vietnam.
As head of the State Department's Division of South-East Asia Affairs from 1944 to 1947, he expressed great concern about the hard line the United States had taken in confronting nationalist movements like the one Ho Chi Minh was leading in Vietnam.
"I was bitterly disappointed," he said years later. "But the die was cast. We were going to follow a hard line on Communism wherever it put up its ugly head. I thought we were right back in the wars of religion."
He retired from foreign service in 1962 and moved to Princeton, where he remained active in local political and civic affairs. He also went on to write "Mongkut, the King of Siam" -- a project suggested to him by the king's great-nephews, who had been upset with the portrayal of the ruler as a capricious despot in the popular musical "The King and I," and wanted to set the record straight.
Mr. Moffat is survived by a son, Burnham Moffat of Danville, Calif.,; two daughters, Nancy Lifland of Princeton, and Jane-Kerin Moffat of Cos Cob, Conn.; eight grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Report Tries To Counteract Job-Loss Fears

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
The Council of Economic Advisers will report Tuesday that more than two-thirds of the new jobs created in the United States in 1994 and 1995 paid better than the average job, Administration officials said today, and that despite waves of corporate layoffs, the length of time most workers spent unemployed in recent years has actually declined.
Nonetheless, the report, written by Joseph E. Stiglitz, the head of the council, found some evidence that the rate at which jobs have been eliminated has risen slightly, despite strong economic growth. Though the evidence is murky -- and subject to differing interpretations within the Administration -- the statistics suggest that managers and other relatively high-paid white-collar workers who have been the focus of the most publicized layoffs are staying unemployed longer. 
 Mr. Stiglitz's report, which the White House plans to issue Tuesday, tries to answer one of the most politically charged questions of the election year: Is there statistical justification for the high anxiety felt in the American workplace today? Mr. Stiglitz has argued that many of the recent reports about declining wages and corporate downsizing, including a seven-part series in The New York Times called "The Downsizing of America," have overdrawn the severity of the turmoil in the American workplace.
"This puts us on a track to say that we've gone through tremendous dislocations, the kind of dislocations that come out of an economy with more job-creating energy than anywhere in the industrial world," a top Clinton adviser said today. "But it's tricky business, because you are walking the fine line of telling people things are pretty good while acknowledging that they are feeling pretty bad."
In fact, as the politically sensitive report has been worked into final form in recent days, some officials of the Labor Department, which also contributed to the study, have complained that Mr. Stiglitz was too intent on emphasizing the pace of job creation, at the expense of what a senior Clinton Administration official called "the clear anxiety you feel whenever you step into a factory."
But Labor officials say they have no argument with one of the most encouraging signs in the report: Evidence that the stagnation of real wages has hit bottom, and that in the past year they have begun to inch back up. Real wages have been frozen for many years, but the issue has gained much attention in the past year or two as the economy has grown rapidly.
The change may be barely noticeable to most workers, however. The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, for the first quarter of this year, showed median wages are now $25,428, slightly less than the first quarter of last year. But that decline was chiefly a reflection of the continued rise in the number of women in the work force, commanding lower wages, on average, than men. The statistics showed that male workers have seen their wages increase 1.3 percent.
Administration officials were quick to caution today that the study was fairly narrowly focused on a small part of the work force -- the 8.4 million new jobs created in the last four years in an economy of nearly 120 million jobs -- and that much of the data about the changing nature of layoffs in the past two years remained fragmentary.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton's aides say that the study builds a foundation for the central theme of the re-election campaign, that Mr. Clinton has presided over an economy that is based more and more on "high wage, high skill" jobs, reversing a long trend of job growth in lower-paying jobs in service industries.
But even while claiming credit for the turnaround, Mr. Clinton has usually been careful in his campaign pitch to acknowledge that the pain of layoffs and "downsizings" has been devastating for millions of families. And he says that he is already well ahead of the Republicans in developing plans to aid workers caught in what the report terms the "dislocations" of a tumultuous but growing economy.
That careful balancing act reflects the delicate political nature of the Council's report. Mr. Stiglitz, in several recent appearances, has made it clear that he wants to dispel the popular image that the jobs being created in the economy are low-paying hamburger flippers, receptionists and underemployed "consultants."
"The evidence is fairly strong that we are creating high-wage jobs," Mr. Stiglitz said after a luncheon on Friday at George Washington University. But he said that there were continuing problems with "dislocation" -- workers who lose a good-paying job and cannot find another job at equivalent pay. Work done in preparation for the council report, Administration officials say, suggests that workers laid off from a good-paying job take a pay cut of roughly 10 percent, on average.
Much of the report focuses on the question of whether the "dislocations" that workers have suffered in the last two years are significantly different from those they suffered in the early 1980's or other major periods of change in the American economy.
It is a difficult set of numbers to parse. The most up-to-date Department of Labor statistics end in 1993. In its series of articles on downsizing, The Times used those figures and other data as the basis to estimate losses in 1994 and 1995. The estimate was based on an economic model that has been the subject of some debate in economic circles, and in the Administration.
"It resulted in numbers that are a bit more pessimistic than our own," one of the President's senior economic advisers said today. The adviser noted that the interpretation of those figures also depended in large part on the period to which it was compared.
For example, Henry Farber, a Princeton economist who has studied such labor statistics with care and participated in the council's report, has observed that while the job-loss figures in the recession that lasted from 1991 to 1993 were comparable to losses in the 1981 to 1983 recession -- leading one to believe that little had changed -- the recession in the early 1990's was comparatively mild. And during a milder recession, there is an expectation that job losses should be less severe than during a deeper one.
By coincidence, the report is being issued just as Mr. Clinton is maneuvering to take political advantage of a growing movement in Congress -- over the initial objections of Senator Bob Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee -- to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 from its current level of $4.25. That would be a small step toward remedying the surging income gap between the lowest-paid workers and the highest-paid, a gap that has widened considerably during Mr. Clinton's term in office.
White House officials are scampering to use the unexpected momentum for the election-year increase -- which Mr. Dole now says he will try to attach to other legislation that Mr. Clinton opposes -- to demonstrate that the President is already executing plans to assure that workers get a larger share of a recent run-up in corporate profits.
"The C.E.O.'s of America's major corporations got a 23 percent raise last year -- an average compensation of nearly $4.5 million each," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today. "Why can't we give 90 cents more an hour to millions of our nation's lowest-paid workers?"
But the minimum wage increase may be the most concrete part of the President's plan for immediate aid to American workers. After months of sometimes bitter internal debate, the White House decided several weeks ago to reject Mr. Reich's public calls for an alternative tax system that would benefit companies that fit his definition of conscientious corporate citizens -- those who promised not to lay off workers during profitable times, and who set up comprehensive health care and profit-sharing systems.
It has also rejected proposals from Democrats like Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico, to create tax incentives for companies to hold executive pay to roughly 50 times the wages of their lowest-paid employees. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has been particularly critical of that idea, arguing that the Government should not interfere with the compensation system of companies.
"At least we are getting these ideas on the agenda," Mr. Bingaman said today.

HEADLINE: New York Weeklies Stage a Free-for-All;
Voice and Press in Give-Away Battle

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
In the weeks surrounding the reincarnation of The Village Voice -- from aging alternative weekly to Manhattan's newest and most ubiquitous free paper -- the metropolis has been awash with mysterious rumors.
First, there was the one about the nail-polish-red news boxes that The Voice had planted all over Manhattan -- how homeless people were hauling heaps of papers to the other boroughs, where The Voice still sells for $1.25. 
 Then there was one about the publisher of The Voice -- how he supposedly called another magazine in a snit to complain that one of its columnists was also writing for New York Press, a free weekly that competes with The Voice.
Finally, there was the story about how The Voice was supposedly putting the squeeze on various downtown businesses to stop accepting free copies of New York Press if they wanted to be able to give out free copies of The Voice.
Evidence to support the rumors was hard to find. But at least a couple of them appeared to be emanating from an aerie atop the Puck Building in SoHo, which happens to be the lair of New York Press.
Things are hopping these days at New York Press, the self-styled alternative to the alternative, which has built much of its reputation by selling itself as the anti-Voice, the heir apparent to The Voice's cultural niche.
In recent weeks, the eight-year-old paper has pushed ahead its distribution date by a day, from Wednesday to Tuesday, to beat The Voice onto the streets, and has begun running a series of promotional ads mocking The Voice as geriatric, doddering and over the hill.
It has hired several new columnists, including a dominatrix named Mistress Ruby; a writer on black popular culture, Michael A. Gonzales, and Alexander Cockburn, one of the best-known writers from The Voice's heyday, who left the paper in 1982. All of which the 40-year-old editor and co-owner of New York Press, Russ Smith, said he believes will enable his upstart weekly to knock the paper he has called "a dinosaur, a relic" off the perch he believes it has occupied for too long.
"This is one of the great reasons, for us, that The Voice went free," Mr. Smith said. "Because it really put us into battle mentality. We're in a real war right now."
As for The Voice, he said: "If they are ignoring us, they are in trouble. Because we are truly the Vietcong. We are in the trees shooting at them. We can move a lot faster than The Voice can."
The Voice is, as it turns out, pretty much ignoring New York Press. Its editor and publisher seem less threatened than bemused -- not unlike the editor of big-city dailies back when alternative papers first began sniping at them.
David Schneiderman, 49, the publisher of The Voice, said he read New York Press only rarely. Karen Durbin, the 51-year-old editor, characterizes the supposed battle between the two papers as "Tyson versus what's-his-name."
As Ms. Durbin and Mr. Schneiderman see it, New York Press is simply trying to borrow legitimacy from The Voice, "piggybacking" on the 41-year-old paper's reputation and history in the hope of boosting its own.
"I think of it a little bit like a gnat," said Ms. Durbin, who first wrote for The Voice in 1972, and returned to run it two years ago. "It's kind of running up and kicking you in the shins. You feel a mild hit on your toe. 'Oh, them!' "
As Mr. Schneiderman tells it, free distribution is going swimmingly. When the experiment began two weeks ago, The Voice instantly tripled its Manhattan circulation to 155,000, he said. Only 342 copies were not picked up.
Classified advertisers have said their ads are getting more responses. There have been more calls answering personal ads. Five hundred news dealers still carry The Voice, even though they can't charge for it.
The only problem, Mr. Schneiderman said, is that the copies are being snatched up too quickly. As a result, he said yesterday that he would print 35,000 more copies starting in May, raising total circulation to 235,000. (It was 118,000 in September.)
That would be more than double the 100,000 circulation of New York Press. And Mr. Schneiderman says a full-page ad in The Voice already sells for nearly four times the cost of one in New York Press.
"Ultimately, you're dealing with two very different products," Mr. Schneiderman said of his paper and New York Press. "This is a sophisticated newspaper. It's won Pulitzer prizes and George Polk awards."
And New York Press?
"They put out a newspaper."
Indeed, the competition is a little difficult to characterize. Owned by Mr. Smith and a silent partner, it offers an unusual mix of columns, personal journalism, listings and often cranky, vicious criticism.
The columns have included at one time or another a three-year-chronicle of one columnist's psychotherapy, a column on patents, the musings of a well-educated deadbeat and a series titled "How to Fight With Your Wife."
The April 10 issue, which coincided with the first free issue of The Voice, included a piece of fiction on the cover and a lengthy, few-holds-barred, first-person account of one man's experience undergoing cysto scopy, titled "Prostate With Fear."
The paper's politics are not easily defined, either. But Mr. Smith describes himself as an economic conservative. There is a libertarian columnist and several writers were quite taken with the Republican candidacy of Steve Forbes.
"I think our paper is a lot more representative of New York in the 90's," said Mr. Smith, comparing his paper with The Voice, and suggesting that the true counterculture, in New York at least, is no longer located on the left. "Our political stuff is more evenly mixed. It's not the rote party line."
On that theme, New York Press has been firing carpet tacks at The Voice (and other publications) for years, trashing The Voice as tired, predictable, mushy-headed, no longer an alternative to the mainstream.
One of its new house ads is a parody of the cartoons of Jules Feiffer, which have appeared in The Voice since a year after it was founded. Another ad, making fun of the music criticism of Robert Christgau, a well-known writer for The Voice, begins: "Auteurist avatar of more seminally epochal, randomly eclecticized oeuvres . . . "
The slogan reads: "NYPress: Music criticism for people under 50."
Asked why he had decided to go to work for the opposition, Mr. Cockburn, who worked for The Voice from 1973 to 1982, said in an interview from his home in California: "Oh, anything to give the old nag a kick in the backside."
His debut column caught the attention of James Ledbetter, a press critic for The Voice, who then took the opportunity to accuse Mr. Cockburn of recycling material from a newsletter Mr. Cockburn puts out.
Mr. Cockburn fired back this week, inviting ex-Voice readers "now in recovery" to send along their versions of why The Voice "became the shapeless, self-indulgent, bulimic mess it is today."
Ms. Durbin, for her part, had nice things to say about Mr. Cockburn's first column, calling him "a bit of a rose in a garbage can." But she said she had no plans for any changes in response to New York Press.
"I don't know how one would go about competing with a publication like that," she mused. "Do we turn sharply to the right? Do I tell the writers: 'Enough with the substance; just blow smoke? Write worse?' "

HEADLINE: Cosmetics Can't Mask Our Economic Inequality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "It's Not a Wage Gap but an Age Gap"(Op-Ed, April 21): W. Michael Cox's arguments only confuse the picture of widening inequality in America. Mr. Cox points out that, over time, people have moved up in income, but he admits that the explanation for that finding is that workers tend to make more money as they age. 
 As the economist Frank Levy has shown, the problem is that men today average much lower earnings and move up much more slowly than did men of the same age 25 years ago. Mr. Cox would have us believe that the only wrinkle in the American Dream is that workers now take longer to reach full earnings.
Actually, this age effect is a result of the great plunge in earnings that most young men -- those without college degrees -- have faced in recent years.
You can try to put rouge and mascara on the haggard face of economic reality, but you cannot hide the sad facts. Inequality has grown -- and more so in the United States than elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Cosmetics Can't Mask Our Economic Inequality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
W. Michael Cox (Op-Ed, April 21) says that we should not be concerned about low wages because workers almost invariably move up the pay scale. His point, while valid in the abstract, overlooks an important problem. 
 A minimum-wage earner cannot buy groceries today with the middle-class job she will have in 10 years. The prospect of economic mobility does nothing to soften the blow of low wages while they are being earned.
Wages at the bottom of the scale are too low, even if they are temporary. Even with the earned income tax credit, the family of a full-time, minimum-wage worker with two children will remain below the poverty level.
Perhaps Mr. Cox would prefer that we help this family with another increase in the earned income tax credit. It is not unreasonable, however, to expect employers to pick up some of the tab by paying a higher minimum wage.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
W. Michael Cox's observation that economic inequality is not economic immobility (Op-Ed, April 21) is worth emphasizing. 
 But if our economy is going to be allowed to grow at only a low rate, about 1 percent a year, then the only way for the some of the "have-nots" to move up is for some of "haves" to move down.
This means that for every poor person who moves up -- and Mr. Cox would suggest that many do -- one of us in the upper strata must fall.
This is not a pleasant thought, and I am trying hard to avoid being one of the downwardly mobile. But unless we can invent a Lake Wobegone system of economics, where we are all above average, we had better stop griping.

HEADLINE: Nanjing Journal;
China's Campus Model for the 90's: Earnest Patriot

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: NANJING

 BODY:
His manner was friendly, but his words had a hard, metallic edge to them.
"Pardon me for speaking so bluntly," said Liu Junhai, a junior at Nanjing University, pausing on a walk across the leafy campus to respond to a visitor's questions about student attitudes. 
 "I don't consider that the United States is very friendly toward China," he said. "After all, you have just sent two aircraft carriers to within a few hundred miles of the Chinese coast and even closer to Taiwan."
Mr. Liu, 22, is a business major, and he seemed all business as he explained himself in a way that reflected the strong patriotism -- some call it nationalism -- of Chinese students today.
"We have received a lot of propaganda from the central Government that Taiwan is part of China and the United States should not interfere in China's internal affairs," he said. "So it seems to me the role the U.S. is playing as a world cop is comical. It is none of your business, so why are you putting your foot in it?"
Again apologizing for the unfriendly tone of his remarks, Mr. Liu added, "We have a saying in Chinese for something that seems out of place: It is like the dog chasing the mouse."
Mr. Liu's remarks and those of a number of his classmates sampled on an afternoon walk around one of China's most prestigious centers of higher learning suggested that just as Americans are more inclined these days to think the worst about Chinese intentions toward Taiwan or in confrontations on trade and human rights, the Chinese seem similarly inclined to think the worst of American intentions.
"I don't think the United States wants to see another Soviet Union in the world, in other words, another superpower or another country on its same level," said Huang Jie, a 20-year-old German major.
Hers was a grievance that many Chinese voice today, a sense that behind Washington's threats to impose trade sanctions on China for copyright piracy, behind its pressure on human rights, behind American and European objections to China's entry into the World Trade Organization is a strategy to contain China or to prevent its rise as a great Asian power.
It almost seems out of place these days to speak of the friendly relations that marked the first 10 years of Deng Xiaoping's reforms, coinciding with Mr. Deng's landmark visit to the United States in January 1979. That was the year that China's paramount leader visited the White House to re-establish full diplomatic relations before jetting off to tour America, even stopping in Houston to wear a cowboy hat and ride in a rodeo at the Astrodome.
"I don't think it is a question of being friendly or not," Ms. Huang said. "Nowadays, I think a country's relations with other countries are decided by economic interests."
Not too many years ago, millions of Chinese students, repelled by the corruption and inflation engendered by Communist Party policies, came out of their campuses to demand democratic reforms in the demonstrations of 1989, leading to a violent military crackdown ordered by Mr. Deng and carried out by a hard-line faction led by Prime Minister Li Peng.
Now, university students remain committed to these lofty concepts, but the emphasis has changed.
"Today, we are swimming in a different sea," said a legal scholar in Beijing who explained that Chinese students today are less inclined to place the blame for everything with the Communist Party or the Government in Beijing, and more likely to find fault with other forces in the world, particularly the United States.
When Beijing went all out to win the contest to be named the host of the 2000 Summer Olympics, rightly or wrongly, many blamed the United States for China's failure.
"I think China should first become stronger," said Lei San, a 22-year-old computer sciences major here. "Then we can concentrate on building democracy." In 1989, when students filled Tiananmen Square in Beijing and put up a statue that they called the Goddess of Democracy, Mr. Lei was only 15.
"If there is no economic base," he continued, "then there will be nothing to build democracy on."
Ms. Huang added a different perspective. "The majority of students want to develop both economic and political reforms," she said, "because people cannot live on bread alone."
One thing seemed clear from these youthful expressions: the Communist Party leadership is benefiting from the wave of patriotic spirit -- or nationalism -- that is rolling through the student population.
Not far from this campus, busloads of Chinese schoolchildren arrive each day to tour the museum built in memory of the victims of the Japanese 10th Army in World War II. The invaders swept into this ancient city, whose name means "southern capital" in Chinese, in November 1937 and began a campaign of rape, pillage and killing that left as many as 300,000 dead.
The museum director, Zhu Chengshan, said visits to the exhibition more than doubled in the last three years.
"Our purpose is to provide patriotic education for children and young people, and not to let them forget history as we strive to make the country stronger," he said.
Mr. Zhu was assigned to the museum from the Nanjing propaganda department in 1992, the year that Prime Minister Li issued national guidelines to enhance the "patriotic education" of China's youth, part of the concerted effort by Communist Party leaders in Beijing after the Tiananmen crackdown to win back legitimacy as well as the hearts and minds of students.
"We intend to use patriotism as a unifying force because China needs stability," Mr. Zhu said.
In some places, it appears to be working.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
YOU know those oddballs who go up and down the beach early in the morning with metal detectors, looking for coins? Well, they probably have better luck than people out looking for reasonably priced Burgundy.
The price of good wine -- really good wine -- is soaring, be it from California, France or Italy. But Burgundy is a special problem: there is so little of it. Burgundy makes less than a quarter of what Bordeaux turns out, so when the good stuff runs out, that's it. 
How else to explain $900 for a bottle of 1993 Romanee-Conti? Yes, that's what some of the local shops are asking. Now if that is what your heart is really set on, there is a merchant out on Long Island who can let you have a bottle for $800 and change. He says that he's out of it now, but if you promise to take a couple of dozen cases of Lafite, he will find you a nice '93.
Of course, it you're worried abeut the economy, downsizing and all that, he has the 1992 Romanee-Conti for a mere $730 a bottle.
Tossing around these kinds of numbers makes carping about $80 and $150 wines seem petty. But what about the people who like Burgundy but are not prepared to spend more than they do for a tank of gas?
Well then, here is a list of surprisingly decent Burgundies, both red and white, all no more than $25 and all with true varietal character; in winespeak that means they actually taste like Burgundy.
The principal red varietal -- in fact the only red varietal -- is pinot noir. The whites are all chardonnay, except then they are aligote, but we'll get to that later.
There is really nothing complicated about this, by the way. The official Burgundy region is some 150 miles long, but that includes Chablis, far in the north, and everything down to and including Beaujolais, which ends just north of Lyons. Most people think of Burgundy as only the Cote d'Or -- Golden Slope -- which runs from Dijon southwest through Beaune to Santenay.
And just south of Santenay is another Burgundy region, a small one, called the Cote Chalonnaise. It gets its name from Chalon, a railroad town whose only vines are in some locomotive engineer's backyard.
The Cote Chalonnaise, along with some lesser-known towns in the Cote d'Or, is where the buys are.
Once upon a time the Cote Chalonnaise was known chiefly as a source of grapes for sparkling wine. Remember sparkling Burgundy? The area has come into its own in recent years as prices for most Cote d'Or wines have sailed upward.
Mercurey, Rully and Givry produce good to excellent red wines. Montagny makes good white wines; Mercurey and Rully also turn out good whites. Bouzeron, another town in the appellation, as official French wine districts are called, also makes good whites and reds. One of the best producers in Mercurey is Joseph Faiveley. Once Faiveley's Clos de Myglands Mercurey was in reach of topers of modest means; now it's best to look for his Mercurey Clos-du-Roi. Recently it was found for $25. Today? Who knows? At least one New York store was offering another Mercurey, Chateau de Chamirey 1993, for about $15.
As the boss of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, Aubert de Villaine is the fellow who brings you that $900 Romanee-Conti. Each day after work he goes home to Bouzeron, where he makes a delicious Bourgogne rouge -- red Burgundy -- called La Digoine, for about $15. His white Burgundy, Les Clous, is about $13.
Mr. de Villaine makes another white wine in Bouzeron: aligote. Once this was a humble wine often blended with cassis to make a Kir. Mr. de Villaine has turned it into a fresh, racy white wine that stands out over many inexpensive chardonnay Burgundies. His Aligote de Bouzeron is about $12.
Louis Latour, one of the best known of all the Burgundy shippers, makes a pleasant aligote, which sells for $10, and a delicious Montagny, La Grand Roche, $12.
Still in the Chalonnaise, the Chateau de Rully makes a most attractive white under its own name. It sells for $14.
The lowest common denominator in Burgundy is a wine with an oxymoronic name -- Grande Ordinaire. It rarely finds its way to our shores. In the United States, the least among red Burgundies is called just that: red Burgundy. Some of them are awful. The only guarantee of quality in these blends is the reputation of the blender. Look for Louis Jadot's for $12; Domaine Leroy's for $14, and Faiveley's for $16.
The famous communes along the Cote d'Or -- Gevrey-Chambertin, Vosne-Romanee, Meursault and Puligny-Montrachet among them -- are familiar even to wine drinkers who can't afford their wines. But fine Burgundies come from lesser-known towns like Chorey-les-Beaune, Ladoix, Pernand-Vergelesses, Monthelie and Saint-Aubin.
The best-known name in Chorey-les-Beaune is Tollot-Beaut; one of the best in Monthelie is Olivier Laflaive and in Pernand-Vergelesses, Louis Jadot. Ramonet is the famous name in Saint-Aubin but Mr. Laflaive also makes a good white Burgundy there. It sells for about $15.
In Pernand-Vergelesses, Jadot owns a vineyard called Clos de la Croix de Pierre. It is not easy to find -- the wine, that is -- because it has fans that look for it every year. But it does turn up here and there and at $20 is a terrific buy. There are also a few white wines made in Pernand-Vergelesses. A lively one from Antonin Guyon sells for $9.
Finally, we come to the Hautes Cotes (pronounced oat-coat), literally, the high slopes. These are the vineyards on top of the line of hills that form the Cote d'Or. They were mostly abandoned between the wars, when Burgundy was hard to sell. They were replanted when the market began to improve in the 1950's and 60's. The northern half is called the Hautes Cotes de Nuit and the lower half the Hautes Cotes de Beaune. Faively makes the Hautes Cotes de Nuits Hugettes, an excellent buy at about $20.
None of these wines are made in any great quantities, so good hunting. If you have a metal detector, use it -- to find enough coins to pay for the wine.

Marimar Torres Pinot Noir 1992.
Green Valley Sonoma,
Don Miguel Vineyard. About $30.
 
 Marimar Torres has been in the United States since the 1970's, representing her family's hugely successful winery near Barcelona, Spain. In 1983, she and her family bought property in the Green Valley area of western Sonoma County and were soon producing a high-quality chardonnay. Later she added pinot noir and now offers two versions, a lighter wine and a somewhat more intense bottling exclusively from grapes from a vineyard named after her father.

HEADLINE: Welfare Study Offered Fair Assessment on Aid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Bob Herbert's "Poison Numbers" (column, April 22): 
 Our study on welfare published by the Cato Institute profiled the benefits available to a typical recipient family, a mother with two children, ages 1 and 4. This means, for example, that our profile family was eligible for the Women-Infants-Children program, which provides food vouchers for young children at special risk for inadequate nutrition.
Mr. Herbert says we should not have included WIC since 80 percent of welfare families do not receive the benefit. He is technically correct, because only children below school age can receive WIC. But older children not eligible for WIC would be eligible for other assistance to low-income families, including school lunches.
Mr. Herbert also criticizes our decision to include housing benefits in our calculations, noting that nationwide only 25 percent of welfare recipients receive housing. Eligibility for housing is a function of time spent on the waiting list. Since the crisis in our welfare system involves long-term welfare recipients, we felt it fair to include the benefit.
Mr. Herbert says we ignored benefits received by the working poor. Our study discusses those benefits. However, benefits received by the working poor are often time-limited and are offset by the additional costs associated with work, such as transportation, clothing and child care. The largest welfare benefit received by the working poor is the earned income tax credit, which the study accounts for.
There are 77 major Federal and state welfare programs, with many recipients receiving benefits from them. Indeed, our study may have understated the aid a recipient can receive.

On the Delaware River, once the haunts of heavy industry, a company finds a beauty spot for a plant.

BYLINE: By Maureen Milford 

DATELINE: NEW CASTLE, Del.

 BODY:
A COMPANY that makes bathroom cabinets and shower rods is building a manufacturing plant along the Delaware River here, providing a stark contrast to the chemical plants of the early 20th century that still operate nearby.
The Zenith Products Corporation of Aston, Pa., has started work on a $20 million plant of nearly 500,000 square feet just south of the twin spans of the Delaware Memorial Bridges. But unlike the steel mills and chemical plants that chose the waterfront site for production reasons, Zenith was attracted to the riverfront for reasons of highway access and esthetics. 
 "It's absolutely gorgeous," Briggs Pletcher, Zenith's assistant to the president, said of the undeveloped tract that looks across the river to Pennsville, N.J. "It's hard to believe we could find a site that beautiful and so easily accessible" to Interstate 95, he said.
The land had been scheduled for heavy industrial development as early as 1918. The Lukens Steel Company of Coatesville, Pa., bought the 525-acre parcel that year as a possible location for a steel operation.
In the 1970's, after Delaware passed its Coastal Zone Act, Lukens put the land up for sale. The environmental law makes it extremely difficult if not impossible for the land to be developed for new heavy industrial uses. Eleven years ago, Lukens -- by then the diversified Lukens Inc. -- began developing a portion of the property but has since sold its interest.
The State of Delaware has agreed to provide Zenith with a $1 million grant for relocation and improvement costs, and $200,000 for job training. The state expects to recover the money within the next three years through personal income and corporate taxes. Ten years worth of property-tax breaks were provided by the City of New Castle.
The 79-acre site chosen by Zenith is on a stretch of the river whose shoreline has been marred by the smokestacks and fuel tanks of heavy industrial development. The Du Pont Company and Zeneca Inc., a chemical company, have operations nearby. Star Enterprise operates a petroleum refinery nearby in Delaware City, in view of the cooling tower for the Salem nuclear power plant complex on the New Jersey side of the river.
The Zenith site is the most desirable in Riveredge Park, an office and light industry development. In addition to being completely flat, which limits construction costs, it is isolated from other development. A historic plantation-style home on the property is to be restored as a training and conference center, according to Herman Van Fleet 3d, a partner in Architectural Concepts of Malvern, Pa.
The architects have designed the Zenith building to take advantage of views up and down the river, Mr. Van Fleet said. The building will take up about 11 acres, but Zenith was forced to buy more than seven times that amount of land because much of the property is wetlands.
Zenith, a subsidiary of the Masco Corporation, a building materials company based in Taylor, Mich., went looking for a spot to build last year after outgrowing its 320,000 square feet of space in Delaware County, Pa., just south of Philadelphia. The company, probably best known for its bathroom space-saving product -- shelves mounted on floor-to-ceiling poles -- had sales of about $90 million in 1995.
One of the conditions in searching for land was that the new site be within a 20-minute drive of its existing plant, where the company employs about 650 people, according to Zenith's chief executive, James Aruffo. That plant will close. Zenith has had operations in Delaware County for about 30 years, Mr. Aruffo said. Most of the employees will move to the New Castle plant when it opens in December, he said.
Zenith paid roughly $2.2 million for essentially 35 usable acres, or nearly $63,000 an acre, said Charles J. White Jr., vice president of Stoltz Realty Inc. of Wilmington, which handled the sale.
In Delaware, as in the rest of the nation, there is healthy demand for industrial space, said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. Because many older industrial buildings have outdated fire and safety codes, companies are opting for new construction. In addition, the ceiling heights of older structures do not allow for modern racking systems for distribution and inventory retrieval.
The result is that industrial construction in northern Delaware was at a five-year high in 1995, according a survey by the Jackson-Cross Company, a real estate firm with offices in Wilmington. The market has pushed prices for improved industrial sites to $70,000 to $80,000 an acre, it reported.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Again Gains on the Mark, Climbing to a 14-Month High

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar continued yesterday to benefit from the weakness of the German mark, settling in New York at its highest rate against the mark in more than 14 months.
The mark has been battered by last week's cut in German interest rates and by talk that Italy would rejoin Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism within weeks. 
 The dollar broke through a psychologically important level of 1.52 marks in European trading, rising as high as 1.5220 marks. In late trading in New York, it settled at 1.5212 marks, up from 1.5168 marks on Monday. Yesterday's closing price was the highest since Feb. 13, 1995.
The dollar also edged up to 106.67 Japanese yen from 106.65 yen in New York. The British pound rose to $1.5165 from $1.5123.
The mark has been weak since German interest rates were cut by half a percentage point last Thursday. The slide accelerated after a center-left coalition won majorities in both houses of the Italian Parliament in elections on Sunday.
The coalition had campaigned on a pledge to restore the lira to the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The decisive victory by the coalition increased confidence that the European Monetary Union planned for 1999 would become a reality.
The rate mechanism establishes linked trading ranges for the currencies of 10 of the 15 European Union member countries and is a precursor to creating a single European currency.
The lira was taken out of the mechanism during an international currency crisis in 1992.
Establishment of a European currency is generally viewed as being negative for the mark -- regarded as Europe's premier currency -- because such a move would fuse Germany's currency with those of its economically weaker neighbors and might undermine Germany's economy.
Speculation about Italy's rejoining the rate mechanism pushed the mark near 18-month lows against the lira yesterday, and a spillover effect led to selling of the mark against the dollar and the yen, traders said.
The dollar rose a fraction against the yen, buoyed by the dollar's strength against the mark, traders said.
The gains against the yen were limited, however, as Japanese exporters sought to sell dollars at around 106.80 yen, traders said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Enticing Europe's Shoppers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
For Christie Wright, shopping at the Gap is not really about buying T-shirts or jeans, though she likes to talk about getting "good quality for relatively cheap prices." It's about her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, growing up, watching Gap ads on MTV, and getting a dose of America and its styles, all while shopping near home on Oxford Street. So these days Mrs. Wright bypasses the nearby Stefanel boutique and ventures into the Gap.
"It appeals to kids," Mrs. Wright said, as she left the Gap one recent morning, laden with purchases. But not just "kids." In addition to spending 60, about $90, on Charlotte, Mrs. Wright paid as much for T-shirts, jeans and other clothes for herself. 
 The Wrights are hardly alone in being smitten by American styles. After years of seeing American fashions on television or on favorite rock and movie stars, Europeans have become hooked on the casual American look. So over the last decade, American retailers have moved into Britain and, increasingly, are taking the leap to the Continent.
As their presence approaches critical mass, the American marketers are exporting not just a fashion sensibility but ways of doing business that are beginning to transform merchandising in Europe just as they have in the United States. Specialty chains and outlet stores, quick to put goods on sale and to seed racks with trendy merchandise, are supplanting small independent retailers, whose inefficiencies and high prices get much of the blame for stagnating consumption on the Continent.
Nowhere are the trends more apparent than in clothing. Gap Inc., which entered Britain in 1987, now has 71 stores in three European countries, and is fast opening more in France and Germany. Esprit de Corp., the San Francisco clothing maker, has 121 European stores, plus many Esprit sections in department stores. Levi Strauss, with 278 stores in Western Europe, is plunging into the formerly Communist East. The Foot Locker unit of the Woolworth Corporation, which hit Germany in 1987, now has 216 European locations and plans a big expansion.
But clothes are not all that America is hawking across Europe. Toys "R" Us has 201 stores in Europe and Blockbuster Video, part of National Amusements Inc., has 764. Walt Disney and the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner are opening European stores as fast as they can find locations.
For American merchants, the main lure is "anticipation of stagnation in America," said Joseph H. Ellis, a retail analyst at Goldman, Sachs in New York.
For European merchants, the result is upheaval on a grand scale. Few Americans may realize it as they browse the tiny boutiques off the Via del Corso in Rome or the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris , but in the last 10 years the share of women's clothing sold through independent retailers in Italy has dropped to two-thirds, from three-quarters, while the share sold at chains and low-price outlets has surged. In France, the independents' share has dropped to one-third, from half.
Despite trying to defend themselves by, say, forming purchasing consortiums, small retailers are being swept away by chains like Hennes & Mauritz of Sweden and Zara of Spain or hypermarkets like those run by Carrefour of France. Increasingly, American chains are profiting from the upheaval.
The Americans do not have it easy. Since malls are still rare, chains like the Gap must bid for high-rent sites on city streets. In some countries, like Germany and the Netherlands, store operating hours are restricted. In the United States, the Gap opened 59 of its Old Navy stores in the first year of that venture; in Britain, it took 10 years to open that many Gap stores.
Retail experts hope the American influence will result in higher productivity and, ultimately, lower prices, increased sales and new jobs.
"I suspect that if Europe is serious about unemployment it will develop its service industries, as in the United States and even in Britain, and one way is to get better at retailing," said William Cullum, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London.
Indeed, American retailers often begin in Britain because, after the deregulation wrought in the 1980's by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, bureaucratic hurdles and costs are lower than in the rest of Europe. Given the weakness of British unions and the lower social security tax payments in Britain, Mr. Cullum estimates, personnel costs can be 50 percent to 60 percent lower than in Germany.
The European success of chains like the Gap is in large measure a result of applying formulas that worked at home.
To assure low prices, the Gap contracts for deliveries of clothing from manufacturers in low-wage countries like Spain and Portugal. To stay abreast of changing fashions, the company feeds new designs and colors into its stores every four to six weeks, compared with four or five times a year for other European retailers. Moreover, wherever the practice is legal, the Gap continually clears inventory by lowering prices on slow-moving items, rather than relying on seasonal sales.
Not that European companies cannot do these things. But analysts say companies like the Gap, accustomed to the size and competitiveness of the United States, often do them better. "The Gap has structural advantages; it has the capability to react to market trends," said Yoram Gutgeld, a retail consultant at the Milan, Italy, office of McKinsey & Company.
In Europe, where stores are smaller, the Gap often has to make do with about 11,000 square feet, the minimum size for its United States outlets. That means there is usually not enough room to combine a regular Gap with a Gap Kids outlet, which is frequently done in the United States. Instead the Gap Kids are separate stores.
Because of delivery problems, the Gap does not sell shoes in Europe, except for infants' and children's footwear. In France, its sizes are smaller, because the French tend to be smaller; in Germany, colors are darker, matching Germans' preferences. Moreover, Gap stores on the Continent do without "greeters," salespeople who welcome shoppers at the door, because Europeans tend to feel the greeters are intimidating.
Still, Gap executives have no doubt that all their products are marketable in Europe.
"We feel that each of our corporate brands -- Gap, Gap Kids, Baby Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy Clothing Company -- can be successful overseas," said William Fisher, the president of Gap International.
As American retailers spread across the Continent, the going gets rougher.
For one thing, while European consumers once were more focused on quality than Americans, slow economic growth and mounting unemployment are making them more sensitive to costs.
"Europeans are now much more price-conscious," said Birgit Kelley, managing director for licensing at Esprit International.
Moreover, the countries next in line to face the American invasion, like Spain, Italy, and France, have strong textile industries.
"This is where companies like the Gap will have it tough," Mr. Gutgeld of McKinsey said.
Increasingly, too, experts say, America's merchandisers will be squeezed by the very revolution they helped set in motion. Even as independent retailers are being killed off, the American chains face the accelerated growth of hypermarkets and manufacturers' outlets, despite bitter resistance from traditional retailers and their lobbies.
European clothing companies like Hugo Boss or furniture manufacturers like Ikea have long operated big suburban outlets, but now developers of factory-outlet malls, including American giants like McArthur/ Glen Realty, are accelerating their plans.
In 1993, McArthur/Glen teamed up with the British Airports Authority to build factory-outlet villages in Britain -- big shopping centers that cluster outlets for clothing, leather goods and other products. Last year, the group opened the first such center on the Continent, outside Troyes, France, southeast of Paris.
Though the French Government recently passed measures to curb such development on the outskirts of towns, and resistance is mounting in Germany and Italy, a recent report by the Richard Ellis real estate group concluded that the concept had been "already implanted" in Europe, and it seemed "only a matter of time before the developers win out."
As for American retailers, this is the type of environment they grew up in, and they are confident they can stay in the race.
"You can point to television, movies or other media" as the source of Europeans' love affair with American fashion, Mr. Fisher of the Gap said. "But the fact was there for everyone to see, and we took advantage of it."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
After Ford takes a greater hand, Mazda consolidates its ad account in Japan.

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IN a departure from the usual practice in Japan, the Mazda Motor Corporation has chosen to concentrate all its advertising with Hakuhodo Inc., Japan's No. 2 agency behind Dentsu Inc.
Generally, Japanese auto makers use different agencies for different models; Mazda had had its account at Dentsu and two other shops. The decision to consolidate the account appears to be guided by the Ford Motor Company, which took effective control of the financially ailing Mazda this month and is trying to turn it around, in part by adopting some American practices. 
 Mazda said it hoped that the concentration of its advertising with a single agency would improve its brand image. From 1990 to 1995, the company's sales in Japan declined by 40 percent. Saving money also seems to be a big factor behind the decision, analysts said.
The move follows the consolidation of the Nissan Motor Company's account at a single agency a few years ago, which created waves in the advertising world. Nissan also chose Hakuhodo. (Concerns about conflicts of interest among Japanese marketers are much less prevalent than in the United States, where the idea that, say, Ford and General Motors would both use the same agency would be heretical.)
A Nissan spokesman said that having a single agency would allow that agency's marketing experts to participate in the conception and planning of a new model, rather than getting involved only after the model was virtually completed. In some sense, this is like the Japanese keiretsu system, in which longtime parts suppliers linked with a single auto maker participate in the design of a car.
Takeshi Saito, an editor at Kokoku Journal, an advertising magazine, said the moves by Nissan and Mazda did not constitute a trend. Rather, he said, the two cases simply marked victories for Hakuhodo, which has long played the Avis to Dentsu's Hertz in the Japanese advertising wars.
Certainly, Hakuhodo appears to be on a hitting streak. Last year it introduced commercials for Nissan featuring Ichiro Suzuki, a young baseball star. The campaign helped lift the sales of Nissan, the second-largest auto company in Japan after the Toyota Motor Corporation, after several years of decline.
Hakuhodo stayed on the mound and produced the counterattack ads for Toyota, another client. Those featured Hideo Nomo, the Japanese pitcher who has become a star for the Los Angeles Dodgers and a hero in his home country.
Tetsuji Shimizu, a spokesman for Dentsu, said the agency had tried to sign Mr. Nomo but lost out to Hakuhodo. "It's been a little irritating for Dentsu," he said. "But we still have the largest share of Toyota ads."
Toyota is sticking with its policy of using four agencies, including Dentsu and Hakuhodo. A review is conducted among the shops for the advertising of each new model. Toyota believes that the competition leads to more creative advertising, a company spokesman said.
The Mazda account change has occurred as sales of automobiles in Japan have been growing again after several years of declines during Japan's long recession. The market recovery has fueled a feverish war in automobile advertising as makers scramble for market share.
The consolidation in Japan does not affect the account of Mazda's American unit, Mazda Motor of America, which remains at the Santa Ana, Calif., office of Foote, Cone & Belding, part of True North Communications. After trade publications reported that Foote, Cone's hold on that account, with billings estimated at $200 million, was loosening, the office underwent substantial changes in management and the Mazda campaign was revamped to introduce the theme "Passion for the Road." Still, speculation continues that the account could be placed in review if Mazda's American sales slump is not reversed.

HEADLINE: Export Boom In Services Cuts Growth in U.S. Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Erasing about half of a huge January increase, the nation's trade deficit shrank to $8.2 billion in February as sales of American services abroad rose to records, the Commerce Department reported today.
Exports over all climbed 2 percent to the second-highest total on record while imports fell five-tenths of 1 percent. It was the first time since November that the deficit had narrowed. 
 The deficit was about $400 million less than expected, and was accompanied by a downward revision of that amount for January. But private analysts noted two main reasons for the contraction and said that neither was likely to be repeated soon.
One was a big drop in the cost of imported petroleum products, which tumbled $1 billion, to $4 billion. The other was a surge in exports of civilian aircraft in the aftermath of a strike at the Boeing Company, which was settled in December.
Nonetheless, the Clinton Administration seized on the results as an affirmation of its trade practices. In the early Presidential primaries, some of the Republican aspirants asserted that many American workers had been idled as a result of free trade policies.
"Our improved trade picture reflects the ongoing improvement in the competitiveness of the U.S. economy, its productivity growth and innovation, and our own efforts to open the doors of foreign markets to American products," said Mickey Kantor, the former United States trade representative, whom President Clinton named to succeed the late Ronald H. Brown as Secretary of Commerce.
Many economists said that the strong performance in trade, which accounted for much of the economy's skimpy growth in the final three months of 1995, would weigh down performance in the current quarter and might contribute little for the balance of the year.
"The message is that U.S. exports are competitive but they are being held back by softness in some of our major markets," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. He said that European economies were "still wallowing around" and that the dollar's rise against the yen would limit further increases in exports to Japan.
Still, today's report confirmed a marked recent improvement in the American deficit with Japan. It edged up $100 million, to $3.9 billion, in February, but that was down from $4.7 billion in February 1995.
Matthew Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, cited the lower deficit with Japan as a chief reason for the overall narrowing of the nation's trade imbalance in the last year.
The deficit with China moved down $300 million, to $2.4 billion, in February, but that was up from $1.9 billion in February 1995. Unlike the aggregate figures, those for individual countries are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
Today's report also showed a $500 million narrowing of the deficit with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner, to $1.4 billion; an unchanged deficit with Mexico at $1.3 billion, and a halving of the deficits with Western Europe ($460 million) and four newly industrial Asian countries ($815 million).
The rise in exports for the month was $1.3 billion, to $68.1 billion, with civilian aircraft accounting for just over half the increase, today's report showed. Imports eased $400 million, to $76.3 billion, dominated by the 20 percent drop in petroleum purchases. Imports of motor vehicles and parts were virtually unchanged.
Economists said they would be watching closely to see how these goods sold. "It will either turn out that importers guessed right, and U.S. demand picks up sharply, or they will have bet wrong and be facing another inventory problem later this spring," said David Orr, a senior economist for First Union National Bank in Charlotte. "We'd bet on the latter."
The Commerce Department said it now calculated the January deficit at $9.9 billion, down from $10.3 billion first reported late last month.
February's record export performance in services -- financial, legal, educational, tourist, telecommunications and others -- provided a surplus of $18.4 billion, $600 million higher than in January.
The American surplus in advanced technology products, which briefly disappeared in September and October, climbed to $1.9 billion in February from $560 million in January, the report showed.
Asked at a briefing whether he favored merging the trade representative's office into the Commerce Department, Mr. Kantor replied flatly, "It's not an option."

HEADLINE: Workplace Fears Disputed In Politically Delicate Study

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
In a politically delicate effort to show that it is helping to create jobs that pay well, the Clinton Administration issued a study today that disputes one of the most prevalent stereotypes about the economy, concluding that most new jobs created in the service industries are relatively high-paying executive and management positions.
"The cartoons might make you think these new jobs are all hamburger flippers," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. "In fact, the conventional wisdom is wrong." And the report concludes that another oft-heard joke about the new economy -- "There are 8.5 million new jobs and I've got three of them" -- is also false. The study found no change in the percentage of workers holding more than one job. 
 The council's study was commissioned partly in response to the series of corporate layoffs that seized headlines in recent months. But it also sets the stage for Mr. Clinton to contend that the anxieties over economic change, while understandable, were overblown -- or at least not attributable to layoffs.
"There has just not been that big a change in the displacement rate for workers," Mr. Stiglitz told reporters today. "But the anxieties are real. Perhaps that is because of a 20-year period in which real wages have declined," he said, arguing that the council's data also suggest that incomes are starting to bounce back.
In recent months Mr. Clinton's political advisers have concluded that what matters politically this year is the perception of job insecurity, and that perception could outweigh Mr. Stiglitz's statistics.
A poll conducted by The New York Times in December concluded that nearly three-quarters of all American households have either suffered a layoff, or have friends, relatives or neighbors who have lost their jobs in the last 15 years. And nearly half of those surveyed said they worried that they or someone in their household might be out of work or looking for a job in the next 12 months.
After months of debate about how to handle such perceptions -- and channel them to the President's advantage -- the White House has decided to accentuate the positive. The President is talking a great deal about easing the transition for workers who lose their jobs, with retraining programs and the ability for workers who change jobs to keep their insurance and pensions.
Next month he is scheduled to conduct a "corporate responsibility" conference in Washington, inviting companies that have innovative programs to retain employees and to give them a bigger stake in the profits.
Some of the findings announced today showed significant changes going on beneath the surface in the uncertain world of corporate layoffs. The report found, for example, that in the early 1990's, workers 55 years of age or older were the biggest cohort of laid-off workers, a reversal from the 1980's, when young workers were the first out the door. But the Administration said that it did not yet have the evidence to conclude whether that trend -- layoffs of highly paid, white-collar workers -- accelerated into the first half of this decade.
Most of the details of today's report had been disclosed before publication of the document. The study determined that 68 percent of the net growth in jobs in the last two years were in industry groups and occupations that pay better wages than the median for all workers.
It also concluded that the "vast majority" of new jobs were full time, despite anecdotal evidence that more and more workers were heading into part-time employment. And it concluded that while employment is up sharply, those who lost their jobs were more likely to be dismissed permanently rather than temporarily laid off.
Perhaps the most curious finding in the report -- and the one likely to be most open to dispute -- is the council's conclusion that the big growth in service sector jobs has not come at McDonald's, but at mutual funds and hospitals, software companies and accounting services. And most of those jobs, the council found after parsing numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, came in what Mr. Stiglitz calls "high-wage occupations," in executive suites and among professionals and specialists.
The council sorted data about workers into 45 occupational categories in 22 major industries, creating a total of 990 "industry/occupation cells" -- each representing a group of workers. After eliminating small "cells" from the analysis because they did not contain enough workers to be statistically significant, the council found that more than two-thirds of all the new jobs created in the last two years paid more than $480 a week, the current median earnings for all jobs in the United States.
"Employment in 'hamburger-flipping jobs' actually fell between 1994 and 1995," the report concludes, defining those as workers at food counters, in the kitchen and in other food-preparation jobs.
That finding is somewhat at odds with other studies that covered years running up to 1993. "It's true that these managerial jobs are growing quickly," said Van Doorn Ooms, the director of research at the Committee for Economic Development, which next month is releasing a major study of some of the same phenomena entitled "American Workers and Economic Change."
"But we also find strong growth at the low end -- the hamburger flippers."
It is possible both findings are correct: There is no standard way of categorizing workers, and different studies frequently divide and define workers and their jobs in different ways.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Britain Object to Iraq Oil Plan

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 23

 BODY:
The United States and Britain announced today that they want extensive changes in a draft plan to allow Iraq to sell up to $2 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine for its suffering civilians.
They portrayed the tightening of the proposal as a way to prevent Baghdad from "manipulating" the accord to weaken the sanctions imposed by the Security Council after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
 Iraq has bitterly criticized the proposed changes, saying that the United States and Britain had interfered just as it was close to an agreement with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that would have relieved much of the poverty and suffering that six years of sanctions have inflicted on the country.
Diplomats said that Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, who rejected two earlier offers as an insult to his country's sovereignty, must now decide whether to continue negotiating on the revised proposal or break off talks altogether.
A statement issued by the United States mission to the United Nations said that both countries have made proposals to insure that the plan will have the intended effect. The statement said the aim was to prevent Baghdad from manipulating the oil sales agreement "for its own ends."
While officials involved praised the Secretary General's performance in negotiations so far, they made clear that the United States and Britain see the agreement he is proposing as one that Mr. Hussein might exploit to his own advantage.
Specifically, the officials said that the resolution provides for $150 million out of every $1 billion worth of oil sold to be used by the United Nations to pay for its relief program in three predominantly Kurdish northern provinces that have broken away from Baghdad and are under the military protection of the Gulf war allies. As a result, the United States and Britain do not want the agreement to give Baghdad any say in which goods are purchased for the north or how they are distributed.
"It's our view that the Iraqis will take any opportunity they can to increase their influence in the north," a senior official said.
The United States and Britain also object to a United Nations proposal that Baghdad be allowed to select the bank where an escrow account will be opened to hold money paid for the oil Iraq sells and take out letters of credit to pay for food and supplies for Iraqi civilians. That risks giving Iraq access to the international banking system, a privilege not permitted under the sanctions.
Finally, while the United States and Britain are prepared in principle to let Iraq use its Government's existing rationing system to distribute the food it buys with the oil proceeds, they say the fairness of such a system should be checked and monitored. The plan is supposed to provide basic staples to every family.
Iraq's Christian minority and the Shiite communities of the south frequently complain that they do not receive their correct entitlement. And a United Nations human rights report in March said the military and senior Government officials enjoy more generous rations than ordinary people.
On Monday, Iraq's top negotiator, Amir Abdul al-Anbari, complained that the British and American intervention led the Secretary General to make changes in "almost every paragraph" of an accord he had said was close to completion. Today Mr. Anbari postponed further negotiations until Wednesday, saying he needed more time for consultations with Baghdad.
The Clinton Administration has pushed hard for the new oil-for-food deal. And last week the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said she wanted an early agreement in part because it would remove the argument that sanctions be lifted altogether to provide for the needs of civilians.

HEADLINE: Technology Stocks Lead Gains in Market

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Another encouraging earnings report in the computer industry sent technology stocks shooting higher again yesterday. The powerful rally lifted the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth straight record and brought its gains to 6.3 percent in less than two weeks.
A jump in oil prices helped lift the struggling Dow Jones industrial average, but hurt airline stocks. 
 The Dow industrials rose 23.85 points, mostly on gains in its three oil stocks, to close at 5,588.59. The Dow spent much of the session with a gain of less than 10 points, once again lagging behind the broader market's record-setting trend over the last week.
Technology stocks, which have resumed their leadership role after a sharp selloff that began late last year, rallied strongly after Digital Equipment issued the latest in a series of strong earnings reports that indicate the industry is not as badly off as feared.
The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology issues, plowed further into record territory, rising 13.26, to 1,166.76. Nasdaq volume exceeded 650 million shares for the first time, with 650.1 million traded. The old record was 641.1 million shares, set Feb. 22.
The American Stock Exchange's market value index, also weighted with technology and other small- company issues, gained 3.36, to 590.73, setting its sixth straight high. It has risen more than 3.5 percent in about two weeks.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 13 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy at about 453 million shares, well above Monday's pace.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500 list -- both dominated by larger companies that surged earlier this year before sputtering in recent weeks -- posted modest gains. The New York Stock Exchange composite rose 1.78, to 349.60, and the S.& P. 500 rose 3.69, to 651.58.
The continuing weakness in long-term bonds has created an uncertain outlook for blue-chip stocks, said Thom Brown, market strategist at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood in Philadelphia.
The 30-year Treasury bond slid yesterday, with its interest rate rising to 6.77 percent. Stock prices often fall with bonds because higher interest rates raise corporate borrowing costs and slow consumer spending.
Higher rates "mean trouble for basic industry issues" like the Dow industrials, Mr. Brown said.
The Dow was bolstered by its three oil-stock components -- Chevron, Texaco and Exxon -- which rose with crude prices amid news that the United States and Britain have pushed the United Nations to toughen its negotiating position with Iraq over a possible oil-for-food deal.
Despite strong earnings reports, energy stocks struggled Monday amid indications of progress in the Iraq talks. An increase in world crude supplies could lower prices, hurting oil company profits.
In commodities trading yesterday, short-term contracts for crude oil jumped 5 percent, and oil stocks followed suit. Exxon rose 2 5/8, to 84 5/8; Chevron rose 1 7/8, to 57 5/8, and Texaco rose 1 3/4, to 85 5/8, as the Dow's three biggest gainers.
But the increase in oil prices hurt airline stocks. The Dow Jones transportation average fell nearly 1 percent.
Digital Equipment, up 5 1/4, to 60 5/8, reported that its quarterly earnings rose 68 percent as the computer maker posted strong sales increases in its storage and server lines.
Among other Big Boardtechnology issues, Motorola rose 2 1/4, to 61 3/4; Compaq Computer gained 1 1/2, to 43 7/8, and Texas Instruments rose 1 3/4, to 85 5/8. But I.B.M., down 1/4, to 107, continued to struggle in the aftermath of a cautious outlook issued by the company last week.

HEADLINE: Times Square Heralds Megastore

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
"Good glitz," said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Commission, looking somewhat sheepish yesterday, his pants legs soaked with champagne, amid a crush of shoppers and curiosity seekers at the opening of the Virgin Megastore Times Square.
"This is showboating, but that never hurt in Times Square," he said. 
 So it was during the big, brash and thoroughly hyped opening of what the Virgin Group, a British company, calls the largest record, movie, book and multimedia store on earth. At 75,000 square feet, spread over three floors on Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets, the store has emerged as the most dynamic commercial enterprise to sprout from the redevelopment of the Times Square area.
Over the last year, the redevelopment effort has made its greatest strides yet, with corporations seeking to get a piece of Times Square's overhaul before all the property is gobbled up.
But many of those deals have yet to change the landscape of the area, and the Virgin Megastore is a sign of what may lie ahead.
"Times Square is the heart of America," said Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, a master of marketing and hyperbole who had wetted the legs of Mr. Millard and other top development officials while christening the store. Mr. Branson made the comments after he was lowered on a huge New Year's-style silver ball from 100 feet above the store.
"We would like to congratulate city and state officials for doing a great job in improving the character of Times Square," he said.
Virgin said the store would have a vast selection of music and entertainment products and promotions similar to those offered by the megabookstores that have opened across the country. For example, it will promote appearances by celebrity musicians and other performers, including appearances this week by the rock group Foo-Fighters and the actor Mark Hamill.
The store will include a cafe, and its lower level provides the only entrance to a four-screen Sony movie theater, which is to open today.
Yesterday, the fate of the neighborhood's best known building -- One Times Square, where the real New Year's Eve ball is lowered -- became clearer when Jeffrey Katz, a Manhattan developer who bought the building a year ago, said in an interview that he planned to begin extensive renovations within six months.
Mr. Katz plans to strip the facade of the building and replace it on all sides, partly with glass but mostly with large neon signs. He said he also planned to develop four to six floors of retail space at the base of the building, and had been interviewing potential tenants, like restaurants and entertainment-related stores.
Virgin's opening was just one of several store openings in the area of 42d Street and Broadway, where vendors like the Foot Locker and the Magic Max stores have opened in recent months, replete with neon signs, as required by the city for all new stores in the neighborhood.
By June 1, according to state officials who are coordinating the redevelopment of 42d Street, business openings at the intersection will include Hansen's Times Square Brewery Restaurant, operated by a German company; a Ferrara's delicatessen, operated by Ferrara's of Little Italy; Cinema Ride, a virtual-reality emporium, and O'Lunney's, a tavern.
By November, other openings are expected to include an Ellen's Stardust Diner and a Disney Store. The Disney Store, at the southwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, will be next to the New Amsterdam Theater, which Disney is renovating and expects to open by next spring.
The surge of new commercial activity comes after 15 years of lawsuits, public protests and delays over plans by city and state officials to redevelop Times Square.
Urban planners and retail analysts said yesterday that the opening of the Virgin Megastore represented a critical turning point for the neighborhood, because other businesses would quickly follow on its heels.
"Virgin has created a major retail footprint in an area where no one would venture, and it's a brilliant move," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of economics and planning at New York University. "They are going to be to the 1990's what Bloomingdale's was to the 1980's."
Virgin executives said yesterday that they began planning their Times Square store three years ago, but had at first questioned whether enough progress would be made in clearing blight from the surrounding blocks.
"We looked at the heritage of Times Square as an entertainment center and an international crossroads and decided it was the best possible place for our American flagship store," said Brian Regan, a spokesman for Virgin, which operates five other United States record stores and is planning more.
Now, he said, "we are an extension of the energy and vibe that is happening in Times Square."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as a surprisingly strong Treasury auction pulled bonds off their lows of the day.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 12/32, to 90 4/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.77 percent, from 6.74 percent on Monday. The short end of the market bounced back more strongly in the afternoon, with the rate of the three-month bill falling one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 4.96 percent. The yields of the existing one-year, two-year and three-year bills ended unchanged. 
 Treasury prices were under pressure early in the session as traders and dealers were busy positioning themselves ahead of an $18.75 billion auction of two-year notes. A sharp rise in a weekly retail sales survey and reports showing a narrowing of the nation's trade gap and a rise in import prices prompted market participants, wary of any sign of accelerating inflation, to sell off securities.
But prices recovered after the auction exceeded expectations.
The new two-year notes were awarded at a high yield of 5.939 percent, lower than the 5.95 percent market participants had expected. Traders said bids were more aggressive, with good investor demand.
The sale was especially impressive given that the Treasury auctioned new two-year and five-year notes just weeks ago. Nonetheless, yesterday's auction of two-year notes was $500 million larger than the previous one.
Today, the Treasury auctions $12.5 billion of new five-year notes. Larry M. Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that the volume of interest in the two-year auction led him to expect that the five-year note would receive a similar degree of interest, and ease concerns about supply ahead of next week's report on April employment.
Some traders and analysts, however, expect the auction of five-year notes may not be as successful. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.28 percent.
Several reports pointing to mounting inflation depressed prices early in the session. The Commerce Department said that the nation's trade deficit shrank to $8.2 billion in February, suggesting that economic growth was picking up. In a separate report, the Labor Department said that import prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March.
But analysts said the data also showed signs of weakness.
For example, the gain in import prices was chiefly a result of oil prices, an often volatile category, which surged 7.1 percent in March.
And Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company, said that despite February's improvement, he expected the trade deficit would widen for the first quarter. "A decline in net exports will be a drag on first-quarter gross domestic product growth, holding it to around a 1.5 percent rate," he said. It should also further ease market fears that inflation will accelerate.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.939%
Low Yield . . . 5.890%
Median Yield . . . 5.922%

HEADLINE: WHAT ROOMS MAY BE WEARING NEXT YEAR;
Give Me That Old-Time Millennium

BYLINE: By LIZ SEYMOUR 

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C., April 21

 BODY:
On Day 3 of the International Home Furnishings Market, the world's largest retail furniture expo, buyers hurrying between showroom buildings paused while the skies darkened and the temperature dropped. A funnel cloud that someone reported at the city limits never did touch down, but weather remained on everyone's mind.
Retailers from the Northeast and Midwest arrived at the semiannual market after a disastrous winter of record snowfalls. Continued consumer caution and the rumble of higher interest rates did not improve their mood. 
 "Our business was basically devastated for three months," said Elliot Rubin, who opened the New York area's first La-Z-Boy store in Cedar Grove, N.J., in November.
Shipments of new furniture in the $48.7 billion industry were down 2 percent in the first two months of this year, the American Furniture Manufacturers Association said.
This spring, it was a "Waiting to Exhale" market without clearly developed trends. The 2,300 showrooms generally displayed a kind of end-of-millennium nostalgia. A shift toward yellow-green and dark finishes evoked the 1940's, the 50's, the 60's and even the 70's.
Mohair, tweed and chrome (the last used lavishly by Ralph Lauren in a $15,885 four-poster bed and an $8,265 trestle table for Henredon), threatened to return. Even "Mediterranean," a word all but banned from the design lexicon for two decades, was back, most notably in Thomasville's 115-piece Renaissance Collection of ornate, large-scale furniture. Goods ordered at the April market will not appear in stores until the fall.
Along with the color shift came a definite tilt toward Europe, away from Shaker, Mission and other American designs of the last few years. France was the country of choice, but the design menu was more Julia Child than Brillat-Savarin.
Baker unveiled a Directoire bed in its Historic Charleston group, and Hickory Chair redrew international boundaries with French Canadian pieces in its American Digest line.
"This is European styling for the American market," said Tom Tilley, senior vice president of Century Furniture, which uses a robot to distress and add gouge marks and wormholes to the maple wood in its new Town and Country collection.
Even contemporary style was spoken with a French accent. The Art Deco designer Jean-Michel Frank, who died in 1941, was the most famous trend setter not actually in attendance. His angular work inspired the carriage-trade maker John Widdicomb as well as Mitchell Gold, whose customers include Pottery Barn.
The droopy slipcovered look (Early Windstorm) was clearly on its way out. The freshest upholstered chairs and sofas looked tailored and taut, as though someone had put a skate key in the back of each and given it a few turns.
Out, too, was rumpled washed linen and faded chintz: new fabrics often mixed cotton with a little rayon or polyester. Just enough for sheen; not enough to raise your barometric pressure.
 
Restoring the Shop Of a Native Son
MILTON, N.C. -- THE lone stoplight in Caswell County blinks green and red at the crossroads in this tiny town (population 200) near the Virginia border. Two blocks away sits the half-burned shell of the 1815 Union Tavern, shored up with timbers and surrounded by yellow tape.
Union Tavern was once the workshop of Thomas Day, a rare free African-American cabinetmaker whose antebellum customers included the Governor, the University of North Carolina and local tobacco barons; at one time, Day's was the largest furniture making operation in the state. Efforts to restore the tavern, burned in a grassfire in 1989, have brought together a biracial coalition of Caswell County's citizens who hail Thomas Day as their most distinguished native son.
Restoration came one step closer with the introduction at the International Home Furnishinas Market of Craftique Furniture's Thomas Day Collection. The collection is made up of 18 reproductions of Day's Empire and Federal-style designs in mahogany and includes bedroom and dining room furniture. Royalties will go toward the tavern restoration.
"I think he'd be pleased," said Marian Thomas, sipping iced tea in the Craftique showroom at an opening-day party on April 18. Mrs. Thomas heads the committee to re 1/8 store Union Tavern.
"It's a great day for Tom Day," she said.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Doom, Gloom and Some Insults

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"Paul Ehrlich and the Population Bomb," on Channel 13 tomorrow night, is an admiring profile of the environmental Cassandra who has been issuing warnings for three decades about overpopulation in the poorest countries and overconsumption in the richest countries. Despite improvements in farming and health that have given ammunition to critics of his famous 1968 polemic, "The Population Bomb," his predictions of famine and revolution remain as dire as ever.
A few of the critics are heard from in this hour, notably Julian Simon, a University of Maryland economist who has scored some points off the Ehrlichians, but the hour belongs to Mr. Ehrlich. David Suzuki, the Canadian geneticist and television personality who narrates, is positively adoring, and Mr. Ehrlich himself remains as self-assured as he was in the 1970's when, sideburns reaching toward his chin, he often showed up on the "Tonight" show. He told Johnny Carson then, "I do believe doom is coming," and he is saying pretty much the same thing now. 
 Never given to understat'ment or diffidence, this Stanford University specialist in butterflies shows he can still get off some pithy insults. He describes creationists as "a group of morons"; he puts down "flacks of the pesticide i'dustry," who, he adds "have no shame"; he shrugs off most scientists for, unlike himself, doing "dull ignorant work that is of no significance to humanity"; he calls Mr. Simon's assertion that there are no known physical limits to growth "totally imbecilic."t
Dismissing the notion that voluntary birth control can work ("nonsensical"), he has called for "coercion in a good cause," for example forcibly sterilizing Indian men who have more than three children. That has sent a chill even among those who share his concerns. Now in what seems a contradiction or may be, for Mr. Ehrlich, a rare modification, he concedes that birth control cannot be imposed from above and says he finds hope in the increasing education and equality of women in poor countries. How to educate or compel Americans to cut down on consumption, however, remains as daunting as ever.
Mr. Ehrlich and his ally, the physicist John Holdren, now maintain that "The Population Bomb," no laugh riot, was optimistic. They see the world as "close to the edge" of absolute scarcity, with the globe's population heading toward 10 billion by the middle of the next century and Western countries gobbling up the resources needed by the impoverished throngs of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
A program that was less adulatory about the man and more probing about his ideas might have been more illuminating. But at the least, you'll come away understanding why Johnny Carson kept bringing Mr. Ehrlich back.
 
'Rights and Wrongs'
PBS, tonight
(Channel 13, New York, at 10:30)
This sobering series, devoted to dr'wing attention to atrocities around the world, not excepting the United States, begins its fourth season with a look at the China trade in illegal immigrants. Accompanied by a hidden camera and a translator, Jon Alpert, known for his verite camera work, negotiates with middlemen in Fujian Province over the per-body charge for shipping a batch of workers to America. The going street price is upward of $32,000; if you prefer dealing with someone who says he is a Chinese official, that will cost $50,000. The smugglers are called "snakeheads," since they lead a line, or snake, of people.
The program also takes us into a Lower East Side basement packed with immigrants; a maximum security jail in California where some of the unfortunate smugglees on the grounded tramp steamer Golden Venture wound up, and a factory -- also known as a sweatshop -- where a successful immigrant family is making clothes for Brooks Brothers.
In coming weeks, "Rights and Wrongs" travels to Chechnya, the Middle East and Nigeria and looks at the status of women's rights, press coverage of human rights and the doings of the World Bank and the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal. Last season the host, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, took umbrage at charges that the series was tilted to the left; a few weeks should tell whether the right is wrong about that.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Mark Stems Recent Losses, Sending Dollar Modestly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly lower against most leading currencies yesterday in light trading as the German mark staged a moderate recovery from a week of selling.
A lower bond-market close and some lower stock prices also helped pull the dollar down against the mark and the Japanese yen. 
 The mark had been pummeled for a week since Germany lowered its interest rates and an election in Italy revived hopes for European monetary union. Yesterday, currency traders took profits on the dollar's gains against the mark, and the mark recovered some of its lost ground.
But the mark remains weak, hurt by expectations that interest rates will fall further this year and that German monetary authorities want a weaker mark to help bolster exports.
Speculation that the move toward monetary union might be back on track has also hurt the mark, because as Europe's premier currency, it stands to lose the most by a merger with the currencies of Germany's economically weaker neighbors.
Despite the dip of the dollar against the yen and the mark, it remained above highs reached a week ago. The dollar has benefited because higher interest rates have attracted more investors than lower rates in Europe and Japan.
"People are trying to find the next reason to buy dollars," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an investment advisory firm. "The market is still bullish."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.5203 marks from 1.5212 marks on Tuesday. It traded at 106.53 yen, down from 106.67 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5150 from $1.5165.
Traders liked the dollar early in the day after rumors, later denied, that the Japanese central bank was prepared to intervene in the market by buying dollars and selling yen.
According to the rumor, which the bank called "unimaginable," it was asking commercial banks to remain open late and have dollars on hand.
But in New York, American bonds and some stocks lost ground.
"That's why the dollar can't make any ground on the upside," said Hugh Walsh, a foreign exchange vice president at ING Capital Markets Inc. "Obviously, if U.S. assets are being sold off, foreigners need to liquidate dollars in order to liquidate their assets."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
As agency bosses meet, an emphasis on marketing brand names and the growth of new media.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE agenda of the 1996 annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies looks much like those of the last four meetings. But that does not concern the executives who planned the meeting because, as K. C. and the Sunshine Band might proclaim, that's the way -- uh-huh, uh-huh -- they like it.
The reason those executives are reveling in repetition is that the 78th annual meeting of the association, which began yesterday in the sunshine of Indian Wells, Calif., is purposely being focused on a handful of issues that have been deemed significant since 1992, when agencies struggled to emerge from a steep, sustained recession. 
 Before then, the only constant topics from one meeting to the next seemed to be golf and tennis scores. Agendas varied widely -- and sometimes wildly -- as issues went in one year and out the other.
The issues on the agenda for the 1996 meeting, which continues through tomorrow at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort, near Palm Springs, include the importance of demonstrating to skeptical marketers how powerful advertising can be in selling brand-name products to consumers, finding ways to help agencies exploit the explosive growth of the new media and assisting agencies in recruiting and retaining a diverse work force.
"We're coalescing around common interests to advance the cause of the industry," said Burt Manning, chairman and chief executive of the J. Walter Thompson Company unit of the WPP Group in New York. He is the 1995-96 chairman of the association, which is also known as the Four A's.
"We're very much committed to programs that work toward a realistic view of how advertising builds brands," Mr. Manning said, "that focus on on-line advertising and how to make it accountable and that look to increasing the diversity of the staffs of the agencies."
David Bell, the 1995-96 vice chairman of the Four A's, agreed, praising the "continuity and consistency" of the agendas.
As for efforts to "promote the value of advertising," said Mr. Bell, who is chairman and chief executive of the Bozell Worldwide unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt in New York, he would like to underline how crucial it could be to marketers "by moving the argument directly to return on investment and shareholder value."
In fact, he added, "I'd like the theme of the 1997 meeting to be on the effectiveness of enduring advertising." Mr. Bell's thoughts about next year's agenda are relevant because at a business session yesterday afternoon, he was elected the 1996-97 chairman of the association.
The new media, particularly interactive media like the Internet, will be the subject of several sessions at the 1996 meeting.
"We're trying to balance some of the hype," O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the Four A's, said in a telephone interview from his New York office before the meeting. "Everyone knows there's an Internet. Now comes the hard slogging: the consumer figuring out how to use it in an easy way and the agencies figuring out how to use it properly and cost-effectively."
In a speech today, Mr. Drake plans to discuss the results of a survey of member agencies on interactive technology. "Among those agencies involved in building Web sites," he said, "a full 25 percent say that's the only business they have with the client. That means the interactive business is new business."
And of the 203 agencies that participated in the survey, he added, 180, or nearly 89 percent, said they used interactive media in some form.
The concentration of issues to be addressed at the meeting has coincided with a narrowing of the audience at which it is aimed. Once meant to appeal to agency executives whatever their responsibilities, Mr. Drake said, the meeting has since been "positioned very clearly as a meeting for C.E.O.'s."
A conference for agency media executives is now held separately every February, he added, and the first conference for agency creative executives is set for the fall.
"Broadening the meetings and doing them on a very vertical basis is paying off," Mr. Drake said, citing combined attendance of almost 1,100 for the 1996 media conference, which drew 640 attendees in Orlando, Fla., and the meeting in Indian Wells, with attendance anticipated at about 420.
Mr. Manning said: "Clearly, this indicates the ability of the Four A's to adapt. If you target, you get more people." And Mr. Bell said the format of multiple meetings "has injected new life" into the concept of annual gatherings.
In addition to Mr. Bell's election, Ralph Rydholm, chairman and chief executive of the Euro RSCG Tatham unit of Havas Advertising in Chicago, was elected the 1996-97 vice chairman. And Byron Lewis, chairman and chief executive of the Uniworld Group in New York, was elected secretary and treasurer.

Good news for the down and out, or are the data misleading?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHAT'S all this fuss about income inequality? Sure, the richer are richer and the poor are eating Doritos. But not to worry, says W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas: Most Americans struggling to make ends meet are on the fast track to affluence.
They found that just 5 percent of a sample of Americans in the bottom fifth of the income distribution in 1975 were still there 16 years later. Meanwhile, 29 percent of them had managed to grab the brass ring, ending up in the top fifth. And "between opportunity and equality," they remind, "it's opportunity that matters most." 
 The Cox-Alm study, published in the Dallas Federal Reserve's 1995 annual report, is making big waves among the movers and shakers of the political right. Indeed, after a ringing endorsement from the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, it has become required reading for conservatives impatient with the current hand-wringing over the alleged plight of the young and immobile.
But a close look at the new research is not confidence-building. Indeed, even a casual look suggests that something -- actually, many things -- are amiss. "Cox and Alm ask the wrong question and give a misleading answer to the question they ask," argues Peter Gottschalk, an economist at Boston College and co-author of "America Unequal" (Russell Sage Foundation).
Standard measures of income distribution amount to snapshots at a moment in time. The large and growing variations between those at the top and bottom that have been reported by the Census are, of course, cause for disquiet. But liberals and conservatives generally agree that mobility matters, too. And without exception, studies that track the fortunes of individuals or families for many years suggest that lifetime income is distributed far more equally than income in any single year.
The Cox-Alm study is in this tradition. It follows 3,725 individuals ages 16 and over who remained part of the University of Michigan's Panel Survey on Income Dynamics for a 16-year period. And their conclusions are nothing short of remarkable. Of those in the bottom fifth in 1975, 95 percent were earning enough money in 1991 to have jumped in the rankings. Poverty in the 1975 snapshot was apparently no impediment to future economic success. The average income of individuals in the bottom fifth rose by $25,322, even after adjustment for inflation.
Mr. Gottschalk, however, notes that the Dallas researchers use unconventional means to reach these astonishing ends. For one thing, they measure incomes actually earned by individuals, rather than assigning individuals some prorated share of family income. As a result, the average earnings of the bottom fifth in 1975 was just $1,153 -- far less than anyone could actually live on.
Who, then, were these people? Probably not the poorest individuals, but the ones who worked only briefly in 1975. Mr. Gottschalk guesses most of them were part-time workers with marginal links to the formal labor force: students with after-school jobs, housewives who worked at the post office in the Christmas rush, and so forth.
Sixteen years later their average incomes had risen a fantastic 23-fold, to $26,475. To Mr. Gottschalk, this suggests that virtually all the former high school and college students in the sample had full-time jobs in 1991, as did most of the mothers whose children had grown up. "I'd be surprised if my teen-ager, who now earns pocket money delivering newspapers, doesn't do equally well," he allowed.
Mr. Gottschalk says, too, that by tracking individuals over time the Cox-Alm study mingles the impact of real economic mobility with income gains linked to accumulating work experience. It should hardly be surprising that 35-year-old carpenters make more than they did when they were 19-year-old carpenters.
What does all this add up to? "We have long known that mobility partially offsets the impact of inequality," says Van Doorn Ooms, director of research at the Committee for Economic Development. "It's still unclear by how much."
One answer that probably better represents the mainstream in economic research comes from Moshe Buchinsky and Jennifer Hunt of Yale University. In a paper published this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they estimated that averaging family incomes over a four-year period reduced measured inequality by about one-fourth. But they also found that the rate of economic mobility -- the probability of moving from one-fifth of the income distribution to another in any given year -- had actually fallen since 1980.
"Maybe it would make sense to spend less time splitting hairs over what's happened -- and more trying to figure out what can be done for the losers," Mr. Ooms concludes.

Prices Slide After Auction Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities ended lower yesterday, retreating from highs that were reached during the session after an auction of five-year notes was stronger than expected.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 17/32, to 89 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.82 percent, from 6.77 percent on Tuesday. 
 After an auction of two-year notes showed strong interest on Tuesday, expectations ran high in the market.
While prices moved lower as dealers and buyers prepared for the Treasury's sale of five-year notes, sentiment was generally bullish, especially after a report showed that orders for durable goods, excluding the volatile category of transportation equipment, fell 1 percent in March. Total new orders rose 1.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $167.6 billion.
The Commerce Department report was consistent with current expectations for steady, moderate economic growth over the the next six months, said Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio, said, "The market's reaction was positive going into the five-year auction, with the notion that the five-year note would go at a high yield of 6.29 percent."
The high yield in fact came in lower than that, reflecting strong demand for the notes. The Treasury sold $12.5 billion in new five-year notes at a high yield of 6.279 percent.
But the afternoon rally prompted by the strong results of the auction soon ran out of steam on signs that the Wall Street firms that had bought the new notes at auction were having trouble selling them to customers.
Institutional investors showed little interest, said Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, which meant that dealers wound up owning a large chunk of the auction.
Mr. Donne said, "Dealers aggressively bid the five and ended up owning more of it than they were comfortable with."
One way for dealers to clear out some of the excess securities they hold is to discount the prices, which has the effect of raising the yields and making the securities more attractive to investors.
That appeared to be the case late yesterday as the yield on the new five-year note rose to 6.33 percent in when-issued trading, from the 6.279 percent at the auction.
While there was some market relief at the end of the auction, there is still more supply on the way. The Treasury plans to auction new one-year notes today, and the Government's quarterly re-funding of debt is coming. The Treasury will announce the size of those sales next week.
In the municipal market, the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York sold $820 million in bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The bonds, which were rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by Standard & Poor's, were initially priced to yield from 3.75 percent for an issue due in 1997 to 5.35 percent for a bond due in 2008.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High yield . . . 6.279%
Low yield . . . 6.200%
Median yield . . . 6.250%

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Climbs to Record For Fifth Straight Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index climbed to a record for the fifth straight session yesterday as the recent boom in technology and small-company issues made it the busiest day in Wall Street's history.
In contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.69 to close at 5,553.90 on concerns that rising interest rates and inflation would impede earnings growth for big companies. The Dow was off more than 50 points earlier in the session before rebounding slightly. 
 Most broad market measures fell, too, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 10.07 points, to 1,176.83, on record volume and has now risen more than 7 percent in less than two weeks. Nasdaq volume totaled 728.6 million shares, crushing the mark of 650.1 million, set on Tuesday.
The combined trading volume of all United States stock markets totaled 1.353 billion, edging the high of 1.352 billion set last Dec. 15.
Technology stocks have been riding a wave of surprisingly strong earnings reports over the last two weeks. Yesterday Compaq Computer became the latest industry bellwether to help dispel widespread fears of sluggish computer sales that swept the stock market earlier this year.
Compaq, the world's leading personal computer maker, said its profit rose 8 percent and sales jumped 45 percent during the first quarter. Compaq shares jumped 3 1/8, to 47, and investors quickly bid up other rival computer issues as well, including Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard, Dell Computer and Gateway 2000.
Smaller-company stocks, which saw little improvement while the Dow surged earlier this year, also continued their sudden record-setting pace. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies set its fifth straight record and has now risen more than 4.5 percent in less than two weeks.
Analysts said smaller stocks have come into favor because their earnings growth is more likely to outpace bigger companies if the economy continues to improve.
Declining issues, at 1,205, outnumbered advances, 1,168, by a slim margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 494.2 million shares as of 4 P.M., well above Tuesday's pace.
The Big Board's composite index fell 0.64, to 348.96, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.41, to 650.17.
The Amex market value index fell 1.68, to 589.05, ending a six-session streak of record finishes.
Analysts attributed some of the broad market's decline to some poor earnings reports, continuing weakness in the bond market and the dollar's renewed strength against other currencies, which hurts multinational companies that convert foreign revenue to dollars.
Bond prices edged lower after the Commerce Department reported that orders to United States factories for big-ticket durable goods rose 1.4 percent in March, the first gain in three months. Although many analysts had expected little change in orders in March, they predict demand will pick up moderately as the year progresses.
"The market is not as bad as it looks," said Michael Metz, market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. "The real weakness is in consumer nondurables.
"If interest rates go up, valuations on these companies fall. And the rising dollar will hurt when companies translate overseas profits. That's finally sinking in with investors."
Disney shares fell 1 1/8, to 60 5/8, a day after the company reported a first-quarter loss of $25 million, partly because of lower movie profits.
Merck, another consumer-stock component of the Dow industrials, slid 1 3/8, to 60 3/8, as other leading drug stocks also gave ground.
Rite Aid, fell, 1 3/4, to 29 7/8, and Revco D.S., was down 1 7/8, at 24 1/8, after Rite Aid withdrew its $1.8 billion offer to buy Revco D.S. following Government contentions that a merger of the nation's top two drugstore chains would dominate the business in the East and Midwest.
Cigna rose 4 3/8, to 112 1/8, after saying it planned to buy back from investors up to $500 million of its stock.
Wm. Wrigley Jr., the chewing gum maker, was down 3 1/2, to 52 after reporting first-quarter earnings that fell below analysts' expectations. Wrigley also announced it would close its factory in Santa Cruz, Calif., which will reduce earnings in the second quarter ending in June by $12 million, or 10 cents a share.

At Indy, Young Drivers in Old Cars

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced the entry list for the 1996 Indianapolis 500 last week, and it reflected the upside-down nature of things in this year of the boycott: youthfulness where it is the biggest problem (among the drivers) and years of experience where it does the least good (in the cars).
The number of cars entered, 77, is down from just over 100 last year, but the total is good considering that most of the top car owners are skipping the race to protest new qualifying rules and running instead in the U.S. 500 on the same day, May 26. At least 25 of the 1996 Indy entries are cars that are in their fourth or fifth season of racing. 
 The boycott is in response to rules changes announced by the speedway last summer that virtually guarantee 25 of the 33 Indy starting spots to the top cars in the point standing of the new Indy-car series, the Indy Racing League, which was organized by the speedway as a rival to the established circuit conducted by Championship Auto Racing Teams.
Exactly 60 percent of the 35 drivers entered -- 21 -- have never started an Indy 500; only nine drivers have started three or more Indy 500 races. The record for the most rookies in an Indy 500 (other than the first race in 1911) is 19, set in 1919.
One potentially positive consequence of having only 35 drivers fighting for 33 starting spots is that with the chances of being bumped from the lineup so slim, the younger drivers won't have to spend lap after lap in May pushing themselves and their cars to the limit for every last bit of speed. They can concentrate instead on finding a comfortable race-day setup and learning to drive in traffic.
Rookie orientation, set for May 4 to May 6, will probably uncover a few drivers among those 21 first-timers who aren't ready to go over 220 miles an hour, and they will be asked to try again next year. On the other hand, teams can always add drivers, so the exact number of people who will be fighting for the 33 starting spots is not certain.
Even if no more than 33 drivers take a shot at making the lineup, there may still be some pressure on them; the speedway will announce a minimum qualifying speed before qualifying begins.
 
History and Economics 101
 When the Winston Cup cars raced at North Wilkesboro Speedway on April 14, many fans were taking a long, last look at the place, in the belief that it might have been the final appearance of Nascar's top series at its oldest track. But North Wilkesboro's history as a Winston Cup track probably has at least one more chapter.
The North Carolina track, which had its first Nascar race in 1949, is owned by Bruton Smith and Bob Bahre. Smith's company, Speedway Motorsports, also owns Charlotte Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, Bristol International Raceway (each with two Winston Cup dates) and the as-yet-completed Texas Motor Speedway near Fort Worth. Bahre owns New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon.
Each man possesses a lust for what North Wilkesboro now has: two Winston Cup dates. Bahre would like to add a second date to the July Winston Cup race he now has at his track, while Smith desperately needs a cup race to fill the 150,000 seats he is building in Texas -- although two races are closer to what he will need to cover his $110 million construction bill.
The answer seems simple: Bahre could shift one North Wilkesboro date to New Hampshire and Smith could move the other to Texas.
Before that, there is the second 1996 Winston Cup date at North Wilkesboro, on Sept. 29, to deal with. Smith's track is scheduled to be ready by then. But Bahre, who says he paid $8 million for his half of North Wilkesboro, and Smith have been unable to reach an agreement in time to shift that date to either track.
"Bruton Smith is a very difficult man to work with," Bahre said by telephone this week. Smith, Bahre said, is trying to buy back Bahre's half of North Wilkesboro, but Smith can stop talking. "I don't care what he offers me," Bahre said, "I want a second date."
An issue that could create problems is determining the value of North Wilkesboro's assets for tax purposes. In the long term, those two Winston Cup races are certainly worth a lot more at either Bahre's track or Smith's track than they are at North Wilkesboro, which has only about 40,000 seats.
A decision would have to be made soon, since North Wilkesboro will start selling tickets for the September race next Monday. "As far as I'm concerned, they're going to start selling the tickets," Bahre said Tuesday. "We had a deal partly together for this fall, but it fell apart."
 
Psst! Wanna Buy a Car?
 Many CART teams have been selling their 1995 cars to I.R.L. teams. One CART team owner, Derrick Walker, has shown himself to be the man you want to buy a used race car from. One chassis he sold was driven to victory by Buzz Calkins in the first I.R.L. race and another won the only other I.R.L. race so far with Arie Luyendyk driving. But a third car never made it into the hands of its driver, Richie Hearn, because Walker's team crashed it while testing it. Hearn's team got a full refund.

The S.E.C. chief wades into the battle over accounting rules.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE battle over accounting rules is on, and Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is demanding a bigger role than ever in deciding who picks the people who write the rules.
Mr. Levitt is asking that the Financial Accounting Foundation, which chooses the members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, have a majority of public representatives as opposed to representatives of various groups with a stake in accounting rules. And he wants the S.E.C. to have the power to approve who is chosen for the board.
The move comes at a time when corporate financial executives have been putting pressure on the foundation to reform the F.A.S.B. in ways that would increase the power of business to block unwanted accounting standards. 
 In a talk prepared for delivery last night to the Economic Club of Chicago, Mr. Levitt disclosed his initiative and seemed to come out against the effort to increase corporate power in the process, saying that he was trying "to strengthen and safeguard the independence of financial accounting standard-setting."
The Financial Accounting Foundation is charged with raising the money to support the F.A.S.B. and the Government Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules for government agencies, and with naming the members of those boards. And it has the authority to change the way those boards are structured.
Currently, the foundation has 14 trustees, all but one chosen by such various constituency groups as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Executives Institute and the Securities Industry Association. The sole public member, chosen by the other trustees, is Kathryn D. Wriston, a director of various organizations and the wife of Walter B. Wriston, the retired chairman of Citicorp.
In a letter to J. Michael Cook, the foundation's president and the chairman of Deloitte & Touche, a large accounting firm, Mr. Levitt said he thought a majority of the trustees should "consist of individuals with strong public service backgrounds, who are able to represent the public interest, free of conflict."
The F.A.S.B. has come under increasing fire over the years from corporations, which have won a series of concessions but have continued to grumble. The board can now approve standards only by a super-majority vote -- five of its seven members, two of whom come from companies. Using political influence, including a vote of the Senate, the companies forced the board to back down when it tried to force them to report as an expense the value of stock options given to executives and other employees.
When that happened, Mr. Levitt had little to say. But in the wake of an effort by some members of the Financial Executives Institute to force wholesale changes, he appears to have decided to step in and fight.
In his letter to Mr. Cook, Mr. Levitt complained that the F.A.S.B. "is not being adequately reinforced by its parent organization and, thus, its public interest objectives are at risk."
Mr. Cook, in an interview late yesterday, said the trustees would address the issues raised by Mr. Levitt at their meeting on Tuesday, and would act quickly. He added that he hoped decisions on changing the F.A.S.B. would be made within a few months, but it is clear that Mr. Levitt wants those decisions to be made by a reconstituted board.
Just who those people are will be crucial. And finding people who are both disinterested and well informed will be a challenge.
In a telephone interview last night, Kenneth Johnson, the controller of Motorola and one of the executives who has been pushing for changes at the F.A.S.B., said he had not seen Mr. Levitt's letter and could not comment on it. But he added that the F.A.S.B. had to be changed. "They are so enamored with theoretical accounting purity that they are unable to look at the practical effects of what they are trying to do," he said.
Mr. Cook said he wanted to make changes that would enable the board to win "higher approval ratings," although he added that any standard-setter would anger some people, and he said changes clearly were needed to make the board more productive.
But the risk is that in winning approval from the corporate executives who are now the angriest, the eventual loser could be the investors who depend on financial statements. "If standards are drawn, or even seen to be drawn, to favor corporate interests over those of investors, faith in our markets will erode," Mr. Levitt said.

HEADLINE: Florida Facing Crisis in Insurance

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MARY ESTHER, Fla.

 BODY:
Sarah Anderson says that after Hurricane Opal last year, her street in this small Gulf of Mexico town in the Florida Panhandle "looked like a combat zone," with roof shingles strewn about, chimneys blown down and waterfront houses flooded.
That storm was a breeze compared with Hurricane Andrew, which in 1992 ravaged parts of South Florida, causing $16 billion in insured losses that made it the nation's most expensive natural disaster. Mrs. Anderson's house was not damaged by the hurricane, but she got a strong idea of the punishment wind and water could inflict. The deductible on her homeowner's policy is doubling to $500, she said, but she feels almost thankful as a new hurricane season nears. 
 "We feel lucky to have insurance," Mrs. Anderson, 58, said. "We've got a lot of our savings invested in this."
But even homeowners like Mrs. Anderson and her husband, Edwin, 65, are in a fragile position should another major storm hit Florida. The insurance industry here still has not recovered from the financial beating inflicted by Andrew. And although Florida is taking innovative steps to keep private insurers in business and has itself become the second-largest insurer in the state, many companies say they need more help.
Some state officials say some companies are themselves to blame for a problem that they created with low prices to gain market share that have led to overexposure. And a state panel of educators, economists and insurance experts has called Hurricane Andrew a temporary setback in what has been "a history of profitability" for Florida's insurance markets.
But insurance companies note that they risk being wiped out because of Florida's population growth, and because of the increased hurricane activity that was seen last year and is predicted by meteorologists for the next 25 years. Florida officials and private insurers agree that they cannot cover the losses should a catastrophic hurricane hit cities like Miami and Fort Lauderdale in the next few years. Indeed, they say thousands of homeowners, who have experienced an average 72 percent increase in insurance rates since 1992, could be left without enough money to rebuild unless the state and Federal governments made major appropriations.
"We're going in the right direction," said Florida's Insurance Commissioner, Bill Nelson, "but we're in a crisis."
Hurricane Andrew, which caused $10 billion in insured damages to homes, led to the bankruptcy of nine small insurance companies and depleted the profits of bigger ones. More important, it warned insurers that they had underestimated a hurricane's capacity for destruction.
After that storm, Florida created an insurance pool, the Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association, to provide coverage to homeowners dropped by private insurers. State officials say the fund, which has 875,000 customers and a $1.5 billion line of credit, can handle losses similar to those caused by Hurricane Andrew and can turn to bond financing for a larger storm. Private insurers would be assessed to cover claims the fund cannot meet.
But insurers and state officials alike point out that there are limits to what the state can cover, and they warn of difficulties if a hurricane hits a large metropolitan area and causes residential losses of $25 billion to $50 billion. Florida officials add that the state fund was meant to be temporary and that the goal is for private insurers to return to covering all homeowners.
Bills have been introduced in both houses of the State Legislature to ask consumers to share a larger part of the cost of hurricane damage through higher rates and deductibles. But whether covered by the state fund or private insurers, Florida homeowners are already paying higher rates. In high-risk areas like Dade County, which includes Miami, premiums have more than doubled.
Some homeowners are being forced to forgo certain coverage to reduce their costs. Robert Polo, a junkyard operator in Miami who owns a five-bedroom ranch house, said he just dropped coverage for the contents to keep his annual premium at $1,400.
"It's just going through the roof," Mr. Polo said.
The hurricane risk for the private market is made more acute because half of the state's residential customers are insured by only two companies, which now consider themselves dangerously overexposed. The two -- the State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, with a 32 percent market share and the Allstate Insurance Company, with 18 percent -- competed for market share in the 1970's and 1980's by cutting prices. The companies and others estimate their rates are 20 percent to 40 percent below what they need to meet potential losses here.
Commissioner Nelson said the ultimate solution would be a Federal national disaster fund. Meanwhile, he advocates extending for three more years a 1993 moratorium on most policy cancellations and nonrenewals. The moratorium is to expire this month.
The moratorium has helped prevent insurers from dropping policies en masse. Its extension, the Commissioner said, would allow "breathing room" for the state to stabilize the market. He said Florida was already using financial enticements to attract new insurance companies here to pick up policies from the state pool.
Florida has also set up a reserve fund, unique in the country, to reimburse insurers based on their market share for a significant part of losses if a hurricane causes more than $3 billion in residential damages. The fund, established after Hurricane Andrew, has $1 billion in cash from premiums paid by homeowners, and with time is expected to be able to absorb the economic blow of a major storm.
But small insurance companies want additional help, like more pricing freedom from state regulators and an end to the moratorium. And large companies have called for a way to transfer hurricane risk to the state by taking hurricane coverage out of homeowners' policies.
"We're not talking about shifting a burden to taxpayers -- the burden is already there," said Vince Rio, a lawyer for State Farm in Tallahassee. "What we're talking about is how do we get out of this mess."
State legislators who oppose the idea of transferring hurricane risk to the state say the companies want a quick fix. The state panel that last year studied how to avoid an economic catastrophe concluded that hurricane insurance should remain private but recommended capping insurers' losses.
Premiums earned in Florida have generally exceeded losses. In 1994, the panel said, homeowners' losses were $508 million while $1.4 billion in premiums came in.
"One line of thought," Tim Lynch, the panel's staff director, said, "is that they took the risk, why should they be bailed out by the government?"
In the Panhandle, where Hurricane Opal caused a relatively paltry $2.1 billion in damages last year, rebuilding is still going on in areas like Panama City, Destin, Mary Esther and Navarre as another active hurricane season is being forecast. William Gray, a hurricane forecaster at Colorado State University, has predicted 11 named storms, including two major hurricanes, for the season.
Florida waits.
"If we have another big hurricane," Mr. Nelson said, "all bets are off."

HEADLINE: New Teeth at the F.T.C. (Fangs to Some);
Commissioner Steps Up Antitrust Work and Broadens the Agency's Role

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
About a month after William Baer handed the Justice Department a humiliating courtroom defeat, deflating its effort to prove that the General Electric Company had rigged the prices of industrial diamonds, the antitrust lawyer was approached about a new job.
His visitor early last year was Robert Pitofsky, a colleague of Mr. Baer's at the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter, and President Clinton's nominee to be chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. Mr. Pitofsky's proposal: that Mr. Baer turn his skills to work for the Government by heading the arm of the F.T.C. that scrutinizes mergers and antitrust issues. 
 Lawyers describe the hiring of Mr. Baer as a classic move by Mr. Pitofsky, lining up the toughest and brightest for his side of a legal cause. Over a long career in academia and government, the 66-year-old scholar has built a reputation as a low-key but aggressive Washington insider able to get difficult jobs done without ruffling too many feathers.
Under Mr. Pitofsky's predecessor as chairman, Janet Steiger, the F.T.C. had begun shaking off the slumber that critics said characterized the agency during the Reagan era. But Mr. Pitofsky appears to be building an agency that is both more litigious and more eager to push antitrust regulation in new directions as mergers reshape the corporate scene.
No one has suggested that Mr. Pitofsky is going to take the same high-flying approach as Anne K. Bingaman, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, who has brought a number of ambitious cases like the G.E. action only to see them fail. Nonetheless, there is little doubt among antitrust experts that Mr. Pitofsky has begun putting his own stamp on the F.T.C.
"He is interested in bringing cases that set policies and precedent rather than garden-variety cases that the staff says we can win," said Kevin Arquit, a former general counsel and director of the agency's bureau of competition and now a partner at the law firm of Rogers & Wells.
Just yesterday, the Rite Aid Corporation said it would drop its proposed $1.8 billion purchase of Revco D.S. Inc. after the F.T.C. repeatedly threatened legal action, arguing that a merger of the nation's two largest drugstore chains would sharply increase prices. For the first time, the agency rejected a merger on the ground that it would not only raise prices for individual consumers but also for large buyers of prescription drugs, like the discount plans offered to employees by companies.
A little more than a year into Mr. Pitofsky's seven-year term as chairman, legal experts said they expected his tenure to be judged as a time of evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, change. Beyond the traditional focus on maintaining competition, he is prodding the commission to analyze whether deals impede innovation or whether the efficiencies gained in mergers can offset any losses in competition.
"When two companies join, one question is whether you are bulking up to become a power buyer or you are trying to change to become more efficient," he said.
Even those who differ with Mr. Pitofsky on antitrust issues acknowledge that he brings a wealth of experience to his position. He headed the F.T.C.'s consumer-protection arm from 1970 to 1973, and served as an F.T.C. commissioner in the Carter Administration. For most the 1980's, he was dean of the Georgetown University Law Center, and he has written extensively on antitrust issues and frequently testified before Congress.
"It is not invariably true that when someone gets a Government job they know what they are doing," said Joe Sims, an antitrust lawyer in Washington. "But over the past 20 years, Bob Pitofsky has been one of the premier Democratic antitrust experts."
Mr. Pitofsky's arrival at the F.T.C. coincides with changes sweeping the merger arena. The number of mergers filed with the agency has increased 77 percent over its last three fiscal years, according to Government statistics.
But perhaps more importantly, the nature of those mergers has also changed. While the merger boom of the 1980's was stimulated by Wall Street financiers aiming to increase returns through tougher management, the current crop of big mergers involves business consolidations that are revamping industries from health care to communications to military contractors.
"I know people are aware of mergers, but I don't think they have any idea of the magnitude of what is going on," Mr. Pitofsky said. "There are industries that are reinventing themselves."
Historically, oversight of mergers and antitrust issues has been split between the F.T.C. and the Justice Department, with each agency citing its experience with one industry or another to claim jurisdiction over cases. But under the aggressive leadership of Ms. Bingaman, the Justice Department snared most of the headline-grabbing cases in the last three years.
Now, however, the F.T.C. is regaining some balance, a result that antitrust experts attribute to a longstanding friendship between Mr. Pitofsky and Ms. Bingaman. Several lawyers said Mr. Pitofsky and Ms. Bingaman had reduced interagency bickering over cases, with the result that cases are now being assigned more quickly. Currently, for example, the F.T.C. is reviewing the proposed acquisition by Time Warner Inc. of the Turner Broadcasting System.
Some consumer advocates have said that the decision in that case may be watershed event in Mr. Pitofsky's tenure. "The decision will set the tone for the type of consolidation that is consistent with competition and not which will consolidate power in a few hands," said Gene Kimmelman, a co-director of Consumers Union in Washington.
Among other themes, Mr. Pitofsky has signaled that the agency will now take into account the increasingly global nature of competition as it develops antitrust policy.
The agency held hearings last year, taking testimony from corporate officials and legal experts. A report on the F.T.C.'s findings is expected this summer, and while Mr. Pitofsky, characteristically, said he did not expect wholesale changes, he did anticipate some revisions of agency policy.
Under Mr. Pitofsky's leadership, the five-member commission has been testing some of the boundaries of antitrust enforcement.
Last year, it voted to bar a merger of two natural gas companies not because it would limit competition immediately, but on the rarely used theory that it might prove a bar to future competition. In that case, the Questar Corporation, which supplies natural gas to customers in Salt Lake City, sought to acquire a 50 percent interest in the Kern River Gas Transmission Company, which has a pipeline that passes through the same area but does not serve it. As the agency went to court to block the transaction, the companies abandoned the deal.
The F.T.C. is also starting to crack down on companies that it says fail to fully divulge data about the value of acquired assets, thereby masking the effects on market concentration. In February, the Sara Lee Corporation agreed to pay a record $3.1 million fine to settle charges filed by the F.T.C. and the Justice Department that it deliberately hid the value of various shoe polish brands acquired in 1991 from Reckitt & Colman. In settling the charges, Sara Lee denied any wrongdoing.
"Merger filings are being turned upside down and inside out," said Mary Lou Steptoe, a former acting director of the agency's Bureau of Competition and now a lawyer in Washington. In the 1995 fiscal year, agency officials challenged or threatened to challenge 45 proposed mergers, up from 15 similar actions in the 1992 fiscal year.
It is not as if Mr. Pitofsky has been spared the sort of bumps that have tripped up Ms. Bingaman at the Justice Department. His Senate confirmation as chairman was delayed for several months, apparently because some Republicans were angry over his testimony opposing the nomination of Robert H. Bork as a Supreme Court justice in 1987, according to several lawyers familiar with the situation.
Despite Mr. Pitofsky's years as the chief enforcer of consumer protection laws at the F.T.C., some public interest groups have expressed disappointment at the agency's efforts in that area since he became chairman.
Mary Ponder, a projects director with the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, said she believed that new regulations on telemarketing recently approved by the commission still made it too easy for illegitimate telephone solicitors to bilk unsuspecting victims.
Mr. Pitofsky concedes that he is unlikely ever to prove as aggressive as some consumer groups would like.
"I still think of myself of being in the center," he said, reflecting on his earlier role at the agency. "It's just that the center has moved to the right during the past 20 years."
In antitrust matters, it soon should be more clear what Mr. Pitofsky defines as "the center," particularly in health care, a fast-changing industry of major concern to the commission.
The F.T.C. is expected to issue guidelines shortly on the types of business relationships that doctors can enter into without violating price-fixing statutes as they negotiate fees with large buyers such as health maintenance organizations.
And antitrust regulators are eager to rebound from recent setbacks in their efforts to police hospital mergers. In December, the F.T.C. dropped its bid to block the merger of the second- and third-largest acute care hospitals in Joplin, Mo., after unsuccessfully arguing in court that the deal would raise health care costs. And last October, the Justice Department failed in a bid to stop a hospital merger in Dubuque, Iowa.
Convinced that competition among local hospitals must be maintained, the regulators are pushing ahead, trying to adapt their antitrust strategy. In January, the F.T.C. voted to try to block the merger of the two largest hospitals in Grand Rapids, Mich.
"This is an area where we really need to win a case," Mr. Pitofsky said.

Cradle of Terror

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
From the Bekaa Valley in Syrian-occupied Lebanon, the dictator Hafez al-Assad mounts two separate terrorist wars.
One is familiar: The Hezbollah, financed and supplied by Iran through Syria, fires its rockets into Israel at civilians while its guerrillas ambush soldiers in the buffer zone. As Assad tires of humiliating our envoy and his guest terrorists run low on rockets, that war will subside. 
 Assad's other terrorist campaign is directed against Turkey. With training camps in Lebanon's Bekaa and headquarters in Damascus, the P.K.K. -- Kurds at odds with the non-terrorist Kurds we protect in northern Iraq -- launches its raids and provokes Ankara's bloody reprisals. The Syrian-sponsored P.K.K. urges Turkish Kurds to rebel and secede.
Thus does Assad, at no cost to himself -- indeed, at a profit from Iranian cash and Chinese missiles -- conduct two proxy wars. With Iraq in check and Egypt in hock, he is free to move against his major non-Arab rivals. Assad's aim is to dominate the Middle East by debilitating the Jews and destabilizing the Turks.
Filled with Carter-era hopes of a "comprehensive" agreement, President Clinton has followed Shimon Peres down the road of appeasing Assad. Clinton honored the terrorist state with a premature personal visit; sent his Secretary of State to Damascus 20 times; crowned Peres's offer to abandon the Golan with a promise of U.S. troops.
Assad's answer: insults at funerals, boycotts of summits, absorption of Lebanon into "Greater Syria" and the escalation of terrorist attacks by the P.K.K. against Turkey and the Hezbollah against Israel.
It's hard to fault Clinton for taking his lead from Israel's too-trusting present leader. Certainly the unwavering support shown by the U.S. after Israel was drawn into shelling Hezbollah rocket launchers near a U.N. compound stands in welcome contrast to the condemnation routinely heaped on Israel by Bush Administration Arabists.
But a realistic strategy is aborning in the Middle East, based on Turkish-Israeli cooperation. The good thing that came out of the Sharm el-Sheik summit meeting was the cover it gave President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey to pay an official visit to Israel. Military cooperation is now in the open -- and was promptly denounced by Egypt -- while intelligence-sharing is secretly under way .
"Many Turks feel Turkey should follow Israel's example," writes the Ankara pundit Ilnur Cevik, "and knock out the [P.K.K.] terrorists in their shelters. That is why there seems to be deep sympathy for Israel's latest raids against Hezbollah."
Most Turks believe that support from America would be heavily influenced by friendship with Israel. Many Israelis know that Turkey has a strategic asset that strikes fear into both Assad and Saddam Hussein: the Greater Anatolia Project, a series of dams that control the flow of water into Syria and Iraq.
Assad, now riding high on his strategy of inducing Lebanese, Kurdish and Israeli civilian casualties, has to worry about a military alliance between victims of his terror sponsorship. He is trying to counter the Jerusalem-Ankara entente with an approach to Greece, offering help in any Greek-Turkish conflict.
What should the Turks do? Stop the repression and permit the assertion of cultural identity of Kurdish Turks; let its military cease radicalizing helpless Kurds, and instead plan a joint threat with Israel to Assad's terrorist training camps and headquarters in the region. And publicly fondle that water spigot.
What should Israel do? Stop fretting about Arab reaction and give top priority to a military and economic alliance with Turkey. Urge hawkish supporters of Israel in the U.S. to get Bob Dole to put Turkey on his overseas itinerary this summer, overcoming past antipathies.
What should the feuding Kurds in Iraq do? The Talabani faction should cut ties to Iran and the Barzani faction to Saddam. Give the visiting U.S. special envoy Robert Deutsch ("Deutch the Lesser," the C.I.A. calls him) a bare-bones budget for overt aid and present a united front against Baghdad.
The U.S.? Scrap "comprehensive." Openly subsidize the good Kurds with a few million. Embrace the Turks. Isolate Assad. Let Israelis choose their course next month without White House advice.

United States and British diplomats continue to insist that they want an agreement on the issue, but without weakening existing economic sanctions against Iraq or allowing President Saddam Hussein to improve his position in any way. 
 "If the changes we put forward are agreed on, we would approve the deal immediately," the American United Nations representative, Madeleine K. Albright, said in an interview. "Some of my Security Council colleagues say that sanctions are hurting the Iraqi people. We want to help them."
The suspension was agreed upon early today by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz.
After meeting with Mr. Boutros-Ghali this morning, Iraq's chief negotiator, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, struck an upbeat note, insisting the talks "are not back to Square 1," stressing the progress made and saying he hoped that talks resumed next month, they "are more sucessful."
But he also made clear that the principal stumbling block remains the changes the United States and Britain insisted the Secretary General make in the agreement, which would allow Iraq to sell up to $2 billion worth of oil every six months to purchase supplies for civilians. "Some member countries objected to some of the provisions and made amendments," Mr. Anbari said.
In particular, the United States and Britain want funds reserved for Iraq's Kurdish provinces funneled through the existing United Nations assistance program there. They question the fairness of Iraq's existing rationing system, which handles food distribution. They also object to Iraq's choosing the bank into which oil payments are made and from which letters of credit would be issued to pay for essential supplies.

HEADLINE: Clinton-Dole Fight on Health Bill Is Preview of Campaign to Come

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole started scrapping today over health insurance and it was clear that they saw a major Presidential campaign confrontation in the making.
The issue that puts the two contenders in stark campaign relief is a provision of a bill whose central purpose is to make health insurance more accessible and to protect workers who change jobs from losing their policies. 
 Both houses of Congress have passed the bill, but the House version contains a provision that Mr. Dole strongly supports and Mr. Clinton as strongly opposes. It would allow people to set up tax-deductible medical savings accounts, which they would tap to pay basic medical expenses if they also bought insurance policies whose high deductibles would not cover the first few thousand dollars of annual health costs.
Despite Mr. Dole, the Senate rejected medical savings accounts last week. Today he took an indirect approach, relying on arcane Senate procedures. He moved to choose Senate conferees who could be expected to surrender to the House and approve the accounts.
Senate Democrats stalled his effort, at least temporarily, and the White House weighed in with a stern warning that if the conferees included the provision, the entire bill would be vetoed.
George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to President Clinton, said: "The Senate passed a clean bill unanimously. If Senator Dole makes the bill more partisan with medical savings accounts, the President will veto it."
Republican supporters of the accounts contend they would help reduce inflation in health care costs by giving the insured a reason to keep costs down. Mr. Clinton and other Democrats contend they would help only the healthy and the rich. They say that by taking that segment out of the regularly insured population, the accounts would drive up costs for the sick and the poor.
Some Senate Republicans said they did not believe Mr. Clinton would kill the bill because of that single provision. Others argue that if he does, he will take the blame for losing the basic portable-insurance bill.
But Democrats contended that Mr. Dole would take the blame for a veto and would eventually realize that the savings-account proposal was a political liability because it is intensely supported by officers of Golden Rule Insurance, who have contributed heavily to Republican causes.
Republican supporters of medical savings accounts, which were included in the balanced budget proposals vetoed by Mr. Clinton this winter, contend the accounts would stem inflation in medical costs at relatively modest cost to the taxpayers.
Both the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the House plan would cost the Treasury $1.8 billion over seven years.
Supporters of the accounts argue that people would watch costs more carefully if they were spending their own money, rather than an insurance company's money. It would be their own money because whatever went unspent one year could be added to the amount set aside the next year -- and under some versions of the medical savings accounts proposal, withdrawals without penalties could be made for other purposes. Advocates also say the accounts would foster competition among insurance companies for additional business, which might also help control costs.
Money that individuals put aside in pre-tax dollars could be used for medical purposes that many insurance policies either do not cover or cover in a niggardly fashion, like prescription drugs, cosmetic surgery or mental health problems.
The most serious argument against the accounts is that they appeal most to healthy, well-off people.
If those people enrolled in them and bought only the cheaper, high-deductible insurance policies, critics say, people remaining in traditional insurance plans would face higher rates. This would happen, they say, because the pool of people buying ordinary insurance would be, as a group, less healthy than it was before the buyers of medical savings accounts left it.
The effect could be accentuated if employers sought to save money and stopped providing conventional health insurance policies, offering only the high deductibles and perhaps with some contribution to the medical savings accounts.
Moreover, critics say, individuals cannot do much to reduce their spending on health care, since most decisions are really made by doctors, not patients.
Today's skirmish of this health battle, a rematch of the 1994 fight when Mr. Dole defeated Mr. Clinton's universal health insurance plan, was over whom the Senate would pick to negotiate with the House.
Both sides agree that some conferees would clearly come from the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which produced the insurance bill, and some would come from the Senate Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is involved because Senator Dole offered some tax-related amendments that were passed, notably a measure that would allow the self-employed to deduct 80 percent of their health insurance costs from their taxable income, instead of the current 30 percent.
But the Republican chairwoman of the Labor Committee, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, opposes medical savings accounts, as does the third-ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.
If a normal selection of three Republicans and two Democrats was made from those two committees, the four Democrats could join Mrs. Kassebaum and Mr. Chafee to block a Senate capitulation on the accounts.
So Mr. Dole proposed bypassing Mr. Chafee and taking only three conferees from Finance, leaving it divided 2 to 1 in favor of the accounts and balancing the 3-to-2 opposition from the Labor Committee. Then he urged adding three conferees from the Judiciary Committee, whose two Republicans would ultimately give him six votes in favor of the accounts.
Democrats objected to the plan, saying the Judiciary Committee had no jurisdiction over any part of the Senate bill, which conferees are at least theoretically committed to defend. So the senators went off to dinner, expecting to fight out the question on Thursday -- or later.

HEADLINE: $25 and Under

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
Memo to anybody who thinks of 9 Jones as a pleasant, beige-toned restaurant where the menu ranged from Asia to Europe to North Africa: Forget it.
This restaurant has undergone a radical personality change, offering a new menu, a new chef, a new look and lower prices. The chef is now Alan Harding, and if you recall the stylish but fussy health food that he prepared at his last restaurant, Nosmo King, forget that, too. Mr. Harding is now offering what might be called Old New York food. That means dishes like steak tartare, oyster stew and pork chops. 
 Why the changes? Mr. Harding and Ken Lipsmeyer, the owner, said it boiled down to economics. The former chef, Marcey Bassoff, changed the menu often, ranging from Asian one season to Italian the next, making it difficult for 9 Jones to develop an identity, which Mr. Lipsmeyer said made it hard to attract regular customers. "We weren't making it," he said in a telephone interview.
For his part, Mr. Harding says he is happy not to be saddled with the Nosmo King constraints anymore and has simplified his approach to cooking out of economic necessity. "I see myself trying to make the food sing with only two components, rather than four fiddly little things," he said. "I feel kind of unchained."
The best dishes have been found on the menu of any swank New York restaurant 75 years ago, like steak tartare ($6), offered without the traditional tableside preparation but delicious anyway. The small mound of freshly ground beef from the renowned Florence Meat Market next door, spiked with Worcestershire, Tabasco, onion and bits of egg (hard-cooked rather than raw, another concession to modern times), puts one in mind of Scotch, martinis and good cigars. Oyster stew ($7.25), rich, creamy and full of oyster flavor, is another wonderful retro appetizer. The menu, in fact, traces its lineage to Delmonico's 1898. Black bean soup ($5), edged with onion and Madeira, is a lighter version of the dish made famous at the Coach House, once a leading New York restaurant. Mesclun salad with a balsamic vinaigrette ($5) and endive salad with grapefruit and warm "cambazola," a blend of Camembert and Gorgonzola ($7), have less historical resonance but are good nonetheless.
Appetizers are the highlight, but traditional main courses are also good. An unbelievably thick, richly flavored pork chop ($15), served with mashed sweet potatoes, collard greens and chunky homemade applesauce; moist sauteed chicken with a crisp potato-and-leek pancake ($13), and sauteed trout with mashed potatoes and spinach all show a deft hand at insuring that main courses are cooked just to the proper point of doneness. Hidden on the menu among some side dishes is a big excellent hamburger ($10), served with sharp blue cheese, that dwarfs its English muffin.
Without a doubt the best dessert is banana pancakes ($6.50), rolled and served with caramelized bananas and whipped cream, big enough for two.
The narrow dining room has been made more masculine to match the new menu. A brick wall that used to be painted white has been repainted -- what else? -- brick red, matching the floor of ruddy Tuscan tiles, while lights have been dimmed to augment the moody black-and-white photos and drawings.
Early in the evening, the dining room is a quiet, pleasant place, but around 9 P.M., the restaurant undergoes another personality transformation, and blaring disco music (vintage 1975 to 1985) pulses through the dining room. Maybe the people in the bar up front appreciate it, but the beat does not go at all well with oyster stew. Perhaps 9 Jones should consult Delmonico's again.

HEADLINE: Boeing Foresees Hiring This Year

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 25

 BODY:
For the first time in five years, the Boeing Company plans to expand its work force.
Boeing, the nation's largest aerospace company, said on Tuesday that its employment would grow this year by nearly 8,200, mainly because of a rebound in commercial jet orders. 
 The forecast is for Boeing's job rolls to reach 113,350 worldwide by the end of the year, compared with 105,185 on Jan. 1 and 107,940 as of Thursday. That leaves more than 5,000 to be hired.
About 6,700 workers are being added in Washington, chiefly in the Seattle area; 1,900 in Wichita, Kan., and about 400 at other sites.

Dutchess County Revives After I.B.M. Downsizing

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
After being hit hard by job cuts at I.B.M., the residential construction market in Dutchess County, N.Y., is showing signs of a rebound.
Several single-family home developments under construction are attracting first-time home buyers and commuters from outside the county, said Steven Domber, president of Prudential Serls Prime Properties of LaGrangeville. "A couple of years ago, sales were fairly stagnant," he said, but now "the market is recovering from what happened with I.B.M. and demand is back." 
 Dutchess was probably the county hardest hit by I.B.M's downsizing. In 1985, the company employed 31,042 people at its plants in Poughkeepsie, East Fishkill and Kingston, just across the Hudson in Ulster County. By 1995, that number plummeted to 10,100, according to the Marist College Bureau of Economic Research in Poughkeepsie.
In the mid-1980's, Dutchess was virtually a company county, with I.B.M. providing 60 percent of its manufacturing jobs and 20 percent of its jobs over all. "It's a situation that just had to explode eventually," said David Stenger, president of Creekview Homes, a developer in Beacon. "You can't rely on one company that way."
But Mr. Stenger has been seeing signs of new life. "Smaller companies are now moving into the empty offices," he said. "It's getting a little better every year."
His company is set to open sales on 75 new single-family homes in four different developments. On average, the homes of three to four bedrooms are expected to sell from $175,000 to $319,000.
"We're marketing to the first-time home buyer, as well as the executive who's moving up to a better house," Mr. Stenger said.
Dutchess developments are attracting buyers from as far south as the Bronx, Mr. Domber of Prudential Serls Prime Properties said. "We no longer depend on buyers from in-county," he said. "I'd say more are now coming from the southern counties."
Some projects, in the northern part of the county, appeal to the move-up buyer who works in Dutchess. One called Coachlight Estates, in Poughkeepsie, offers houses with three and four bedrooms priced from $249,000 to $260,000. "They're for the doctor or attorney who already lives in Dutchess," Mr. Stenger said, "because Poughkeepsie is a bit out of commuting range." Creekview Homes recently bought the remaining 20 lots and has a model under construction.
Creekview Homes builds about 30 homes a year. "That's a lot less than we used to do," Mr. Stenger said. "But we've downsized, too." And he's concentrating exclusively on single-family homes.
"You're not seeing the explosion of condominiums that happened seven or eight years ago," Mr. Stenger said. At that time, apartment buildings were converting to condominiums and many town house developments were being built.
"That reached a saturation level," he said, "and then when the recession hit people were stuck with condos they couldn't sell. The market is still suffering from that."
Some developers with projects that had been approved as condominiums "are going back to the town and changing them to single-family," Mr. Stenger said. "It's usually a matter of killing half the density and the towns are usually agreeable to that."
Another reason for the lack of condominium construction is the scarcity of land. "Condos generally are higher-density developments requiring more land, and it's just not available anymore," said Anthony F. Di Lorenzo, director of sales for Baker Residential, a developer based in Pleasantville. "It's also harder to get approvals for those projects today."
That does not mean that condominium construction has disappeared entirely. "There are still some condos being built," Mr. Domber said. "It's a life-style choice. There will always be people who are interested in a development with amenities like a pool and who don't want to look after lawns."
About a year and a half ago, Mr. Domber said, Dutchess developers began to pursue new land opportunities aggressively and take advantage of more attractive prices.
Creekview Homes has received preliminary approval for a 28-lot development, called Harvest Meadows, in East Fishkill. The homes of three and four bedrooms, mosly split-levels and a few colonials, are expected to sell for $175,000 to $200,000. "We hope to break ground at the end of May," Mr. Stenger said, "and I'm sure we'll sell out within the year."

Picasso Again, Still Surprising

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
FIRST came the mammoth Picasso retrospective in 1980. Then seven years ago was the memorably exhaustive and exhausting "Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism." It might seem that by now William Rubin, the Museum of Modern Art's longtime head of painting and sculpture, who organized both shows, would have had enough of Picasso marathons. But Mr. Rubin is back, out of retirement for yet another Picasso swan song. To him, more is always more, with Picasso at least.
This new exhibition, "Picasso and Portraiture," opening Sunday, is again big, too big, overcrowded and uneven. But it is also immensely accessible, often thrilling and highly revealing. From start to finish, the show's fascination has to do with the sheer sweeping humanity of its subject. Portraitupe, it turns out, is a new way to shuffle the Picasso deck, and room after room has unfamiliar pictures that are ferociously, shockingly inventive and often stirring. 
 This includes works from the last contested decades of Picasso's long life, when his creative powers were thought to have waned. They did, which doesn't mean that occasionally, in a few of these late portraits, he didn't rise to a heady degree of physical freedom. The exhibition begins with his prodigious, melancholic pictures of his father and his Aunt Pepa in the 1890's, images steeped in the tenebrous sobriety of Ribera and the other Spanish Old Masters whose works the young Picasso revered. It ends with one of his most unforgettable s'lf-portraits, from 1972, just before he died at 91: the portrait is a fevered crayon drawing of a near-death mask, staring terrified and goggle-eyed into the abyss.
The show explodes some familiar assumptions. One is that Picaspo changed styles whenever he changed lovers, and that those styles corresponded to the characters of the women. His turn from Cubism to Neo-Classicism in the 1910's, for example, was supposedly on account of his marriage to Olga Kokhlova, whose tastes were conservative.
This is simplistic, and the inclusion of the Neo-Classical "Artist and His Model," from 1914, before Picasso met Kokhlova, proves it. His personal life did of course affect his art, but whether he changed artistic idioms because he met new women (or vice versa) is the wrong question. Picasso's turn from Cubism, such as it was, just as easily might have been his way of keeping ahead of the pack, meaning the Paris artists who had jumped on the Cubist bandwagon and made it a salon style. A decade later, his exploration of Surrealism, likewise, might have been a reaction against the new rage for Neo-Classicism.
In any case, Picasso never really did throw over one style for another. While he was making Neo-Classical portraits, like his concise and loopy drawings of Stravinsky and Diaghilev, he kept making Cubist portraits, too, often painting the same subject both ways.
This remained true throughout the pears. His best-known renditions of Dora Maar, the gifted Surrealist photographer and painter who was his lover during the late 1930's and early 40's, are weeping women: spiky, convulsive, demented figures. But these are just a skewed handful of the Maar portraits Picasso painted. With pictures of her as an electrified coil, a kind of live wire, and others as a smart fashion plate or a poignant, lonely siren, the exhibition restores a sense of Picasso's restless, almost serial approach to portraiture and brings back something of Maar's complex character as well.
Sometimes Picasso's subjects were just armatures, excuses for formal extrapolations. Does it matter whether the audacious, beastly seated hulks you occasionally see in the show represent Maar, Kokhlova, Francoise Gilot, another lover, or Jacqueline Roque, Picasso's second wife? No, because he depicted them in these cases the same way, more or less. And what does it tell us if, as Mr. Ru'in contends, a few of the tender, maternal Neo-Classical paintings, including "Woman in White," are secret portraits of Sara Murphy, an American socialite? It may say something about Picasso's infatuations, but about the pictures, it says little.
Over the years, Picasso used whatever formal depice served his expressive end. So are these portraits, then, really more about him or his subjects? Or put another way, what was portraiture in Picasso's odd case?
Historically, portraits were about likeness, about simulating a sitter's appearance, though all artists, to some degree, revealed their own character in their portraits of others, which is why Velazquez's "Pope Innocent X" is so different from Bernini's, and his paintings of Philip AV unlike Rubens's. Portraits, moreover, were how artists traditionally courted subjects and manipulated them: they were tokens of power long before Picasso used them that way.
But Picasso did conceive a new and radically elastic approach to the genre. With him, portraits became metaphorical: a voluptuous still life could be a stand-in for Marie-Therese Walter, a lover; or an exuberant pointillist melange of jockeying abstract patterns could evoke yet another sweetheart, Eva Gouel. If there is a major drawback to the Modern's show, it is its meekness in this respect: instead of unexceptional portraits, of which there are too many, there could have been more still lifes, landscapes, word pictures and other boundary-stretching allegories that were Picasso's most provocative and venturesome reinterpretations of portraiture.
The show has about 220 paintings and drawings. It is accompanied by a voluminous catalogue with particularly interesting essayp by, among others, Robert Rosenblum on the Walter period, Kirk Varnedoe on self-portraits and Michael FitzGerald on Neo-Classicism and Gilot. Mostly the exhibition focuses on people Picasso portrayed often. Amo'g the exceptions is a single, adept portrait of his sister, Lola, which borrows from Toulouse-Lautrec to turn her into a fin-de-siecle femme fatale. Picasso, of course, borrowed from Velazquez, Delacroix, Redon, African art, medieval art, ev'rywhere. In an early room of the exhibition are his portraits of his lover Fernande Olivier. He turns her into a kind of Greek kore, then into a rocky pyramid of faceted, angular planes, a kind of human analog of Cezanne's mountainous landscapes.
Wherever there was an expressive possibility in any kind of earlier art, Picasso found it and exploited it. Interestingly, his own invention and Braque's, Cubism, initially posed a problem in this respect. Faces were swallowed up in puzzle-like compositions, their features emerging only obliquely, incidentally, encoded. The face of the dealer Wilhelm Uhde in the Cubist portrait here is reduced to a few pinched lines, while the one of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler is nearly impossible to decipher. It took time before Picasso realized that Cubism could actually be deeply expressive: that the disconnection and rearrangement of parts of a person's appearance opened up vast new emotional possibilities for portraiture.
And you see the results in "Seated Bather," from around 1930, the horrific image that transforms Kokhlova, his then estranged and embittered wife, into a bony, mantislike creature, a painted gorgon closely akin to Giacometti's "Woman With Her Throat Cut." Or, equally, you see the results in "Bather With Beach Ball," Picasso's sardonic remake of his young mistress, Walter, as a pneumatic plaything, a floating zeppelin with a blow-up tube for her head.
The portraits of Walter are often said to be Picasso's best. Some of them are remarkable: heraldic paeans to sex, composed of ripe, somersaulting shapes of unmodulated violets, reds, yellows and blues, bounded bp thick black contours. They are voyeuristic, erotic.
But the Walter portraits here, several rooms of them, are not always his finest. The more memorable works, it turns out, tend to be unexpected. For instance, there's one of Sara Murphy (or whoever) painted with sand. Braque painted with sand, so this portrait is partly a response to him, but what makes it special is the tender effect: a kind of low relief of soft forms fading into shadow that creates an evanescent image, a face seen in the half-light or as if through a scrim.
Then there's a 1938 portrait of Maya, one of Picasso's daughters, in a pinafore, a virtuoso turn made to look childlike, remarkable for its freely scribbled lines against a bare surface and its acutely drawn, sober face. Picasso's contribution to the history of art of children was substantial: he observed not just how they looked and moved but also how they made art, then he copied them savvily. You see him do this also in his portraits from the late 1940's and early 50's of Paloma, another daughter, and Claude, a son. There's one of both of them with their mother Gilot, rendered as if by a child, yet concise and, once you look closely, unbelievably informative, like heiroglyphics: with a few wry, shorthand strokes, Picasso manages to depict Gilot with her legs crossed, reclining, her head resting on upraised arms.
His most frequent portrait subject was Jacqueline Roque. Several densely hung rooms are devoted to these works, and among them is "Seated Woman" from 1971, a big painting so freely brushed and boldly drawn that it can even bring to mind de Kooning. The background, milky white, overlaps and actually defines the darkly painted head, its features illuminated as if by a yellow up-light, so it appears ghostly and unreal. This is an impassioned picture and also doleful.
Picasso was 89 when he painted it. Painstakingly, he had developed from the beginning a pithy economy that allowed him to make not just caricatures of people (it's too bad that, the size of the show aside, none of the early character studies he drew for the Quatre Gats tavern in Barcelona are here) but encapsulating images. With his self-portraits, the encapsulating image became a cocksure gaze, a stare that was his metaphor for the power of vision, Picasso's vision. You see it in "Yo, Picasso," where he's a haughty young man in a flaming scarf and blinding white shirt, and in the self-portrait from 1907, its rough strokes laid down like the crude carvings of a primitive sculpture.
And in the last self-portraits, the stare is still there, but now hollow, not blazing. Picasso often represented himself metaphorically, and most of his self-portraits come early in his career, when he was finding his way. The late self-portraits, in the final gallery, are vivid exceptions, testimonies from the edge of the grave. Picasso clearly used portraiture to exorcise his deepest thoughts and fears, so that by the end of Mr. Rubin's vast exhibition, you feel wrung out but moved.
 
"Picasso and Portraiture: Representation and Transformation" opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, and remains on view through Sept. 17. It is sponsored by Phillip Morris and ITT Sheraton. A smaller version of the show will open in Paris in October.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
What Clinton Wrought

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In just one secret move, President Clinton did the following things:
Made a decision, critical militarily and politically, over the head of Congress and behind the back of the United Nations. Double-crossed America's closest allies on a matter of the lives of their own troops. Strengthened the terrorist power of Iran, the country Washington and foreign offices around the world believe is the principal sponsor of international terrorism. Cut straight across America's own policy of trying to contain Iran -- absolutely contrary to it. Damaged, perhaps beyond repair, U.S. efforts to get friendly nations to help the containment at economic cost to themselves. 
 These results came from Mr. Clinton's secret decision in 1994 -- surreptitious is more accurate -- to give a silent nod that encouraged Croatia to become an open highway for shipments of Iranian arms and military trainers to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government then at war with the Bosnian Serbs.
Now that the war is at least temporarily over, the longer-term and even more important results of the decision are becoming clear. But the major result has not sunk into the consciousness of Congress, press or public.
Mr. Clinton opened the way for Teheran to achieve the one thing it wanted most from the Bosnian war, the same thing that Europeans feared most: a militant-Islamic Iranian base in Europe. Iran quickly established a terrorist center and dispatch point -- and a political haven in Europe, in the most unstable area on the Continent.
Now Iran and the Bosnian Government are using in peacetime the Iranian power and presence that came with the weapons and the specialists accompanying them.
Iran is the major foreign political presence in Bosnia. Iranian soldiers barely disguised as volunteer guerrillas run training centers and carry out terrorist missions. Iranians have trained Bosnians in an Iranian speciality -- death squads created to operate on foreign soil.
One target is Fikret Abdic, a Muslim now in exile in Croatia. He is an opponent of Islamic militancy, and in 1990 outpolled Alija Izetbegovic for the presidency but was squeezed out of the post. When the war started, Mr. Abdic led Bosnian Muslims who were in armed opposition to Mr. Izetbegovic. The Western press consistently and erroneously uses the Bosnian Government's propaganda epithet for Muslims who opposed Mr. Izetbegovic -- renegade.
The specific Clinton decision was to tell Croatia that Washington had no policy about Iran's request to send large shipments of weapons through Croatia to Bosnia. That is diplomatic code for "go ahead and do the dirty work." Ever since The Los Angeles Times broke the story, Mr. Clinton has refused to disclose documents and told his aides to keep their mouths shut, tight.
We can assume what made the Clinton Administration carry out this colossal deception of its own public, the U.N. and its allies. He not only broke the U.N. embargo, which he had said the U.S. must never do, but did it without getting the agreement of Britain, France and other countries. They had said they would pull their troops out of Bosnia if arms from anywhere, let alone terrorist Iran, flowed to the Muslims.
Mr. Clinton wanted to help the Bosnian Muslims in their war against the Bosnian Serbs, without committing American troops or openly sending arms. There was an honorable way to act -- inform our allies and break the embargo publicly, over their objections. The Administration's choice was to do it with cowardice aforethought -- go ahead, but keep us out of it. (A side result: He put his secret, and honor, in the hands of Iran and Croatia, which grow in mutual cooperation.)
Presidents have taken secret military actions before. But when Mr. Reagan, for instance, approved the arming of the Nicaraguan contras, and Mr. Nixon the bombing of Cambodia, at least they thought they were helping causes they were fighting for. I cannot think of another case where a President made a secret deal that would so predictably damage his own cause as Mr. Clinton did to the containment of Iran.
Maybe the Clinton people thought they would never be found out. Maybe they thought that would make it all right. Many people talk themselves into that. Most of them are children, one way or another.

HEADLINE: GRAIN PRICES SOAR ON POOR WEATHER AND LOW SUPPLIES

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 25

 BODY:
As the nation's farmers head into their fields for spring planting, economists are paying more attention than usual to how the work is going.
Bad weather, dwindling stocks of grain and strong demand at home and abroad have sent corn and wheat to record high prices this month. And while the ultimate impact of the spike -- on consumers and the broader economy -- depends on such unknowns as the coming season's weather, the price instability has spawned anxious talk of inflation from the Farm Belt to Wall Street. 
 Already, many economists are saying it is likely that food inflation rates, which have hovered between 2 and 3 percent in recent years, will double by next year as the impact of today's prices filters through the food pipeline. Should that happen, the average family with children, which by Government estimates spends approximately $6,500 a year on food, could end up spending $400 more next year.
Economists say that a repeat of last year's experience -- when planting was delayed, summer heat disrupted corn pollination and an early frost crimped yields -- could drive those costs still higher, sending food inflation over 10 percent, a level last seen in the 1970's.
For now, the real impact is on agriculture itself. Many farmers are scrambling to cash in on the price increases by planting more acreage, while cattle producers are starting to kill off cows they can no longer afford to feed with expensive grain.
But what has economists and the financial markets edgy as they look ahead is that food prices are not the only ones going up this spring. Heavy demand has also driven energy prices upward, to their highest level since the Persian Gulf war.
Many bond traders, in particular, have already decided that broader inflation and higher interest rates are on the way, judging from how bond prices tumbled in recent weeks.
"Commodity prices are clearly spooking the bond market," said David Wyss, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting service in Lexington, Mass.
Most economists say that Wall Street has been overly anxious about inflation's return. Price shocks to the agricultural sector are certainly nothing new, and energy prices move in a volatile manner, both up and down.
"It is a temporary distortion as things stand now," said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist at the First Chicago NBD Corporation.
Indeed, futures prices indicate the market is expecting some balance to be restored. While corn prices for delivery next month hit a high today of $4.99 a bushel, traders are willing to bid only $3.35 a bushel for corn from next fall's harvest.
One reason for optimism: Farmers are projected to plant 79.9 million acres of corn this year by the Agriculture Department and as much as 84 million acres by some private forecasters, up from 71 million acres last year.
But analysts say the risk is real that inflation could be uncorked, as much by market psychology as by supply and demand.
David Hale, chief economist for Zurich Kemper Investments Inc., warned in his most recent economic survey that the commodity price increases posed a serious challenge to the economic policy makers of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve, he said, must "pursue a policy which prevents higher food prices from encouraging a general acceleration of inflation expectations, which influences wage bargaining." Mr. Hale said that a combination of low grain reserves and depressed output could cause food prices to rise by 8 to 10 percent during 1997.
Normally, grain demand falls relatively quickly as prices climb. This time around, though, all of the world's major grain purchasers kept buying long after economists expected them to curb spending.
In part, that reflects the rise in agriculture of deep-pocketed enterprises that have the means to ride out increases in feed prices. And unlike the situation in the 1970's, when the Soviet Union bought huge amounts of grain on credit, China and other importers are flush with dollars to pay for American grain and meat.
"What's different is that this is a demand-driven market," said Terry Francl, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group in Chicago representing more than four million farmers.
Consumers are likely to get mixed signals for many months about what the low stocks and high grain prices mean to them.
The single biggest user of grain is the cattle business. Once it starts killing large numbers of cows, the price of hamburger and other lower-grade meats could fall for many months if retailers pass through the savings. Savings may also show up in the form of larger portions for the same price, as McDonald's is reported to be considering.
Low beef prices will force pork and poultry producers to keep their prices low to compete. The savings at the meat counter may well offset the nickel-to-dime price increases for pasta, bread and other grain products already making their way into some markets.
Eventually, though, there will be less meat around than consumers want, and prices for meat products could rise sharply, economists say.
"We are headed for a shock to consumers," said Paul Prentice, president of Farm Sector Economics Inc., a Colorado Springs consulting firm.
For the time being, it is the agribusiness sector that is reacting to the shocks of corn's near doubling from $2.50 a year ago, wheat's climb from an average of $4.35 last year to about $7, the climb in soybeans from an average of $6.80 to more than $8.20 and the upward pull of those crops on most others.
Farmers stand to profit, but face many tough decisions: Should they rip out winter wheat decimated by drought and disease to free up more land for spring planting or harvest what's left of the wheat in June? How much of this year's corn and soybean crops should they sell in advance? (The biggest winners in this year's price surge were the few gamblers and procrastinators who held on to most of their 1995 crop long after others sold.)
One wild card is the new farm bill, which allows farmers to get Government payments without placing any restriction on what they grow. It gives farmers more flexibility but not necessarily easier choices.
"I've changed my plans about what I'll plant several times since the beginning of the month and I'm not done yet," said Noel Kjesboe, a Wendell, Minn., farmer who usually grows wheat, corn, soybeans and barley.
The giants of agribusiness are also among those feeling pinched. Profits are plunging at grain processors like Cargill and Archer-Daniels-Midland, which recently shut down some of its ethanol production. Tyson Foods and other chicken producers have cut back broiler production for the first time since the 1970's to reduce their need for corn. Interstate Bakeries and its rivals are scrambling to minimize the production losses from dealing with poorer- quality wheat they would normally not buy if supplies were more plentiful.
As in the past, the brunt of the grain squeeze is destined to fall on animal producers, especially the cattle industry. Normally, cattle producers can avoid high corn prices by switching to more use of wheat, hay or grass in pastures. But wheat is expensive and in short supply, dragging up prices for other forage crops. And the pastures of the Southwest and Great Plains have withered under some of the driest conditions in a century.
To make matters worse, the grain prices are rising when the beef cattle herd of 35.3 million animals is too large for the market. That holds down prices packers are willing to pay at feedlots, which are losing an average of nearly $1 a day on every cow they fatten at today's grain prices.
"A feedlot can't afford to tell a packer, 'I don't like your price so I'll wait until next week,' " said Mike Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Nebraska Cattlemen's Association.
The feedlots have responded by driving down the prices they pay for young animals to around 55 cents a pound. At that price, only 20 percent of ranchers that raise calves can eke out even a slim profit, according to Charles Lambert, economist at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Many have begun to sell breeding cows to raise cash.
By some estimates, the nation's cattle herd could drop by two million this year. The selloff is expected to be especially sharp if this summer's weather is not wet enough to restore pasture land and produce bumper grain crops.
"There's no room for another bad grain crop," said Paul McAuliffe, senior commodity analyst here for the North American Grain division of the Continental Grain Company, a leading feed and livestock producer.
Old-timers note that today's prices look modest when inflation is taken into account. Corn soared to $18 a bushel in 1947 and was at $12 a bushel in 1974 if prices are adjusted to today's dollars. Farmers are so much more productive today, though, that economists say such peaks are hard to imagine without a worldwide weather disaster.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Real Welfare Cheats

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The unconscionable assault on welfare recipients by officials at all levels of government is taking place in an atmosphere of extraordinary dishonesty.
Even politicians who traditionally have tried (however modestly) to look out for the interests of the poor are in retreat on the welfare issue. They will tell you that politically they have no choice. The polls show that voters are overwhelmingly hostile to welfare. 
 What the politicians tend not to talk about is the extent to which the public has been misled (often deliberately) about who is on welfare and what benefits they are receiving, and about the potential for catastrophe if benefits are ended for large numbers of welfare recipients for whom jobs are not available.
There is little doubt the public hates welfare, but most Americans are not cruel. "The public is tough-minded but not unsympathetic," according to an in-depth analysis of attitudes toward welfare that was released this week by Public Agenda, a research organization founded by the public opinion analyst Daniel Yankelovich and former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
The study found that Americans "resent much of what they see" about welfare, "but few are callous or smugly superior. They vent their anger at what they consider a dismal, almost insane, policy failure, but, within the space of an hour's discussion, show a remarkable willingness to wrestle intellectually with the myriad complexities involved. In many ways, the public is more open-minded and pragmatic than leaders who see themselves as far more 'informed' on the issue."
The problem with welfare for most Americans has to do with values, not money. Working people resent welfare, the study found, primarily because it "represents a repudiation of their own efforts to support themselves and their families and to be self-reliant even during hard times."
But the public is interested in real reform, which means genuine efforts to keep children housed and fed while moving adults into the world of work. Most politicians, with one eye on the latest poll and the other on the next election, have scrapped all thought of reform and are moving willy-nilly to cut benefits.
The public, in this area, is far ahead, both practically and ethically, of the politicians. According to the Public Agenda study, "Of nine possible reforms presented to respondents -- ranging from requiring job training to paying surprise visits to make sure recipients deserve benefits -- reducing benefits ranked last in popularity."
Politicians are moving in the exact opposite direction. Gov. George Pataki of New York -- in lockstep with national trends -- is calling for a 26 percent reduction in monthly benefits, and Democrats who control the State Assembly have caved in to his demand to establish time limits for receiving cash benefits.
In New York City, a deputy commissioner of the Human Resources Administration issued a memo a few weeks ago emphasizing the priorities to be followed in the handling of welfare cases. The top priority was case closings. The lowest (fifth in a list of five) was case acceptances. In other words, getting benefits to poverty-stricken mothers and their children was the least important consideration.
The memo was leaked to the press (it was in the New York Observer Wednesday) and suddenly city officials offered a "clarification." The priorities, according to the clarification, "should be understood as equal."
"They are really doing bad things to poor people," said Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center in New York. Ms. Krueger is fighting the "Draconian" welfare proposals now being considered in Albany. She asks a simple question. "Where are the jobs?"
A study released last summer by the office of Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger found that at any given time about 50,000 jobs, of all types (not just entry-level), are available in New York City. If they were all filled by welfare recipients, 300,000 more jobs would be needed for the remaining adults on welfare, and an additional 200,000 jobs would be needed for other unemployed New Yorkers. The ratio of out-of-work New Yorkers to available jobs is 10 to 1.
These are problems that need to be looked at seriously and honestly. Instead, politicians are cutting welfare with their eyes closed.

HEADLINE: Lower Rates Raise Resales Of Single-Family Homes

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes jumped 6.9 percent in March to the highest level in more than two years as buyers responded to low mortgage rates.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.21 million, up from 3.94 million in February. 
 The rate was the highest since December 1993, when it was 4.35 million.
"Many consumers, especially first-time buyers, were able to get into the market," said Art Godi, the association president. "They took advantage of extremely favorable rates in the first quarter."
However, rates have been rising recently and many analysts fear higher financing costs will price many buyers out of the market.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.62 percent in March, up from 7.08 percent in February, but down from 8.46 percent last year.
Rates had shot up to 8.05 percent during the week ended on April 11, but slipped to 7.95 percent last week.
Analysts say that for every percentage-point increase in interest rates, 250,000 to 300,000 families are priced out of the market.
John A. Tuccillo, an economist, said the March resale pace is not likely to be sustainable into the summer. "The spring home-buying season started off well, because many first-time buyers closed sales using low interest rates secured in January," he said. "What we are seeing is the result of buyers, including trade-up buyers, who moved quickly before interest rates rose."
The median price of a previously owned home in March was $115,300, up 6.8 percent from March 1995, when it was $108,000. The median is the midpoint -- half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
The median price was $96,000 in the Midwest, $150,000 in the West, $99,500 in the South and $141,100 in the Northeast.
Sales rose in each of the four regions, including a 12.5 percent jump in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 1.1 million. They increased 6.6 percent in the West, to a rate of 970,000.
"California has experienced a surge in home-buying activity over the last several months and has boosted activity in the West," Mr. Godi said.
Sales advanced 5.4 percent in the South, to a rate of 1.57 million, and 5.3 percent in the Northeast, to 600,000.
In a separate report from the Labor Department, the number of American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits rose by 13,000 last week to the highest level in three weeks.
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 372,000. The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims fell by 15,250, to 371,750, during the period ended last week. Many analysts prefer to track the four-week average, which is less volatile.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies on New Evidence Of German Economic Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied broadly yesterday on new evidence of economic weakness in Germany and an influential German banker's suggestion that the mark was overvalued against the dollar.
The dollar's greatest advance came against the European currencies but was less pronounced against the yen. That was also the indirect result of the mark's retreat in foreign exchange dealings. 
 Many traders were selling marks to buy yen, pushing the Japanese currency to the highest level against the mark since early December 1995.
"The story today was more mark weakness than anything," said Win Thin, an international economist at HSBC Midland in New York.
The dollar hit its highest level against the mark since early February -- 1.5350 marks -- before dropping back slightly to 1.5340 marks in late trading in New York, up from 1.5203 marks on Wednesday.
The dollar rose to 106.70 yen from 106.53 yen. The pound fell to $1.5075 from $1.5150.
The mark weakened after Germany's Federal Statistics Office reported a benign April inflation rate, suggesting that the Bundesbank now has more leeway to lower interest rates further.
The central bank lowered rates a half percentage point a week ago but expectations have grown since then that another reduction will be required to stimulate Germany's economy.
Reports of a rise in Germany's insolvency rate and more weakness in the country's construction industry added to the picture of malaise in Germany, further diminishing demand for marks.
"I guess people are still concerned that the German economy is weak," said Seth Cohen, a director of foreign exchange trading at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "People are still looking for further cuts in German interest rates."
The dollar received a further lift on remarks by Franz-Christoph Zeitler, president of the Regional Central Bank in Bavaria and a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. He said the value of the mark against other European currencies was appropriate but suggested it had further room to weaken against the dollar.

HEADLINE: Senate Bars Plans to Cut Immigration

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Raising serious doubt that Congress will make any meaningful changes in legal immigration this year, the Senate today resoundingly rejected two measures to reduce the number of foreigners entering this country legally.
After six hours of debate, senators rejected, 80 to 20, a proposal to reduce immigration by legal residents' family members by at least 10 percent over the next five years. 
 The proposal would also have effectively shut the door on American citizens' efforts to bring their adult children or siblings into this country. Those visas would instead have gone to the spouses and young children of permanent legal residents; many of those people are already living in the United States but without proper papers.
Though the proposal was offered by Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Wyoming Republican who is the Senate's authority on immigration, 40 Republicans voted against it. Among them was Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader.
Those Republicans' position reflected their strong agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee's decision last month to deal with legal and illegal immigration in separate bills. Mr. Simpson's proposal was an amendment to a bill intended to curb illegal immigration.
The bipartisan vote against the Simpson proposal also reflected strong support for the position that immigrants who enter the country legally serve as a wellspring of economic growth and innovation.
A second amendment to the immigration bill, offered by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, closely resembled Mr. Simpson's but would have allowed some visas for adult and minor children of legal residents. It was defeated 74 to 26.
Both amendments would have limited family sponsored immigration to the current level of 480,000 people a year. The Immigration and Naturalization Service projects a 41 percent increase in legal immigration this year, including family categories. The number declined 10 percent last year, to 593,000.
Last month the House, by a vote of 238 to 183, removed from its illegal-immigration bill most provisions on legal immigration and then passed the bill. The Senate appears likely to pass its bill on illegal immigration next week.
With the legislative calendar running short and senators now on record against reducing legal immigration and certain family categories, many experts in immigration said that the likelihood of the Senate considering the separate bill on legal immigration might be dimming.
Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group in Washington that favors reducing legal immigration, said that the legal-immigration bill "technically is still alive," but that its fate rested with Mr. Dole's clearing time on the Senate floor for debate.
Today's debate over the two amendments, particularly Mr. Simpson's, was as lopsided as the eventual vote on them.
Even with his amendment, Mr. Simpson argued, "we will continue to have the most open door of any country in the world."
But senator after senator rose to defend the nation's history of accepting legal immigrants.
"We've got room for people who want to come and work," said one of them, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. "We don't have room for people who are looking for a handout."
Many lawmakers, including Republicans, also objected to Mr. Simpson's tactics. "Tacking this on to the illegal immigration bill is the worst conceivable way to deal with legal immigration," said Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan.

HEADLINE: Penney's Wandering Eye Puts Wall St. on Watch

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, the country's fourth-largest retailer, was courted for a takeover by the J. C. Penney Company but swiftly refused the offer, both companies said yesterday.
The offer, which was made in February, has left Wall Street suspicious that Dayton Hudson, which has a mixed bag of both good and troubled retailers, is in play. It also raised questions about whether J. C. Penney, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, had designs on other retailers. 
 Dayton Hudson's stock had a strong run while the offer was kept secret, gaining nearly 22 percent, or about three times the advance shown by the average retail stock. That performance raises the possibility of a leak, although there is no proof.
"The gain in the share price reflects investors' anticipation that the composition of this company will change," said John M. Eade, a retail analyst at Argus Research in New York.
The offer was first reported yesterday in The Star Tribune in Minneapolis, which wrote that J. C. Penney offered a 50-50 cash and stock transaction that valued Dayton Hudson's stock between $90 and $95 a share, putting the deal at roughly $6.8 billion. At the time of the offer, Dayton Hudson's shares were trading around $76. Its shares were unchanged yesterday, at $92.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Yesterday, as both companies refused to comment, the whole offering took on the look of a regrettable cocktail party flirtation.
J. C. Penney released a statement saying that it had proposed a "friendly business combination" that offered "an attractive opportunity" for shareholders, and that Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson had spurned the advance.
Dayton Hudson's press release was equally brief, calling the overture an "unsolicited" proposal that was promptly rejected by the Dayton Hudson board.
"It was a surprise because you just don't imagine J. C. Penney making the bid," said Josephine Kwok, an analyst at Jurika & Voyles, an institutional investor in Oakland, Calif., and a large holder of Dayton Hudson shares. "But as long as the price goes up, I wouldn't mind it."
Retail analysts were left pondering the probability of a new suitor for Dayton Hudson, which has enjoyed healthy profits from its Target discount store division, but has been hurt by its sagging Mervyn's discount department stores and its upscale department store division.
For some time, Wall Street has put pressure on Dayton Hudson to remove its 64-store Midwestern department store division, which like many regional chains, has faltered. Investors have also pressed the company to unload its 297 Mervyn's clothing stores, which compete with the J. C. Penney stores. Both have been a drain on profits.
Analysts have suggested that the company ought to keep the Target stores, which sell everything from eye drops to show shovels. The most frequently mentioned possible suitor for the department store division has been May Department Stores. But Dayton Hudson has chosen instead to upgrade its department stores.
"Wall Street always thought that if you have an ingrown toenail, you should cut off your toe," said Edward A. Weller, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco. "But I think management believes that the payoff of running its department stores more effectively could bring a much bigger payoff than what they would earn on cash."
J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., does not have the reputation of a hungry giant on the make, but it is becoming clearer that it is eager for an acquisition. Last August, it was one of the winners in a bidding contest for some Woodward & Lothrop and John Wanamaker stores held in Federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan.
While its cash reserves have been strong -- it has recently repurchased its own stock -- J. C. Penney has taken a beating in same-store sales, under pressure from Sears, Roebuck & Company. And it seems to be tapped out in domestic growth. A Dayton Hudson acquisition would have permitted new economies of scale, a marriage with the similar Mervyn's business and the benefits of Target.
"I think what this indicates is that J. C. Penney is very profitable and generates a ton of cash," Mr. Weller said. "It sees its expansion opportunities as very limited, and it recognizes the potential for Dayton Hudson's operating companies to have significant improvement in sales and profits."
On the surface, Dayton Hudson's stock movement since the secret proposal seems oddly rapid, given that the company reported disappointing earnings for the fiscal year that ended in January. While its same-store sales were healthy in February and March, some analysts suggested that even performance surprises on the upside would not justify the run-up.
"Earnings were down last year, $3.89 versus $5.52 a year before, and the forecast for this year is $5.25," Mr. Eade of Argus Research said. "That's a nice move off, but it is coming off a depressed number. So it looks like there must have been a little takeover speculation."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET TRUCE: MINIMUM WAGE;
House Republicans Again Avert Vote on Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
House Republicans narrowly fought off a Democratic effort today to vote on an increase in the minimum wage, even though 13 of them deserted their leaders and voted with the Democrats.
After the 220-to-200 vote, Democrats said they would try again next week and expected to do better then, and in any case to win sometime in May. 
 "We plan to use every opportunity that's available to us strategically to bring this up," said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat.
On Wednesday, House Republican leaders said they did not plan to bring the issue of raising the hourly minimum wage to $5.15 from $4.25 to the floor for a vote this year. They said they would propose other changes to help low-wage workers.
Democrats responded today with a surprise effort to amend a procedural rule that was on the floor to provide for a vote on the minimum wage.
Representative Scott McInnis, the Colorado Republican who was managing the procedural rule, denounced the effort as a "sneak attack" and a "diversionary argument" based on election year politics. His Republican colleagues left Mr. McInnis almost alone on the floor to oppose the Democrats in debate.
Democrats argued that since the Republican leaders refused to schedule a vote any other way, this was their only recourse.
"Stop playing games and schedule a vote," demanded Representative William L. Clay, Democrat of Missouri.
Representative Gene Green, Democrat of Texas, said, "What we need to do is put the jam on the bottom shelf for the little people."
The Republican victory was made possible only by the votes of 15 Republicans who have sponsored legislation to raise the minimum wage by $1 an hour but who voted against considering the issue today.
They are Representatives Spencer Bachus of Alabama; Steve Horn and Frank Riggs of California; Nancy L. Johnson and Christopher Shays of Connecticut; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida; Bob Franks and Bill Martini of New Jersey; Benjamin A. Gilman, Amo Houghton and Rick A. Lazio of New York; Frank A. Cremeans and Steven C. LaTourette of Ohio, Phil English of Pennsylvania and Jack Metcalf of Washington.
There does appear to be momentum working for the House Democrats. The last time they staged a procedural vote over the minimum wage, on March 28, they lost 228 to 192, with only 7 Republicans supporting them.
There was no action on the wage issue in the Senate today, but Democrats insisted that they would keep trying to bring it forward. It was clear that while the 47 Democrats were solidly in favor of the increase, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and the other 52 Republicans had nothing approaching a common position.
At a Democratic news conference, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich offered some unsolicited advice to Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, urging him just to let the issue come to a vote. "When you are in a hole," Mr. Reich said, "don't dig."
In the brief House debate, Democrats said they were looking after what Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas called "the people that mop the floors, that take out the trash, that wash the dishes."
Mr. McInnis answered by attacking Democrats for raising gasoline taxes three years ago. "If you want to help the working poor of this country," he said, "do something about taxes."
Two Georgia Republicans came to his aid. One, Representative John Linder, said: "This is not policy. It is politics and crass politics."
The other, Representative Jack Kingston, accused the Democrats -- "the comrades on the other side," he called them -- of failing to recognize that an increase in the minimum wage would cost jobs. "The folks over there are simply economically ignorant," Mr Kingston said. "I don't believe they are malicious."

HEADLINE: For Japan's Women, a Lesser Work Role

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 25

 BODY:
It would be safe to assume that there is little sexual harassment on the assembly lines of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in Japan. That is because there are virtually no women on the assembly lines of Mitsubishi and other automobile manufacturers.
In the Japanese workplace, many women are confined to subservient roles like pouring tea for their male colleagues, with many of them called office "flowers." Most women have no hope for promotion and no guarantee of lifetime employment; they are expected to quit when they marry. 
 Some industry analysts have said that such differences might have led to a tolerance of sexual harassment at a factory of a Mitsubishi subsidiary in Normal, Ill..
Tsuneo Ohinouye, the top executive at the Illinois plant, denied that cultural differences played a role in the way women were treated. He said the company did not tolerate sexual harassment.
There is evidence that women face sexual discrimination in Japan. In help-wanted advertisements, companies often specify the sex of employees they want and set an age limit for female applicants. It is said that some companies will not hire single women that live alone.
There are very few women in the upper or even the middle ranks of management. Some young women are leaving the country for better employment opportunities.
There are only 5 to 10 sexual-harassment lawsuits filed each year, said Mizuho Fukushima, a lawyer who handles such cases. She said many women accept such mistreatment, however reluctantly, and filing lawsuits is not a common practice in Japan.
A woman brought the first such lawsuit in Japan in 1989 under general civil law for injurious behavior. A court ruled that a company and one of its male employees had violated the woman's rights because of crude remarks that drove her to quit her job.
As for the lack of women on automobile assembly lines, executives attribute that to a Japanese law prohibiting women from working late at night. Most automobile plants have workers alternate day shift and night shifts.
Some progress is being made. Spurred by the passage of an equal opportunity law in 1986, companies began hiring more women for career-track positions in the economic boom of the late 1980's, though many of those gains were lost in the recent recession. More women are also working after marriage.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET TRUCE: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE AND SENATE VOTE TO APPROVE '96 SPENDING BILL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Congress passed a $160 billion spending bill today, assuring that vast swaths of Government that had closed, reopened, closed again and reopened again during the long budget wars will stay open the remainder of fiscal 1996, now a bare five months.
The House vote was 399 to 25. The Senate approved the bill 88 to 11. 
 President Clinton, who held out during bargaining over the bill for more spending on his priorities like health, education, the environment and jobs programs, said he would sign the bill Friday morning. He hailed the action as a triumph of bipartisanship, and called for new talks on a plan to balance the budget in seven years.
"We have an opportunity," he said. "We can't let it slip from our grasp."
Republicans, who maintained that the legislation locked in place the largest single-year spending cuts since World War II, suggested that Mr. Clinton had to be dragged to the reductions.
"The President was forced to sit down and achieve a result," said Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Robert L. Livingston, Republican of Louisiana, lifted a line from Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message to make the same point.
"He said the era of big Government is now over," Mr. Livingston said. "We're taking him at his word. The world has changed, and were heading in the right direction."
But today's vote did nothing to break the broader political impasse over the biggest and fastest-growing part of Government: the benefit programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and welfare, that consume fully two-thirds of the $1.6 trillion budget. Dealing with these entitlement programs will be crucial to bringing the Federal budget into balance.
Nor did the passage of the spending bill settle the root argument between Republicans and Democrats over what and how much Government should do, and how much to spend doing it.
But today's votes did end the longest and most bitter struggle over fiscal policy in memory, one that closed much of Government for a record 27 days last winter. Scores of Federal agencies, including 9 of 14 Cabinet departments, stayed open the rest of the fiscal year only after the combatants agreed to allot them temporary stipends 13 times in a row -- another record.
Seldom before, if ever, had the two branches of Government argued more than a few days into a new fiscal year without arranging some sort of year-long financing for the agencies in dispute.
The Republicans did indeed cut spending: With the new legislation, the Government is authorized to spend a total of $488 billion on domestic agencies, from the military to highway building to environmental protection, for all of fiscal 1996. According to the Congressional Budget Office, that is $20 billion less than was approved in 1995.
Actual spending for 1996 will total $532 billion, compared to $539.2 billion the previous year. Actual spending is greater because it includes money that was authorized, but not spent, in past years.
Judging by today's remarks in the House, negotiations over the budget were every bit as acrid as in December, when most comity between the two sides collapsed.
"If Republicans had worked with the Democrats, we could have kept the Government open," said Representative Joe Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat. "If Republicans had worked with the Democrats, we could have settled this six months ago and come a lot closer to giving the American people the kind of government they deserve. What took you so long?"
Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, called the vote "the end of a very dark period" and added: "Finally we can say that that nonsense, for the rest of this fiscal year, is over."
Republicans were no less caustic. Mr. Livingston detailed what he said was a long list of instances in which the Congress acceded to the White House -- on environmental spending, on education, on job-training programs -- and then added drily, "Most of these issues will be revisited in the next few weeks." He was referring to the Republican budget for fiscal 1997, which will probably be sketched out in public next week.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich was equally dismissive of Mr. Clinton's plea for a new round of budget talks, saying Congress wants genuine reductions in spending and not "a proposal that's just been written by press secretaries."
"The President would have to indicate a willingness to have real reform this year," he said. "Not some phony proposal that has all the savings in the seventh year or the sixth year, but real reform this year."
Both the Republicans' 1996 budget and Mr. Clinton's budget for fiscal 1997 project fiscal balance in 2002, but postpone the bulk of politically difficult spending cuts until the final years. By most measures, Mr. Clinton's plan "backloads" more spending cuts than does the Republican one.
Mr. Clinton has made his share of attacks on the Republicans' budget. But he elected to stay above the fray today, casting himself as the virtually apolitical leader of all Americans who oppose deficit spending.
"The most important thing to happen today is simply this," he said. "We have shown that we can work together, and when we do, we can get results that are good for the American people, today and for our future. But when the leadership of Congress insists on going it alone, one party alone, we get gridlock, stalemate, vetoes, Government shutdowns. Today was a real victory for progress over partisanship."
The legislation enacted today, the product of five weeks of bargaining, cobbles together a compromise from four spending bills that Mr. Clinton had previously vetoed or that stalled in Congress. It lays out spending plans for the Departments of Commerce, State, Interior, Justice, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, as well as dozens of major agencies like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency.
In gravity-defying fashion, it satisfies two opposing demands: that domestic spending be cut every penny as much as Republicans want, and that spending on Mr. Clinton's domestic priorities be increased.
Mr. Clinton won about $5 billion in additional spending, though not all he sought, for the environment, education, job-training programs, his national service initiative and his proposal to place more police on the streets, among others.
He also won battles to weaken or strip several amendments from the spending bill. Among them were clauses that would have rolled back Environmental Protection Agency regulation of wetlands, restricted the Endangered Species Act and capped the amount of direct Federal loans to college students.
Mr. Clinton's spending increases were offset by cuts in other parts of the domestic budget, mostly from funds reserved for natural disasters but also in Congress's spending on certain social programs.
In some cases, such as a cut in payments to the states for adoption assistance, the agreement merely reduced the size of a proposed increase in spending.
On the House floor today, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, the Republican Rules Committee chairman from New York, boasted that the spending compromises represented genuine cuts in spending, not "smoke and mirrors." That is essentially true.
On the other hand, both sides did employ some fiscal gymnastics to reach agreement. The compromise finances part of other additional spending, for example, by proposing to collect $500 million more in bad debts owed the Government. And it finances other permanent Government activities with onetime gains in revenue from the sale of Government assets such as oil reserves.
That means the bargainers may have to find still more money in the next budget, when some of the same Federal programs could well be on the chopping block again.

Surging Grain Prices Raise Fears of Inflation
Corn and wheat prices have climbed to records this month, because of bad weather, dwindling supply and strong demand at home and abroad.
While it is too early to gauge the ultimate impact of the spike on either consumers or the broader economy, the price instability has brought anxious talk of inflation from the Farm Belt to Wall Street. [Page A1.]
 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, before leaving to inspect the parched wheat crops, said the markets should calm down. [D15.]
 
Ford Announces Huge Recall
Ford, responding to consumer pressure and facing lawsuits, announced the largest recall ever by a single auto maker. It asked owners of 8.7 million 1988 through 1993 cars and trucks to bring them to dealers for replacement of ignition switches that might cause fires. [A1.]
 
Congress Passes Budget Bill
Congress passed a $160 billion spending bill, assuring that vast swaths of Government that had closed repeatedly would stay open during the remainder of fiscal 1996. President Clinton hailed the action as a triumph of bipartisanship. [A1.]
 
Harassment at the Factory
Some women working at the Mitsubishi car plant in Illinois say the company has been unfairly accused of tolerating sexual harassment. But others recount a long series of offensive incidents. In Japan, virtually no women work on auto assembly lines. [A20.]
 
Stock Market in Late Rebound
Wall Street staged a late rebound, sending the Nasdaq composite index to a sixth consecutive high, 1,184.17, up 7.34, and the Dow industrials up 13.01, to 5566.91. Computer and paper stocks fueled the advance. [D8.]
 
Strong Gain for Home Sales
Sales of previously owned homes jumped 6.9 percent in March to the highest level in more than two years. Buyers responded to low mortgage rates, but rates have been rising recently, which could deter buyers. [D2.]
 
Sonat Seeks Norwegian Company
Sonat Offshore Drilling of Houston offered to buy Transocean A.S. of Norway in a $1.5 billion deal that would form the world's second-largest operator of offshore rigs. Transocean said its board would consider the offer. [D2.]
 
Guilty Plea in Insider Case
A Las Vegas insurance salesman, Edward Warren Eizman, 35, pleaded guilty to conspiracy in connection with insider trading based on tips provided by a former lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the New York law firm, which had clients in merger talks. [D3.]
 
Teachers to Cut Tobacco Shares
The New York Teachers' Retirement System voted to cut the tobacco holdings in one of its index funds, saying it was concerned that the uncertainty surrounding tobacco stocks had undermined their investment value. [B7.]
 
Malone Tries To Outfox MCI
TCI's chairman, John C. Malone, left, having lost out to Rupert Murdoch and MCI in bidding for the nation's last unclaimed license for direct-broadcast satellite television service, cut a deal with a Canadian satellite broadcaster. And MCI, which paid $682 million for its license, is crying foul. [D6.]
 
Delta's Operating Profits Surge
Delta Air Lines reported a fourfold increase in operating profits to $169 million, and announced it would share with employees both stock options and seats in boardroom meetings. S.& P. raised Delta's credit rating to one notch below investment grade. [D5.]
 
Xerox Profit, and Stock, Jumps
Xerox earnings soared 61 percent in the first quarter to $237 million, driven by sales of color copiers and stronger results in Latin America. Xerox's stock jumped $4.125, to $145. [D4.]
 
At the 4A's, a Focus on New Media
Addressing the 78th annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in California, George M. C. Fisher, Eastman Kodak's chairman, urged development of the new media. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Bosnians See A California In Balkans

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: SANSKI MOST, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
As the people in this valley emerge, battered by war and winter, two men are waiting for them. They intend to grab everyone -- widows, refugees and demobilized soldiers alike -- by their collars, shake them soundly, then point them toward a vision.
"We're going to make this place into California," proclaimed Gen. Mehmed Alagic, without even a blush over a plan that might be mistaken for a fantasy. "Why not?" 
 That vision seems less fanciful when you survey the wide plain surrounding this town. A ring of forested mountains frames the grasslands and acres of cornfields that are cut by the Sana and eight other rivers. If you squint just a little, this could resemble a smaller San Jose in the era when it was a farm town.
Mr. Alagic, who recently retired as general, is one of the most esteemed heroes of the Bosnian Army. His partner in this dream, Mirzet Karabeg, 52, who just stepped aside as mayor so Mr. Alagic could fill that office, is the area's most powerful politician. The men, both Muslims, may carry the weight to pull off the transformation, but their style is more like a small-time dictatorship rather than Golden State modern.
"The first step," explained Mr. Karabeg, "is to start cutting back on all this free food those humanitarian aid agencies are sending in here. As long as people can eat for nothing, they won't work."
If that is not enough, the leaders begin evicting from Government-controlled housing anyone who doesn't put in 180 hours a month at a job or a reconstruction project.
"Socialism taught us to be lazy," he said.
This is a rather surprising analysis for a man who, until the Bosnian war, was a bureaucrat in Yugoslavia's state-owned factories and then a senior functionary in a town administration that sought to protect citizens from life's sharp corners.
But with this valley in ruins, hundreds of its people killed and the survivors scattered and traumatized, the two men see this as a time for change.
For their part, Mr. Karabeg and Mr. Alagic, who before the war was an officer in the Yugoslav Army, have found that everything they once believed in has vanished. Yugoslav Communism evaporated. Even Yugoslavia collapsed in war.
Four years ago, the men's Serbian colleagues and neighbors took control of this area, killing and expelling Muslims and Croats.
Since Bosnian Government troops under General Alagic helped retake the town in October and Mr. Karabeg was returned to city hall, the former mayor has often talked of one of his new sources of inspiration: old American Westerns.
"I won't talk about what happened to the Indians," Mr. Karabeg said. "That was ethnic cleansing too." But then he talks about the lessons he draws from characters played by Glenn Ford and John Wayne. "If you work hard, and you are just, you will be rewarded. Your future is in your own hands."
For the last six months or so, the two men have been working on how to apply those maxims.
"We have thought about it, and we have to change everything," Mr. Karabeg said. "For one thing, the whole agricultural system is wrong."
He was referring to the limit of about 35 acres allowed per farmer, a remnant of old Yugoslav laws that were intended to protect small subsistence farmers, but also effectively kept them out of local economy.
"We will have large ranches, like in California, not small farms where families just produce for themselves." he said. "There will be dairy and cattle ranches, and very large fruit orchards so we can sell on the free market."
The people here say there was a sedate quality to life in this valley before the war. It was caught half-way between farming and industry, with most workers employed in factories as well as tending their small holdings.
"But that's not efficient," said Mr. Karabeg. "The people were not good at either job." Now, he said, he will make people choose: either produce crops for market, or be a factory worker.
When it was pointed out that in California there are tens of thousands of homeless and unemployed at the bottom of the economic order, people who have not found a place in the system he envisions here, he scoffed. "They must just be lazy," he said. "Because in America if you want to work you will succeed."
If the two men see the rural area becoming a replica of California's Central Valley, they see the rest of this region becoming a haven for industry.
Farmers who give up the land could find that the benign conditions on the production line have changed, however. "There were far too many workers, and not nearly enough production," Mr. Alagic said. "We can't afford that anymore." Wages, at least initially, are to be about one-tenth of what they were before the war.
Local government -- in other words, the mayor -- now controls all local industry formerly run by the state. Eventually, the two men say, the enterprises will be privatized. But for now, apart from the 184 small grocery stores and cafes and a couple of barber shops, Mr. Alagic, with the former mayor at his side, has used his influence as a war hero to gain control over almost everything that can generate income or provide a job, from the wood-products factory to the coal mine.
During the three and a half years that Bosnian Serb forces had control here and Bosnian Serbs occupied the houses, there was rampant looting and destruction. And Bosnian Government troops looted homes and farms when they returned.
So almost all the 1,856 tractors that were licensed before the war are now gone. Of the 11,300 factory jobs listed in town records, only a few hundred remain because most factories are damaged and few have equipment in working order. Nearly all the houses are damaged and many of them are uninhabitable.
A study by the United States Army found that there is not enough clean water or medical care available to safely sustain the 20,000 people who now live here, about one-third of the pre-war population.
But these facts do not stand in the way of Mr. Karabeg and Mr. Alagic. The men are encouraging any Bosnian refugee with a strong back and the capacity to believe in El Dorado to make a new life here.
"By this summer there will be thousands more," Mr. Alagic predicted. "But they'd better want to work."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET TRUCE: THE DETAILS;
Both Congress and Clinton Find Cause for Cheer in the Final Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Both Congressional Republicans and the White House can find something to crow about in the $159.4 billion budget agreement that Congress passed today, and each side has eagerly trumpeted its gains.
Republicans met their goal of cutting $23 billion in discretionary spending from the budget over last year's levels. 
 Even though they were forced into some political horsetrading with the White House and shifted millions of dollars to some programs that they have targeted for outright elimination or deep cuts, they were able to force the Administration to accept offsetting cuts from other programs.
Though the agreement approved today does not address the larger, more important steps needed to balance the Federal budget -- particularly changes in entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare -- the $23 billion in cuts kept the Republicans on track in their plan to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, conceded that much today when he was asked what his party's biggest concession had been: "Money," he replied. "Big time."
On the other hand, though the provisions of the new agreement leave this year's budget $30 billion below President Clinton's request for 1996, the White House can clearly claim the advantage on policy issues.
The Administration was able to wrangle $5 billion in additional spending for the jobs, education and health programs it felt strongest about. And it rescued from the Republican trash heap the President's police-on-the-streets program, his Goals 2000 education program and his national service program, AmeriCorps.
And after months of bruising fights between intransigent and outspoken adversaries, the Administration won almost across-the-board success on major environmental disputes in the new budget agreement.
To the very end, a senior White House aide said, the talks on environmental issues were "an extremely high-energy, high-emotion, high-intensity series of discussions." The agreement gives President Clinton special waiver authority to overturn provisions in the bill on several environmental issues, some of which had been debated for nearly a year, his aide said.
Here is a rundown of specific features of the agreement:
 
Endangered Species
 The Administration will soon be able to resume listings of new species for protection under the Endangered Species Act, a procedure that has been halted since last summer, when Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, added an amendment on a spending bill that imposed a moratorium.
 
Wetlands
 The Environmental Protection Agency will retain the authority in existing law to veto permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers for draining and filling wetlands, a power that Senator Kit Bond, Republican of Missouri, had tried to limit.
 
Tongass National Forest
 President Clinton won in his fight with the three-man Alaskan delegation, Republicans all, over expanded logging in the Tongass National Forest. Though the White House agreed to pay about $100 million in economic aid to local governments in compensation, logging there will not be expanded.
 
Mojave Desert
 The bill would allow increased land use there, both recreational and for commercial purposes like mining. The President is expected to exercise a waiver that would nullify that provision.
 
E.P.A. Spending
 The Environmental Protection Agency, which throughout the budget struggle has been targeted for exceptionally deep cuts in its spending, is to be made almost whole, although its budget will not actually increase, as the President originally had sought, administration officials said.
The agency will be allowed to spend about $6.6 billion in the fiscal year 1996, which is already half over and ends in October. That is a shade less than it spent in the previous fiscal year, and is nearly $1 billion more than the amount allocated by the spending bill that Congress initially passed but that the President vetoed.
Agency officials said the financing would allow it to resume a normal pace of enforcement actions and inspections, one area that has been severely crimped during the long budget impasse, although it would take a long time to catch up on the backlog of unfinished work.
 
Toxic Wastes and Clean Water
 Similarly, work will resume at dozens of Superfund sites all over the country where the task of cleaning up toxic wastes has been halted, the officials said.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are being restored to revolving funds that help the states pay for sewage and drinking water treatment plants, they said.
 
Energy and Emissions
 There were some areas of policy in which Congress prevailed and the President decided not to fight any longer. For example, energy efficiency measures, steps to avoid the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are implicated in global climate change and programs to encourage the development of new environmental technologies have all been cut.
 
AmeriCorps
 Republicans had targeted Mr. Clinton's national service program for elimination. Under the new agreement, it survived, though with only $400 million, $69.5 million below the 1995 budget and $417 million below the President's request.
 
Goals 2000
 The Administration's program to improve the quality of education was also on the Republicans' kill list. But it will continue through at least this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, with $350 million, nearly $22 million less than last year.
 
C.O.P.S.
 The Republicans retreated on a plan to turn the President's cops-on-the-beat program a block grant to states and they also provided $1.4 billion, a slight increase over last year's budget of $1.3 billion. Administration officials said it was enough money to keep on track with its plans to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets in the next few years.
Advanced Technology Program
 The Commerce Department-run program was an early Republican target for elimination. But in the end, the Republicans relented and appropriated $221 million for one of Mr. Clinton's pet projects, which last year received $341 million.
 
Abortion Language
 Stripped from the bill is language that would have allowed states to deny payments for abortions for Medicaid recipients who become pregnant through rape or incest. But Republicans preserved a provision that forbids Federal, state or local Governments to deny accreditation, licenses or financial assistance to medical schools or hospitals that refuse to teach abortion procedures. The White House had opposed that language.
 
H.I.V. Policy
 The conference bill overturns a recent law that requires the mandatory discharge of members of the military who test positive for the virus that causes AIDS. That provision was part of a $265 billion defense authorization bill that Mr. Clinton signed on Feb. 10 but only after pledging that he would fight to have the law reversed.
 
Student Loans
 The Republicans dropped a plan to limit the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to 40 percent of new Federal loans. Intead, the bill limited administrative costs of the program to $436 million. The student loan issue was one of the first that the Clinton Administration seized upon as political ammunition against the Republicans.
 
Disasters and Security
 The bill authorizes $1.3 billion in supplemental appropriations for natural disaster relief for flooding in the Pacific Northwest and from last winter's blizzards in the Northeast. There is also $860 million for peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, $70 million for transferring F-16's to Jordan and $50 million to Israel for anti-terrorism measures.
 
Program Eliminations
 The budget kills 200 Federal programs, half of them in the Departments of Labor, and Health and Human Services. The Administration had suggested or supported many of the eliminations.
 
Public Broadcasting
 The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which came under a pointed and sustained attack from conservative Republicans for having a purported liberal bent, received $250 million.
 
Utility Assistance
 Nearly the entire budget for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program was restored -- $1 billion. Republicans ran into a maelstrom of protest and negative publicity when they proposed killing the program, which helps pay utility bills for the poor and some elderly people. House and Senate budget negotiators wound up cutting $100 million from the program.
 
Debt Collection
 The budget would give a new set of teeth to the Federal Government's debt collectors. Under the legislation, delinquent debtors would be barred from obtaining Federal credit and Federal employees who owe the Government could see their salaries garnished.
Private collection companies would be used to collect some nontax debts and the bill would put the Treasury Department in charge of a new, centralized effort to collect deliquent nontax debts, which are estimated to exceed $55 billion.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Stocks Rise Again, To 7th Consecutive High

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Nasdaq stocks rose to their seventh consecutive high yesterday, capping the market's busiest week in history.
As investors snapped up shares of technology and smaller companies betting that such issues might provide stronger earnings growth than blue-chip stocks, the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.72 points, to 1,186.89. For the week, the Nasdaq index gained 48.19 points, or 4.2 percent. 
 "Nasdaq is still acting very well, although it looks extended," said Harry Laubscher, an analyst with Tucker Anthony. "More and more secondary stocks are attracting buyers."
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 1.08 points, to 5,567.99, its fourth gain in five days. For the week, it was up 32.51 points. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.59 point, to 653.46.
But the story in the market yesterday continued to be Nasdaq trading, which topped 642 million shares, the fourth most active in history. Thursday's volume of 723 million was the second busiest while Wednesday's 728 million was the busiest ever, Tuesday's 650 million was the third biggest. On the New York Stock Exchange, 404.5 million shares traded hands yesterday.
Still, the pace of trading slowed ahead of the weekend and next week's battery of economic data, analysts said. Among the reports next week, the Government will report on gross domestic product for the first quarter on Thursday and employment in April on Friday.
The stock market is expected to approach the jobs data defensively, given the selloff on Wall Street after the February and March jobs reports were much stronger than expected.
"Things have quieted down after an extremely active week," said Alan Ackerman, a market strategist at Fahnestock & Company. "Players and stocks are tired."
For a second day, shares of E.I. du Pont de Nemours held back the Dow's gains. Du Pont, which fell 3 on Thursday after reporting weaker earnings, fell another 1 1/2 yesterday, to 79 1/4.
Philip Morris led the Dow's gainers, rising 1 7/8, to 89 1/4. At the company's annual meeting on Thursday in Richmond, the chief executive, Geoffrey C. Bible, pledged that the company would fight health-related liabilty suits and would increase spending on its United States tobacco operations.
Phelps Dodge rose 4 1/2, to 77. Business Week magazine reported that the company might be a takeover target for RTZ of Britain. Both companies declined to comment.
Estee Lauder rose 4 1/4, to 37 5/8, in anticipation of a strong quarterly earnings report next week, analysts said.
Several initial public offerings drew avid interest. Heartport Inc., a developer of procedures for performing minimally invasive heart surgery, skyrocketed 14, to 35, in its first session.
i2 Technologies, a software maker, jumped 19 3/4, to 39 3/4, in its first trading day.
Shares of Affinity Technology also made a strong Wall Street debut, rising 7 1/2, to 20 1/2. The company is a maker of electronic products aimed at speeding up bank consumer loans and other financial services.
In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,387 to 959 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Earlier in Tokyo, stocks ended slightly higher. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 4.93 points, at 22,235.03. Japanese financial markets will be closed Monday in observance of Greenery Day.

HEADLINE: Gambling in the Sunlight

 BODY:
Just a few weeks ago, Representative Frank Wolf's proposal to create a commission on the social and economic impact of the nation's gambling explosion seemed just the sort of virtuous idea that everyone in this partisan Congress could support. In early March the House approved the nine-member study panel without dissent. But the Virginia Republican's proposal is in trouble in the Senate and may die there unless the majority leader, Bob Dole, exerts leadership to rescue it.
A special interest group known for its generous campaign contributions -- the Nevada-based gaming industry -- has teamed up with prominent and well-compensated Republican lobbyists to try to stop the bill. With help from Nevada's Democratic Senator, Richard Bryan, and Alaska's Ted Stevens, the Republican chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the effort seems to be succeeding. 
Mr. Bryan blocked Senate action. Mr. Stevens, meanwhile, has produced a weak revision that would deny the commission the powers it needs to subpoena documents, convene investigative hearings and make recommendations that go beyond such obvious issues as native-American casinos and gambling on the Internet. Angered by criticism, Mr. Stevens last week decided, for now, against reporting any bill out of his committee. The delay increases the chance that the commission will die in the usual close-of-session legislative logjam.
The social and economic consequences of the rapid proliferation of casinos and state-run lotteries have received too little attention. There is room for a comprehensive look at the true costs and benefits for local economies and at the relationship between gambling and crime. There is also a need to look at the industry's role in creating gambling addicts and the extent to which earnings derive from problem gamblers. Even staunch supporters of legalized gambling cannot object to a fair effort to give localities the information they need to make informed decisions before turning to gambling as a source of new or increased revenue.
Although Mr. Dole has received hefty campaign contributions from the gambling industry, he has indicated his support for a national gambling study. To make it happen, though, he needs to move quickly to make room for the bill on the Senate calendar and to insure its passage with the commission's full investigative powers intact. Among other things the commission would study the gambling industry's ability to influence public policy. The Senate's timidity is a case in point.

HEADLINE: Cheap Gas vs. Stiff Upper Lips;
So Far, Deregulation Is Leaving Most Britons Cold

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: PLYMOUTH, England

 BODY:
You might think that American and other foreign energy companies would have an easy time stealing British Gas's residential customers, now that the Government is ending the giant utility's monopoly on home deliveries of natural gas.
After all, British Gas charges more for the fuel than just about any other supplier, and it is widely reviled for its shoddy service and, recently, for the huge compensation package it paid its chief executive. 
But if that's what you think, you probably haven't met the likes of Mark King, the director of a community center in this southwestern coastal town. "The way I understand it, it's the same pipeline, and gas is gas," said Mr. King, expressing the same kind of consumer befuddlement that greeted competition in the long-distance telephone business in the United States a decade ago. "So how is it I get a bill from any one of 9 or 10 different companies?"
Partly because of the confusion, the Government is proceeding cautiously with its free-market experiment, which officially begins April 29 in just three southwestern counties -- Devon, Cornwall and Somerset -- with 500,000 consumers. Deregulation will be expanded to the densely populated southeast in 1997 and to all of Britain in 1998.
But the American companies -- Amerada Hess, Texaco and the Southern Company -- are moving aggressively, hoping to glean experience they can apply back home when competition sweeps the utility business there.
Already, the barriers to competition for industrial and some commercial customers have come down in the United States, but homeowners are still locked into buying their gas from local utilities, with the price set by state regulators.
Scattered experiments are beginning, however, that allow residential customers a choice. Soon, residential customers in Wyoming will be asked to choose a gas company, for example, and last month, the public utility that delivers electricity to portions of Orange and Rockland Counties in New York and Passaic and Bergen Counties in New Jersey proposed a plan to allow 1,500 residents to choose their electricity supplier.
One thing American companies have learned the hard way in this country is that the English do not take kindly to door-to-door sales pitches. Sweb Gas, which is owned by the Southern Company of Atlanta, had to dismiss one of the companies it hired to ring doorbells after consumers complained its sales tactics were deceitful. "We decided not to try selling in person after doing some market research that showed it wouldn't be welcome," said Caroline Harper, Amerada Hess's managing director.
The American companies have also discovered that although the Government has published a booklet that thoroughly explains the competition and how it works, most consumers look to the gas marketers themselves for explanation. And making comparisons to competitive telephone services isn't enough, because consumers in some areas don't have a choice of telephone companies yet.
Finally, they are finding that hype falls flat in a country renowned for its stiff-upper-lip stolidness. Almost everyone is complaining about the flood of direct mail related to the competition. And none of the other marketing ploys -- not the sales representatives wearing brightly colored jackets who pitch their line in shopping center parking lots; not the ads plastered on billboards exhorting the public to call a toll-free number for information on how to save on gas bills; not even incentives like vouchers for savings at the Marks & Spencer department store chain -- are having much effect.
Many residents feel overwhelmed by the torrent of glossy pamphlets promising savings of up to 20 percent. Many have greeted the competition with a big yawn. "When we first started getting brochures in the mail, I just threw them away," said Anne Littlewood, a homemaker here. "Then my husband started looking into it. If it was up to me, I suppose we'd just do nothing."
Other reactions ranged from the suspicion that lower prices would lead to poor service to the hope that holding out would help push prices even lower. Then there is the undercurrent of jingoism that sets up an additional hurdle for the Americans.
Tom Birdwell, a taxi driver here, for example, views allegiance to British Gas as something of a patriotic duty. Buying from the Americans isn't an option for him. "They let us fight through the worst of the war and didn't come in themselves until the end," he says, referring to America's entry into World War II in 1941. "I'll buy British, thank you, and support British Gas."
Not all consumers are so dogmatic. But enough are either ignoring the blandishments of the nine gas marketers competing against British Gas, or putting off a decision to switch, that early projections about the impact of the new policy are being thrown into doubt.
While the campaign was expected to lure some 100,000 accounts away from British Gas fairly quickly, the participating companies say they don't expect to reach that level for several months or perhaps not even until next year.
Gas marketers like those participating in the pilot program here are undaunted. Many note that it took several years for consumers in the United States to accept competition for long-distance telephone service and that the AT&T Corporation still dominates that business.
"The light will eventually switch on with residential customers, just as it has with commercial users," said John W. Barr, a principal in Barr Devlin Associates, an investment banking boutique in New York that advises utility companies.
Indeed, some Britons are taking the plunge. John and Pamela Foster opted for a three-year contract with Total Gas, a joint venture between London Electricity P.L.C. and Total S.A., a French oil and gas company, after much thought. "If I save 10 percent, I'll be happy," Mr. Foster said. He figured that would knock his monthly bill down by $50 a year or so, roughly in line with the projected average savings for British households.
British Gas, for its part, expects its new rivals to make headway after their slow start. "We're like a cat with a rather long tail in a room full of rocking chairs," sighed Robert Dangerfield, a company spokesman.
Many of the same companies now vying for residential customers have been competing for commercial and industrial customers since 1986 with a fair amount of success, which they expected to repeat in the $20 billion residential market after Ofgas, the quasi-governmental agency that regulates the gas industry here, opened it to competition.
Many of the companies competing to supply gas to homes blame the Gas Consumers Council for the lack of interest among residents. "They've been most unhelpful," said Caroline Harper, managing director of Amerada Hess Gas. "They've implied that British Gas would be reducing its prices and advised people to wait and see how things went."
She and executives from other gas companies also said the regulators' decision to start competition in the spring, when gas consumption is tailing off, had hampered efforts to focus consumers' attention. "We haven't quite got the numbers signing up that we anticipated," said Graeme S. Boyd, sales and marketing manager for Total.
Linda Gilroy, the regional manager of the Southwest office of the Gas Consumers Council, had a different take. Ms. Gilroy said she was surprised by the apathy she encountered when she spoke about the issue recently to a group of Rotarians, a club for business people, in Exmouth. She had taken along a stack of booklets published by Ofgas that explain the competition and how it works, she said, but only one of her listeners opted to pick up a copy.
Consumers themselves say they find it difficult to understand how the competitive system will work. And it is a bit of an abstraction: British Gas will continue to operate and maintain the pipelines into residential homes, and the other gas companies will pay it a fee based on the volume of gas they pump through the lines. The newcomers are able to offer significant savings because British Gas is saddled with contracts made years ago that force it to pay well over current market rates.
Customers in low-income neighborhoods worry that the new companies will not be as understanding as British Gas about late payments or the lack of a family bank account -- even though they will have to abide by the same laws curbing cutoffs.
Mr. King, the community-service director here, prepays for gas using tokens that he feeds into his meter. He said the new companies had not made much effort to solicit accounts in his neighborhood, where unemployment runs high. But even if they had done so, he added, he would stay with British Gas.
"These new companies are unproven," he said. "Maybe in a few years, if they're even still around, I'd consider switching. But not for now.
"British Gas should have never been privatized, anyway," he added, giving voice to a commonly held philosophical reservation about the Government's new policy.
One might think British Gas would welcome the public's lukewarm support for the new foreign rivals, but instead, the company is desperately hoping that competition will take hold. That's because it is concerned that Ofgas will not allow it to compete head-on with the other gas marketers if they have not attracted enough customers, even though a spokesman for Ofgas said British Gas could lower its prices right away.
But if British Gas does begin competing here on price, it will risk the outrage of its 18 million other customers elsewhere in the country who will still be paying at the old rate.
"We're not in a very nice position at the moment," Mr. Dangerfield said, expressing a sentiment that may well be shared by some of British Gas's competitors.

HEADLINE: Yankee Who Captured Savannah Is Its Hero

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga., April 26

 BODY:
Not since William Tecumseh Sherman spared Savannah from the torch has this city been so indebted to a Yankee.
And so today, the town showed its appreciation for John Berendt, the New York author whose fabulously successful best seller, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," exposed Savannah's eccentricities to the world and spawned a cottage industry in the process. Tourism is booming here, and by everyone's account the main explanation is "The Book," as locals refer to it. 
 This morning, book fans and Berendt friends gathered in moss-draped Monterrey Square to hear the town crier, Harry Jennings, declare it "John Berendt Day" by official proclamation of the Mayor. The square, which is the setting for the book's central action, the murder of a young gigolo by a prominent dealer in antiques, was renamed for Mr. Berendt for the day.
Mr. Berendt said he was flattered. "I'm very pleased," he said, "although I'm a carpetbagger, to be, I guess, the favorite carpetbagger of Savannah.".
The event was concocted with the help of press agents at Random House, Mr. Berendt's publisher, to mark the completion of the book's second year on The New York Times Book Review's nonfiction best-sellers list. The book, with 900,000 copies in print and translations in 11 languages, has fallen off the list from time to time since being published in January 1994. But its appearance on Sunday (at No. 6) will mark its 104th week on the list. Warner Brothers expects to begin filming a movie version in Savannah early next year, with Clint Eastwood directing.
Some Savannahians, of course, would have preferred that their city not become known as home to the gay murderers, black drag queens, voodoo priestesses and piano-playing con men that populate the book.
"I don't think he played up the good parts of Savannah or the history of Savannah as I grew up with it," said Patricia B. McCuen, who was born here 68 years ago. "It's not just the little Southern back-stabbing town he talked about."
But for tourists, those characters and their world have proved an irresistible charm. Everybody, it seems, wants to tour a city that a local historian, John D. Duncan, likens to "a house of secrets."
In 1995, Savannah's hotel and motel room-tax revenues soared by 15 percent, triple the average growth in each of the previous four years. Registrations at the visitors' center increased by 6 percent after two consecutive years of declines.
"Everyone agrees that the book was responsible for the abnormal growth," said Ray Wood, an economic analyst with Savannah Electric who compiled the tourism statistics.
These days, it is common to see visitors walking the streets of the historic district, book in hand, searching for the Mercer House, where Jim Williams murdered Danny Hansford, or Clary's Cafe, where Mr. Berendt first encountered Luther Driggers, who was rumored to be interested in poisoning Savannah's water supply. So many tourists have traipsed through Bonaventure Cemetery, another setting, that the Trosdal family has removed the statue of Bird Girl, pictured on the cover jacket, and stored it in a garage.
Half a dozen companies now offer "Midnight" bus tours of the historic district, featuring personal reminiscences about key characters and stops at all the important scenes. "I have two buses that are full every day," said Pat C. Tuttle, owner of Hospitality Tours. "We turn people away. They're part of this cult."
Nancy Hillis, the model for the character Mandy, sells "Midnight" walking tour maps for $5 and a 45-minute videotape for $15. When tour buses stop by the Hamilton-Turner House, where she lives, Ms. Hillis summons visitors into the parlor to hear her life story and a brief anti-drug lecture. Finishing up her speech this morning, she looked at her watch and gasped. "I have to go talk to 500 Shriners," she said.
Mr. Duncan, who owns a Monterrey Square shop of antique maps and prints, charges at least $100 for his two-carousel slide lecture about the book's characters. He and his wife, Virginia, have sold so many copies of the book in their store that they now earn more from book sales than from his $42,000-a-year salary at Armstrong State College.
Next month, Deborah D. Sullivan plans to open "The Book" gift shop. "Our main feature will be the book, the map of the book, the tape of the book, the large print book, and, of course, the Christmas ornament series, starting with the Bird Girl," Ms. Sullivan said.
Property values in the historic district have been driven up by book-obsessed buyers, said Cora Bett Thomas, a longtime real estate agent. And after a Maine biotechnology company decided to move its headquarters here, its president told local officials that he first became interested in Savannah because of the book.
"I was hoping he would say it was our great marketing," said Richard A. Estus, chairman of the Savannah Economic Development Authority. "But he said, 'Well, I was reading the book and was fascinated and thought Savannah must have great character.' "
But perhaps no one, with the exception of Mr. Berendt, has profited from the book as much as The Lady Chablis, the sassy drag queen Mr. Berendt made famous. Chablis said in an interview -- on a cellular telephone -- that he had received a $100,000 advance from Pocket Books to write an autobiography, which will be published this summer. The title: "Hiding My Candy."
This week, Chablis modeled along with Marla Maples at a New York fashion benefit. When Ms. Maples's husband, Donald Trump, complimented his appearance, Chablis responded, "Well, see now, darling, you married the wrong woman."
Chablis is booked to perform this weekend at a society wedding in a Savannah park for more than $7,000. "That's very good money for 30 minutes work," he said. "I have to thank John Berendt. That book has changed my life."

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi Motors Plans Rescue of Embattled U.S. Unit

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 26

 BODY:
The American manufacturing subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, already the target of a potentially huge Federal sexual harassment lawsuit, is also facing serious financial problems that will force a reorganization and a huge capital infusion, the parent company announced today.
Mitsubishi said it would take a one-time charge against earnings to reflect the lower value of the American subsidiary, Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, which has lost money almost every year of its existence and is mired in debt. The charge, for the year that ended on March 31, is 32.6 billion yen, or about $300 million. 
 Mitsubishi Motors also announced a sudden change of presidents. Takemune Kimura, a manufacturing expert who is credited with revitalizing one of the company's main factories, will replace Nobuhisa Tsukahara, who has held the post for less than one year. It is the third prominent change at the top this month among Japanese automobile makers, following those at the troubled Nissan Motor Company and at Mazda Motor Corporation.
Mitsubishi said Mr. Tsukahara, who is ill and has been in and out of the hospital, had stepped down for health reasons. But the move also seems to reflect the decision of Hirokazu Nakamura, the company's powerful chairman, that a change was needed at a time when Mitsubishi was facing growing problems at home and abroad.
"The environment surrounding Mitsubishi Motors has drastically changed," Dr. Nakamura said at a news conference today. Mitsubishi has weathered Japan's long recession better than most of its competitors because it is the leader in the fast-growing sport utility market in Japan. But Honda, Toyota and others have introduced models that are now eating into Mitsubishi's market share. Mitsubishi is the No. 3 auto maker in Japan and is strong in other parts of Asia. But in the United States, it has a weak product lineup and a small, underperforming dealer network.
Mitsubishi officials said the naming of the new president, the planned reorganization of the American plant and the sexual harassment case were unrelated. They said the company decided to write down the value of its American subsidiary now, because results for the fiscal year that ended last month were strong. Even with the charge against earnings, and a 4.9 percent decline in sales, Mitsubishi Motors still expects to report a 9 percent increase in net income, to 20.5 billion yen. (But using the exchange rates in place at the end of the fiscal year, earnings will decline in dollar terms, to about $191 million.)
In his first public comments on the sexual harassment controversy at the factory in Normal, Ill., Dr. Nakamura said the incident had brought "shame" to the company. And he confirmed the company's desire to resolve the situation.
"Some say the press reports do not stick to the facts, but at the same time we have to admit that parts of the reports are true," Dr. Nakamura said. "It's a shame on us and extremely regrettable."
"I really hope that the case can be settled in a friendly manner as early as possible," he continued. "And I believe that the case will be settled in the near future."
Dr. Nakamura said he was worried that harassment charges could give consumers the impression that Mitsubishi lacked the discipline to produce quality products. He said other companies with the Mitsubishi name, which are only loosely linked to the auto company, had also expressed concerns about the impact on their sales and images.
Employees at the Illinois factory have also expressed some concern that the harassment suit will hurt sales, putting their jobs in jeopardy. But it became clear today that the real danger to their jobs is the plant's failure to reach its annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles since it began production in 1988.
The plant has made a profit in only one or two years, said Minoru Wada, a Mitsubishi managing director in Tokyo. The accumulated loss at Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing is $800 million and it has debts of $700 million.
So Mitsubishi Motors, perhaps with help from some other Mitsubishi companies, will inject what Mr. Wada suggested would be about $500 million in new capital into the American subsidiary to retire some debt.
The Illinois factory will undergo cost-cutting and the product line will be revamped. Tsuneo Ohinouye, chairman and chief executive of the American subsidiary, said the company, which has 4,000 employees, will "make a full effort not to have layoffs."
Mr. Wada said the aim was to cut costs so that the factory could be profitable even if it produced only 130,000 or 140,000 vehicles a year. In 1995, the plant produced 218,500 cars, its best year ever, but still lost an undisclosed amount of money, in part because the yen's rise made parts imported from Japan more expensive.
The factory in Illinois, which makes Mitsubishi's Galant and Eclipse models, was owned jointly with the Chrysler Corporation until Chrysler sold its share in 1991. But the output is still sold by both companies. Chrysler sold 80,000 of the cars last year, including the Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring.
But Mitsubishi faces new challenges because Chrysler is expected to stop buying cars from Mitsubishi in the next few years because the stronger yen has made the prices of the models noncompetitive.
"The fact that the Chrysler relationship is weakening is awful for Mitsubishi because they will have to sell the cars themselves and their network is so weak," said Saul Rubin, an analyst at SBC Warburg in Tokyo.
Mr. Kimura, the new president, completed engineering graduate school at Kyoto University. He is given credit for turning the Mizushima Works in the Osaka region into one of the most efficient factories in the company. He became executive vice president in 1993.
Still, the choice was a surprise because Mr. Kimura left the board of Mitsubishi last June to become president of a subsidiary, apparently because Mr. Tsukahara was named president of Mitsubishi Motors instead of Mr. Kimura.
Mr. Kimura has no international experience. And at 65, he might be a stopgap president.
At the news conference today, Mr. Kimura disclosed little about his plans other than to say that his biggest worry was maintaining sales volume and that he hoped to create a company "where all employees can work cheerfully."
He displayed a self-deprecating sense of humor. When someone asked about his health, he replied, "Only my head is bad."

HEADLINE: Bank Lobbying Blocks a Bill On S.& L.'s

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
After months of maneuvering, the nation's big commercial banks succeeded this week in blocking legislation -- supported by both the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership -- that would have forced them to pay a big share of the cleanup bill from the savings and loan crisis.
In a display of raw lobbying power, the American Bankers Association and individual banks from around the country won support from a handful of key Democratic and Republican House members who defied their parties to derail the measure, which would have cost banks $12 billion over two decades. 
 The banking legislation was supported not just by both party leaderships but also by regulators, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and so it may come up again this year. But industry executives, Administration officials and members of Congress said it was unclear how the measure could be pushed through without concessions to the banks.
The lack of legislative action increased the risk of default on $8.2 billion in bonds issued in the late 1980's to help pay for the savings and loan crisis. And it left unresolved a situation in which savings institutions pay vastly more for deposit insurance than commercial banks.
A savings institution with $100 million in deposits -- small by industry standards -- pays $230,000 a year in premiums to the savings insurance fund, because the premiums must go in part to paying interest on the bailout bonds. Healthy commercial banks, even the biggest, pay only a token $2,000 each to the bank insurance fund.
Because of the disparity, savings institutions are rushing to acquire or start commercial bank affiliates and shift deposits into them. That allows a savings institution to pay the much lower bank rate for insurance, but slashes the amount of money available to pay interest on the bonds.
Under Secretary of the Treasury John D. Hawke Jr. said that the bonds, which were authorized by Congress but do not carry an explicit Government guarantee, could be at risk of default as early as next year.
Under the legislation, banks would have had to pay $600 million a year for more than 20 years, in the form of increased deposit-insurance premiums, toward the bond interest payments. The much-smaller savings industry would have paid $180 million a year, plus a one-time assessment of $5 billion to strengthen its deposit-insurance fund.
Similar legislation was passed by the House and Senate last year, but was attached to the Republican-sponsored balanced budget bill that was vetoed for unrelated reasons by President Clinton last fall.
Given another shot at stopping the bill, big banks undertook a lobbying blitz in recent months, generating letters from thousands of bankers and leaning on legislators to whose campaigns they have contributed. They argued that the increase was an unjustified tax and that talk of a bond default was hyperbole.
Under an agreement by Speaker Newt Gingrich and the White House, the measure was to be attached to a temporary spending bill that Congress was about to vote on.
With both Democrats and Republicans on the House Banking Committee supporting the legislation, and with the bill having strong bipartisan support in the Senate, trade groups and such banks as Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, a strong opponent of the measure, focused their lobbying on a legislative bottleneck: the House Rules Committee, through which the measure had to pass.
Among those leading the opposition at a Rules Committee meeting on Tuesday night, participants said, was Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, a Republican who represents the district that is home to Banc One's headquarters.
On Monday night Ms. Pryce attended a long-scheduled fund-raiser held in Cleveland by the Ohio Bankers Association at which she received around $10,000 in campaign contributions. During 1993 and 1994 Ms. Pryce received $50,798 in campaign contributions from commercial banks and their lobbying groups, including $10,000 from Banc One, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization. During the same period, she received $4,000 from savings and loan institutions.
Among the others leading the opposition was Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee helps raise money for Congressional candidates.
Earlier this week Mr. Frost undertook the maneuver that brought the issue before the Rules Committee. He had been lobbied heavily by the Texas Bankers Association. He received $42,450 in contributions from commercial banks in 1993 and 1994, the analysis said, and $2,000 from savings and loans.
Democratic and Republican House aides said that when Mr. Frost voiced opposition to moving the measure through the Rules Committee, the bipartisan support collapsed.
One reason, they said, was that Republicans feared allowing Mr. Frost to portray himself as a hero to the banks in an election year.
Mr. Frost said his opposition to the measure was based on a belief that controversial legislation should have a chance to be fully debated and not be rammed through on the back of broader legislation.
Ms. Pryce said her opposition "was prompted by the surprise nature of its appearance" before the Rules Committee and said the bill was 'too controversial to be added" to the temporary spending bill.
After being blocked in the Rules Committee, the Administration and the House leadership had the option of trying again on Thursday by attaching the savings and loan legislation to the omnibus spending bill for the current fiscal year.
But a group of 24 House members led by Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, a Republican, had sent a letter to Mr. Gingrich last week saying they might have to withhold support for any budget agreement if the savings bill was attached to it. The 24 Representatives acted after heavy lobbying from banking groups, House staff members said.
Not wanting to risk the budget agreement, the Administration and House leadership moved the budget bill to the floor without the savings measure.

HEADLINE: Bond Market Idles Before Economic Reports

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended nearly unchanged yesterday, in a quiet trading session.
Bond prices traded in narrow ranges, as market participants waited for a number of important economic reports due next week that could provide a clearer indication of the strength of the economy and the outlook for inflation. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management plans to issue its survey on Wednesday, while the Government is scheduled to report on the gross domestic product for the first quarter on Thursday and April employment on Friday.
"The market is going to get a one-two-three punch next week with those three reports," said Matthew Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston.
 The bond market was also taking a breather yesterday after absorbing nearly $74 million in new Treasury notes and bills that were sold at auction this week. Supply, however, continued to be a concern: the Treasury plans to announce next week the terms of the quarterly re-funding.
The price of the 30-year bond edged up 2/32 , to 90, leaving its yield unchanged from Thursday at 6.79 percent.
Bond prices received a boost early in the session from a downturn in commodity prices. Rising grain, oil and other commodity prices have sent minor shock waves through the bond market. Experts were split over whether inflation could heat up long term. Bond investors fear inflation because it erodes the value of their securities, which carry a fixed rate of return.
 In addition, market watchers said bond prices were bolstered by purchases of two- and five-year notes by the Federal Reserve on behalf of foreign central banks.
 These so-called under-the-table transactions are commonplace on a small scale. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York declined to comment; the Fed almost never comments on such activity.
 "The market basically ended unchanged, but on the positive side, there was some buying by the Fed on behalf of foreign central banks," said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at IDEA Inc. a consulting firm in New York.
While the purchase by the Fed supported the market in general, Mr. Stiles said, the positive effect was tempered by dealers seeking to unload the new two- and five-year notes and one-year bills they had bought at auction this week.
 Dealers were trying to distribute recently sold securities ahead of the three critical economic reports set for release next week, he said.
The most important report next week will be on employment, said Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. The two previous monthly reports showed surprising strength in the job market, roiling the bond market both times.
The economy is expected to have created 129,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate is expected to be 5.6 percent, unchanged from March.
 Yesterday, the University of Michigan's released its final consumer sentiment index for April, which was higher than expected but was discounted by the market, traders said.
The index, released only to subscribers, stood at 92.7 compared with 93.7 in the final March index, traders said. Economists had expected a reading of 91.9.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Joins The Latin Trend To Free Markets

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 26

 BODY:
After reversing several years of stalwart resistance to free-market changes, Venezuela is under heavy pressure at home and abroad to produce results.
This week, the Government ended two years of currency exchange controls that had crippled the economy and had plunged the country into high unemployment and double-digit inflation. The Government has also removed some price controls and subsidies, reflected most drastically in a 470 percent increase in the cost of gasoline. It also set a timetable for privatizing some of the vast Government-owned assets this year. With these moves, Venezuela embraced changes that had swept through other Latin American countries years ago. 
 The plan was capped by a preliminary agreement for a standby loan with the International Monetary Fund -- the demon against which President Rafael Caldera campaigned when he won the election two years ago.
"After two years of the wrong policy, I think the President is taking the right steps," said Alejandro Salcedo, president of the Venezuelan stock market.
The I.M.F. board is expected to approve the $1.4 billion standby loan to fortify the country's international reserves and ease the federal deficit, said Fernando Egana, the presidential spokesman. The preliminary agreement by the I.M.F. opened the way for companion loans from the World Bank and the Bank for Inter-American Development. The banks are pledging $1.9 billion to bolster the Government system of employee severance payments, which is collapsing from mismanagement and corruption. Part of the $1.9 billion will go toward offsetting the economic hardships among the poorest Venezuelans that free-market changes are expected to cause.
"The Venezuelan agenda was not undertaken because the Government thought it had no other alternative, but because it thinks it was a good thing to do," Mr. Egana said. "I think people know the adjustment will be painful in the short run and better in the medium and long term."
While Venezuela is not expected to need the foreign cash immediately, the I.M.F. accord provides a measure of credibility to the economic revisions that, analysts said, are the last resort of a country whose economy has been spiraling downward under two years of tight Government control. Inflation ran at 70 percent over the last year, and was projected to reach 100 percent this year, with virtually no growth in the sectors of the economy unrelated to oil.
A bloated bureaucracy and a collection of state-owned enterprises in industries as varied as petroleum, mining, hotels, telecommunications, transportation, banking and electricity have left Venezuela with a deficit that would have reached 6 percent of the country's total output if the emergency measures had not been taken. The Government expects its changes to cut the projected deficit by two-thirds, Mr. Egana said.
While loans from international institutions have in effect thrown the Venezuelan economy a rope of credibility, the reprieve is a limited one. The I.M.F.'s $1.4 billion standby loan runs for one year and falls short of the complete backing that a three-year loan would have signified, analysts said.
With the lifting of the Government-set exchange rate, the value of the national currency, the bolivar, dropped from 270 to around 500 to the dollar, before essentially stabilizing at 465. An expected run on banks from industries starved for dollars did not materialize, in part because banks increased interest rates.
Domestic airlines doubled their fares overnight, and costs of everything from buses to groceries to newspapers have skyrocketed within the last week. The sales tax, which had been 12.5 percent, paid at the wholesale level, will rise to 16.5 percent, and will now be passed on directly to the consumer.
Olga Escalante, a 42-year-old mother of three who sat in a park near the gilded cupola of Congress, said that shopping had become an exercise in patchwork economics. The earnings of her 54-year-old husband, who lost his job in the mail room of a Caracas newspaper, shrank from $705 to $86 a month after he took a job in a perfume factory. "It's horrible," she said, "Today things are one price, tomorrow they're higher, and there's no increase in salaries."
Mrs. Escalante sells lottery tickets and cleans houses, while her high-school-age daughter has started cutting hair to help with the expenses. "Today, black beans that were 300 bolivars are 400, onions went from 100 to 190, floor wax to 900 from 600, sanitary napkins from 200 to 1,000."
The I.M.F. plan is not without its critics. Hugo Faria, an economist and financial analyst at the Institute for the Study of Advanced Administration, a private research organization, said Venezuela already paid 42 percent of its $14 billion annual budget toward servicing its foreign debt. And with some $100 billion in Government properties, he said, the country would do better "selling off its crown jewels" than increasing foreign debt.
The cornerstones of the economic program, he noted, were an increase in taxes and gasoline prices, and a surge in debt. "When you look at it from the financial side, it looks like a bailout of the Government at the expense of people," Mr. Faria said.
Venezuelans, who in 1989 rioted over price increases, appear resigned to austerity measures this time around. In a recent survey, some 86 percent said the changes should have been undertaken earlier. They said they would withhold judgment in the hope of seeing some improvement over the next year.
But some expect slow progress. "Of course, I have hope, at least that this will be a benefit for my children" Mrs. Escalante said. "I don't know whether it will be one for me as well."

HEADLINE: It Was Zoning That Allowed SoHo to Be SoHo;
Tax Inhibits Growth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You correctly state in your April 21 news article that only because so many people ignored the provisions of the Zoning Resolution was New York City able to regain some of its economic strength. 
 I hope that the City Planning Commission, in its revision to come out next month, will build in incentives to promote the new live-work concept from which so much of the new economic vitality derives.
The planning commission should eliminate the tax on the conversion of business buildings into living-and-work quarters, which to a large degree inhibits the growth of infant industries.

Germany Cuts Welfare; Lean Times for Europe?
With Europeans voicing widespread anxiety about whether they can remain competitive in the global economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced long-heralded cuts in Germany's well-padded welfare state that are intended to reduce Bonn's budget deficit by $33 billion. 
 The measures, which threaten social benefits that Germans regard as virtually sacrosanct and follow by only two days France's sweeping changes in its national health care system, underscore the worries among European Governments and businesses that leaner times lie ahead. High welfare spending and cosseted labor appear to be at risk as nations, led by Germany, work toward a single European currency. [Page 1.]
 
U.S. Budget Cuts, Wide and Deep
The budget bill signed by President Clinton, combined with other actions taken by Congress in the last year, will cut domestic spending by $24 billion, or 10 percent. Although Democrats rescued a few favorite programs, like the national service program known as Americorps, the Republicans cut spending for a wide range of domestic programs including housing, labor, education and Commerce Department programs. Many of the cuts, like those for the arts, were substantial. [D10.]
 
Stocks Advance;
Busiest Week Ever
Nasdaq stocks rose to their seventh consecutive high, up 2.72 points, to 1,186.89, capping the market's busiest week in history, as investors rushed to buy shares of technology and smaller companies. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 1.08 points, at 5,567.99, its fourth gain in five days. For the week, it was up 32.51 points. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.59 point, to 653.46. [41.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in quiet trading, as market participants waited for a number of important economic reports due next week. [47.]
 
For U.S. Business, Gains in Mexico
American companies operating in Mexico stand to gain from two important regulatory decisions. Although the fees that American-led telecommunications joint ventures will have to pay Telmex, the current phone monopoly, are higher than the seven new competitors wanted, they are lower than the target set by Telmex. Secondly, the Mexican Chamber of Senators voted to approve the creation of privately run pension funds. [38.]
 
Fuji Bank President Quits
The president of Fuji Bank, one of Japan's largest financial institutions, announced his resignation, but denied his decision was a result of Fuji's huge loan losses. Still, the resignation was seen as a way of assuming responsibility for the bad-debt problems, and puts pressure on the heads of other Japanese banks to step down as well. [39.]
 
Japan Leads Asian Currency Pact
Japan has concluded a currency pact with seven neighboring countries in an effort to expand its role in guarding against turmoil in the currency markets in Asia. In New York trading, the dollar fell to 105.55 yen. [40.]
 
Gasoline Futures Prices Surge
Gasoline prices surged for the sixth consecutive session on the New York Mercantile Exchange with unleaded gasoline for May delivery settling 1.20 cents higher at 76.81 cents a gallon. Wheat and corn futures prices again rose sharply. [40.]
 
Herman's Files
For Chapter 11
Herman's Sporting Goods, which operates 117 stores in the Northeast, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, saying it had $127.8 million in assets and $160.5 million in liabilities. The retailer, based in Carteret, N.J., said all its stores would remain open. [39.]
 
In Hoover's Town, Enduring Trust
The trust that "Boss" Hoover built with the 15,000 residents of North Canton, Ohio, home of America's leading vacuum cleaner maker, has endured -- happily for Maytag, which bought the Hoover Company. [9.]
 
Onassis Items Fetch $34.4 Million
The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate auction ended, after chalking up sales of $34.4 million. The last item that Sotheby's sold was Mrs. Onassis' last car, a 1992 BMW 325i four-door sedan. It went for $79,500. [27.]

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: IN ISRAEL;
Peres's View: Modest Boon

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 26

 BODY:
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, evidently relieved at being extracted by the American-brokered deal from a military operation that had gone awry, declared today that "Israel comes out of this with more quiet and more strength."
The announcement that attacks and counterattacks on civilians in Israel and Lebanon would cease early Saturday cleared the way for Mr. Peres to leave later that day on an official visit to Washington, a trip that was in question as long as the fighting continued. 
 Mr. Peres listed four elements of the agreement that he described as advantages over the unwritten 1993 accord that had similar aims: this one was in writing; it brought Syria, Lebanon, the United States and France into the picture as monitors; it explicitly forbade rocket attacks on northern Israel, and it did not ban Israel from retaliating when attacked.
But the agreement, brokered by Secretary of State Warren Christopher after a week of intensive shuttling, also left the Hezbollah guerrillas free to continue attacks inside the nine-mile-wide zone of southern Lebanon occupied by Israel as a buffer. That made the agreement a big target for the conservative opposition, and Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Peres's challenger in the May 29 national election, opened fire promptly.
"This is not what we waited for," he said. "This reinstates the previous situation, which created the crisis in the first place. This is an explicit Israeli license, in writing, for Hezbollah to act against Israeli Defense Forces in Lebanon, and furthermore it creates safe havens for Hezbollah in the villages."
Mr. Peres and Mr. Christopher announced the agreement at 6 P.M., a scant half hour before the start of the Jewish Sabbath, thus effectively cutting off debate for a day. But Mr. Netanyahu's onslaught and intenal deates that anticipated the pact made clear that the Lebanese operation would not be the political and military success that Mr. Peres evidently had hoped for.
On balance, most commentators said, it will benefit Mr. Peres's campaign by portraying him as a leader ready to take firm action to protect Israel's security -- but only if the pact held. If Katyusha rockets begin falling again, everybody agreed, Mr. Peres will suffer a serious political blow.
That effectively left Hezbollah with the potential to undermine Mr. Peres's election chances. But Mr. Peres seemed to place considerable significance in the fact that Syria had agreed to a written arrangement that involved it as a monitor.
Asked in a television interview what would prevent Hezbollah from attacking, he said: "Their hands are tied not to attack because if they do, it will cause a conflict, and if there's a conflict, it becomes an issue for Syria and Lebanon.
"The Syrians had an agreement with us in 1974, and there has been no infringement in the Golan Heights. I attribute great importance to the fact that Syria and Lebanon have agreed to be partners."
From the outset, Israeli officials said privately that the goal was not to disarm or destroy Hezbollah militarily, but to persuade Syria and Lebanon to curb the guerrillas.
In Israel's view, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria was not necessarily behind the Hezbollah offensive, but he alone is capable of reining in the guerrillas. The Israeli Government also holds that Mr. Assad has adhered to agreements he made, like the Golan Heights cease-fire.
The military operation was intended to increase pressure steadily by sending 400,000 refugees fleeing the south and by selectively shelling the Lebanese civil infrastructure. But the plan abruptly went awry on April 18, when Israeli gunners hit a United Nations camp full of refugees, killing more than 100.
That put Israel on the diplomatic defensive and prompted Mr. Christopher to seek a way out.
The question was whether it was Israel or Syria that got the best of the deal in the end. Though Mr. Peres never spelled out Israel's objectives, officials had indicated that they hoped Syria would agree in writing to rein in the guerrillas completely and to agree to revive peace talks.
In the end, Syria, which was effectively sidelined from the antiterrorism campaign opened by the United States after a spate of suicide bombings in Israel, found itself back at center stage in the search for a regional peace. Israel emerged with its image tarnished by the terrible carnage at the United Nations camp and the impression that it waged a deliberate campaign against civilians and economic targets.
The final toll was 160 dead in Lebanon and no fatalities in Israel. A Hezbollah leader said 13 guerrillas had been killed.
The "understanding" read out by Mr. Christopher was unsigned and obligated Syria only to sit on a monitoring panel whose actual powers and organization remained to be sorted out. Nothing condemned Hezbollah, and leaders of the organization declared their satisfaction with the arrangement.
Israel was also known to be unhappy about bringing France into the monitoring group. France generally sided closer to Lebanon and Syria than to Israel during the operation.
For Mr. Peres, the advantage was primarily the hope that rocket attacks against northern Israel would stop and that more Israelis would come to agree that only a comprehensive peace with Syria would really bring peace to the region.
Inside Israel, the fine points of the agreement were less important than the question of whether it could bring security to the north.
"It should be kept in mind that nuances in the formulas that Christopher has worked so arduously to bring about are of little concern to the Israeli public," wrote Hemi Shalev in Maariv. "As far as it is concerned, the test of the pudding is in the eating, and its judgment of the Grapes of Wrath," as the Israeli operation in Lebanon was called, "like its view of Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, will be reached exclusively in terms of results on the ground."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Under the Agreement"
 
Groups in Lebanon will not fire rockets or other weapons into Israel.
 
Israel and its allied militia will not fire at civilian targets in Lebanon.
 
Nothing precludes anti-Israeli guerrillas from attacking soldiers in the Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon.
 
Populated areas and industrial facilities will not be used as launching grounds for attacks on Israeli soldiers.
 
Each side retains the right to self-defense.
 
The United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria form a Monitoring Group to follow compliance with the agreement.

HEADLINE: Model Corporate Citizen Finds Its Trust in Doubt Over a Zoning Issue

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Tale of Town and Company

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: NORTH CANTON, Ohio, April 26

 BODY:
It came down to whether they could still trust Hoover, their local corporation. Was Hoover still Hoover? Or had the 1990's turned the Hoover Company, America's leading vacuum cleaner manufacturer, into just another subsidiary controlled by a faraway corporation? That is what North Canton's 15,000 residents have struggled to figure out these last two years.
A mundane suburban zoning matter set off the soul-searching. In 1994 the company announced plans to sell 241 acres here that had been owned by the Hoover family since the early 1800's. Would Hoover follow its past and make sure that the development was a tasteful addition to North Canton? Or would Hoover, purchased by the Maytag Corporation seven years ago, behave like the subsidiary of a bottom-line corporation and squeeze what it could onto the land? 
 Which Hoover? people asked.
From the turn of the century until the mid-1980's, what Hoover was, was as plain as day: an exemplary corporate citizen of North Canton, Ohio, founded by W. H. (Boss) Hoover and guided into the 1950's by his eldest son, H. W. Hoover Sr. At one time Hoover vacuum cleaner salesmen were treated like heroes here, gathering from around the nation every summer and parading along Main Street -- "It beats as it sweeps as it cleans," they'd sing -- before bedding down at the Hoover Camp for the annual retreat.
Hoover has been the family and the company whose generous donations made everything major in North Canton possible -- the City Hall, the library, the Y.M.C.A., Hoover High School, the ball parks, the hook and ladder fire engine, the community Christmas tree on the Hoover factory lawn, $970,000 worth of computers for the public schools.
Stark County is a political bellwether that swings between Republicans and Democrats in Presidential elections, and it is no accident that North Canton is a Republican stronghold. It is Hoover. People here grew up trusting Hoover and voting Republican. If that trust was broken now, it would be bad news for the Republican vision of America.
It is a commentary on the edginess that people feel in these days of restructuring and downsizing that even the president of a company with Hoover's track record must constantly reassure his work force. The president, Brian A. Girdlestone, says: "With employees, at every opportunity I remind them this is still Hoover, the same values. I say it directly and I say it often."
 
Trusting Hoover? Yes, but Maytag?
Hoover went through big changes starting in the 1980's. It has downsized its unionized work force in Stark County to 2,000 from 3,300, while opening factories in Mexico and Texas. It has reduced its famed sales force and other salaried positions by 47 percent since 1988. It was bought by a holding company, Chicago Pacific, in 1986, and by Maytag three years later.
Suddenly, trusting Hoover meant trusting Maytag. Maytag! If ever North Canton residents needed a cautionary tale for modern corporate behavior, it was Maytag. Maytag had gone from a widely respected, highly profitable manufacturer of appliances, with its headquarters in small-town Newton, Iowa, in the mid-1980's, to an overextended fumbler in the international market. In recent years Maytag has closed factories and sold off Hoover's European and Australian operations to generate cash.
Last year, Maytag paid a $16.5 million settlement to 800 West Virginia workers in its Dixie-Narco division. The workers said contended that Maytag had breached its trust by closing a factory that it promised to keep open.
In 1994, when Hoover announced plans to sell the 241 acres, residents here asked themselves: Was this Hoover or was it Maytag, pushing a button in its vacuum cleaner division to suck up cash?
At public meetings Lynne S. Dragomier, a Hoover vice president, promised that the company would be a "steward" of the land in the tradition of Boss Hoover: 70 of the 241 acres would be donated to the city for Little League ball parks, and another 50 acres would be donated to a local university.
But the plan also called for 52 acres of retail and office development in a county that many feel is overrun with drugstore chains, fast-food restaurants, malls and shopping centers. As Dick Stahl, an opponent, said, "Per capita, we probably have more drugstores in North Canton -- I don't think we have that many sick people."
Residents of this middle- to upper-middle-class suburb proceeded cautiously before challenging their biggest employer. A private poll commissioned by Hoover last summer indicated that a large number of people were undecided.
Some, like Ruth Basner, a local historian, proclaimed their trust at public meetings. "Trust has made North Canton what it is," she said. "I trust the Hoover Company."
More debated it privately. "Trust, yes, it's a matter of trust," said Gary Wechter, a 15-year member of the City Council who didn't say much publicly. "I was torn."
Families were torn. Judy Douglass put up a sign in her front yard supporting the opponents, Residents Against the Maytag Mall, or RAMM. When her husband mowed the grass, he yanked it down. "My husband said, 'You don't know who else could buy up that land and do anything they want with it. At least we know Hoover.' "
Mrs. Douglass wasn't so sure.
Mr. Girdlestone, Hoover's president, has mailed four letters to every North Canton home over the last six months. Last month's letter urged residents not to sign a petition to put the rezoning on the November ballot.
Stark County's major corporations -- the Timken Company, Hoover, Republic Engineered Steels and Diebold -- have played an important role in keeping the Republican Party strong here. When Charles Brown, the party's county chairman, is asked why the Canton area is not as heavily Democratic as other Ohio cities like Akron or Cleveland, he gives a one-word answer: "Timken."
It is a complex answer. It is not just that the Timken Company, the county's biggest employer, has a chairman, W. R. (Tim) Timken Jr., who is active in Republican politics. It is that Timken, the steel and roller bearing manufacturer, has been owned by the same family for a century and has stuck by the community through the Depression and the Rust Belt years, richly endowing schools, hospitals and cultural institutions here.
Right alongside Timken was Hoover. The most striking symbol of the kind of citizen Hoover has been is the vacuum cleaner factory itself, which sits in the center of town. In many Midwestern cities, the factory is at the end of a dead-end street, bordered by slums. Hoover's factory is a handsome brick building with lots of windows and a quaint smokestack straight out of a Norman Rockwell print.
When Hoover announced in 1994 its plan to sell the 241 acres, the first thing many thought was, "Maytag's moving Hoover out!" Hoover's vice president called city officials to assure them. "I wanted them to know there were no further symbols here," Ms. Dragomier says. "The real estate market was good, and it was a good time to divest in land we didn't need."
Hoover signed a contract with Robert DeHoff, a local developer. Mr. DeHoff assumed that Hoover's reputation would make the rezoning easy. He learned differently at the first public meeting in the summer of 1994. As Mr. DeHoff entered, he held the door for an elderly man with a cane, then introduced himself. "He says to me" -- it was a profanity. "That's when I knew," Mr. DeHoff said.
Approval is a two-step process. First the 241 acres had to be annexed by North Canton from a neighboring township. Then the land, which was zoned primarily for residential use, had to be rezoned to permit 42 acres of stores and restaurants.
To North Canton officials, annexation seemed logical, giving the city oversight of development and the benefit of increased tax revenue. On Nov. 14, 1994, the City Council voted unanimously to annex.
Yet, even the pro-Hoover comments that night reflected a jitteriness. Councilman Daryl Revoldt argued that the development would bring new jobs and help diversify the economy. People understood what went unsaid: Diversification was necessary because Hoover might not always be here.
Norman Kutz, of Walsh University, which was to receive a 50-acre donation, urged action while Hoover was still Hoover. "That leadership that's there now," he said, "may not be there 5 or 10 years from now as we know them -- or have the feelings toward this community."
The opposition, mainly homeowners who had grown accustomed to living near Hoover's empty fields and woods, fought back. The next month they collected more than 1,000 signatures opposing the Hoover plan and annexation, forcing a citywide referendum. "It wasn't hard getting people," said Kathy Magel, an opposition leader. "We did it in eight days." She told neighbors she did not blame the company; she blamed the City Council for not standing up to the company. "You can't trust a corporation," she said.
Opponents knew where the fear lay. Their speeches and yard signs always called it the Maytag plan, never the Hoover plan.
 
A Revised Plan, With Lots of Green
Hoover's president had assumed that donating the two parcels of land would be enough to show good faith, and was caught off guard. "You hear the things being said," Mr. Girdlestone recalled, "you get a little hurt. You're giving all this land away and you think, my goodness."
Residents Against the Maytag Mall got their yard signs out first last summer. "The day those 500 signs went up," Ms. Magel said, "they knew how serious we were."
Hoover officials felt they had to start a campaign, even if the company appeared heavy-handed. "We had to undertake it to defend not only the plan, but our honor," Ms. Dragomier said.
They also considered changing the land plan. While Hoover kept saying that the 52 acres of commercial and office space would not be a mall, opponents effectively countered that the two local malls, Canton Centre (55 acres) and Belden Village (65 acres) were a similar size.
So Mr. Girdlestone decided to ask Maytag for permission to reduce the commercial tract from 42 to 22 acres, which would also reduce the price Hoover would get for the land, according to Mr. DeHoff.
Mr. Girdlestone has considerable influence within Maytag, in large part because of Hoover's profitablity. Susan Gallagher, a NatWest Securities analyst, says of all the corporation's product lines -- including Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Admiral, Dixie-Narco -- Hoover ranks second in earnings.
When Leonard A. Hadley, Maytag's chairman, visited last summer, the two met in Hoover's board room. "He realized the importance of Hoover being Hoover," said Mr. Girdlestone. "Part of Hoover's continued success is our relationship with the employees and community."
Mr. Hadley approved the change. "He said if it's the right thing to do, do it," Mr. Girdlestone recalled.
In September, as part of its $75,000 advertising campaign, Hoover mailed all residents a glossy revised land plan that was strikingly green. The next phone survey Hoover did showed "significant movement in the polls for the Hoover plan," Mr. Girdlestone said.
Suzanne Burnett, a retired Hoover High School teacher, said she had been on the fence but felt that reducing the commercial area was a signal this was still Hoover. "I studied the opposition's mailings," she said, "I didn't see anything that gave me reason not to trust Hoover."
People can be cynical, but it is striking how many good deeds done long ago gave Boss Hoover's company the benefit of the doubt now. Ms. Burnett recalled, "When the schools didn't have money to meet the payroll in the Depression, Boss Hoover supposedly brought money into the schools."
Many retired Hoover workers still live here and spoke of Hoover loyalty. The company's second chairman, H. W. Hoover Sr., had the same secretary, Esta Stoner, for 46 years.
People mulled it over and found evidence that Hoover was still Hoover. The last chairman to run Hoover when it was locally controlled, Merle R. Rawson, a widely admired figure, had handpicked Mr. Girdlestone as his successor.
Jim Repace, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' local at Hoover, saw it as a good sign that Mr. Girdlestone has invested in the plants here, and last year signed a five-year union contract. "We have our problems," he said, "but people have it nice here, they really do."
 
A Windy Omen For Annexation
To get out the vote, the pro-Hoover forces assembled a phone bank of everyone from Little League coaches to retired teachers. "One man I called said this would be a project Boss Hoover would approve of," Ms. Burnett said.
Mr. Revoldt, the Councilman, said he could see things turn Hoover's way in October. "We had a particularly windy set of days, a real Ohio fall," he recalled, "Yard signs were blown down, and afterward I noticed a lot of the opposition signs didn't go back up."
After Judy Douglass's husband took down her RAMM sign, she did not put it back. "I felt Hoover had listened," she said. "I studied that map they sent out -- it was awfully green." She voted for Hoover. "Now I just hope we will be able to trust them."
The annexation passed with 77 percent of the vote. Last month the City Council unanimously approved the rezoning. Opponents have until today to file petitions to put it on the November ballot.
Asked how he thought it would go, Mr. Girdlestone said last week: "They'll get it on the ballot. You can always get people to sign a petition. But we'll win."
Actually, Mr. Girdlestone didn't know it, but Hoover had won. The opposition leader, Ms. Magel, confided to a reporter last week that she would not circulate petitions again. "I could get the signatures in three days," she said. But fighting the commercial area, she added, would also mean fighting the good parts of the plan, like the Little League fields, the university land and new homes.
"It was hard standing up to the establishment in a small town," she said. Hoover outspent her group by 6 to 1.
Ms. Magel says she will monitor the project. She takes pride in having pressured Hoover to alter its plan. "We're not interested in ripping the town apart again," she said. "What's the point? They'd have all those Little League people out there working the phone banks again."
 
Throughout the Presidential election year, articles in this series will examine Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County, a political bellwether for decades.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S.-Backed Pact Puts Japan In New Role in Asian Finance

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 26

 BODY:
Japan has concluded a currency pact with seven neighboring countries in an effort to expand its role in guarding against turmoil in the currency markets in Asia.
Under the arrangements, announced on Thursday, Japan would effectively lend money to the seven central banks against United States Treasury securities and then reverse those deals in what are called repurchase agreements. 
 Such agreements would allow the central banks -- those of Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- to stabilize their currencies against the United States dollar in times of volatility. In February, Japan reached agreements with Hong Kong and Singapore to cooperate in interventions in the currency markets. But today's pact is more extensive.
As the largest economy in the region, Japan appears to be stepping up to a leadership role as a lender of last resort in Asia. Moreover, some economists say this is a step in a broader effort to play a greater role in managing exchange rates in Asia -- and to increase the influence of the yen, which remains a distant second to the United States dollar in Asian dealings.
"It's a manifest attempt to take leadership," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.
With the collective foreign exchange reserves of Asian countries now surpassing the total of the Group of Seven countries -- which include Japan -- the Asian central banks appeared poised to take a larger role in currency markets.
But some currency traders said the arrangement would have little impact. "What the market really wants to see is for these countries to use their own money" to stabilize exchange rates, a Japanese trader said.

HEADLINE: Dollar Off on Rates Talk

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday after a Japanese newspaper said the Bank of Japan could raise interest rates as early as May, setting off a yen rally that held up even after the report was denied by the central bank.
The approach of two holidays in Japan also helped weaken the dollar, as many traders speculated that the Bank of Japan would not intervene to help the dollar next week. 
 "This is not a market you want to be involved in over a very long Japanese weekend," said Elena Shperling, chief trader at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia. Financial markets in Japan will be closed on Monday and Friday.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 105.55 yen from 106.70 yen Thursday. The dollar fell to 1.5284 German marks from 1.5340 marks.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Daniel A. Lehner;
Making Sure You Have Something to Read While In-Flight

BYLINE: By DEBRA M. KATZ 

 BODY:
DANIEL A. LEHNER is president of three corporations: Inflight Newspapers, a multimillion dollar business that distributes newspapers and magazines to airlines and hotels; Inflight Advertising, which manages the advertising and manufacturing of the plastic binders that hold the magazines distributed by Inflight Newspapers, and Lehner International, which oversees Mr. Lehner's various business investments, like the Great American Cafe, a Valley Stream restaurant.
Mr. Lehner built his businesses, which employ 150 people in all, out of a small candy store in Queens that his grandfather began in 1936. As late as the early 1970's, Mr. Lehner says, he himself was driving the truck that delivered the newspapers. 
 He is the president of the Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce and the Valley Stream Chamber of Commerce. He serves as director or trustes at Dowling College in Oakdale, Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, the Long Island Philharmonic in West Islip, the Association for a Better Long Island in Hauppauge, WLIW-TV in Garden City, and the Long Island Coalition for Fair Broadcasting in Garden City.
He grew up in Massapequa Park and now lives in Cedarhurst with his wife, Remy, and her son from a former marriage. He has a 24-year-old daughter from his first marriage. Together he and his wife do much work for charity. On Dec. 12, to mark their second wedding anniversary, they raised $1.2 million for various charities by buying all the seats for a performance of "Phantom of the Opera," the Broadway show close to their hearts because it is where they met.
Both he and his wife are avid private pilots and Mr. Lehner belongs to many aviation groups, including the Long Island Air Guard, of which he is the chairman.
Q. How did you build a multimillion dollar distribution company from a small candy store in Queens?
A. After the war, my father and grandfather couldn't get two salaries out of the store. About 1951 a secretary from T.W.A. came in looking for a special kind of Cuban cigar. They didn't carry that because it was very expensive, like $5 for a box of 50. Nowadays that'd be very cheap, you buy one cigar for $5.
So she said she wanted XYZ cigars and either my grandfather or my father said, "Hang on one second. I know exactly where to get it." So one of them jumped out of the store and ran down and got it where they knew they could find it from a wholesaler. They came back with a bill, you know like a chit you get from a luncheonette, that said on it $4.95 or $6.95 and they handed the bill to the lady to pay for the cigars. There was no thinking about their time involved or their expertise in knowing where to get the product and so on. She just paid the wholesale price.
She was so impressed with this that she said: "We need newspapers. And what happens is every time we send someone down with $5 in petty cash they buy 2 packs of cigarettes for themselves, 4 candy bars for the rest of the crew and maybe 10 newspapers." At the time newspapers were a nickel a copy, very inexpensive. So what we did, and we didn't know this at the time, we brought a control factor to the purchase of newspapers. And that's probably the best thing we do here is control where the product goes.
Q. So this major company began with a secretary from T.W.A. who said, "We need newspapers"?
A. Right. They brought over a bundle of newspapers no bigger than this pile here (Mr. Lehner points to a stack of several papers) and they would do this constantly. Then they went off and acquired other airlines and built the newspaper business to the point that by 1960 they were selling 8,000 to 10,000 newspapers.
Q. And you went into the business in 1965?
A. Right. In 1968 I developed something called the inflight system and that provided for the distribution of magazines all over the world.
Q. So at some point you began adding magazines to the newspapers?
A. Right. The real secret to the magazine distribution is the fact that we get it to where the airplanes are. Say American Airlines has 600 airplanes. The airplane mix doesn't really change, but where the airplanes are on the ground changes. For instance, if they open up the Raleigh-Durham hub, all of a sudden all the planes are in Raleigh-Durham. If they make the New York to Florida trip, the planes are in Fort Lauderdale. We keep track of all the scheduling.
Q. You bring the newspapers and magazines to the airplanes themselves?
A. We get them to the catering facilities in most cases. Catering is one of the last things to go on board an aircraft. And the same thing with the magazines. We need the planes on the ground long enough to change the magazines, too. That's part of the criteria for the calculations; in La Guardia you have a 30-minute turnaround. They come in, get another group of people and take off.
If you want to go to Chicago, you wouldn't think about where that plane goes afterward. That plane goes from here to Chicago, down to Kansas City, over to Alberquerque, up to L.A. and maybe ends up in Seattle that day before the trip ends. So what I need to know is, where is that plane overnight? If it's going to overnight in Seattle, that's where I need to have the magazines.
Q. So you go to airports all over the country?
A. All over the world. We do it for 900 airlines. If you want to say, what is the real essence of what we do here, we are a distribution company.
ip,1mQ. And everything comes out of this building?
A. Right.
Q. Why did you choose Valley Stream?
A. This was the first town out of New York City.
Q. As you got more and more successful, did you ever consider moving to one of the fancy industrial complexes being built all over the Island?
A. They're actually too far away for my purposes.
Q. Because you need the airports? How quickly do you get to Kennedy Airport from here?
A. Probably 10, 15 minutes.
Q. With so many businesses leaving Long Island and folding, you're still happy being on Long Island?
A. I could do this operation probably either on the West Coast, going out to L.A. or San Francisco, or go to Chicago and still reach most of what I want to reach. But we have made a conscious decision to be in Valley Stream. The people on Long Island are great people. You give them opportunities and they grow with them. Most of my people here are homegrown. My personnel director started as a secretary. The assistant marketing director started as a secretary.
Q. You've made a small business into a very large, successful one on Long Island. What advice do you have for someone who wants to start a small business on Long Island?
A. In retail, do not compete with any of the big boxes, the Home Depots, the Incredible Universes.
Create a niche. My business is very, very much a niche. And every time I look at a business -- or even the expansion plans we have, we have several things on the drawing board -- I reject it when they don't have a major niche. Something we can do especially, we know how to do because of our expertise.
Q. So is the time for the small mom and pop store ended forever?
A. It's not going to be the same as it was before. Main Street is changing.
Q. Well, let's look at Cedarhurst's "Main Street," for instance. Cedarhurst used to have the most bustling, thriving, fashionable "Main Street" on Central Avenue. Now there are vacant stores everywhere. What advice would you give to Cedarhurst?
A: Most downtown Main Streets need to be reconstructed. A good example is what they did at Stony Brook. There were some old stores and they reconstructed it all, starting with the post office. They brought in several catalogue stores. These are the highly specialized stores you want to try to get.
Q. Victoria's Secret?
A: That would work. If you can attract them -- and it's not easy to attract them because you have to come up with tax incentives and rent incentives -- the community enjoys going to new products, to a new big box.
Why are there so many strip malls? Because they're new stores. When I did the restaurant, the restaurant was totally rebuilt. The facade's new, the inside's new, everything was gutted. We need to do that to the downtown areas.
Q. Do our winters hurt businesses?
A. Take advantage of it. If you've got snow, sell snow shovels. It's like when we were designing our product, we said, what do we have to do to stay one step ahead? Recycle paper. That's what's going on now.
I just heard of a brand new store that opened up that only sells the late night TV products. So if you want to go buy a thingamajig that makes your stomach get smaller, or something like that, and it was advertised on TV, this guy's got it. That was a clever idea.
Q. What are the disadavantages of owning a business on Long Island?
A. High taxes and high electric bills.
Q. You're the president of the Valley Stream Chamber of Commerce and the Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce. Tell me what a successful chamber of commerce does for businesses in its town.
A. No. 1 is to provide the information that's necessary to the smaller business people who cannot get out and find out what's going on. You have to bring it to them. You can't expect them to show up at every meeting and every seminar. If that means somebody is out pounding the pavement, that's what you have to do.
Q. What do you do as the president of the Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce?
A. We get together with about 25 Chamber of Commerce presidents once a month and we exchange ideas. For instance, in Valley Stream, we put up banners at Christmastime and the streets are lit. We've done this by taking it in small pieces and allowing each store owner to do a piece of the decorations instead of one person trying to decorate with thousands of dollars worth of stuff. They rent the banners for $50 a year and the lights on each tree costs $100 a year. It's like adopting that tree.
So we've shared this information now with Great Neck who might have tree-lined streets so they can go out and do it. We need an awful lot more of the interaction of information.
Q. You have a nice balance in your life: You have a multimillion dollar worldwide business yet you're very involved in the details of small-town life, like putting Christmas lights on Main Street.
A. I think it's a throwback to when my grandfather had this ice-cream store, which wasn't any bigger than the local flea market vendor. Our community is only what we make it. Too many people say, "Oh, somebody else'll do it," but that somebody else might not be around.

HEADLINE: Putting the Focus on the Family Business

BYLINE: By LEONARD FELSON 

 BODY:
WHEN Peter M. Deane, the founder of a kitchen design firm in Stamford, died five years ago at the age of 50, his wife, Ingrid Deane, hired an outsider to run the company until their children, then in their early 20's, could develop experience and grow into the family business.
"It was a wise thing to do. In a small business you can disintegrate quickly if you're leaderless," said Robert Ker Jr., the man hired as chief executive officer of Kitchens by Deane, and a mentor to Carrie, 29, and Peter, 26, since. 
 Going outside -- wise as it may have been -- also may be the exception to the rule when in managing family businesses. That is an issue that the year-old Family Business Program at the University of Connecticut is exploring these days.
"Our mission is simple: to foster growth and development of family businesses," the director of the program, Richard N. Dino, said.
Family businesses face the same business problems as all businesses, but add to that the problems of family, and, Dr. Dino said, "that creates a pool of challenges that are different than what you might have if you're part of a business that is not family-owned and operated."
For UConn, the new venture underscores the changing economic times as big business, long the emphasis at the university's business school, downsizes.
The dean of UConn's School of Business Administration, Thomas G. Gutteridge, said "We're really reaching out to unique niches -- entrepeneurial companies, family businesses, nonprofit organizations, in both directions, trying to provide services and get them involved in what we're doing."
In addition to helping family businesses with practical advice, the new program also is engaged in academic research on the subject. Mr. Dino, an economist, recently co-authored a study with William S. Schulze, also from UConn's business school, on the relationship between organizational governance, or how a business is run, and chances for survival.
The program is also part of a growing movement among business schools to focus on family businesses, which account for 80 percent to 96 percent of the 15 million businesses in the United States, according to Mr. Dino. In Connecticut, with more than 76,000 businesses operating, an estimated 69,000 have been defined as family businesses.
"Historically, family businesses have always been thought of as Mom and Pop operations, and while a huge chunk are three-, four-, five-person operations, there's a significant mid-market size of companies in the $5 million to $100 million range," Mr. Dino said.
Since Mr. Dino was hired to run the Family Business Program, he has been traveling around the state trying to recruit owners and partners in family business to join the program, which conducts seminars, workshops and various other networking events.
Among issues likely to be dealt with are resolving conflict, estate planning, forming a board of advisors, what it's like to be a successor, planning for the worst and preparing a transition.
To date, the program has 20 family business members, who pay a $2,500 annual fee -- which Mr. Dino reminds prospective members is an amount they could spend in one or two days with their lawyer.
"I tell them to look at that money as an investment in their company's future," he said. "You make an investment in your plant and equipment and you make investments in human resources. I tell them, 'This is an investment in your family business capital.' "
At the program's first event, which featured UConn women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma after the team won the national title, only 30 people showed up. But the second event drew 60 and the third, 95.
Mr. Ker, of Kitchens by Deane, said he is one of the program's most enthusiastic supporters. "I jumped aboard fast because I felt it would be very helpful to the children," he said. "It's been helpful to them and to me, and I've been around businesses a lot of years." What Mr. Ker finds most helpful is the program's practical emphasis. "It isn't theoretical," he said, "it focuses on very basic issues like how do you keep a family business running past the first generation."
Another convert to the program is Michael D. Hobbs, president and second-generation owner of Hobbs Inc., a New Canaan residential general contracting business. So far the Hobbses have avoided many of the sensitive issues that can entangle family businesses, in large part because his father retained a team of advisors (a lawyer, accountant, an estate planner and insurance representative) to help set up a detailed succession plan. Also, Mr. Hobbs, one of two children, was the only one interested in the business, and among his three children, all grown now, only one, Scott, has followed in his father's footsteps.
Mr. Hobbs, who was involved in early focus groups when the family business program was being launched and now serves on its advisory board, said it wasn't until he began listening to other family business stories that he realized how sheltered he had been.
"Inside of any given family, the perception of who should be given what kind of authority can be extraordinarily difficult," he said. "If you have good communication, you're 50 percent of the way along, but if a father says to his child, who may now be 50 and is treated the same when he was when he was 15, 'I'll tell you what to do,' it can be catastrophic, and things don't get less complex, they get more complex as time goes on."
Added Mr. Hobbs: "If we're going to be a nation of small businesses, and I don't see any reason why that isn't likely, given technology, the level of sophistication among family business owners simply has got to increase or we're going to have one- generation businesses" that will either fail or be sold to outsiders in the next generation.
While professional advisors certainly can help family businesses, Mr. Dino said his program can help when sensitive issues go beyond the realm of lawyers' or accountants' expertise. "If I have to fire my son or daughter because they're doing a lousy job," he explained, "or as a son if I have to tell Dad, 'You're in the way, you have to step aside,' who do I go for to ask for help?"
Such issues, Mr. Dino said, will need to be addressed increasingly as the bulk of family businesses, which were started after World War II, begin to be passed to the next generation as the owners and founders reach retirement age.
"There's trillions of dollars of assets that are going to be transferred to the next generation," Mr. Dino said, "but the success rate of ownership transfer from the first to second generation is only 30 percent." Most of those businesses get sold to nonfamily owners, often because of poor estate planning.
The changing-of-the-guard phenomenon has been a major push behind family business programs like UConn's. An estimated 55 programs have been established across the nation in the last five years, Mr. Dino said.
UConn's received money from various sources, including grants, seed money from Henry W. Nozko Sr., founder and head of the Acmat Corporation of New Britain, and $15,000 each from program sponsors including Acmat, Arthur Andersen & Company, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, People's Bank, Reid & Riege and U.S. Trust Company.
Mr. Dino, a former economic and marketing forecaster for Kodak and Xerox, has owned his own business -- a restaurant in Stamford -- and sat on the board of directors of family businesses, said what he has found most amazing is once program members sit down to talk, it doesn't matter that one heads a $5 million company or a $100 million company.
"It's as if," he said, "they speak the same language."

HEADLINE: BOOKEND;
Jane Jacobs: Still a Pioneer

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger; Paul Goldberger is the chief cultural correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
There is something strangely pleasing about the fact that Jane Jacobs, who has spent her life writing books about cities and the virtues of urban disorder, has now, at 80, written one about a single woman who lived a life of extreme order in that most rural of places, Alaska. This book -- "A Schoolteacher in Old Alaska" -- is much more important than its self-consciously quaint title lets on. It is nothing like any of Jane Jacobs's other books, and in fact was written only partly by her; the body of it is the memoir of her great-aunt, Hannah Breece, who spent 14 years at the beginning of this century teaching children of Alaska natives. Breece died in 1940, leaving her great-niece a manuscript she hoped would be put into publishable form.
The pleasure in this book comes not from any sense that Ms. Jacobs has reversed course; quite the contrary. She has not elevated Fort Yukon over Greenwich Village, and neither has she put aside her profound belief in the value of serendipity. What she has done is make the point that a sense of independence and of control over one's life is essential to satisfaction and productivity. This is hardly inconsistent with what Jane Jacobs has been telling us for more than 30 years; it is just that until now she has been fairly constant in wanting us to believe that the wide range of choice the city offers makes it a more likely source of fulfillment and independence than the country. The truth is that these are virtues that transcend geography, and can occur in all kinds of places and all kinds of situations; perhaps the most important aspect of her new book is that it contains Jane Jacobs's implicit recognition that this is so. 
 Jane Jacobs let her great-aunt's manuscript languish while she pursued her own career, which included the writing of five books -- among them "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," her powerful testament against modernist urban renewal and in favor of the casual, pedestrian and street-oriented life of traditional densely built cities. One of those rare books that have changed the world, it was to urban planning what Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" was to the environmental movement, and it is arguably the most important book written about cities in the 20th century. Now, more than half a century after her great-aunt's death, Jane Jacobs has finally taken up the challenge and brought her memoir to publication. She began in 1994 by retracing her great-aunt's passage through Alaska, and upon her return to her home in Toronto proceeded to edit and annotate the old manuscript; then she added introductory and closing essays. She presents her great-aunt's story as something of an early work of feminism and cross-cultural inquiry. It all adds up to something that is not nearly as parenthetical to Jane Jacobs's own career as one might at first think.
For if there is any shortcoming to much of Jane Jacobs's thinking -- certainly to her thinking as expressed in "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" -- it is that she has always tended to fall prey to the fallacy of physical determinism, nearly as much as the modernists and urban renewal czars she has so roundly, and deservedly, criticized. They believed that high-rise towers in open space would solve urban and social ills; Jane Jacobs believes that small-scale buildings and lively streetscapes will perform that same miracle. Given the choice, I'll take her view any day, but that's not the point. Her vision is closer to reality, but the physical form of cities doesn't always determine what will happen in them, and sometimes big, ugly high-rise buildings work just fine.
To those whose admiration for Jane Jacobs borders on passion -- and I certainly put myself in that group -- there has always been a certain frustration to the limits of her thinking. She doesn't like to admit that the automobile-oriented suburb works for some people, problematic as we urbanists may find it. She isn't comfortable admitting that Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, a complex of banal red-brick towers built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company after World War II, is successful as a place to live and as a community despite what we might call the political incorrectness of its dreary physical form. Nor does she seem terribly eager to acknowledge that the facile architecture of Lincoln Center, however disconnected it may be from the streetscape, has had a profound, and generally positive, impact on the surrounding city, encouraging the very liveliness and mix of uses that Jane Jacobs has claimed such places suppress. The problem is that the physical form of places like Stuyvesant Town and Lincoln Center is too much at odds with her orthodoxy. And an orthodoxy it is, however much it may be correct most of the time.
What has all of this to do with Hannah Breece, a prohibitionist and devout Christian whose life was firmly grounded in 19th-century pieties? Only that Jane Jacobs's long years of pondering her great-aunt's life seem to have brought her to a kind of implicit concession that factors other than the physical form of a community can affect the well-being -- and, more important, the sense of self-determination -- of its people. This may be an odd reason to cheer this new book, but so be it. I have always wanted Jane Jacobs, iconoclastic, wide-ranging thinker that she is, to see the world in still broader terms, and with this book she truly has. I suspect that Hannah Breece would not have been very comfortable in the urban places that Jane Jacobs -- and I -- like best, and Ms. Jacobs's willingness to see her as hero in spite of this both deepens and softens our view of Ms. Jacobs herself.
For Jane Jacobs, in the end, has always been a defender of individuality, and Hannah Breece was as individual as they come, full of courage and self-assurance when such traits were rarely visible, let alone admired, in women. Maybe it isn't really Jane Jacobs's fault that her passion for individuality has been caricatured over the years into a kind of left-wing, Greenwich Village liberal conformity; if you read her words carefully it is clear that she believes in more than that, even though it is that world that has made her a prophet and has molded itself around her views.
Hannah Breece was an activist. She did not man the barricades of protest, but she took charge of her life and ran it with determination and fortitude. How else could you describe a woman who spent her 40's and 50's (she was 45 when she began her 14-year sojourn) climbing mountains, fording streams and pursuing the mission of "civilizing" native children in the wilderness? Jane Jacobs, determined multiculturalist that she is, admits to problems with her great-aunt's Eurocentric attitudes, but eventually comes to terms with the reality that, much as Thomas Jefferson tolerated slavery, even remarkable people sometimes fail to transcend the limits of their times. And to give Hannah Breece her due, at one point she states that her goal is not "whitizing" her students but "civilizing" them, a distinction more subtle than most of her contemporaries would have made.
How similar, in the end, are Hannah Breece and Jane Jacobs! Both were pioneers: Breece in the wilderness, Jane Jacobs in an urban frontier that she could see in a way that others had not. Both looked at the world as full of surprise and wonder, but did so without innocence; they knew that it required constant negotiation, and the satisfaction they found in it did not come from believing that life could go on autopilot. Both put much stock in the joy that comes from ordinary things, and believed that there can be profundity in the minutiae of daily life, and richness in the mixing of different kinds of people into a complex social fabric.
Hannah Breece dealing with recalcitrant tribal chiefs resistant to a school in their community, Jane Jacobs taking on Robert Moses to fight the Lower Manhattan Expressway and save SoHo and Greenwich Village. Here in her great-aunt's life, then, we see Jane Jacobs's true toughness and, even more, her roots, the beginnings of all she has stood for and all she has helped us value. One is tempted to say that Jane Jacobs probably has known all the while how close her own life has been to that of her great-aunt, and that she is just letting us in now on the things that have inspired her all along.

Aging and Old Age
By Richard A. Posner.
375 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $29.95.
Richard A. Posner is one of the most interesting figures in American social thought. His new work, "Aging and Old Age," follows a recent book on sex, which in turn succeeded treatises on literature and the judiciary. What these writings have in common is a truly remarkable degree of erudition and, beyond that, the single-minded pursuit of an idea -- the application of economic theory to human behavior. He also draws on ideas from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology and classical philosophy, above all Aristotle. One might imagine that someone with so extraordinary a range of knowledge would reside in an empyrean of pure thought. But Mr. Posner has a worldly vocation as well, and a very demanding one. He is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. 
 The legal and political problems posed by the elderly were in fact the stimulus for much of this book. There are extended discussions here of topics like the Social Security system, age discrimination, mandatory retirement, pensions and pension law, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, the punishment of elderly offenders and much else. Yet those are not the only issues Mr. Posner treats, nor the most interesting. He also discusses such matters as the economic power of the aged and whether it is too great or too small; the relations between age and creativity in various domains of art and scholarship; which careers peak early and which peak late, and why; the differing modes of intelligence and their correlation with age; the status of the old in preliterate societies; why the elderly have a high rate of voting yet a low rate of jury service; why they are less likely to be victims of crime; and why they are (or are thought to be) loquacious, stingy and self-absorbed.
A few of these topics are covered in depth, but on the whole Mr. Posner's aim -- clear enough though unspoken -- is to demonstrate the power of the "human capital" approach put forward by Gary S. Becker and other economists. That position is spelled out in the first four chapters and, be warned, they will not be easy going unless you are familiar with both the language and the underlying ideas of economic analysis. Here is a sample sentence: "If because of the age-related increase in the cost of investing in human capital or the age-related decrease in the expected return, or both, the rate of investment in new human capital eventually declines with age below the rate of depreciation of the worker's existing human capital, there will be net depreciation."
That kind of language prevails even when Mr. Posner deals with simpler matters, like the increase of loneliness in old age: "The loss of friends will be increasing rapidly at the same time that the net utility from forming new friendships is declining." Mr. Posner can be an engaging writer when he lets himself be, as in the occasional anecdote about his family history, or in his paragraphs on Yeats's poetry. But such passages do not last long, and we are soon back to discount rates, utility-disutility and disinvestment.
Still, the approach through economics does discourage excessive sentiment. Since death and disease are so frightening to so many of us, we tend not to think too critically about policy in these areas, instead following the most familiar paths or heeding only the most urgent voices. The results are often perverse. One example is the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which Mr. Posner tells us was sold by emotional rhetoric as a means of protecting elderly workers. He argues that it is "at once inefficent, regressive and harmful to the elderly." In a long, dense concluding chapter Mr. Posner shows that the act discourages hiring the elderly because employers fear the greater costs of training them and the legal complications of firing them. It is in the study of such distortions, and their dynamics, that the careful, nearly obsessive, approach of this book shows to special advantage.
There is also a penetrating analysis of sex differences in medical research expenditures on the elderly. Diseases that affect women -- cervical and breast cancer -- currently receive much more research money per death than those affecting men primarily or exclusively -- like heart disease, lung cancer and prostate cancer. Should we shift the balance? Who gains and who loses, and how? Mr. Posner's subtle discussion of this issue is a model of thoroughness and balance.
On the other hand, "rational choice" does not fare so well when it must deal with the irrational or with instinctual drives, and with the displacements and defenses they generate. We see this most clearly in the discussion of suicide. Mr. Posner proposes a utility theory of suicide, wherein "the utility of living, net of disutility due to suffering, bereavement and other losses, declines with age." Hence, "aging reduces the option value of living on."
With his usual consummate honesty Mr. Posner sets forth the many problems in that formulation, but he will not allow himself to consider that depression may play a significant role in suicide, since he believes depression "is difficult to distinguish operationally from rational, clear-eyed evaluation of declining quality and prospects of life." That is simply not so; the irrational component in suicidal depression is evident rather quickly in most cases. (The first suicidal patient I ever saw made a suicide attempt because the microphone did not work when he was introducing a guest speaker in an auditorium, and he assumed that the audience was -- silently -- jeering at him.) There are other problems with this discussion, some of which Mr. Posner points to, confessing puzzlement. Why is the suicide rate so much higher for men than for women? Why does the rate rise only slightly as women age, yet rise steeply for men? And why is the suicide rate for blacks at all ages so much lower than for whites?
These questions and many others like them either go unasked or receive shallow answers. For all his brilliance and erudition elsewhere, Mr. Posner here has imposed unnecessary limits on himself and on his grasp of human behavior.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/One Broadway;
Tenants That Felt They Were in Not-So-Good Hands

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
NEW YORK has long been a place where landlords and tenants seem to haggle over everything and where a lease's fine print can run to dozens of pages. But even in New York, the legacy of ill will left by lease -- and eventually, sale -- negotiations between tenants of One Broadway, that landmarked building opposite Bowling Green Park, and Allstate Insurance, its former owner, seems extreme.
"Allstate really negotiated in bad faith all along," charged Robert T. Tobin, managing partner of the intellectual-property law firm Kenyon & Kenyon, the building's main tenant and now its co-owner. 
 "Allstate has never negotiated in bad faith with anyone," countered Peter Kierig, an Allstate assistant general counsel. "The tenants were difficult on every lease term."
At the root of the mutual anger lies the siren call that so many downtown landlords, Allstate included, are hearing of late: That of residential converters, lured to downtown office buildings by city tax breaks for anyone who turns them into apartments, and offering prices well above those that office buildings usually command.
"We're seeing a healthy competition between residential and commercial use, and it is a pleasant surprise," said Carl Weisbrod, head of the Alliance for Downtown Manhattan, who expects more than 1,000 apartments to come on stream this year.
But that same competition poses a dilemma for many would-be sellers of downtown buildings. If they want to sell them as office buildings, they will get a much better price if the buildings are leased up. But for residential use, the emptier the better, since few converters want to deal with buying out -- or waiting out -- existing office tenants.
A landlord who wants to keep both options open must almost by force put lease negotiations in limbo, while tenants wrestle with the specter of corporate homelessness.
That was the bind that everyone at One Broadway got caught in.
Back in 1992, when Allstate took the building back from financially strapped owners, the best strategy seemed clear: Get the 100-year-old building, which badly needed a structural overhaul, into physical shape, get its tenants to renew, and sell it.
"Our plan was to sell this as a commercial structure," Mr. Kierig said. "And since we knew a building was more attractive if its leases were already renewed, we instituted the negotiations with the tenants."
Kenyon & Kenyon and the investment counseling firm Brundage, Story & Rose, which together make up about 70 percent of the 12-story building's tenancy, were clearly the important players. Both firms' leases were expiring in a few years, and both wanted to stay.
"We just love the building, we use it on our Christmas cards, we stamp it on our Christmas chocolate bars," Mr. Tobin said.
But both tenants wanted lease provisos keyed to protect them if the building did change hands. For example, they insisted on so-called self-help clauses, which allow a tenant to handle necessary repairs and deduct the costs from the rent bill.
The tenants felt that such extra protection was only fair in light of unknown ownership. Allstate thought it was onerous, and that a new owner might balk at such clauses.
"Institutional landlords with solid credit rarely agree to such clauses, particularly if they want to sell the building," said Howard Nottingham, a senior vice president of LaSalle Partners, which Allstate hired to manage and lease One Broadway.
The negotiations got cantankerous more than once. And they dragged on and on.
Each side blames the other for the stalls. James G. Pepper, a Brundage, Story partner, and Mr. Tobin of Kenyon insist that Allstate sat on the leases; Mr. Nottingham says that often, Allstate would redraft a lease and not hear from the tenants for months. Another person familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says that both tenants tried to take unfair advantage of Allstate's desire to get leases signed in advance of any sale.
"They tried to beat Allstate up on everything, from the economics down to the most inconsequential clause," he said. "Allstate hung in longer than I thought it would."
Ironically, it was a clause in one of the original leases that wound up breaking the impasse: Kenyon had the legal right to match any outside offer to buy the building.
K ENYON would not have been the first downtown tenant to exercise such an option. In 1994, for example, McGraw-Hill invoked a similar clause and bought 65 Broadway, the home of the municipal bond brokerage firm J. J. Kenney, a McGraw-Hill subsidiary. According to Darcy A. Stacom, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director, McGraw-Hill paid about $13.5 million for a building that is worth closer to $16 million today.
But McGraw-Hill knew what outsiders were offering to pay. Allstate and Kenyon got caught in a Catch-22 situation: Allstate, which was not yet thinking about residential conversion, did not want to market the building until the leases were signed; Kenyon did not want to make an offer until it knew how the market valued the building.
The lease negotiations continued. And despite the slow pace, by last fall all parties figured they were in the home stretch.
"By November we had negotiated all the points," said Mr. Tobin, who says he gave in on clauses that would help Allstate sell the building. For example, he says he agreed to show Kenyon's books to potential buyers concerned with the main tenant's credit.
But then Woody Heller, a Jones Lang Wootton broker whom Allstate had retained to help sell the building, threw a wrench into the procedures.
"I suggested that, because of tremendous enthusiasm for residential development, it might make more sense to market the building empty," Mr. Heller said.
One Broadway is a perfect candidate for conversion to apartments. It has harbor and park views, and its floors are small enough so that the apartments would not have too many interior, windowless spaces. It was once the headquarters of United States Lines, and is still saturated with nautical niceties. There's a wave motif in the first-floor frieze and an entranceway that still has First Class Passengers carved above. A huge Citibank branch at ground level, once a ticket-booking hall, sports murals on maritime history.
So Allstate's lawyers, on the brink of signing the leases, put their pens back down. They asked Mr. Pepper to give them another 90 days while they talked to residential converters. Allstate thought it was a reasonable request; Mr. Pepper was furious, and decided to move, no matter what Allstate decided to do with the building.
"I said I don't care what happens, I will not deal with Allstate ever again," he said. "They have the intellectual capacity and responsiveness of a tar baby."
Mr. Tobin was furious, too. He says he had to learn of Allstate's new plans from Mr. Pepper. "We really felt we'd been had," he said. In January, Kenyon sued Allstate to force it to sign the new lease.
Kenyon hired Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson to handle the suit. Soon after, John L. Mechanic, a Fried, Frank real estate partner, introduced Mr. Tobin to Steven C. Witkoff, a principal at the real estate firm Stellar Management. The two men hatched a plan: Kenyon would exercise its option to buy the building and put up some equity; Stellar would put up most of the equity, and would manage the building.
"People have disproportionately written off the downtown office market," Mr. Witkoff said. "They forget you get substantial tax benefits and energy rate cuts for leasing office properties, too."
The East New York Savings Bank quickly agreed to finance the purchase. "You had a major tenant marrying up with guys who had the management skills and financial wherewithal, and that pretty much mitigated the risks," said Sam Giarrusso, the bank's administrative vice president. And, should the bank ever have to take the building back, "there are plenty of residential converters who would pay good money for it," Mr. Giarrusso said.
I N March Kenyon and Stellar bought One Broadway for $9 million. They immediately renewed Brundage, Story, at the terms Mr. Pepper had negotiated with Allstate. The building's other major tenant, the law firm Fox & Horan, has several years left on its lease. Only the second floor is empty, and Kenyon may take that space itself.
Many lawyers and sales brokers say they expect more such stories to surface soon. "The craze right now is certainly for residential conversion, but there are still plenty of people looking for buildings to keep as offices," Ms. Stacom said.
"It's a sensible partnership, a tenant that wants some equity and control over its space, and an investor that knows how to operate a building," said Mr. Mechanic, who says he has been asked by another law firm to explore whether it should go that route.
Over at One Broadway, scar tissue has formed on the wounds from the difficult negotiations. Kenyon has dropped its suit against Allstate, and all of the tenants are on long-term leases.
"We're happy, and I assume Kenyon's happy," Mr. Pepper said. "I don't give a damn whether Allstate is happy or not."

HEADLINE: The View From: Bridgeport;
Downtown Bridgeport, Minus Casino, Builds Hopes on the Arts

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
LIKE a long-forgotten Rembrandt discovered in the attic that restores a family's fortunes, a remarkable, but little-seen, art collection is holding out hope for Bridgeport's downtown.
The collection is owned by Housatonic Community-Technical College, which is relocating to the site of a former downtown shopping mall. Known as the Housatonic Museum of Art, its extensive holdings include paintings and sculpture by Picasso, Matisse, Miro, Mary Cassatt -- even Andy Warhol. 
 "It is the largest and best collection of any two-year college in America," boasted Burt Chernow, its director emeritus, who might be said to know because it was he who assembled it, through donations from wealthy patrons and many of the artists themselves over the last 29 years.
Some pieces are displayed in offices and on hallway walls in the college, presently occupying a former sewing machine factory on Bridgeport's East Side. But the majority of its more than 4,200 works are in storage for lack of a place to show them.
Under current plans, that would be solved by converting McLevy Hall, a stately brownstone where Abraham Lincoln made a campaign speech in 1860, into a museum with ample display space. There, the Housatonic collection would become the center of the city's promotion of arts, entertainment and tourism as one of Bridgeport's main development goals for the 21st century.
Constructed in 1853, McLevy Hall originally was the county courthouse and Bridgeport's city hall. It was remodeled solely as city hall in 1903, reverted to use as a courthouse in 1960, and currently holds municipal offices and the Bureau of Vital Statistics.
If all goes well, the museum will be joined by the Polka Dot Playhouse, a theater company marooned on Pleasure Beach Island by a brokendown bridge, and many new shops and attractions at the nearby harbor waterfront.
Also within a one-block walk is the future home of the college as well as the Barnum Museum. The Downtown Cabaret Theater is just a few blocks away, as are the Beardsley Zoo and the Discovery Museum, adding to what planners hope is the basis for a busy tourism industry.
The idea of expanding arts and entertainment actually originated in 1993, but was drowned out by the quest for a casino and Donald Trump's proposals for an amusement park and a motor racetrack, among other noisy ballyhoo.
It represents a change in direction for the city's economic development plans for the downtown business district. That had been for a combination of retail and housing, but was abandoned when the 1990 recession hit. "That idea was to make the downtown a neighborhood," said Michael Freimuth, Bridgeport's economic development director. The new plan is designed to give people a reason to visit and make the downtown business people feel good about the place.
City officials are enthusiastic about their prospects for tying a number of relatively small projects together, each multiplying the tourism effect. They expressed dismay at the prevailing attitude that the city's future was dimmed when the casino proposal was defeated.
"People were saying there's nothing else happening in Bridgeport," Mr. Freimuth said. "The casino was a double-edged sword for us."
Mr. Freimuth said a casino would have helped by attracting development funding. Now the plan rests on the availability of state grants: $3.9 million for the McLevy Hall art museum and $2.7 million for the Polka Dot Playhouse. According to Drew Hingson, chairman of the Downtown Special Services District, "Everything works together." People who go to a show are likely to eat at a restaurant next door and take in the exhibit at the museum across the street.
Housing the Housatonic Art Museum collection in McLevy Hall, he said, would move the arts and entertainment potential of Bridgeport's downtown very close to "critical mass," and perhaps beyond it.
It all makes more than enough sense to Mr. Chernow, whose knack for accumulating masterpieces is diminished by the lack of a place to hang them. "We hope to get McLevy Hall because we have more artworks than we have walls," he said.
He began the Housatonic collection in 1967 soon after he joined the art faculty at the school. A resident of Westport, he and his wife, Anne, a painter of note, were acquainted with many artists and wealthy art patrons who responded to his requests with priceless gifts from their private collections. Within a year, the collection had enough pieces for two exhibits at the Discovery Museum (then named the Museum of Art, Science and Industry).
The collection spans a wide range of art, from ancient Greek and Egyptian pottery, Chinese marble carvings and African masks to Ansel Adams photographs and works by many important contemporary artists.
The new home for Housatonic Community-Technical College will include gallery space and a sculpture garden, but thousands of works would still have to be packed away. For those, McLevy Hall is needed.
Mr. Chernow also hopes for a permanent, full-time staff for the Housatonic Museum of Art, which now has only three part-time people. "There are museums that have a lot of staff and no art," he said. "We have a lot of art and almost no staff. Usually, a museum of this size would have 10 full-time staff members."
The city proposes to move the Polka Dot Playhouse into the old Bridgeport Trust Company building across the street from the McLevy Hall green. The green itself is now being refurbished with the help of private donations.
That block of State Street also is the home of Silver Lining, a nonprofit art gallery, and the Regional Center for the Arts, a magnet high school program that provides classes in dance, theater and jazz for 60 high school students from Bridgeport and five neighboring suburban towns. All three stand to gain from an influx of neighbors. The Playhouse and the Regional Center are already working together on theater programs for students, and Silver Lining is planning an exhibition of art by Bridgeport high school students.
Their biggest problem now is that no one stays in downtown Bridgeport after work, or thinks of visiting there during leisure hours.
"It makes a wonderful, viable cultural center for that area downtown for people who work there and want to come back there after work," Rose Lodice, president of the Polka Dot Playhouse, noted.
Larry Halpern, managing director of Silver Lining, said people who call his gallery are interested in two things: "Where to park and what else is there to do." He said a museum across the street and the Polka Dot Playhouse next door would answer the second question.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Addicted to the Hard Life

BYLINE: By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE; Benedict Nightingale is chief theater critic of The Times of London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
ANYONE WHO HATES Sir Peter Hall should invite him to spend two weeks beside some idyllic swimming pool, doing nothing but sunbathe and sip champagne. Such a regimen, he says with a shudder, would make him miserable.
Conversely, anyone who wishes the 65-year-old director well should insure that he follows a program that would shatter a man half his age. What about bringing a Feydeau farce to the West End, staging Beethoven's "Fidelio" in Rome, organizing a major radio revival of Shaw's "Man and Superman," putting the finishing touches on a two-part television drama about West Indians in Britain, and transferring his production of Oscar Wilde's "Ideal Husband" to New York -- and all in the space of a few weeks? 
 That has been the first third of 1996 as Sir Peter wanted it, planned it and has come very near to achieving. His production of "Fidelio," scheduled to open on April 16, was suddenly aborted after the opera house technicians in Rome refused to handle its British-built set. But that setback only meant that Sir Peter scheduled extra rehearsals of Feydeau's "Mind Millie for Me," which was on an out-of-town tour before starting previews at the Haymarket Theater four days ago. There, it replaced "An Ideal Husband," which opens on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Wednesday.
A doctor once told Sir Peter that his body manufactured so much adrenalin that he had become addicted to it. But that's only half the reason he loathes the idea of taking life easy: "I don't work because someone or something is making me, or because of economic compulsion, but because I love it. I need to rehearse every day. No one says to a painter, why don't you stop painting? There might come a time when I want to slow down, but it hasn't happened in the 43 years I've been directing."
Some people assumed Sir Peter would lessen his workload when he gave up the most taxing job in the British theater, director of the Royal National Theater, back in 1988. Instead, he formed the Peter Hall Company, a commercial organization that started life in high style by dispatching Vanessa Redgrave in Tennessee Williams's "Orpheus Descending" and Dustin Hoffman in Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice" from London to New York.
Though "An Ideal Husband" is the first of his productions since then to have made the crossing, plenty of others have kept his name before the British public. At one point, in 1993, five plays directed by him -- four for the Peter Hall Company, one for the Royal Shakespeare Company -- were running simultaneously in London.
Is there a danger, then, of substituting quantity for quality? "That's for other people to answer," he said. "I do think, though, that people accuse me of spreading myself too thin because they get furious at my appetite and energy. It's somehow un-British, isn't it, to try too hard. I don't say I'm Picasso, because I'm not. But nobody said to Picasso, You're painting too much and you're 80, so why don't you stop? And if an actor keeps on acting, nobody accuses him of spreading himself too thin."
Certainly, Sir Peter has the respect of his senior fellow professionals. Richard Eyre, who succeeded him as director of the National Theater, left "An Ideal Husband" thinking it a better play than Wilde's more famous "Importance of Being Earnest." "He made me feel I'd underestimated it," Mr. Eyre said. "And that's typical of his work, which is true to the text, unostentatious, uncluttered, lucid, quite muscular and wonderfully accessible."
Adrian Noble, director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, thought "An Ideal Husband" demonstrated Sir Peter's skill at choosing the right cast and giving it creative freedom. "He takes on more work than anyone should," Mr. Noble said, "yet gets such good performances out of his actors. He cares passionately about the future too -- developing talent and handing on the baton to new directors."
And certainly Sir Peter's recent productions have been well received by the public. A revival of "Hamlet," with the little-known Stephen Dillane as a quirky, unglamorous prince, defied conventional wisdom by succeeding on commercial Shaftesbury Avenue, and "An Ideal Husband" has been playing to an average of 90 percent capacity on what is actually its return visit to the West End.
SIR PETER'S PRODUCtion, first seen in 1992, was restaged in London only because a special deal was negotiated with the actors' unions allowing a Broadway transfer. British Equity agreed to let Sir Peter bring Jessica Lange and a mainly American cast to the West End in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire" next fall, so American Equity allowed Martin Shaw, Penny Downie and most of the other Britons in Wilde's play to go to New York.
If Sir Peter has not lost his appetite for work since leaving the National, he has not lost his enthusiasm for controversy either. He is still recognizably the man who leaped on a coffee table at a press conference in 1985 to denounce the Government's financial cuts to the theater, famously provoking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to ask her arts minister, "When can we stop giving money to awful people like Peter Hall?" Few directors would dare denounce the restrictive practices of both branches of Equity so ferociously.
When Sir Peter formed his new company in 1988, he hoped that almost all of its productions would play on both sides of the Atlantic. And almost every one, he said, has attracted interest from America. But the reason so few have transferred is not only the hesitancy of Broadway producers to restage financially risky work like Aristophanes' "Lysistrata" or the Dillane "Hamlet." It is also because neither Equity permits foreigners to perform in its own country unless they adhere to strict conditions. Usually that means they must be international stars, or arrive with a permanent ensemble, which the Comedie-Francaise is but the Peter Hall Company is not, or they must be part of a swap: "Ideal Husband" for "Streetcar."
Three years ago, Sir Peter refused to take Peter Shaffer's play "Gift of the Gorgon" to New York because American Equity rejected its leading man, Michael Pennington. Last year, London and Toronto saw his revival of Ibsen's "Master Builder" but Broadway missed out. The union accepted Alan Bates as Solness, but not Victoria Hamilton as Hilde, even though she received some of the most stunning reviews that can ever have come a newcomer's way. More recently, British Equity refused to allow Sir Peter to introduce London theatergoers to a young Trinidadian actor he calls "a bit of a genius," Michael Cherry, who stars in "The Final Passage," his two-part film about the influx of West Indians into Britain.
"Both Equities need their heads banging together, because both of them are ignorant protection societies," rages Sir Peter. "I think they're a disgrace to the profession on both sides of the Atlantic. A union ought to be about the nurturing of talent, especially young talent. It should be about an interchange that's productive and creative. But a closed shop is defensive and deadening, and I've never met an actor in either country who doesn't bemoan it. It is simply dreadful, and it makes me terribly angry."
Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors' Equity in New York, responded to Sir Peter's criticisms last week, describing them as "petulant and ill thought out." The director, he said "is living in a dream world" if he believes that American performers would oppose policies preventing an influx of British actors. Such regulations, he said, help to insure that American actors are not denied the opportunity to develop their talents. Though he noted that unemployment among his union's membership is sometimes as high as 90 percent, he said that Equity has become more liberal. Since 1981, it has agreed to a total of 94 exchanges of individual actors between America and Britain, Mr. Eisenberg said.
"An Ideal Husband" will, in any case, give New Yorkers the chance to see why the British critics were so enthusiastic about a play often dismissed as a Victorian melodrama peppered with Wildean jokes. The reason Sir Peter wanted to direct it and even tried several times to mount a production when he was running the National, was that he believed it a deeper, more humane piece than is usually supposed. "Though it's 100 years old, it couldn't be more violently contemporary, both politically and sexually," he said.
IN SIR PETER'S VIEW, THE story of Sir Robert Chiltern, the statesman blackmailed for a financial indiscretion he committed years ago, has obvious resonances for both Britain and America. But the most prominent character in his production is Lord Goring, the Wildean wit and dandy who gives kindly but shrewd advice to both the politician and the politician's judgmental wife. As played by Martin Shaw, Goring is, said Sir Peter, "an extremely tolerant man who really understands himself and other people." He is also an unacknowledged bisexual, likely to prove "a jolly good husband to his wife and a very good father to his children," Sir Peter said.
In other words, he has much in common with Wilde himself. "Yes," the director continued: "The play is obviously autobiographical. It was written when Wilde was being blackmailed by rentboys, and six months after it opened he was in Reading Gaol. It's a play about bisexuality written at a time when you couldn't admit in the theater that homosexuality existed. Even in the 1960's, the feeling was you had to be one thing or the other. Now we are beginning to admit that bisexuality may actually be the norm."
Fop Sir Peter, the jokes are not decorative but a "comic version of the British stiff upper lip, an attempt to keep control at times of great tension and difficulty." Indeed, it's the play's combination of humor and emotional seriousness to which he attributes its success in a London that seems to get more like New York every day: "The political scandal makes audiences laugh, but there is also an enormous tenderness and tolerance in the play that I think we yearn for now. We live in a society that is so competitive and selfish that audiences really respond to ideas of understanding and forgiveness."
What next? There were newspaper reports two months ago that Sir Peter had suffered a serious heart attack. In fact, he fainted after giving a two-hour lecture to the company he formed 36 years ago, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and then driving through heavy traffic to a theater 10 miles south of London. Tests in the cardiac ward of a local hospital revealed he was suffering from tension. The Grim Reaper -- a figure Sir Peter has admitted he fearfully ponders every day -- was not about to pounce. "I feel very well, very energetic," he said. "And my appetite for life is as strong as ever."
Extracurricular life th'se days revolves round Nicki, his fourth wife, and Emma, their 3-year-old daughter and his sixth child. In the autobiography he published in 1993, Sir Peter spoke of bouts of near-suicidal depression that had hit him when he was working too hard or, sometimes, not working hard enough. But the marriage he made in 1990 is, he declares, keeping them at bay.
That doesn't mean any let-up in a regimen that will, he vows, continue until he does indeed drop dead. After completing "Man and Superman" for BBC radio and transferring the "Julius Caesar" he directed last year from Stratford to London, he stages Sophocles' "Oedipus" plays at the National and in Greece, directs Moliere's "School for Wives" and Williams's "Streetcar" for his own company, and starts readying himself to do a six-hour television film based on Barrie Unsworth's slave-trade novel, "The Sacred Hunger."
He would also like to form an ensemble of about 12 actors, take over a West End theater and offer programs of three plays in repertory. It is more a hope than a firm plan, but, with Sir Peter, hopes have a way of happening. "I've always filled my days up as full as possible," he said. "But I'd also like to do one more big thing before I hang up my clogs."

HEADLINE: Habitats/46 West 83d Street;
Lawyers' Apartments of the 1st Part and the 2d Part

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
AT the nadir of the real-estate recession of the early 1990's, Barbara Peabody couldn't sell her one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side.
"No more than five people looked at the place," said Ms. Peabody, a lawyer who works in the New York City Corporation Counsel's office. 
 She had bought apartment 8A at 46 West 83d Street 22 years ago, as the building was going co-op; she married, gave birth to one child, then another. "There were Fisher-Price toys everywhere," she said with a laugh.
Like many other parents struggling at the time to sell their too-small apartments, Ms. Peabody and her husband, Michael Cusick, a corporate lawyer with a downtown firm, knew something had to give. So they looked sideways, to the adjacent apartment.
An elderly woman was living next door in 8B, a rent-controlled tenant who had not bought her one-bedroom apartment. Someone told Ms. Peabody that the building's sponsor had contacted the tenant, then in her 80's, and re-offered the apartment -- which the woman supposedly had again declined.
Ms. Peabody leapt at the chance. She called the sponsor and bid $60,000 -- $5,000 above the old insider's price. The sponsor refused. She offered $80,000; he accepted.
The deal was set and then completed. But when the excitement of the closing -- and the dozens of sketches of how the two apartments would look combined -- had passed, the family was left with the central problem: They had bought an occupied apartment.
"Now comes the macabre part," Ms. Peabody said. "We tried not to think of it -- because we really liked her. But we couldn't help thinking of it: How long would she live?"
Ms. Peabody prides herself on being a careful person, and she had done spread sheets on the financial aspects of the deal.
Financially, it made great sense to her. Because of an anomaly when the building became a co-op, her original one-bedroom -- for which she had paid $87,000 -- had a $1,100 monthly maintenance, possibly one reason it had not found a buyer when she tried to sell it.
The one-bedroom next door, virtually the same 1,100 square feet but without some of Ms. Peabody's lovely views of Central Park, had a $700 monthly maintenance. From that standpoint alone, combining the apartments was a way to even up the situation.
But there were also more calculations: The tenant was paying $506 a month in rent -- less than the maintenance the new owners would have to pay.
The couple rented out their old apartment for about $2,300 a month and moved to a rental apartment at 79th and Broadway, a fine apartment with a maid's room and a dining room. The rent on the family's 79th Street apartment started at $2,400 a month. By the time they left -- four and a half years later -- the rent was up to $2,800.
In March 1994, while they were in the rental apartment, their elderly tenant died.
At that point, Ms. Peabody asked the board for permission to sublet the second apartment indefinitely, while she lived in the rental on 79th Street and made renovation plans to link the two apartments on 83d Street. The board balked, but agreed to let her sublet both apartments for a year and a half more.
By subletting the second apartment for $2,000 a month, Ms. Peabody said, she took in "about $20,000" -- money she is using to do the long-planned renovation, which is finally taking place. (Her expenses, including a mortgage on the second co-op apartment, totaled $2,367 a month; her income from the two rents was more than $4,300.)
T O find an architect, Ms. Peabody simply asked around. She heard about Tom Vail from the mother of one of her children's schoolmates. She was impressed, she said, because Mr. Vail returned her call within minutes.
They went over her plans. Because of the board's generosity on subletting, she was able to get her plans approved by the necessary city agencies, and by the building's board, more than a year before she actually decided to start work.
Her tenants moved out Dec. 1. The work started in January. Mr. Vail, she said, recommended excellent contractors.
"You know the nightmare," she said. "I do contract litigation."
In her own case, the first estimate -- for 8A -- may have arrived vaguely worded, but she instructed the contractors what she wanted to see on their bid.
"I don't want to see just 'electrical' and a price; I want to see exactly what's going in," she explained. "I don't want to see 'bathroom work'; I want to see 'three new walls for bathtub enclosure.' "
The architect and his client worked on drawings, figured out in their own minds what the job should cost and went back to the contractors and asked: Can you do 8A's renovation for $40,000?
They could.
Right now, the renovation is very much in progress. Ms. Peabody's old kitchen is being enlarged; the ceiling is open and the electricians are trying to figure out what fixtures will go there.
"Well, I want to have some lights here," Ms. Peabody, a handsome woman with streaky gray hair pulled back in a ponytail, said offhandedly. "We're going to put a table there now, so maybe a hanging fixture, but then we eventually want to build some cabinets across the back, so maybe some track lights?"
The electrician, who appeared to have a good sense of humor, agreed to put in a ceiling box for now -- and the exact fixture could be contemplated later.
The long hall leading from the entrance of 8A into the rest of the new apartment had cracked plaster, and has been laminated with sheetrock, bringing the surface out 5/8 of an inch. The 4- by 8-foot sheets of the drywall don't go all the way up to the 9 1/2-foot ceiling, so the carpenters have applied a picture-frame molding along the top edge of the drywall, creating a small ledge -- which Ms. Peabody is trying to decide if she likes.
(To cut pieces of drywall and laminate it into the space between the new drywall and the ceiling would add considerably to the budget.)
T HERE are still more decisions: Should there be a French door from the long hallway -- which broadens into a central foyer -- into the dining room? Should the bookcases at the end of the living room be retained the way Ms. Peabody designed them years ago, or changed? What color should the walls be?
But these decisions are minor, and Ms. Peabody is one of the first to describe herself as "fairly ecstatic" with her deal.
"The agents say I've got one of the biggest bedrooms on the Upper West Side," she proclaimed. "My kids -- Isabel, 6, and Theo, 9 -- use it to play soccer; they use it as a gymnasium." Her bedroom, created by combining the living room and bedroom from the tenant's apartment, measures about 17 by 24 feet and has a beautifully tiled new master bath off on one side, where the former kitchen used to be.
With the architect's fee, the costs for renovating both apartments came to $75,000. Added to the combined $167,000, the total comes to $242,000 for an elephantine three-bedroom apartment with three-and-a-half bathrooms and a formal dining room -- hundreds of thousands of dollars less than such an apartment would ordinarily cost.
"I knew it was weird," she said, standing in the midst of the renovation, "but the way I worked it out, I really thought it was absolutely foolproof."
What if the elderly tenant had brought in a daughter or granddaughter, who inherited the rent-controlled apartment?
"Yes," Ms. Peabody said. "That was the scary part."

HEADLINE: Medically Uninsured Increasing On Island

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
AN increase in Long Islanders without health insurance is generating concern that many people are not receiving adequate medical care.
The number of uninsured people in Nassau and Suffolk Counties has steadily climbed since 1990, according to the State Health Department. In 1990 Long Island had 207,000 people, or 7.5 percent of the population, without health coverage. Last year the total was 314,000, or 10.8 percent of Long Island. 
 The rise reflects a statewide trend, a spokeswoman for the department, Frances Tarlton, said. The uninsured statewide rose, from 22 million, or 12.3 percent in 1990, to 29 million, or 16 percent, in 1995.
The growing number on Long Island is mostly made up of people who have lost their jobs or workers in small companies that have halted insurance programs, experts said.
The chief economist for the Long Island Association, Dr. Pearl Kamer said the economy and the insurance problems were directly related. Many discharged employees have lost their insurance, and people who have gone into business for themselves or who have joined small companies are finding themselves in critical situations, without insurance and unable to afford the high premiums, she said.
"On Long Island," Dr. Kamer added, "we are fundamentally a small-business economy. Today many employers of small businesses are looking to outsource some of their work or to hire part-time employees, so they can avoid the expense of health-insurance coverage.
"This is creating a contingent work force that is much less secure than the work force of a decade ago, when more people had permanent jobs with a full range of benefits. The issue of providing health-insurance coverage is actually stunting the economic recovery on Long Island."
Last week the United States Senate passed legislation to make health insurance coverage portable from job to job. The bill faces difficulty in the House of Representatives, which passed a different version last month, but election-year concerns are reported to be giving the measure some momentum.
The core of the bill is a provision that would require insurers to cover workers under a new employer's plan if their last job carried insurance. But it would sharply limit any exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions. People who leave their jobs are among those who might not be able to pick up new insurance right away.
Health insurance for a person costs an average of $150 to $200 a month, according to Douglas Jacobs, a broker at Bender Insurance in Massapequa. For a family of four, Mr. Jacobs said, the monthly premium might run from $400 if the family is in a managed-care plan to $650 for a full-service program, with a choice of doctors outside a network.
Many insurers no longer sell policies for individuals, and those that do often impose high deductibles, he said, adding, "Times are tough, and people are doing a lot of drastic things they never thought of before to keep their family budgets going."
In terms of medical care, many uninsured people are not going to doctors' offices for primary or preventive care like checkups and immunizations, Ms. Tarlton said. One result, she added, is that too many people find themselves going to hospitals in the midst of medical crises.
"This is a forgotten population," the Suffolk Health Services Commissioner, Dr. Mary Hibberd, said. "People tend to think that there are only two groups, those who have insurance and those on Medicaid. Too often this huge population in between -- of the working poor -- is forgotten about in state plans, and nobody is taking care of them."
Suffolk County operates eight neighborhood health centers, and they have a total of 250,000 visits a year. The fastest growing group at the health centers is the uninsured, according to Dr. Hibberd. Uninsured patients have increased since 1992 by 15,000 visits a year, and that group makes up 35 percent of those at the centers.
The county has expanded clinic hours to evenings and weekends, Dr. Hibberd said, and those extra hours have filled up quickly with people who work during the day and have no access to other health care.
People without insurance are receiving less frequent care for themselves and their children, she said. Fees for a visit to a pediatrician usually range from $50 to $150, and the uninsured cannot afford that, especially with several children.
"What concerns us is that there are medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension and asthma that should be treated early," Dr. Hibberd said. "If people don't get early treatments they'll get sicker and need more expensive care later. Unfortunately this is a growing problem."
The centers have sliding fees that range from free to $200 a visit, based on the services rendered and patients' earnings.
Nassau runs nine centers, including one at a school and a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. Their fees range from $10 to $180.
Immunizations and services for tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases are free.
Nassau Health Commissioner Kathleen A. Gaffney said that most patients at the centers had always been uninsured, but that the number was growing.
With major employment dislocations, the the centers feel the effects tangibly, Dr. Gaffney said. When Grumman dismissed hundreds of employees, the center in Plainview had a surge of new patients who were former Grumman workers and who had lost their insurance.
Concern is also growing for postcollege young adults, she said. After college, young adults are usually not covered by parents' policies, and if they are not in jobs with health insurance, typically do not seek health care, Dr. Gaffney said.
The lack of insurance is also a significant problem for women who cannot afford mammographies, the Commissioner said. The county has started offering free mammographies at the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow and other centers. Last year more than half the women who were given mammogrophies had no insurance, she said.
A major state program, the New York Prospective Hospital Payment Mechanism, expires on June 30. Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed the Health Care Reform Act, which would include changing health insurance, said Ms. Tarlton.
One proposal is to continue surcharges that insurers pay for hospital care, but providing some of those funds earlier, instead of reimbursing the hospitals after they have rendered the services. The state would raise $1.37 billion from the surcharges, of which $702 million would help pay hospitals for charity care and offset the costs of treating the uninsured.
By law, hospitals have to provide emergency care for all patients, whether or not they can pay.
An additional $174 million would be allocated for subsidized health insurance, including expansion of the Child Health Plus Program, which covers children of workers without health insurance. The program now covers 100,000 children up to the age of 14.
Mr. Pataki calls for adding another 100,000 participants over three years, increasing the eligibility to 18 and expanding coverage to include in-patient hospital care.
In addition, the Governor has designated $14 million to a new program, the Small Business Insurance Partnership, an incentive to encourage small businesses with fewer than 50 employees to provide insurance.
Under that program, the state would pay 45 percent of the premium, the employer would pay 45 percent, and the employee would pay the remaining 10 percent.
The reforms would not cover all of the uninsured, but would be a first step, Ms. Tarlton said.
The chairman of the State Senate Health Committee, Kemp Hannon, Republican of Westbury, said the Legislature was digesting the proposals. "As more people are being left out of the system," Mr. Hannon said, "we are seeing more irregular health care that too often ends up with acute situations that must be treated in emergency rooms. There is a critical need to address this problem. Individually, you need insurance to have good health care, and the system needs more people to be insured to have good health care and to be an effective system."

HEADLINE: HOME REPAIR;
With Plastic Laminates, Start Simply Because There's No Turning Back

BYLINE: By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI

 BODY:
PLASTIC laminate is the tough surfacing material widely used as a cover for kitchen countertops. Laminates are made of thin sheets of kraft paper impregnated with phenolic resin. A plastic veneer, melanin, is added to the resin-paper sandwich, followed by a layer of colored or patterned plastic, then topped with another layer of melanin. The multilayered sandwich is fused under heat and pressure. The result is a thin, heat-resistant veneer that makes a durable and decorative work surface. Two copyrighted trade names for this product are Formica and Micarta.
Plastic laminate is available in 4-by-8-foot sheets. (Some home centers may also stock 30- , 36- and 60-inch widths and 6- , 10- and 12-foot lengths.) It costs about $1.50 to $2.50 a square foot. The laminate is available in two thicknesses: 1/16 inch and 1/32inch. The 1/16-inch thickness is a general-purpose laminate. The thinner, 1/32-inch sheets are called vertical-grade laminate and are designed for use as facing for backsplashes, drawer fronts, doors and cabinets. Vertical-grade laminates are too thin for countertops. 
 Laminates are manufactured in a wide assortment of colors (more than 250) and patterns. They also come in a variety of surface textures like matte, glossy, embossed and grained. It's wise, however, to avoid using glossy or textured laminates on countertops because they do not wear well and will lose their brilliance in a few years.
With most laminates, the color is impregnated in the top layer only, so the edge is a dark band. The dark edge may not be noticeable if the surface color is also dark, but it can be incongruous with a light surface. The solution is to use a color-through laminate that has all the layers imprinted with the color. Color-through laminate is more expensive than ordinary plastic; it runs from $3 to $5 a square foot.
Laminate is too thin to be used alone, and it must be bonded to a substrate, or support piece, like a 3/4-inch plywood or particle board. Particle board is economical and suitable as a substrate for a desk or workbench, but it is not water-resistant. For a countertop that will support a sink, moisture-resistant or exterior grade plywood is a better choice as a substrate.
The laminate is bonded to the substrate with contact cement. The cement is brushed onto the top of the substrate and the underside of the laminate, then allowed to dry. Aligning the laminate can be tricky because the cement bonds the two coated pieces together the instant they touch. You cannot move the laminate once the bond is made.
The best method of bonding the laminate is to place two sheets of paper on the cement-coated surface of the substrate. Place the laminate on the paper, and align it with the top. Then slide the paper out. Even with this "slip-sheet" method, alignment can be less than perfect. That's why it's best to cut the laminate a little larger than the top -- allowing about a 1/2-inch overhang on all sides --and trim it to size after it's bonded.
If you've never worked with laminate, it may be well to experiment with it. Start with a simple project, like a card table or a laundry table, to perfect your skills. If you don't have a table, you can make one by attaching four legs (home centers have various styles available) to a sheet of 3/4-inch particle board.
Start by cutting the sheet to approximate size; remember to allow at least 1/2-inch overhang on all four sides. There are a number of ways to cut the laminate. If you have a table saw, you can use it with a carbide blade or an old combination blade. Do not use your best steel blade because the hard plastic laminate will dull it. If you don't have a power saw, you can use a hand saw with fine crosscut teeth.
Still another way to cut the laminate is with a laminate scriber. The scriber looks like a utility knife but is made for hard plastic. To make the cut, place a straight edge down, then score a line across the face of the laminate with the scriber. Bend the laminate back until it breaks. This technique sounds easy, but it can be tedious because you may have to make a number of passes before the score mark is deep enough for a clean break.
Before bonding the laminate to the table top, examine the top for bumps or holes. Sand down the bumps and fill the holes with wood putty. Make sure the surface is clean and dry before brushing on the contact cement.
Contact cement is a petroleum-based adhesive. It is flammable and toxic. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area away from heat or an open flame. There is a water-based contact cement that is less toxic and non-flammable, but it has less bonding strength than the petroleum-based cement.
Bond the edges first. Adhere one strip, then trim it before doing the next one. The best tool to use to trim the laminate is a router fitted with a carbide trimming bit. (Be sure to wear eye protection.) You can also use a plane, a Surform tool or a special laminate trimmer (available at some rental stores).
Do the top last. It's important to make sure that the bond is secure and that there are no air pockets beneath the plastic. One way to do this is by tapping across the entire surface with a hammer; to avoid marring the finish, place a wood block under the hammer. You can also use a rolling pin to press the laminate in place.

HEADLINE: Group Opposes Managed Care

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

 BODY:
"CODE BLUE" -- in medicine, the words indicate a patient has gone into cardio-pulmonary arrest and must receive immediate emergency resuscitation.
Recently, an advocacy group of doctors, nurses and patients took the name Code Blue to underscore their belief that, in the words of one of the group's founders, "our dying health care system needs to be resuscitated." 
 Dr. Carl P. Weber, a surgeon who practices in White Plains, and Dr. Richard Frimer, an internist who specializes in intensive-care medicine and pulmonology who also practices in White Plains, founded Code Blue to promote awareness of what they say are the pitfalls of managed care. The doctors say that the managed-care system prevalent in America today influences doctors to make medical decisions based on financial considerations, stresses cost cutting over cures, penalizes doctors for recommending certain tests, treatments and consultations with specialists and may actually reward them for withholding care.
To publicize their views, Dr. Weber and Dr. Frimer have placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines, spoken at public meetings, contacted legislators and given interviews for publication or broadcast.
"On top of being sick and frightened, many people now have to fight with their insurers simply to get reimbursement for some procedures," Dr. Weber said. The managed-care trend, he added, is to cover only the basics, only the barest minimum. "This country is developing a system where you can get the gas tank filled, you can have the oil changed, but when the engine falls out you have to fight to get it replaced and paid for."
"We have gone back to the dark ages," Dr. Frimer said. "The science of medicine is getting lost in a lot of jargon about cutting costs."
Managed care, Dr. Weber explained, is a general term for insurance plans that oversee where and how members receive health care. Although specifics vary with each plan, this usually entails determining which, and how many, doctors a patient can see and which tests he or she can get. Under many plans, a patient's freedom of choice is severely restricted, Dr. Weber said, observing that often a patient must see a "gate keeper" doctor who determines whether consultations with specialists are necessary and therefore reimbursable.
Because the majority of employees of large and small companies are now enrolled in some type of managed-care plan, doctors feel pressure to provide services through those plans, Dr. Weber said. He added that those doctors who take part may find themselves financially penalized by the insurance companies for ordering certain tests, referring a patient to specialists or keeping a patient in the hospital beyond a certain number of days.
"The decisions are made by people interested in economics first, and the actual welfare of the patient, a distant second," he said. Furthermore, he said, some studies indicating that managed care saves significant amounts of money are skewed because they were conducted on a group younger and healthier than the average American. "We need to educate the public about what managed care really is doing," he said.
Toward that end, he and Dr. Frimer have raised $48,000 from doctors, nurses and patients to pay for full-page newspaper ads. Code Blue has also joined in a lawsuit, as an advocate, on behalf of a patient who is claiming her treatment was compromised under a managed-care plan. The group has also filed a petition in State Supreme Court, asking that the court require the state's Department of Health to investigate the impact of managed-care plans on patients' welfare. And they are volunteering to speak to any group willing to listen.
"The proponents of managed care fail to consider the devastating situations people often find themselves in," Dr. Weber said. "There was a case, not long ago, in which a child needed a transplant. This particular health maintenance organization approved payment but stipulated that the procedure be done at a particular transplant center, which happened to be 150 miles from the child's home.
"Both parents needed to work, but because of this, the mother had to quit working to be near her child. The father, who had a low-paying job, could not stop working, and rarely got to see his sick child. The other child in the family developed psychological and behavioral problems as a result of all this stress. This HMO's policy virtually destroyed a whole family."

HEADLINE: Hospital Plans Unit for Children

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

 BODY:
COUNTY officials recently announced plans to build a $60 million children's hospital at the County Medical Center in Valhalla within five years. This 150-bed hospital would become the only hospital in the New York City area specializing entirely in providing tertiary care -- the highest level of care -- for seriously ill children.
At a time of economic difficulty for both governmental units and hospitals, the county will provide $9.9 million toward the project from the 1997 capital budget, with the rest coming from the Medical Center's own fund-raising efforts. This will be the first major fund-raising campaign in the Medical Center's history. When completed, it will become the first new medical building on the Valhalla campus since the Medical Center opened in 1977. 
 "We will not be focusing on the child who has pneumonia or asthma but the child who has cancer or heart disease or who needs transplant surgery," Edward A. Stolzenberg, the county's Commissioner of Hospitals, said at a news conference in a pediatric outpatient area. "We treat many of these illnesses now in the main hospital, but we can't provide the amenities that children and their parents need."
Each year, the Medical Center treats 20,000 patients under age 20. This represents a sixth of the center's patient population. The main hospital has 109 pediatric beds on two floors. Services provided there to children include kidney transplants, brain surgery and cancer care. The Medical Center is the only hospital between Westchester and Albany that does pediatric open-heart surgery and has an intensive care unit for children. There are 570,000 children in the seven-county region north of New York City.
"We are letting out the best-kept secret in the Hudson Valley and that is the quality of our child services at the Medical Center," said Dr. Michael H. Gewitz, director of pediatrics. "We're interested in providing a functionally designed hospital for children that matches the care they need."
Dr. Gewitz said that in treating children it is important to provide a non-threatening environment and take family needs into account. The Medical Center is limited in that regard. The new hospital, for example, will have rooms equipped with pullout beds so a parent can stay overnight.
Commissioner Stolzenberg said that pediatric liver transplants will soon be performed at the Medical Center. "But since the children's beds are full on a regular basis, we must expand to provide new services," he said.
The expansion plans come at a time when many hospitals are being forced into intense competition by cutbacks in government aid. County officials said that the new hospital will not compete with local hospitals, because the mission of the new hospital will be to treat the most seriously ill children, those who cannot receive adequate care elsewhere in the county.
There are two other children's hospitals in the New York area: Babies and Infants Hospital at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan and Schneider Children's Hospital at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park. Neither of these hospitals is devoted solely to tertiary care.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said the project will go forward even if there is a change in the county's relationship with the Medical Center, such as the county's turning control of the center over to a public benefit corporation. "There has been a need for this for a long time," Mr. O'Rourke said. "We are building a new hospital that will either be run by the county commissioner or a public benefit corporation."
Mr. O'Rourke defended his decision to ask the county's Board of Legislators to help finance the project. "The county spent $68 million to build a new jail a couple of years ago," he said. "It needed to be done, but it's time we spent money on something of equal importance to the future of this county and state."
Commissioner Stolzenberg said that feasibility studies have identified how private sources can provide most of the money needed to complete the project. Fund-raising efforts will begin in June at the hospital's annual ball. State approval will be necessary before construction begins. Early plans are to build the new hospital behind the main hospital near the Medical Center's heliport.

HEADLINE: Norwich's Deer Now In Hunters' Sights

BYLINE: By SAM LIBBY 

 BODY:
MOST of the deer from the Mohegan Park Zoo in Norwich, remainders of a herd that had served as town pets since 1936, were shipped out of town one night early this month, auctioned off in Ohio, and are now in Texas game farms where they will be hunted and killed for trophies.
An East Lyme-based wildlife rescue organization, which had been trying to prevent the deers' slaughter, only managed to acquire eight of them, which will eventually be returned to Connecticut. 
 The developments apparently ended a struggle between economics-minded town officials who argued that the deer must go, and others seeking to continue the Norwich tradition of a local deer herd especially beloved by children.
Last fall there were 53 deer in the zoo's three-acre fenced-in enclosure. Six died during the winter and five escaped after a hole was cut in the fence in March and the remaining 42 were turned over to Ponte Brothers, of Westport, Mass., after being tested, at Norwich's expense, for potential health problems.
Only 39 survived the trip to Woods and Waters, a western Ohio animal auction house. And three of those animals were so damaged in transit that auction officials said they had to be destroyed.
Before being auctioned on April 20, the remaining 36 animals were examined by potential buyers, and there were some expressions of dismay. "It's very unusual that animals in this poor condition are auctioned here," said Raymond Bailey, an Ohio white-tailed-deer breeder.
Indeed, auction house employees warned potential bidders that the animals had a host of injuries including lameness, abscesses, open sores, a broken jaw and deep infected wounds. But regulars said the animals were auctioned at some of the highest prices in memory for white-tailed deer.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Mr. Bailey. Animals that usually would have sold for less than $100 commanded $400 to $600, he said.
"This is only business," said Bill Engles, a seller of deer to Texas game farms. "I have people who are paying $8,000 for bucks and $1,800 for does. I have an order for 800 animals." It was Mr. Engles and two associates, all wearing big black Stetsons hats and black Western attire, who bought most of the bucks and large does offered at the auction. One of the Mohegan Park bucks sold for $1,000; a doe sold for $850.
Mr. Engles bought 22 of the zoo deer; 6 were bought by deer breeders, and the wildlife rescue organization got the rest.
Ponte Brothers, which was paid $3,600 by the Town of Norwich to have the deer tested for disease, received about $20,000 for the sale of 36 deer. It was as a result of a $5,000 donation from Donald Burr of Norwich that the North American Wildlife Association was able to buy the eight deer, said Robert Salvatore, president of the organization.
Volunteers are trying to stabilize the animals and prepare them for transport to the association's 25-acre wildlife refuge in East Lyme, said Mr. Salvatore.
Two years ago a zoo advisory council recommended the destruction of the herd. The city is converting the zoo into a petting zoo, which will only have barnyard animals.
Following the council's recommendation, a deer contracted rabies, and the city was ordered by the state to erect a second fence around the deer enclosure.
The city then made plans to have the deer shot and butchered for local soup kitchens.
But public school children and other city residents protested the animals' death sentence.
In February, Mr. Salvatore said, he was contacted by City Manager Bill Tallman and told that his wildlife association could take over the care of the animals at the association's refuge.
And volunteers were building an enclosure when, on April 8, in secret and after dark, the zoo animals were turned over to the Ponte Brothers for their apparently rugged trip to Ohio.
The city did consider sending the deer to North American Wildlife Association, said Mr. Tallman. But the city was advised by Dale May, head of the state Department of Environmental Protection's wildlife division that the association did not have sufficient resources to care for the animals. The city also had an agreement with George Ponte, owner of Ponte Brothers, that he would get at least 40 deer, said Mr. Tallman.
Robert Pritchett, a Pennsylvania deer breeder, bought a zoo buck with an infected wound on its left front leg at the auction. Mr. Pritchett said he believed he could heal the buck's wound and use him for breeding until the fall. "He'll be alright until the fall. Then he's going to be eaten," said Mr. Pritchett.
Not so, apparently, for the small group bought by the wildlife association, which is trying to raise an additional $5,000 to transport the animals to Connecticut, build a five-acre enclosure at the refuge and begin a fund for the animals' ongoing care, said Mr. Salvatore.
At the wildlife refuge these animals, the last remnant of a 60-year-old herd that was always the city of Norwich's pets, will be able to live out their natural lives, he said.
"At the very least Norwich's children can be told that the city government did not succeed in having all of the city's pet deer killed," Mr. Salvatore said.

HEADLINE: Can Towns Control Gaming's Downside?

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
LEDYARD is a rural eastern Connecticut town where the churches easily outnumber the cocktail lounges. But it still worries about bad influences. Town Council member Cynthia S. Brewster is putting the finishing touches on a 15-page ordinance that would restrict adults-only book and video stores, massage parlors and nightclubs.
Ms. Brewster says people in town are worried that with the largest casino in the Western Hemisphere already open in Ledyard, and another planned in the next town over, people are worried that the region could become the next Las Vegas. 
 Nearby Salem and Colchester are preparing similar ordinances, Norwich has one on the books, and other towns in the region are beginning to look at their own laws for controlling pornography. Two prostitution rings have been broken up, rings that were tied to casino customers, advocates of the ordinances point out.
"Our region is changing quickly, and we've lost control of a lot of our land because of Federal mandates regarding Indian reservations," Ms. Brewster said. "This is an attempt to regain some of that control."
Jenny Contois, Colchester's First Selectman, said her town has the third-highest growth rate in the state. "All that activity raised a red flag -- particularly with the casinos so close by," she said. "People have really been concerned about the possibility of adults-only businesses moving into town, and they've asked us to look into an ordinance that could control it."
But many local officials also believe the threat is overblown. They note that there are no adults-only bookstores, video shops or massage parlors at the Foxwoods Resort Casino, which is run by the Mashantucket Pequots on the border of Ledyard and Preston, and there are none planned for the Mohegan Pequot's Sun Resort Casino under construction in Montville.
Ms. Contois, for instance, said she doesn't think the casinos would so heavily influence commercial development in Colchester, which is 15 miles away, that peep shows will be opening along Main Street.
"I'm not a big proponent of gambling," Ms. Contois said. "I think it has its negatives. But it has also generated a lot of jobs, and had this industry not been here as defense companies were downsizing, we would have experienced much higher unemployment."
Kathy B. Warzecha, the city planner in Norwich, said an ordinance banning nude dancing, adult bookstores and other adult-oriented enterprise has been in place there just over a year.
"But it hasn't been a big issue in town," Ms. Warzecha said. "I've never had anyone come in and propose something that would violate the ordinance. In fact, what I'm more concerned about now is the opening of pawn shops."
Ms. Warzecha said if the casino has had any impact in town, it has been positive. With more than 60,000 people going to the casino on a busy day, there is no way the restaurants and shops on the grounds of the gaming complex can accommodate everyone, and the other towns in the region could get the spillover.
"There are such large numbers of people involved, you don't even need to capture that much of it on a percentage basis to make a big difference in the business climate," Ms. Warzecha said. "There's a lot more traffic moving through Norwich now, and once things go a little further you'll see more benefits from the people driving through."
"What it's done is created a new level of enthusiasm," she continued. "We've had five or six new businesses come into the downtown in just the last month. You can't focus on the bad points of the casinos because they're here, so you have to try to focus on the good points."
Other officials say the ordinances make sense even if casinos don't have the impact many people expect.
"This is an effort to think ahead," agreed Cynthia B. Rowin, the Salem Town Clerk. "Salem is a fast-growing town, and when you have an area that's seeing a lot of development, this is one of the areas you look at. We want this ordinance in place before an adult-oriented business decides to locate here."
But lawyers caution that the towns cannot carry their restrictions too far. Joseph S. Grabarz, executive director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, said many of the local ordinances are meaningless, legally.
"There are already laws on the books that govern what minors can buy, and that put limits on what can be shown or printed, so I would question what these local ordinances would accomplish," Mr. Grabarz said. "It's a chancy thing for a town to do, and can often lead to a large financial exposure."
Mr. Grabarz said, for instance, that some towns respond to citizen pressure to restrict what an adults-only business can put on a sign outside its doors.
"There's a problem whenever they try to regulate content," Mr. Grabarz said. "The town shouldn't be in the business of telling one business how it can advertise, unless it's the same rule for all businesses."
He said, though, that the Civil Liberties Union rarely steps into the fray when a town attempts to ban the distribution of pornography.
"They can be very lucrative businesses, so as soon as the law is enforced and one of them is shut down, there's enough money at stake that the business obtains a high-powered attorney and gets it overturned," said Mr. Grabarz.
Alan Neigher, a Westport lawyer who specializes in First Amendment cases, said towns have a right to use zoning laws to maintain the essential nature of the town, but it can quickly be undermined.
"The types of regulations that get struck down are generally those that focus on a particular type of activity," Mr. Neigher said.
"If towns around Ledyard have kept their residential character, they probably have a better chance of enforcing an ordinance," Mr. Neigher said. "But once they develop commercial areas, that argument starts to slip away. It won't be long before you have a business that wants to get into entertainment, first with restaurants, then nightclubs, and so on. Before you know it, you have lap dancing."
Most of the towns said they are aware that they have to proceed carefully. Salem's 10 1/2-page ordinance goes into great detail about how signs must identify the business as "adult-oriented," owners must be licensed and the businesses cannot be within 500 feet of a residential area, 2,000 feet of a park or school, or 3,000 feet of another adult-oriented business.
"There was actually very little discussion of First Amendment rights because the ordinance is so carefully worded it won't infringe on anyone's rights," Ms. Rowin maintained.
The ordinances must also, by law, go into great detail about what is banned, with specific and graphic detail of genitals, breasts and buttocks. Ms. Brewster said members of the committee drafting Ledyard's 15-page ordinance joke that it will be difficult to find someone who won't be embarrassed reading it into the record.
"There are still a lot of gray areas in terms of what the courts view as constitutional and unconstitutional, but I think this is a good ordinance," Ms. Brewster said.
Not everyone is happy, she acknowledged. One zoning commissioner complained that the ordinance might ban nude dancing for bachelor parties at a local bar, and several people have expressed concerns about how it might affect a couple of existing video stores where videos that might be called triple-X-rated, are stocked in a back room.
But Ms. Brewster said most support the ordinance. "This is not the type of business we want to attract," Ms. Brewster said. "In the long run, how is that kind of business going to improve our quality of life?"

Just an Old-Fashioned Town, Filled With Music, Art and Fish This Weekend

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. SMITH 

 BODY:
Fish and people are pouring into Lambertville and its Pennsylvania neighbor New Hope this weekend for the 15th annual Shad Fest, a popular showcase not only for art and music, but also for the town of Lambertville itself.
In its heyday, the town, a ferry crossing that became a manufacturing and transportation hub in the 19th century, saw the construction of picturesque churches, stately commercial buildings, and elegant Second Empire and Victorian houses. As economic development moved south, recessions and Lambertville's physical isolation in the Delaware Valley had the beneficial effect of causing the village to enter the mid-20th century largely undeveloped and unchanged. 
 A new generation of young professionals now calls Lambertville home, but a sense of community remains. Images of the area from the 1850's to the 1920's fill a new book of photographs, "Lambertville and New Hope" (Arcadia Publishing), by three members of the Lambertville Historical Society, James Mastrich, Yvonne Warren and George Kline.
Subjects of the photographs include Billy McCartney, the World War I-era New Hope postman who crossed the bridge every working day to pick up mail at the Lambertville railroad station ("You could set your watch by him," Mr. Mastrich said); Boy Willie Smith, a fisherman, mending curtainlike shad nets called seines, which have been used since the days of the Lenni Lenape Indians; a very quaint A&P store offering modern prepackaged convenience; the garage of George C. Green, a legendary mechanical genius who could diagnose machines' malfunctions without even taking them apart; a bell destined for the St. Andrew's Episcopal Church being removed from a temporary location, and the Lambertville House, the town's premiere hotel, whose long-awaited renovation is under way.
When word of the project spread, area residents came forward with useful information, suggestions and pictures. Dr. Mastrich, a psychologist practicing in Kingston, said he treasured this sense of community as well as Lambertville's ambiance, so charming as to seem hardly real.
"When I was a kid, I had a wonderful train set with a downtown, a little church, little buildings," said Dr. Mastrich, who grew up in Stamford, Conn. "And now I live in it."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
A Big Refinancing at a Middle-Income Co-op

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
"WE came looking for a better way of life," said Philip Leblang, explaining what brought him and his family to the Amalgamated Warbasse Houses middle-income co-op in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn 32 years ago, when it was newly built. He and his wife, Hilda, are still in the two-bedroom apartment on the third floor that they bought then for $2,600.
He is 77 now, and their two sons have grown up and moved out. For Warbasse, which has 2,585 apartments in five 23-story buildings and plenty of outdoor parking, he has nothing but praise. But if pressed, he will admit that age has caught up with the elevators. 
 "They cut out, they stall, they're always being fixed," he said. "If the odd one is out, we're in trouble, and it's often out, believe me." If the odd one is out, he must walk up or down a flight to catch the elevator that stops on the even floors.
The elevator problem and some of the other infirmities of advanced building age are on the threshold of treatment and cure at Warbasse, however.
After obtaining a Federal mortgage-insurance commitment, the development closed in March on a new $33.36 million 35-year first mortgage at a fixed 8 1/8 percent interest rate from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Pension Trust.
With $14.2 million of the loan, the co-op paid off the balance remaining on the state moral-obligation bonds that financed the project. About $11 million has gone into a reserve fund for future building needs, including a complete window replacement.
But millions more are already committed to a roof replacement program ($1.7 million) and an upgrading of the elevator system ($4.5 million). The elevator work will be done over the next two years by the Republic Elevator Company, of Long Island City, Queens. When it is complete, two elevators will serve every floor.
What is unusual in all this is that a middle-income co-op, whose residents have only a modest equity stake in their housing, has decided to buy out two state-backed bonds running to 2006 -- one carrying a 3.6 percent interest rate and the other a 3.8 percent rate -- and accept significantly higher long-term monthly carrying costs in order to make a substantial rehabilitation program possible.
Moreover, Warbasse has done it without opting out of the middle-income housing program itself, which developments may do after they have been in it for 20 years. Staying within the program means that vacancies will continue to be sold at prices well below their true market value.
With the new financing, the shareholders' monthly maintenance costs have gone up by 8.7 percent, or 3 percentage points more than was required for normal increases in operating expenses.
T HE owners now pay $123.21 a room per month, or $579 for a typical two-bedroom apartment without a terrace on a middle floor, including utilities.
Current purchase prices for vacant apartments range from $8,595 for a small one-bedroom to $20,055 for a three-bedroom penthouse unit with seven rooms. The typical midlevel two-bedroom with no terrace would sell for $12,892.
So far this year, vacancies have occurred in 10 two-bedroom apartments. Eight of them have gone to families already living at Warbasse who needed larger units. The two others went to outsiders who had been on the waiting list for four years.
The New York State middle-income, or Mitchell-Lama, housing program was established in 1955 under a law sponsored by Assemblyman Alfred Lama of Brooklyn and Senator MacNeil Mitchell of Manhattan. Over 400 developments with more than 150,000 housing units, both rentals and co-ops, were built under the program, using long-term state bonds and getting the benefit of low property taxes. New arrivals may earn no more than seven times the annual rent or maintenance charge in smaller apartments, and as much as eight times in larger apartments.
Under this eligibility rule a family of four earning as much as $65,420 would be eligible for a two-bedroom apartment at Warbasse. Thousands of families apply to get on the waiting list when, periodically, the development advertises for applicants, but only 400 names are drawn. Then it takes a few years till the list is used up. Warbasse plans to establish a new waiting list for one-bedroom apartments next year.
According to Michael J. Martino, senior vice president for housing in the New York State Housing Finance Agency, the ownerships of 17 developments with 11,000 apartments that were built under the agency's auspices have chosen to prepay their mortgages, leave the program and thereby charge market rents for vacancies. Almost all have been rentals, normally owned by the investor-builders who chose to participate in the development program.
"Warbasse wanted to maintain its middle-income status while enhancing its physical environment," Mr. Martino said.
The agency, which has originated the financing for 90 developments with 53,000 housing units across the state, with about $1.1 billion in loans outstanding, is hoping to come forward with a program that will allow this type of refinancing to occur under state auspices.
But with no such program available, Warbasse found itself frustrated for several years until it was led by mortgage bankers -- Bert M. King of King Mortgage Corporation, of Bethesda, Md., and Irwin Shapiro, of New York Urban Servicing Company -- to the Federal Government for an insurance commitment under the Section 223f program.
This multifamily insurance program was used in the 70's to assist newly built middle-income developments that encountered fiscal difficulties.
In recent years it has been used by private rental owners to refinance their mortgages, with about 20 projects coming through the New York office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development since 1992. But it had not previously been used to provide financing for major capital improvement programs at successful older Mitchell-Lama co-ops.
"Warbasse had about $2 million in its reserve funds," said Theodore B. Liban, a lawyer for Warbasse. "That was clearly not enough to make repairs that were urgent."
Managers of other major Mitchell-Lama developments are taking notice.
"Any development that needs a major capital improvement and hasn't got the money available needs to see if it should refinance its first mortgage so that it can spread out the cost to its residents over time," said Jeffrey C. Gold, vice president of Marvin Gold Management in Brooklyn, which manages 14 Mitchell-Lama developments with 6,360 apartments.
These developments may feel compelled to leave the state program if proper financing mechanisms are not available.
Amalgamated Warbasse Houses, on 29 acres off Neptune Avenue, was sponsored by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.
Its name honors James P. Warbasse, a physician who lived from 1866 to 1957 and founded the Cooperative League of the U.S.A. Near it are other large middle-income developments of the era -- Trump Village, Brightwater Towers and Luna Park.
T HE unionist founders of the co-op movement so successfully achieved their dream of replacing squalid housing with affordable modern housing in the Coney Island and Brighton Beach area that tenancy turnover has been glacially slow. Warbasse is now considered a "Norc" -- a naturally occurring retirement community. About 40 percent of the households have at least one member over 65, and a large number have one member over 75. There are 8,000 residents in all.
Nowadays many younger families are moving in, including a large contingent of Jews from the former Soviet Union.
"The community is getting younger," said Joseph Tarantola. "There are many small children around, and I enjoy seeing that."
But it is Mr. Tarantola who seems to embody the spirit of the place. He is 72, and a retired officer of the jewelry workers' union.
He arrived at Warbasse in 1965 with his wife, Selma, and two children, 9 and 5, from a rental in Crown Heights. The children are gone and the grandchildren are in Maryland, but he and Selma remain in their three-bedroom apartment with a terrace.
Move? "We've thought of that," he said. "But we love the city. We can walk to the beach. We're not anxious to move out."

A Below-Market Rental for Village Employees

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
THIS small, affluent village, known for its riverfront mansions and quaint downtown, has agreed to sell a vacant waterfront building to an affordable-housing organization that plans to build 24 rental units on the top two floors and a new library for the village on the first floor.
The first below-market-rate housing ever built in Irvington, it will be targeted to village employees, many of whom are now forced to live outside of the village because of its high cost of housing, according to Steve McCabe, the village administrator. 
 "We'll develop a point system," Mr. McCabe said, "giving priority to village employees, volunteer firefighters, workers with the ambulance corps, teachers and seniors."
After holding several public hearings, the village encountered very little opposition to the proposal, according to Mayor Dennis Flood.
"I think people are always afraid these developments will somehow adversely affect their property values," the Mayor said. "I think we've done a good job in alleviating those concerns. Also the county's planning department has been very helpful in pointing to projects that have worked out very well in other communities."
One of the immediate advantages to this proposal is that it makes use of an 115-year-old white elephant, which has sat vacant at the foot of Main Street for over 10 years. "It will bring an infusion of people downtown, hopefully helping to revitalize the downtown shops," said Mr. McCabe.
Like other Hudson River communities, Irvington at one time had a bustling industrial section on the waterfront. Lord & Burnham Company, which manufactured greenhouses, operated in Irvington from 1870 until 1986. It built several low-rise brick buildings by the water. A smokestack with the company's name on it rising over the buildings still serves as a primary identifying feature of Irvington from the water.
In recent years, some of the old industrial structures, especially those on the west side of the railroad tracks, have been finding a new life as office buildings, offering loft-style spaces with river views and big windows, and attracting graphic-art and other creative companies from Manhattan.
The 30,000-square-foot Burnham Building, which is on the east side of the tracks, was not part of the waterfront renaissance. After being on the market for several years, Lord & Burnham eventually sold it to the village in 1993 for $750,000.
"When we acquired it, we always hoped it would be the site for our new library, but the right proposal never materialized," Mr. McCabe said.
Then the nonprofit Affordable Housing Construction Company, of Katonah, offered to develop it jointly with the Greyston Foundation, another nonprofit developer, in Yonkers. "They liked the idea of the library," Mr. McCabe said. "Other developers were reluctant to give up that space."
O N April 4, at a public hearing, the project's architects -- Stephen Tilly, Architect, of Dobbs Ferry, and Galliher, Baier & Best of Simsbury, Conn., an associate in the library's design -- and presented their plans for the renovation, which includes gutting the interior and creating 24 apartments, including studios and one- and two-bedroom units.
The building is actually comprised of several structures that have been pieced together over the years, according to Stephen Tilly, the lead architect.
"The challenge is to make the interior space seem seamless," he said. One part of the building is an 1880's Queen Anne carriage house with a skylight. "The top of that could be turned into an amazing studio," Mr. Tilly said.
He also plans to create an outdoor terrace at the back of the building, which would be used communally. "It's just an interesting space," Mr. Tilly said. "We could wind up with a multitude of floor plans. The apartments will certainly not look alike." They are expected to rent for between $575 and $875 a month, according to Mr. McCabe.
When Jonathon F. P. Rose, president of Affordable Housing Construction, first saw the building, "I immediately fell in love with it," he said.
"It fit the mission of our company completely," he added.
His firm looks for projects within walking distance to mass transportation, Mr. Rose said.
"It's also important," he went on, "that a project bring people and diversity to a downtown. We would never build a big box outside of town that would sap a downtown."
The library component will occupy 10,000 square feet on the first floor, which is triple the size of the existing library in the Village Hall.
"I think it's the perfect mixed use," Mr. Rose said. "More and more, libraries are becoming meeting places. It will serve to anchor Main Street."
The entire project is expected to cost $5 million, Mr. McCabe said. A local group is raising funds for the library construction. "They hope to raise $900,000," he added. "They're off to a good start."
T HE developers will be looking to state and county grants and Federal tax credits for most of the financing. They have already applied for a $720,000 county loan and a $192,000 Federal loan, and they are seeking a total of $672,731 in state and county grants and will apply for $2 million in Federal tax credits.
"The county has really been pushing for villages to develop affordable housing," Mr. Rose said. "The money is there. It's a matter of finding the right sources."
Four years ago, the county set a target of building 5,000 new units of affordable housing over a period of 10 years. "We now have 800 units that have been completed, are under construction or are ready to go," said Lynn Oliva, the County Planning Commissioner.
She added that the Irvington proposal "seems to be a wonderful mixed-use project" that "makes use of a landmarked building and brings a residential component to the downtown."
"It's got a lot going for it," she said.
The affordable-housing goal for Irvington was 35 units, according to Mr. McCabe, "and we stand a very good chance of exceeding it."
Last month, Jim Dinan, a local resident, gave the village a one-acre parcel off Broadway, with the stipulation that it be used for affordable housing.
The land is the site of the Irvington Presbyterian Church, a 1853 Gothic Revival building, which was practically destroyed by fire in 1972. Only remnants of the stone walls remain. They will be replaced by three town houses to be built by the Future Homes Company of Westchester, based in Valhalla.
"There will be a total of 14 homes with two and three bedrooms," Mr. McCabe said. And they will be for-sale units.
"We're excited that we could be one of the few communities to meet the county's goals for the number of affordable housing units," Mr. McCabe said. "We could set an example to other villages. If little old Irvington could do it, they could, too."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 23-Story Building to Go Up Near United Nations;
$30 Million Office Tower For German Government

 BODY:
Construction is to begin within days on a 23-story office building near the United Nations that will be entirely occupied by the Federal Republic of Germany.
The building, on a 50- by-100 foot site at 871 United Nations Plaza, between 48th and 49th Streets, will allow Germany to consolidate three of its New York offices. 
 The property was bought from the Albanese Development Corporation of Garden City, L.I., which also assisted the German government in designing the building and arranging for the Turner Corporation to serve as general contractor. The architect was Schuman Lichtenstein Clamon & Efron of Manhattan.
The project will cost about $30 million, said Karl-Heinz Schoer, first secretary of the German Mission to the United Nations.
Mr. Schoer said Germany's U.N. Mission at 600 Third Avenue, its Consulate General at 460 Park Avenue, and its Information Center at 950 Third Avenue will be housed in the new building when it is completed in two years.
"It's much more economical to do that," Mr. Schoer said of what he called "a trend here in New York" for foreign governments. The three agencies, he said, "will still be independent, but with one joint management office."
And because foreign governments are tax exempt, Germany will not have to pay real estate taxes, as it now indirectly does as a renter, Mr. Schoer pointed out.
The president of the development company, Vincent M. Albanese, said a Swedish company had been interested in building a hotel on the site several years ago, but ran into financial difficulty.
"We abandoned the idea of a hotel and determined that this site was uniquely suited for a foreign government, because of its proximity to the U.N.," Mr. Albanese said. Originally, the plan had been to sell floors to several foreign governments.
The 100,000-square-foot building, with a two-story high lobby and a slim plaza in front, will have a glass and light-brown granite facade.
The Albanese company also owns a building on 49th Street that abuts the site of the proposed office tower, and the German Government has purchased the first floor of that building for use as a passport and visa office.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Fade Out a Flea Market, Fade In a Multiplex Theater

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
FOR 20 years, a 20-acre tract off Route 1 here was home to the U.S. 1 Flea Market, where some 100 merchants sold their wares at bargain prices in a 175,000-square-foot building that now is vacant and forlorn.
But over the next month the building will be demolished and a 16-screen, 79,000-square-foot Sony movie theater with 4,200 to 4,400 seats, a 70,000-square-foot retail complex and up to three free-standing restaurants will rise on the site and on an adjacent 15 acres. There will also be parking for more than 1,600 cars. 
 Sony Theaters, a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment Company, based in Manhattan, will build the theater and lease the ground under it from the Sheldon Elizabeth Company, a Roseland developer that owns the entire site. Sheldon Elizabeth, using its own equity and traditional bank financing, will build the retail and restaurant space.
The theater, which marks the return of a nonpornographic moviehouse to the city after a more than a 20-year absence, is expected to open by November. Construction on the rest of the $20 million project will begin once a sizable portion of the retail space has been preleased, said Barry Yeskel, a partner at the development company. Completion is expected sometime in 1997.
Mr. Yeskel said the decision to move ahead with the project was based on economics. "The concept of an entertainment center and quality retail made sense," he said, adding that it was a "higher and better use" than the flea market for the site.
For Sony the site offered an opportunity to enter an underserved market. Kenneth B. Benjamin, Sony's vice president of real estate, said the site was chosen because of its access to and visibility from a highway and, adding a twist to the old developer mantra, "demographics, demographics, demographics."
He said that more than 400,000 people, with an average household income of $63,000, lived within a seven-mile radius of the site. And that, he said, does not include the student population at Rutgers University, which now numbers around 35,000.
New Brunswick officials welcome the project. Along with providing jobs it will generate less traffic and more tax revenue than the flea market, said Glenn S. Patterson, director of the city's Department of Policy, Planning and Economic Development. "And" he added, "it will also burnish the city's image as an entertainment and cultural hub."
Over the last decade, Livingston Avenue at the southern end of New Brunswick's reviving central business district has been reshaped into something of a cultural center. Three theaters now stand there -- the State Theater, a performance center, and two legitimate theaters, the George Street Playhouse and Crossroads Theater, which houses the state's largest professional acting company. .
A ND just last year the corner of Livingston Avenue at New Street became home to a five-story, 160,000-square-foot structure for Rutgers University's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, the Center for Urban Policy Research and the Mason Gross School of the Arts, where exhibitions are held.
Restaurants and other food outlets have also sprung up -- 35 is the latest count. That count also includes recent arrivals like coffee bars, including Butterfield's Beanery on Albany Street, and a microbrewery, Harvest Moon, that opened last month on George Street.
Mr. Patterson said the Sony theater complex would give people another reason to come to New Brunswick. Though it is outside the downtown "there will be some spinoff," he said.
Claudine I. Gillooly, executive director of the eight-year-old New Brunswick City Market, added that the theater "would bring more people who will see what else the city has to offer, try our stores and spend money." She said some downtown merchants saw the flea market "as unfair weekend-only competition."
City Market is the 16-block downtown special-improvement district, in which property owners tax themselves to finance physical improvements and services, including marketing to inject new life downtown.
The project is moving ahead at a time when the retail climate in New Jersey is soft and, industry analysts say, is expected to remain so at least for the balance of this year. But movie theaters are among the few users still shopping for space, helping to pick up some of the slack left behind by the store closings and bankruptcies of national discount chains, said Jonathan S. Meisel, a broker who deals with the theater industry at the East Rutherford office of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage.
They are being driven today through competition to "provide a higher level of technical sophistication and comfort that simply cannot be done at old theaters," Mr. Meisel added. As a result they are expanding at their current locations or looking for new sites all around the state, which remains popular because of its density, he said.
Mr. Meisel said there were at least a half dozen other movie theater projects under way or planned in northern New Jersey alone.
Mr. Benjamin of Sony said his company planned to add 50 screens in New Jersey this year by expanding existing theaters or building new ones, like the one in New Brunswick.
Others include a 10-screen theater under way in Mountainside and the expansion of an 8-screen theater in Wayne to 14 screens.
But Ted Kraus, who runs a retail consulting firm in Mercerville, said the aggressive posture of some movie operators may lead to overbuilding.
Sony disagrees, at least for the new screens they are adding. "We are aggressive, not foolish," said Mr. Benjamin, noting that in the case of the New Brunswick project the nearest significant competitor was the theater at the Menlo Park Mall, some eight miles to the north. He said the project would also be within a concentrated retail setting, which is preferred because of the interaction that can occur with other retailers.
F ROM a retail perspective the multiplex movie theater is "one of the uses that can be counted on as a destination," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a forecasting firm in Scotch Plains. "But while they tend to bring in more traffic, the people going to the movies may or may not go to the stores and buy."
The key, added Mr. Kraus, the Mercerville consultant, is siting the three uses so all are visible from the highway, providing sufficient parking and having a retail mix that complements the theater.
Mr. Yeskel, of Sheldon Elizabeth, the development company, said the project's retail component would incorporate all those factors. Though the leasing will be "driven by the market," he said the project as now envisioned would have three to four large national tenants like a bookstore or an electronics store "that would be consistent with an entertainment theme."
That concept sits well with Ms. Gillooly of City Market. "But if it winds up having 15 to 20 smaller retailers," she said, "that would hurt the downtown."

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT;
What Budget Squeeze? There's Money to Borrow

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
The state government is facing lean times, and the Legislature, the Whitman administration and dozens of interest groups are furiously debating what expenses to cut to bring the $16 billion budget into balance. But lawmakers are still feeling generous when it comes to borrowing money to pay for future programs.
So far, nine bond issues have been proposed for the November ballot, for a total of $1.6 billion in new spending -- nearly half as much as the state's entire existing bonded debt. 
 This does not mean that all nine will actually be on the ballot. Each year, lawmakers propose as many as 15 bond issues, of which only a handful (and often none) are approved by the full Legislature and the Governor for submission to the voters. Still, all are awaiting hearings in various legislative committees; approval requires a three-fifths vote in both houses, or a simple majority two years in a row. The deadline for inclusion on this November's ballot is Aug. 27.
Voters have traditionally looked kindly on environmental bond issues, and the largest proposal so far would allow the state to borrow $450 million for the Environmental Cleanup and Containment Bond Act of 1996. The money would be used to match Federal funds to dredge the Kill Van Kull, to build containment areas for dredged material, to upgrade underground storage tanks and to safeguard drinking water supplies.
No one testified against the bond act at a hearing of the Assembly's Environment, Science and Technology Committee last week, while the State Department of Environmental Protection, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and business and labor groups all said the money was needed to keep ships moving in the port.
Here are the other proposals:
HOUSING $290 million to build affordable houses and apartments, to help low-income families make down payments and pay closing costs for home purchases, and to provide loans and grants for small businesses. Two bills are proposed, with one in the Assembly Housing Committee and one in the Senate Urban Policy Committee.
 
PRISONS $275 million to pay for building and renovating state prisons and county jails. As an alternative, voters would be asked for $150 million to build new jail space, with at least $40 million to be used for county adult jails and juvenile detention centers. Both proposals are in the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee.
 
PINELANDS PROTECTION $70 million, mostly for grants and loans to local governments in the Pine Barrens for sewage treatment and water supply projects. The bill is in the Assembly Environment, Science and Technology Committee.
 
DEMOLITION $35 million, most of it to be used for loans and grants for local governments to demolish unsafe buildings. Two bills are proposed, with one in the Assembly Local Government Committee and one in the Senate Urban Policy Committee.
 
SCHOOLS $250 million for construction and renovation of schools, with $60 million to be set aside for grants to build kindergarten and pre-kindergarten classrooms in poorer districts. The bill is in the Assembly Education Committee.
 
LIBRARIES $50 million to build and renovate libraries, with grants of up to 20 percent of any one project's costs. The bill is in the Assembly Education Committee.
 
MENTAL HOSPITALS Trying to stave off the Whitman administration's plan to close Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital, supporters have proposed this $50 million bond issue to improve the hospital or build a new one on its grounds. The bill is in the Assembly Health Committee, but even its supporters concede that its prospects are dim.

Raising the Stakes
I am a lifetime Yankee fan who has often taken his family to the stadium in the Bronx. We have never had a problem. All the talk about a new stadium is only about money. That is why if Steinbrenner ever comes to New Jersey, the only money we taxpayers should offer him is the toll for the George Washington Bridge. He can carpool by taking with him any New Jersey politician who would dare spend any of our money to feed his greed.

If I Were Steinbrenner
Simple facts of economics: 1. The Yankees work as hard as any other major-league team. 2. They are the No. 2 draw on the road, yet they are a lowly 12th in attendance at home. If I were Steinbrenner, I'd be mad too! The Yankees are not getting fair market value for their efforts, and it is not any of their own fault. The area, parking, etc., are a hindrance.

Naming a Price
To attract the Yankees to New Jersey and not cost the taxpayers a dime, why not continue the practice of selling names?
Rest stops are renamed as political favors. Continental Airlines paid tens of millions of dollars to place its name on an arena. Take the logical next step.
Since attracting the Yankees would take a little more, let's start the bidding at naming a roadway. Make the Garden State Parkway "Steinbrenner's Way." If that doesn't work, offer a city. Will anyone really miss Ho-Ho-Kus with the Yankees in the state?
As a last resort, offer to change the name of the state. The only question would be whether to call ex-New Jerseyans Steinbrennerians or Steinbrennerites.
 
JOHN BURY

Who Deserves What?
Being an old-time Brooklyn Dodger fan, I don't worry much about the Yankees, but even they don't deserve George Steinbrenner. I think we ought to let him stay in New York. Why do we want any more pathological personalities in New Jersey?

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Trolley Urged for a Limping Old Freight Line

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: FLORENCE TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
Once, the railroad connected the blue-collar towns along the Delaware River from Camden to Trenton. As many as 50 passenger trains a day shuttled students, commuters and shoppers. Freight cars hauled raw materials to dozens of factories, including the Roebling Steel plant here, which built the cables for the Brooklyn and Golden Gate bridges.
But by the 1950's, highways and suburban shopping malls had pulled people off the trains and into their cars. In 1963, passenger service ended, and as factories moved to the outer-ring suburbs or closed (Roebling in 1974), freight service decreased to only a few times a day. 
 Now, there is talk of reviving passenger rail service for the 30-mile trip between Camden and Trenton.
For supporters, the idea is more than nostalgia. The service could be part of a proposed South Jersey rail network extending from Glassboro to Trenton, with connections to Philadelphia, New York City and beyond. But perhaps just as important, the service could give the riverfront area a much-needed second wind.
"We are in an area that is somewhat depressed economically; we have a lot of empty buildings that used to be for manufacturing; we have a lot of people who are either unemployed or underemployed," said Assemblywoman Diane Allen, Republican of Edgewater Park. "This would be an economic shot in the arm. This area would come alive again in ways it hasn't seen in a long, long time."
And Herman T. Costello, Mayor of Burlington City, said: "This train thing could be very helpful. Industries might come here now if they know that people can commute 20 miles via rail."
A week ago, New Jersey Transit hired consultants to study whether light-rail trains, or modern trolleys, are feasible on such a line; the results should be announced within three months. The project is certain to be expensive, since other light-rail lines have cost up to $40 million a mile -- which works out to $1 billion for the link from Camden to Trenton. Then there is the likely opposition from people who live near the tracks.
But the project does have advantages. Freight service still runs on the tracks, so little property, if any, would need to be acquired. And the tracks, now owned by Conrail, are for sale, so the timing could be just right for state officials to jump in.
"Technically, it's not a complex project; it's simple," said Frank M. Russo, senior director of new rail construction for New Jersey Transit. "It's just a matter of, is the ridership there? Are the economic development requirements there? Do we have the money that we want to commit to it?"
The project would be quite a comeback for a storied line. Built in early 1830's, the Camden-to-Trenton route (officially the Bordentown Secondary) was part of the Camden & Amboy railroad, one of the nation's first passenger lines. With three tracks available, affluent Philadelphia families took day trips to picnic along the New Jersey side of the Delaware; adventurous Burlington County couples went the other way for an excursion to the big city.
But when rail was eclipsed by the automobile, the route lost its relevance. (It may have been a sign of things to come that Thornton Wilder's 1931 play "The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden" centered around the automobile, not the train.)
Even now, the railroad is an afterthought. Freight cars chug on a single remaining track past shuttered storefronts, inert downtowns and empty, rusted factories that once made pipes and steel. And while freight service is still profitable, it isn't as profitable as other lines, and Conrail would like to sell the tracks, as well as several other South Jersey lines, by early next year, said Bob Libkind, a Conrail spokesman.
Neighbors of the line say that would not be a bad thing, citing worries about noise from increased freight service. A recent proposal to build a light-rail system from Camden to Mount Holly was shelved indefinitely because of residents' fears about safety, noise and crime.
Still, many are crossing their fingers that something will be done soon along the riverfront.
"We've got to get people back in the mind-set of using the train to get to work," said Carol Ann Thomas, principal transportation planner in Burlington County's office of the engineer. "The potential here is pretty amazing. Whether or not its time has come yet, we will see."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
State Knows a Thing or Two About the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By Brett Pulley; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
For $5.50 an hour, Sal Risalvato will put a willing and able person to work -- pumping gasoline, cleaning windshields and mopping the restroom floors at his service station in Riverdale, Morris County.
For such dirty work, the pay may not sound like much, but it is 45 cents above the current minimum wage in New Jersey. And that margin, according to Mr. Risalvato, is what enables him to compete for entry-level job seekers. So when he recently heard that the Federal Government was considering increasing the nationwide minimum to $5.15, from its current level of $4.25, he started to worry about what it might mean for his business and the 11 workers he employs. 
 "If they raise it, it will raise the threshold on what I pay," said Mr. Risalvato, who has owned the gas station for eight years. "The government shouldn't be mandating this. The marketplace is really what should prevail."
If Mr. Risalvato's words sound familiar, they should. It's been four years now since New Jersey raised its own minimum wage by 80 cents above the federal level to $5.05. Passed in 1991 by the State Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, the increase went into effect a year later. At that time, business lobbyists appealed to state legislators, warning that an increase would lead to layoffs and also make New Jersey businesses less competitive than their counterparts in other states.
But since then, there seems to be little evidence that business has gone to other states or that the higher minimum wage has led to job loss. According to state labor statistics, 134,000, or about 3.7 percent of New Jersey's total work force, earned the minimum wage in 1993, the latest year figures were compiled. For the most part, businesses that employ minimum wage workers have absorbed the higher costs in wages, and passed them on to the consumer through higher prices -- as they do with all other increased costs.
Alan Krueger, co-author of a 1995 book called "Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage," said his own study of the impact of New Jersey's increase found that it did not result in layoffs, nor did it cause customers to react to higher prices by going to other states with lower price structures.
"Minimum wage jobs provide services like retail sales and fast food," he explained. "These are services the consumer can't go elsewhere to get. You're not going to drive into Pennsylvania just to pay less for a hamburger."
Republican politicians and business owners like Mr. Risalvato usually oppose increases, while Democrats and labor groups approve. But now New Jersey Republicans are apparently betting that their friends in the business community can indeed swallow a modest increase. Addressing a conservative group of independent business owners, Representative Richard A. Zimmer of Hunterdon County, who hopes to succeed Bill Bradley in the Senate, took a big gulp recently and suggested that he might support a minimum wage increase as long as it does not "reach a point were it hurts the people its intended to help."
And two other New Jersey Republicans, Representatives Bill Martini of Clifton and Robert D. Franks of New Providence in Union County, went one step further recently and joined a group of breakaway Republicans who co-sponsored the legislation to raise the minimum wage. "I really thought it was a fairness issue," Mr. Martini said. "We're asking people to get off welfare. So this is one way to make that option more attractive."
Opponents of an increase argue that the only people who really benefit in the long run are politicians looking to collect votes. They contend that the higher wages too often go to wealthy or middle-class kids who are just earning a little fun money. "The whole concern about the minimum wage is a sham issue to cover up our failure to prepare people," said Donald Scarry, principal economist of New Jersey Economics, a policy consulting firm. "They come out of school poorly trained and then we shift the burden to the business community to pay them a decent wage."
Mr. Risalvato says he is bracing himself for a likely increase and the ripple effect that it will have on the wages he pays. "I've got to compete for employees," he said. "What else can I do?"
At least he hasn't started lobbying the Legislature to change the law to allow him to use those automated gasoline pumps that are operated by credit cards -- not yet, anyway.

HEADLINE: A Million Here, a Million There

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
GOVERNOR WHITMAN has finally had to take the budget ax out of the closet.
Until now, the Governor has been able to keep her campaign promise to reduce income tax rates without making huge cuts in state spending. She relied in part on creative money management -- lowering state contributions to employee pension funds and stretching out debt payments, for example, moves that she insists were fiscally prudent though critics deride them as gimmicks. 
 This year, the Governor has bigger holes to patch. She is planning to take $250 million from the fund that distributes benefits for up to 26 weeks to people who are temporarily disabled. But that's nowhere near enough to cover the $1.2 billion lost in this coming year through the income tax cut alone. And many of the Governor's efforts to make government "smarter and smaller" by turning over state programs to private contractors either have not come to pass or have not yielded huge savings.
So for the fiscal year that starts July 1, with her full 30 percent tax cut in place, Mrs. Whitman is telling New Jersey for the first time that it must make ends meet the old-fashioned way: by deep spending cuts. To balance her $16 billion budget, the Governor has recommended more than half a billion dollars in program cuts. Almost 1,220 state jobs would be eliminated, 814 through layoffs and 406 through attrition.
The Departments of Environmental Protection and Human Services face the biggest cuts. But few state agencies and programs are spared, except perhaps for the Department of Law and Public Safety, where money was added to help enforce "Megan's Law" and pay for new juvenile justice programs.
Many of the proposed cuts can certainly be defended in tough fiscal times. Since there is no longer a shortage of nurses, Mrs. Whitman is seeking to eliminate the state's $534,000 nursing scholarship program, along with $316,000 in subsidies to nursing schools. The administration is also seeking private backers for the Garden State Games, to replace $150,000 in tax money for the statewide amateur athletic competitions.
But other cuts could cost money in the long run. The Governor has proposed eliminating money for a 44-year-old program that rewards state employees for money-saving suggestions. Right now, it costs $100,000 a year to run the program out of the State Department of Personnel, which pays for one staff member and bonuses ranging from $25 to $10,000. Last year, the program generated 79 ideas; carrying out just 16 of them saved the taxpayers $15.8 million.
While the Governor's agenda has dominated the debate since she introduced her budget proposal in January, others get a chance to put in their two cents' worth, so to speak. The Legislature began hearings late last month, scheduling session after session to hear the concerns of the public, lobbyists, and Cabinet officials.
Mrs. Whitman has told legislators that they can restore whatever cuts they want, as long as the budget balances in the end.
BUT assuming -- just assuming -- the Governor got everything she wanted, here's a look at how the budget would affect you:
* If you're 65 or over, a $26 million cut in the state's prescription subsidy plan could mean higher copayments and possibly the removal of 30,000 participants who have assets totaling $50,000, excluding their residence and automobiles.
* If you're a student enrolled in the state's colleges or universities, you are likely to face a tuition increase. Although Mrs. Whitman recommends keeping state contributions flat at $773 million for colleges and universities, she is proposing that colleges pay for salary increases negotiated this year, so some administrators are looking at raising tuition to make up the difference. At the same time, the Governor recommends $23.1 million more in scholarship grants, which will allow the state to increase the number of awards from 52,500 this year to 55,160 next year.
* If you own a business, the Whitman administration wants to cut some of your taxes. The decline in the corporation tax from 9 percent to 7.5 percent would make New Jersey more competitive with neighboring states. New spending was also included for two new programs at the Department of Commerce to create and retain jobs and to provide financing to small businesses in urban areas.
* If you farm, you might be concerned about the $100,000 cut to the Agriculture Department's "Jersey Fresh" promotion budget and a $2.9 million reduction in state grants to help farmers buy equipment and improve marketing or production methods.
* If you qualify for welfare, the administration is seeking to impose a five-year limit on benefits and end most long-term training and educational programs. But to encourage welfare recipients to find work, the Governor would allow them to keep more of their income. The administration is also considering changes in state-subsidized day care that could disqualify working parents who earn more more than $22,000 a year.
* f you're among the 13 million people who visited one of the state's 28 parks, 57 historical sites or 42 natural areas last year, you may want to call ahead before your next trip. A proposed $800,000 budget cut is expected to reduce hours throughout the park system and close many historical sites all but two or three days a week.
* If you're a commuter, you might find fewer potholes now that Mrs. Whitman has agreed to distribute $25 million to fix roads damaged by the harsh winter. The number of miles maintained on state highways will increase by 38 from 10,609 to 10,647, but the number of county bridge inspections will decline from 1,550 to 850. The number of buses operated by New Jersey Transit is expected to remain the same, while the number of railroad passenger cars will increase from 692 to 787.
* If you're worried about the environment, you may not be reassured by the administration's contention that the elimination of 305 jobs and a budget cut of $17.6 million will not affect its ability to monitor the environment. This includes a $3 million cut in the budget of the commission that is overseeing the cleanup of 6,000 known hazardous waste sites in the state.
* If you're a state employee, chances are you will be paying more for health benefits. Unionized employees will see their wages frozen next year as part of a new contract negotiated by the administration (they will get a $250 bonus in the next few weeks). All this assumes, of course, that you are not one of the 814 people whose jobs will be eliminated. If you are, you'll find that the state is no longer offering placement services for laid-off workers.
* If you're a parent with a child in public school, the school may get a new computer because of a $10 million technology grant tobe distributed statewide. But the school subsidy program at the Liberty Science Center has been eliminated, and a $3.2 million cut is proposed for the Goodstarts program designed to improve the school performance of low-income children from pre-kindergarten to the early primary years.
Almost half of the state's more than 600 school districts would see declines in overall aid, forcing 293 districts to propose tax increases or program cuts.
* If you're a mayor, you probably have dreams (nightmares?) about property taxes. Mrs. Whitman has proposed that municipal aid remain flat this year, but she did not make up the difference to cover a drop in the gross receipts tax that will cost municipalities $40 million this year. There are also several proposed cuts in state agencies that would affect property taxes. For example, the administration is seeking a cut of $2.8 million that would end toxicology testing and forensic services, forcing some county medical examiner offices to pick up the tab.
However, the administration says counties could be passing on some savings to taxpayers because the state has assumed much of the cost of running the court system. Mrs. Whitman also points out that municipalities have some new cost-control tools, like binding arbitration, that give them more leverage when negotiating police and firefighter contracts.
"We have not seen an increase in property taxes because of a decrease in the income tax," said Harriet E. Derman, the Commissioner for Community Affairs, who is about to become the Governor's chief counsel. "The numbers just don't support that. The increase last year was 4 percent, which is the second-lowest increase in 20 years. So far, all indications are good that the municipalities are coming in fairly low again this year. The mayors and council members are doing a good job."
But Democrats contend that the full impact of the tax cut will ultimately force such big cuts in the state budget that property taxpayers will be forced to make up the difference.
State Senator James E. McGreevey, a Democrat who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge in Middlesex County, said state aid for his township would decline by 6 percent under the Governor's proposed budget, from $30.2 million last year to a proposed $28.4 million this year.
"Mayors are last on the food chain, and this year the Whitman administration has put us even farther down the line than usual," Mr. McGreevey said. "The Governor's aid reductions to local government will again result in a cost shift to municipalities property tax burdens."
Lawmakers have already made noises that some proposed cuts would be restored before a final budget is approved before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.
Within hours after learning of the proposed restrictions in the the prescription program for the elderly, legislators hinted that they would never go along with the idea. The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Robert E. Littell, a Republican from Sussex, told parents and students at the A. Harry Moore School, a school for the handicapped in Jersey City, not to worry about a $750,000 cut proposed in Mrs. Whitman's budget. Legislative leaders have also said that $265,000 cut the state Agricultural Museum is likely to be restored.
"I can tell you that every dollar in the budget has a constituency and we always make changes," Mr. Littell said. "It is not easy. There will be some cuts that will be restored. But we will more than likely have to make some cuts in other areas in order to make up what we want to add back."
THE Legislature relies heavily on the Office of Legislative Services, a nonpartisan research staff, to offer analysis. The office issues budget reports on each state agency, along with revenue estimates. This year, the Office of Legislative Services has said Mrs. Whitman may be relying on overly optimistic revenue projections that could lead to a $249 budget gap for the new fiscal year.
But State Treasurer Brian W. Clymer, who had already revised the state's revenue collections downward in January for this fiscal year, described the state's revenue targets as "prudent, responsible and achievable."
Mrs. Whitman's fellow Republicans, in control of both the Assembly and the Senate, didn't raise too many questions about the difference. They have also been relatively easy on members of the Whitman Cabinet who began appearing this month before budget committees to explain budget cuts.
And even the Democrats, who pounced on the discrepancy in the revenue estimates at the budget hearing, have not had much success poking holes in the administration plan, even with the help of advocates worried about the fate of the programs closest to their hearts.
State Senator Bernard F. Kenny, Democrat of Hoboken, whose questions have been among the most pointed, says Mrs. Whitman, for the first time since taking office, is being forced to defend her policies rather than talk about tax cuts alone.
"The political gain from the tax cuts has been exhausted," Mr. Kenny said. "The pain is starting to be reflected in this budget. The Governor is cutting government, which is something I don't think that she was anxious to do. I think that she was trying to say that you can have it both ways. but you can't significantly cut a broad-based tax the way that she did and not expect that there are not going to be consequences on the social side, the governmental side and on the policy side.."
Outside Trenton, the budget debate is being closely watched by the major bond rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, whose analyses determine how much interest New Jersey pays when it goes to Wall Street to borrow money, mostly for capital projects.
Although Mr. Clymer, the State Treasurer, has built a healthy surplus into the budget, outside analysts have raised concerns about several potential problems that could knock the budget out of balance.
There is the state's charity care program, which distributed $400 million to hospitals last year. The state's authority to continue diverting money from the state unemployment fund to pay for charity care expired on Dec. 31, and the Whitman administration and the Legislature have not yet come up with a new financing plan.
Then there's the New Jersey Supreme Court decision requiring the state to come up with $450 million to close the gap between the wealthiest and poorest school districts. The state contends that it has already made a "good faith" payment of $186 million, but lawyers for the poorer districts say that is not enough. Mrs. Whitman has tried to shift the debate away from giving more money to the poorer districts to coming up with new statewide curriculum standards that have not yet been adopted and that have not yet had a price tag placed on them.
Another problem was the the seven-month impasse between Congress and President Clinton on a new Federal budget. Late last week, the Whitman administration was just beginning to sort out how much aid it would be getting from Washington.
Whatever happens to the New Jersey budget, it will almost certainly be not be seven months late. In fact, seven months from now Mrs. Whitman will be preparing to present a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 1997.
 
Potholes and Detours on the Road to a Budget
Figuring out a budget is hard. Just ask President Clinton and Congress. Or ask the New York legislature, which has failed to pass a budget on time for the last 12 years.
New Jersey tends to make its deadline -- which is the start of the new fiscal year on July 1. But it's rarely easy. Here's are examples of some of the obstacles on the road to approval of the $15.98 billion spending plan that Mrs. Whitman outlined in January.:
NO. 1
Both major bond rating agencies, St'ndard and Poor's and Moody's Investment Service, raise several questions about the Whitman plan, including a proposal to help balance the budget by using $250 million in surplus money from a fund that aids temporarily disabled workers.
NO. 2
The Senate President persuades the Governor to restore the property tax deduction on state income tax forms. This will cost the state $176 million that is not included in the Governor's budget.
NO. 3
Older voters start letting legislators know they are upset about the Governor's proposal to cut a prescription plan for the elderly. If legislators listen, this could punch a $26 million hole in the budget.
 NO. 4
The Governor releases her 400-page budget book, providing enough nitty-gritty details to send an army of advocates marching toward Trenton. There's no money for group homes for the developmentally disabled. A state lab that tested water in Toms River must be closed. Hours will be sharply cut at Grover Cleveland's birthplace in West Caldwell. And what happened to the money for the Monmouth Boys and Girls Club?
NO. 5
State and federal data show a loss of 26,500 jobs in January. Is this a sign of an long-term economic downtown that will hurt tax receipts? Or is just a blip, something else to blame on the bad winter weather?
NO. 6
Who is going to pay for 'ospital care for the uninsured? There's no money in the budget. Business and labor balk at continuing to divert money -- $1.6 billion last year -- from an unemployment insurance fund. The hospitals are getting ready to sue. Whatever happened to that idea to increase the cigarette tax? Did somebody mention Jim Florio's name?
NO. 7
A newspaper article says budget cuts mean that 200 blind children won't be able to go to camp this summer. A Republic senator who prides himself on cutting state spending vows to help restore the money.
NO. 8
Congress and President Clinton are still arguing about the federal budget. Last year New Jersey got $4.5 billion; some Washington watchers say tha state will be lucky to get $3.5 billion this year.
NO. 9
The Supreme Court says the state has to find the money to insure parity among poor and wealthy school districts. The Whitman administration insists it's just a matter of moving money around. Nobody else in Trenton seems to want to talk about it.
In June, the real wrangling, and late-night negotiating sessions begin. Some of the programs will survive the chopping block, others will not.
The bottom line is that the state must have a new -- and balanced -- budget when the next fiscal year begins July 1.
