HEADLINE: 6.9% Rise in Home Starts Despite Rate Increases

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The most interest-sensitive part of the American economy -- the housing market -- seems almost impervious to this year's sharp rise in the cost of mortgages.
Confounding forecasters, builders stepped up groundbreaking on new homes by 6.9 percent in November to an annual pace of 1.54 million, the Commerce Department reported today. This was the biggest advance since March and the most rapid rate for residential construction in nearly a year. 
 "The housing sector is just not showing signs of slowing," said David Lereah, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "I think you've got some raised eyebrows at the Federal Reserve."
Despite today's figures, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates at its policy meeting on Tuesday, waiting instead to act until the next scheduled meeting, a two-day session starting Jan. 31, economists said. The Fed, the nation's central bank, has been trying since February to slow the pace of economic growth and keep inflation from accelerating by raising short-term interest rates six times. Most economists expect further rate increases.
The bond market took today's news in stride, apparently interpreting the strong housing starts figures as having been significantly swollen by exceptionally mild weather last month. And analysts noted that the report showed a decline in permits issued for future construction, which suggested a possible slowdown ahead. Bond prices rose today, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to 7.85 percent.
The gains were highly concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, where prolonged good weather has the biggest impact.
Still, analysts were impressed by housing's strong performance in the face of a jump in conventional mortgage rates to above 9 percent, more than two percentage points higher than at the beginning of the year. Starts for the second and third quarters were both higher than in the preceding quarters, and the first two months of the fourth quarter showed yet another advance.
But while the total number of units seems little affected, analysts say higher interest rates have caused a change in their composition. People who can no longer afford to buy homes are generating fresh demand for apartments and other multi-unit dwellings, on which construction soared 19.9 percent last month. Mr. Lereah estimates that this year's rate rises have priced about 240,000 first-time buyers out of the market.
Another factor, said Edward Guay, chief economist for Cigna Investment Management in Hartford, was a scramble to finish developments on which work had been suspended and then resumed last year when interest rates dropped sharply. The idea is to complete these projects, which involve heavy preliminary investment, in time for the spring buying season.
Starts of single-family homes climbed 3.7 percent, to a pace of 1,196,000 in November, today's report also showed. This was 4.2 percent less than in November 1993.
"Single-family starts remain in a flat trend," said Edward E. Yardeni, an economist with C. J. Lawrence/ Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, adding that the latest survey of builders' estimates of the number of potential home buyers points to weakness in coming months. About 51 percent of members of the National Association of Home Builders reported "low to very low" customer traffic this month, compared with about 21 percent in April. Members reporting "high to very high" traffic plunged to 9.4 percent, the lowest reading in four years.
Some analysts found another harbinger of a slowdown in November's 1 percent decline in permits issued for future construction, which eased to an annual pace of 1,384,000 -- up about 6 percent in the Northeast, down that amount in the West and unchanged in the Midwest and South.
For starts, the Northeast posted the biggest gain, 26.8 percent, though its pace of 161,000 units is less than half that of any other region. The Midwest had a 25 percent November spurt while the South was ahead 1.9 percent and the West was 6.4 percent lower.
Last month's advance, which was the biggest since a 14.4 percent jump in March, followed a 4.6 percent October decline that had been the first setback in four months. Starts for both September and October were revised modestly higher today.

HEADLINE: $76 Million to Settle Treasury Note Charges

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Two prominent private investment firms agreed yesterday to pay $76 million to settle charges that they had cornered the market in an issue of two-year Treasury notes in 1991, making millions for their investors in the process.
Steinhardt Management Inc. agreed to pay $40 million and the Caxton Corporation, $36 million, to settle antitrust and securities-law violations in an agreement with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither firm admitted wrongdoing, but both agreed to hire independent consultants to monitor their compliance with the rules governing the trade of Treasury securities. In addition, for the next 10 years they must provide the S.E.C. with information about their positions in Treasury securities on demand. 
 "This case stands for the proposition that parties cannot engage in fraud and manipulation in the market for U.S. Treasury securities," William McLucas, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, said in Washington yesterday.
According to the terms of the settlement, Steinhardt Management will pay $19 million in fines to the Government and $21 million to a fund that will compensate investors who lost money as a result of the alleged manipulation. Caxton will pay $22 million in fines and $14 million to the compensation fund.
The $35 million in compensation represents the excess profits the two firms made as a result of their manipulation, the Government said.
"Our strategy in the spring of 1991 was to concentrate our investments in two-year Treasury notes because we anticipated that the Fed would lower short-term interest rates," said Michael Steinhardt, the principal in the firm bearing his name, in a statement. "That strategy was reflected in a concentrated holding of two-year notes, including the April two-year notes, and was immensely successful for our investors."
But the Government charged that Steinhardt and Caxton, which is run by Bruce Kovner, a close associate of Mr. Steinhardt, together acquired as much as 158 percent of the April 1991 auction of $12 billion worth of two-year notes. The two firms were able to amass more than 100 percent of the issue by buying notes from short-sellers, investors who borrow securities and sell them, with the intention of replacing them at a cheaper price later.
The Government said that act created a so-called short squeeze, which forced the investors who had sold borrowed notes to pay higher prices to cover their positions.
A second such short-squeeze occurred the following month, leading to charges against Salomon Inc. that ultimately led to the resignation of John H. Gutfreund, the company's chairman, and several other top executives.
In 1992, Salomon agreed to pay $290 million in fines and compensation as part of a settlement with the Justice Department and the S.E.C. related to the May 1991 auction. Earlier this year, Salomon, Caxton and Steinhardt agreed to pay $100 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by holders of the April and May notes.
Yesterday's settlement removes a cloud that had been hanging over both Caxton and Steinhardt for years. Mr. Steinhardt in particular had been dogged by the pending action, which added additional financial uncertainty in a year when his funds have performed miserably.
One of Wall Street's most successful investors, Mr. Steinhardt has posted an average annual return of 27.2 percent since he first started his company 27 years ago. But after interest rates began rising earlier this year, the $4.5 million that Mr. Steinhardt had under management shrank to just over $3 billion.
The large losses and his continuing legal problems led Mr. Steinhardt to consider retiring earlier this year, according to a letter sent to investors last month. But in the letter, he said that he had decided to continue to manage the firm's funds in 1995.
Mr. Steinhardt wrote that he had considered waiving the firm's 20 percent cut of the profits from the funds until he earned back what his investors had lost this year. But he said that he decided not to because he was bearing the legal and settlement costs related to the Treasury scandal.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading of Dollar Is Light Before Interest Rate Review

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against most leading currencies yesterday, with many traders unwilling to buy or sell the currency ahead of a key meeting of the Federal Reserve next week.
"There is not a whole lot of incentive to do anything," said Amy Smith, an analyst with the consulting firm of IDEA. 
 In other currency trading, the Canadian dollar fell to an eight-month low.
While few expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets on Tuesday, dealers said yesterday that the market was keeping a close watch nonetheless
"There is always a chance that the Federal Reserve could surprise," said Anne Pankowski, vice president at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. "The last time they had a meeting they surprised the market with the magnitude of their rate hike. So, there is the chance that the Fed may surprise again."
When the Federal Reserve raised rates by three-quarters of a percentage point after its Nov. 15 meeting, the move touched off a monthlong rally in the dollar. Higher rates help support the value of the dollar because they attract investors by raising the rate of return on investments denominated in the currency.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.5737 German marks from 1.5710 marks on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 100.25 Japanese yen, from 100.37 yen on Thursday.
In other currency trading, the Bank of Canada intervened in the foreign-exchange market and bought Canadian dollars for United States dollars. The Canadian dollar had weakened after the Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Quebec's debt rating.
"It fueled some speculation that one of the major American rating agencies may now downgrade Quebec's debt, too," said Curtis Perkins, foreign exchange trader at Chemical Bank.
Dealers said that foreign investors might become wary about purchasing Quebec's fixed-income securities and thus put further pressure on the currency.
In New York, the Canadian dollar fell to 71.85 United States cents, from 72.07 United States cents on Thursday, its lowest level since April 4.
The dollar rose to 1.3322 Swiss francs, from 1.3270 francs on Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.5603 from $1.5620.

HEADLINE: Teaching Children Respect for Wildlife

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While most Americans are concerned about budget cuts and a failing economy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars into a National Shooting Sports Foundation program to turn unsuspecting children into sport hunters, according to Bob Herbert ("Reading, Writing, Reloading," column, Dec. 14). 
 Children have a natural affinity toward animals, yet the gun lobby -- along with state and Federal wildlife agencies -- wants to brainwash youngsters into believing that animals are nothing more than moving targets. The number of hunters decreases each year, and killing animals for recreation will eventually die out if hunting organizations and apologists do not interfere with social evolution.
We should teach children respect and compassion for wildlife, not teach them that violence is an acceptable and laudable form of entertainment. The very last thing responsible parents want to see is a gun in their child's hands, whether it be on a city street or in a state park.

HEADLINE: Bad Examples Abroad

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Fleeing Bosnia, Blocked by America" (Op-Ed, Dec. 9), Julie Mertus writes: "The Embassy's counselor for refugee affairs, Caryl Courtney, told me that the immigration officer hoped to make the trip this fiscal year, but added that 'there may not be enough money in the budget -- the per diem adds up.' " 
 I'll bet it does. United States Government personnel travel on expense budgets completely out of line with living standards in the countries they visit. While I was doing administrative work for the Agency for International Development in Budapest a year ago, I learned that the per diem for officials visiting Budapest was close to $200.
That amount is two-thirds of an average Hungarian's monthly salary (closer to half of the salaries of Hungarians employed by the agency), and is more than half the monthly rent that I paid for a furnished, one-bedroom downtown apartment.
In Budapest, the outrageous standards at which diplomats were living was merely embarrassing. Hearing that a diplomat's comfort is more important than the lives of 32 refugees, however, is offensive -- and presents a nasty picture of American priorities.

HEADLINE: Trying a Jump-Start at Hoffritz

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
After months on the brink of collapse, Hoffritz, an old name in specialty retailing, has been given a reprieve.
It remains to be seen if the company that was forced into bankruptcy proceedings last August really has much of a future, but a group of investors injected up to $500,000 into the company last week, providing Hoffritz's few remaining stores with some much-needed merchandise and maybe a full-fledged second chance. 
 "This is a new business that is walking, not running," said Joel J. Silver, who along with his brother, Leonard, bought Hoffritz in 1975. "We have been given the opportunity to restart an idea that began back in the 1930's."
That Mr. Silver has been given another chance may have more to do with the Hoffritz name than anything else, a name that dates to 1932 and has long been associated with high-quality pocket and kitchen knives. It has survived despite what suppliers and competitors say were flawed expansion plans and overly generous salaries and bonuses that the Silvers paid themselves.
"In the minds of many New Yorkers, Hoffritz was the first place people thought of when they wanted to buy a pocket knife," said James Kennedy, co-chairman and chief executive of the Forschner Group of Shelton, Conn., which supplied Hoffritz with Swiss Army knives from the early 1940's until early last year.
"The Silvers took a business risk when they expanded so rapidly, and it didn't work out."
Last August, after months of unpaid bills and an ill-fated attempt to raise money through a public stock offering, Hoffritz was forced into bankruptcy court proceedings by three of its biggest suppliers. Separate discussions were held later with a group of suppliers and a competitor about taking over the business. Both efforts failed.
Starved of inventory, the Silvers had no choice but to rapidly dismantle what only three years earlier had been a sprawling retail enterprise, with 110 stores in 33 states and annual sales of nearly $50 million.
Early this month, only five stores, all in the New York metropolitan area, remained open. In Manhattan, the stores at 43d Street and Madison Avenue, and on 57th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, were shuttered. In Grand Central Terminal and the World Trade Center, sites of the two remaining stores in the city, what was left in inventory was being sold at half-price.
But now, new money has changed that.
Last Monday, the leases of the remaining Hoffritz stores were assigned to a new company, International Cutlery Ltd. Joel Silver will oversee the business. Leonard Silver, a longtime retailing executive, is retiring.
New knives, manicure sets and scissors flowed back into the stores this week. For the time being, the "50 percent off" signs are gone.
At the Grand Central store, display windows, dark for months, not only have a festive spray of Christmas tinsel and some goods, but also a sign of revival saying, "We are restocking with new merchandise for your holiday needs."
Even though Hoffritz is now a snip of its former self, with much lower costs, many suppliers have been returning only if they get paid up front.
Precise International, an importer in Orangeburg, N.Y., that shares the Swiss Army knife franchise in the United States with the Forschner Group, said it had resumed shipments to Hoffritz on a pay-as-you-go basis even though the Silvers still owed the company more than $300,000.
"This is an old-line company that has had a lot of difficulty," said Tom Higgins, president of Precise. "But it seems as though there is some possibility for them to maintain it, and we made a business decision to ship to them on a prepaid basis. The names of Hoffritz and Swiss Army knives are synonymous, so if we had decided not to ship to them, they would die."
Hoffritz's troubles worsened after a plan to raise more than $7 million through an initial public offering of stock was cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but was rejected by both Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange.
"If the public offering had worked, they probably would have been successful," said Lou Kindleberger, a vice president at Frost Cutlery, a supplier in Chattanooga, Tenn., that was one of the companies that pushed Hoffritz into bankruptcy.
Mr. Kindleberger might have been right, but the story told in the company's offering prospectus was not one that would probably attract many investors.
After they bought Hoffritz from Federals Inc. through a leveraged buyout in 1975, the Silvers set about expanding the business, and by 1990 had 81 stores across the country, up from 22 when they bought it.
But business began to sour in the late 1980's, the Silvers said. The stock market crash in 1987, and the subsequent deterioration in New York's economy, hurt business in their home market. "We started losing money in 1989 and 1990, and could have gone into Chapter 11," Joel Silver said in an interview. "We made a concerted effort not to do that."
Instead, they pursued a strategy that in hindsight was even more disastrous: they expanded further.
In the fall of 1990, the Silvers bought the assets of Cutlery World of America Inc., a bankrupt retailer that had 95 stores, mostly in California and Florida shopping malls.
Initially, the Silvers intended to close 20 stores, and were confident that they could turn the others around.
Closing the stores was easy. But disposing of more than $5 million in Cutlery World's inventory was not. In fact, it took three years.
All the while, revenues declined and losses mounted. By last April, Hoffritz had accumulated a $12.3 million loss, according to the documents from the stock offering.
As losses mounted, so did delinquent payments. Although stores were being closed to cut costs, debts owed to suppliers had risen to nearly $2 million by last June. Landlords were owed $858,900 in back rent.
The Silvers, however, continued to pay themselves well. In 1992, when the company lost $2.6 million on sales of $18.4 million, Joel Silver, a lawyer who was an official in the New York City Housing Development Administration from 1970 to 1972, received $387,000 in salary and bonus, and $60,000 in legal fees from the company. His brother was paid more than $413,000 in salary and bonus.
Both men took substantial pay cuts in 1993; each received a base salary of $200,000 and no bonus. But by then, critics say, the damage was done.
"I think too much money has been taken out of that company for it to survive," said David Hall, co-owner of United Cutlery of Chattanooga, another of the suppliers that forced Hoffritz into bankruptcy. "The company was in dire need, but the executives were taking too much in terms of their salaries and the like."
Joel Silver said the criticism was unjustified.
"I beg to differ with them as to what we could have taken," he said. "We took significantly less than we agreed with our lenders to take. And we could have taken far more in the 1970's and 1980's, when times were good."
To keep themselves afloat, in 1992 and 1993 the Silvers arranged a series of private debt and equity placements, and sold the Hoffritz name and trademarks.
With the new infusion of capital and inventory, Mr. Silver says he is confident the remaining stores will be profitable "from day one." Others are not so sure.
"I don't see how it's viable," Mr. Higgins of Precise said. "But we wish him luck, and hope they can do something."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 20, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the financial problems of Hoffritz, a specialty retailer of knives, referred incorrectly to the company's plan for an initial public offering of stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken no action on it; it has not been approved.

HEADLINE: WORD & IMAGE;
O.K., Call It War

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
I USED TO HATE hearing about the "war" against drugs, and as executive editor tried to discourage that metaphor in The Times. But the politicians won the battle of the cliche even as they were losing the war. The "war" term appeared in this newspaper only 16 times in all of 1981, but 66 times in 1987 and 511 times in 1989, after President Bush promised at his inaugural, "Take my word for it, this scourge will stop." Well, it didn't, and we're down to about 100 mentions in each of the Clinton years, a mere twice a week. And now I'm sorry, for it's time the media began to cover the war on drugs as a war -- the way they covered the last war that America lost.
The better newspapers are portraying the drug quagmire the way they once portrayed the quagmire in Vietnam. Dispatches from the front find cops risking life and limb to drag in users and dealers, but just as many stalk the streets the next night. The brass that's bragging about progress and calling for still more troops, weapons, prisons and money must be smoking something. 
 If the newspapers, magazines and TV networks would agree that there's a war on, maybe they would report a monthly "bag count" -- the number of kilo-size packs of cocaine or heroin seized by Federal, state and local raiders in urban hideaways, remote marinas and canine stomachs. They could point out that the bag count, much like the Vietnam body count, is a meaningless index of progress in the war; no matter how impressive the seizures, the flow of bags in the underground drug channels continues relentlessly.
The press has been too generous with pictures of prosecutors and politicians posing with the mounds of heroin and cocaine they've stumbled across somewhere. If more of the media would open drug-war bureaus in the inner cities, their bravest reporters would find that there's no shortage anytime, no increase at all in the street price of drugs, just constant pressure by a guerrilla army of street pushers supporting their own drug habit by enlarging the circle of customers. The reporters would document the cost and futility of the pursuit, the cynicism and corruption of the pursuers and the serene confidence of a wealthy enemy.
GRADUALLY, MAYBE through C-Span "teach-ins" run by such radicals as former Secretary of State George Shultz, Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore and William F. Buckley Jr., the commercial networks might learn that the war on drugs -- meaning the prohibition of drugs -- is not only being lost but is also unwinnable. The radicals have adopted the antiwar slogan of "legalization," but the TV anchors don't have to embrace that still-undefined remedy. They need only climb to the rooftops of Washington Heights in New York and cruise down along the Potomac Delta while reciting the terrifying findings of their research staffs: the direct, recognizable cost of this war is probably running in excess of $100 billion a year. There's not even a good estimate of the cost of the related crimes committed by drug peddlers and users, and of the measures taken to prevent such crimes, to compensate the victims and to punish some of the perpetrators. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being stashed in offshore sanctuaries and hundreds of millions more are available to import the stuff and to pave the way with bribes and untaxed wages. *
Of the 20 million American drug users, maybe 5 million are "seriously" addicted. A year's supply of heroin for all of them can be made from opium poppies grown on only 20 square miles of land -- not quite the area of Manhattan. A year's supply of coke can be stashed in 13 truck trailers. So "eradicating" the supply abroad is impossible; "interdicting" drugs at the border is a joke.
About 40,000 Americans die each year of the direct and indirect effects of drugs; a large proportion of New York City's 2,000 annual homicides are attributable to drug trafficking. And drug offenders, whether or not they are violent criminals, clog the courts and prisons.
When finally one of the TV anchors senses that the country is ready to hear unvarnished truth, like Walter Cronkite's passionate declaration in 1968 that it was time to get out of Vietnam, she won't have to bother with statistics. Against a backdrop of gripping graphics, she could simply list the war's consequences:
 
* Urban blight, fear and destruction.
* Neighborhood turf wars and shootouts.
* Family ruin, school failure and wreckage.
* Lost productivity in the economy.
* Crack babies, kids dealing drugs, addicts felled by AIDS.
* Cops corrupted. Courts and prisons overwhelmed.
* Murder and mayhem clear to the top in Mexico, Colom
 
* Most of the statistics in this column are taken from "The Making of a Drug-Free America" by Mathea Falco and "A Wiser Course: Ending Drug Prohibition, a Report of the Special Committee on Drugs and the Law of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York."
bia and other countries that cannot resist supplying the rich American market. And in America, contempt for government -- and despair.
IF THE PROHIBITION OF drugs is a lost cause then "legalization" -- in some form -- is inevitable. But the word "legalization" has been demonized, like "negotiation" before Henry Kissinger sat down with the Vietcong in Paris. A year ago, Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was pilloried -- and disowned by her President -- for recommending "some studies" of how drugs might be legalized and regulated. Most Americans still think legalization would constitute "surrender" to immorality. Some call it "genocide" because they imagine ghetto children lining up at the corner drugstore for their daily fix.
Not until we in the media do a better job of reporting the horrendous costs of this unwinnable war will the public consider alternative policies. By definition, legalizing drugs would put the big dealers and their gun-toting distributors out of business. It would also keep most users from having to steal to support the habit. That alone would liberate a great deal of money and energy for reclaiming wrecked lives and neighborhoods.
Like the Surgeon General, I don't pretend to know how a legal drug trade might be managed. Maybe drugs should be sold inexpensively to adults through Government outlets, like the ABC liquor stores that many states opened after Prohibition. Maybe drugs should be given away at neighborhood dispensaries that also offer treatment to cure addiction. Maybe dozens of experiments are in order.
By all means, let's call it "war." Then deal with defeat.

HEADLINE: PASSING THE SCOOP;
BEN & JERRY

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus is a contributing writer to this magazine.

 BODY:
BEN AND JERRY ARE HAPPY AS clams, even though for much of the past year or so they have been getting a lot of dubious press. Many of the news stories pounced on the announcement in June that Ben Cohen was stepping down as chief executive of Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., which takes in $150 million a year selling such diet-busters as Coconut Almond Fudge Chip and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream. In fact, Cohen and his partner, Jerry Greenfield, were looking for a chief executive officer to "help the company realize its next stage of growth and financial strength." Was this, reporters wanted to know, a prelude to Ben and Jerry's leaving the company they founded in 1978?
Other stories took the company to task for including artificial ingredients in some of its "all-natural" flavors; for a high injury rate among employees; for making many stockholders anxious with a sharp fall in share prices and other stockholders unhappy by dropping its official policy of having the highest-salaried jobs at the company paying no more than seven times the lowest-paid ones. 
 "When we began," Cohen explains, "there were all those stories about 'Look what good they've done.' That stopped being news. So the new story is 'Look what bad they've done.' "
As leaders of a socially responsible business movement -- a loose coalition of companies that includes the Body Shop, Patagonia and Esprit -- Cohen and Greenfield have funneled part of their profits into organizations concerned about children's rights, the homeless and the environment. In many ways, Ben and Jerry, ex-hippies, invented a business that institutionalizes the ideas and values of the 1960's.
Born on Long Island within days of each other in March 1951, they have been best friends since junior high school. Jerry is the quiet, thoughtful one. Ben has more bombast. Jerry is married and has a 7-year-old son. Ben is divorced, with a 4-year-old daughter. Both love to eat. The interview at company headquarters in Waterbury, Vt., begins when Ben goes to a huge freezer near his office, produces three containers of what he calls "product" and three spoons. "This is an old 60's ritual," he says, laughing. "Pass the pint."

Q: O.K., guys, why have you spent the past six months looking for a new C.E.O.? Are you giving up your baby?
JERRY: We're not giving up the baby. But this is necessary. We have 600 employees. We manufacture ice cream on two shifts and on three different sites, and the level of complexity is such that it requires organizational, operational and management expertise that goes beyond what Ben and I can offer. In terms of creating an evolving vision for the company, instilling values, pushing the boundaries of what our company can do, Ben and I have an incredible amount to offer. In terms of day-to-day management, we are lost.

Q: Mel Brooks once said, "It's good to be the king." Will it be hard to not be king?
JERRY: I haven't been king for a long time. I've been more chief of staff. We're not leaving the company, though when Ben announced in June that he was stepping aside as C.E.O., the press played it as if we were leaving. It never entered our minds.
BEN: The job I'm looking to take on is being chairman of the board, which is the title I've always had. I'm looking to find out what a chairman of the board does.
JERRY: We want to institutionalize what we're doing so that if Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield get run over by a truck tomorrow, this company would still do the things on which it is based. In the new setup, I'll be vice chairman of the board. Ben and I expect to continue to work on new flavors, new products, long-term strategy, keeping in touch with customer desires and, for me personally, I'm interested in keeping closer relationships with our staff.

Q: In searching for your new C.E.O., you took ads inviting people to write essays on why they should be named C.E.O. of Ben & Jerry's. First prize in the contest is the job. Were you serious?
BEN: Definitely. The person we are looking for must have a strong commitment to progressive social values and experience running a company our size. There probably are only a handful of people that meet that description. So we wanted to make an open search. We had a professional headhunter looking, but we also found some candidates through the contest. In all, we've interviewed about 20 people for the job. We should announce our choice sometime after the new year.

Q: What kind of entries came to you through the contest?
JERRY: Incredible ones. Most were humorous. We had several resumes that came in written on icings of cakes.
BEN: Really good-tasting cakes.
JERRY: Excellent cakes. We got over 20,000 responses. I suspect a lot of people were aiming for second prize: a lifetime supply of ice cream.

Q: Your contest was a public relations hit. But there have been reports that your franchises feel neglected, that your employees have a high on-the-job injury rate.
BEN: Our accident rate is a lot higher than we want it to be. We want a much safer operation, and we're devoting a lot of effort to doing that. We stopped producing our brownie ice-cream sandwiches because our workers were getting repetitive stress injuries. In terms of our franchises, our company has put a lot of effort into helping them do a good job. But a franchise is like a parent-child relationship. The franchiser is the parent and the child doesn't like it that much. As the child moves into adolescence, the child thinks that the parent doesn't know anything. We will always have problems.

Q: Your company used to have a salary system where the highest-paid employee made no more than five times the lowest-paid one. It's been in the press that you've increased your own salaries.
JERRY: We went from a salary ratio of 5 to 1 to 7 to 1. The top salary moved from $100,000 a year to $150,000 year. Ben and I are not at the top salary within the company. The president of the company, Chuck Lacy, is. Ben and I earn $132,500. In order to get this new C.E.O., we are not going to restrict ourselves. I expect that we will be paying compensation at the low end of market rates for a C.E.O.

Q: How are you two guys different from each other?
BEN: As a manager, I'm fairly autocratic. I'm hard to please, not very communicative. People perceive me as intimidating. I tend to be more conceptual and Jerry tends to be more practical. I tend to be more independent and Jerry is better with people. I am not able to do routine things. Jerry is.
JERRY: Right. Ben is the creative one, the risk-taker. Ben has often told me that he would rather fail at something new than succeed at something that has already been done before. That's a shocking concept to me. Also, as a team, we have a good sense of the absurd. The most immediate absurdity is that our business was started by two non-business people and it has reached such an exalted status in the ice-cream world.

Q: As kids growing up in the wilds of Merrick, L.I., in the 1950's, what did you dream about becoming?
BEN: After a fireman, my dream was to be a modern-day Judah Maccabee. He seemed like a really good guy. He helped his people and he gave the world Hanukkah.
JERRY: I guess I wanted to become a doctor. It's what Jewish kids from Long Island who were good in science did. Ben and I were very uncool. We were fat nerds. I was in the math club. Ben played the cello.

Q: When you first met in a seventh-grade Merrick junior-high-school gym class, what drew you to each other?
JERRY: The fact we were both fat, unathletic and outside the social mainstream. The first time I saw Ben, the gym teacher was yelling at him. We had to run a mile in seven minutes or we had to do it all over again. So Ben was saying, "Gee, Coach, if I can't do it in under seven minutes the first time, how am I going to do it on the second try?" Ben likes arguing with authority figures. It was a revelation to me that anybody would do that. And it is still a revelation when Ben does certain things. In 1988, we received this Small Business Administration award from President Ronald Reagan. There was this White House dinner and we got to say a few words and Ben got up and made this speech about how we should take the money from the defense budget to meet basic human needs. It was shocking to me that he would have the gumption to attack government policies in front of those people.

Q: How did your ice-cream business start?
BEN: Around 1975 or so, I had decided to homestead -- buy a piece of land, grow food, do pottery. Pottery was to be the cash crop. In those days, people talked regularly about alternative life styles and looking for ways not to become part of the system. Problem was, I would take my ceramics to fairs and markets, set them up, sit with them all day and I'd bring every one of them home again.
JERRY: It was a bad time for us both. I had been rejected by 40 medical schools. We were clearly not succeeding in our chosen fields. So we started considering different ways to support ourselves. We wanted to live in a rural college town, do something where we could be together and that was fun. Since we love to eat, we immediately thought of food. Ice cream made sense, though we considered bagels, shish kebab, fondue. Ben & Jerry's scoop shop opened in Burlington, Vt., in 1978. Sixteen years later, Ben and I are as surprised as anyone that we're running a $150-million-a-year business, with 600 employees and 100-plus franchisees.

Q: Is it true the early success of your product stemmed from the fact that Ben, the official ice-cream taster, has a smelling problem?
BEN: I've never had a very good sense of smell, and if you don't have that, you don't have a good sense of taste. When we began, the game was for Jerry to make a flavor I could taste with my eyes closed. To do that, he had to make ice creams that were intensely flavored. Also: because of this disability, I have an excellent sense of mouth feel. Creaminess and crunchiness are very important to people who can't taste.
JERRY: This led to our putting bigger than standard chunks of fruit and candy into our ice creams. It turned out that people really liked these highly flavored, extra-chunky ice creams. We were offering them something unique.

Q: Is ice cream better than sex?
BEN:It depends on what you're in the mood for. If you really need some Cherry Garcia, then having some Cherry Garcia is going to do it for you more than sex will.
JERRY: We've just entered the British market, where Haagen-Dazs has an incredibly sexy ad campaign. Someone there wrote of us: "If Haagen-Dazs is the ice cream you have after sex, then Ben & Jerry's is the ice cream you have instead of sex."

Q: What is your assessment of your competitor?
JERRY: Within the super-premium ice-cream category, the two major players are Haagen-Dazs and us. Haagen-Dazs tries hard to project an elegant high-class European image, even though the product is made in New Jersey.
BEN: I think Haagen-Dazs is an excellent ice cream. It's smooth, rich, creamy. But smooth ice cream is not that difficult to produce. Making the crunchy sort is much harder.

Q: Have you had any flavor failures?
BEN: Fred and Ginger. That's ginger ice cream with chocolate chunk bow ties. Now I happen to think that Fred and Ginger is a great flavor. There are great flavors that are ahead of their time and don't sell that well.

Q: Did you ever met a flavor you didn't like?
JERRY: Bubble gum ice cream. Gumdrop ice cream.
BEN: Once, while in Florida, I had something called Smurf ice cream -- it was blue with white dots. This was for research. In our business, research can be difficult and hazardous.

Q: Of your own flavors, which do you consider the best?
BEN: For some odd reason, I can't get Cherry Garcia off my mind.

Q: It's sort of a frozen Black Forest cake, right?
BEN: Except that its base is vanilla. Don't think we haven't tried frozen chocolate. It didn't work because the chocolate overpowered the cherries. There are things that are good in cake and terrible in ice cream. My first concept of Cherry Garcia was to chocolate coat the cherries and throw them in. It was really difficult for me to get a supplier who would make chocolate-coated cherries. Once we finally did, we tried them in the ice cream and they were lousy. We tried different chocolate coatings, thickness, cherries and it was still lousy. So we separated the chocolate from the cherries, because it was cracking off in the machinery. Next, I wanted whole cherries, but they wouldn't go through the machinery. Finally, we agreed on a combination of whole and half cherries.

Q: How does Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead feel about being a flavor?
BEN: He's honored. It's a good flavor. Plus he gets his royalty. We've since gotten flavor suggestions that pay tribute to other 60's cultural heroes: the Almond Brothers, Mint Jagger.

Q: Speaking of the 60's, does your product have some of the qualities of recreational drugs?
BEN: In that it's really good and people like to eat it a lot and sometimes people can't help themselves, yes.

Q: Let's be honest about your yogurt. It's not nonfattening.
JERRY: It is very low-fat.

Q: What's the calorie count?
JERRY: I don't count calories. I count fat grams. If you look at Chocolate Fudge Brownie frozen yogurt or Cherry Garcia frozen yogurt, they are very low-fat.
BEN: Listen, it is a dessert. People need to eat stuff that makes them feel good and most everything, aside from rice and celery, is fattening. The bottom line is that our low-fat yogurt has 2 percent fat in it.

Q: Ben & Jerry's is considered a socially responsible business. Define that.
BEN: It's a business that cares about people, that seeks to use its power to improve the quality of life within society. It seeks profits and tries to integrate spiritual and social concerns into day-to-day activities. Typical businesses tend to do everything in terms of narrow self-interest. They want to maximize profitability and quality. We add a third factor: impact on the community, on the consumer, on our employees. We use suppliers like Greyston Bakers, which provides jobs for the previously unemployable. We buy our coffee from a rural cooperative in Mexico, helping to raise the standard of living there. We sell some of our ice cream through partner shops like Common Ground, which trains the previously unemployed. We give 7 1/2 percent of our pretax profits to our foundation, which, as far as we know, is the highest percentage of any publicly held company.

Q: A conservative economist like Milton Friedman might say that what you're doing is bad for business.
BEN: Milton Friedman's position is that the only justifiable action for business is to maximize profits. He thinks if the owners of the business desire to use their profits for social good, fine. Jerry and I believe that corporations are chartered by the society and that they are charged with operating for the public good. Corporations have tremendous power. If you're just going to give out these little bits of money to stockholders, then the power is going to be dissipated. I think Friedman negates all the other aspects of business that are not financial in nature. Like lobbying. Like contributing to elections. Putting politicians in power. They are doing that to maximize their profits at the expense of the welfare of the society.
JERRY: We think making a better world increases profits. If you have a world where there are a lot of riots and disparities, that's not a world where you can sell a lot of ice cream. If you have a world where people are nurtured and their basic human needs are met, you can sell more.

Q: Some would say you two display a touching innocence.
BEN: When we talk about our image, we think of childlike sophistication. "Let's have fun. Let's not be jaded. Let's try to run a business according to values that we learned as children."
JERRY: Here, if somebody says, "Let's look for our new C.E.O. by having a national essay contest where we offer the job as first prize," people say, "Cool, let's do it."

Q: You have ex-Black Panther Bobby Seale on your new advertising campaign. Does he sell ice cream?
BEN: Is he the guy on the poster who says, "Vanilla"? He says it very well.

Q: What were you trying to do with that campaign?
JERRY: Support activists, pay homage to them. We needed to tell consumers that Ben & Jerry's was now making ice cream without chunks in it. And the only way we could do that was through mainstream advertising, which is unusual for us. So, how could we use mainstream advertising to support our social values? The original concept behind the ad was to show these activist mouths next to a scoop of ice cream and ask people to guess whose mouths they were. But when we did tests, a lot of people couldn't guess the mouths of Daniel Berrigan, Pete Seeger and Dolores Huerta. Spike Lee, who directed and appeared in the commercial, said, "Look, if you're going to use these activists, you want to use them full face so that you help them gain recognition for their causes and what they are about."

Q: In many ways, your company has become one of the major custodians of the ideals and values of the 1960's. Do you find that ironic?
BEN: It humbles us. Who would have guessed that fat little old nerdy Ben and Jerry would be the keepers of the 1960's flame? Perhaps it's fitting for an ice-cream company to be the keepers of 60's values. Ice cream is fun. It's happy. The 60's were a wonderful time and the values of the 60's were serious and happy: peace, love, fairness, equality.

HEADLINE: Striving for That One Singular Sensation

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
"HELLO. THIS IS JAMIE. I can't answer the phone right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you as soon as I can! Thanks a lot! Bye."
The voice on the answering machine is resonant, that of someone ready for anything. It is the voice of a Broadway gypsy, a triple-threat performer who has learned to live in roller-coaster bursts of optimism and despair in a world that is becoming an anachronism. 
 Gypsies today must be more expert than ever at dancing, singing and acting. They must remain poised and self-confident despite continual rejection. And more than ever, they must be prepared not to work on Broadway, where they once trekked their way from musical to musical. Sometimes the casts were so big, there were separate choruses of singers and dancers. But today smallness is the watchword. While there were nearly 9.000 gypsy members in Actors Equity in New York City in 1994, only two major musicals opened on Broadway. One was "Show Boat"; the other was "Sunset Boulevard," and that was cast in Los Angeles.
All gypsies come from somewhere other than New York, or so it is supposed, hopping a bus from some dusty little place with a suitcase and a dream. Mr. MacKenzie grew up in Petoskey, a town in northern Michigan, but he came east to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and Dartmouth College, where he majored in government. He fell into theater at Dartmouth, learning as he participated. He came to Manhattan in 1990, at the age of 31, and he came with no conservatory or musical-theater training.
Today, he said, "hundreds and hundreds" of university theater graduates are coming to New York to try their luck. And the talent pool has been further enlarged after the Actors Equity union was forced to open auditions to a new category of members after a suit in 1988.
"Differences aside," Mr. MacKenzie said, "we're all sort of in a common fraternity: getting up early, standing in line and waiting, talking about casting directors and directors."
The last show in which Jamie MacKenzie performed closed in May. There have been nibbles and near-misses since then, but nothing else. In some ways Mr. MacKenzie is not a very typical gypsy; for one thing, he came to theater relatively late. But in other ways the tale of his travails is, in microcosm, the tale of all Broadway gypsies, struggling to maneuver in the shrunken Broadway of today.
Mr. MacKenzie did not seem especially interested in performing as a child, recalls his mother, Barbara MacKenzie. He sang in a church choir and participated in a few "little plays." But from a very early age he had all the aplomb of an entertainer. "He was very verbal," she said. "He talked to adults all the time. The neighbors loved to have him come over -- they called him The National Observer. He was kind of a studied 2-year-old."
Even at Dartmouth, Mr. MacKenzie did not seriously consider becoming a performer. With nearly everyone in his family a lawyer (his mother is a judge), he was expected to go to law school. "But in my senior year of college, I felt I wasn't doing it for myself."
In the end he accumulated enough credits for a degree in drama, "but I didn't want to frighten my parents," he said teasingly. He came home after graduation, in 1982, working at odd jobs, then studying acting in England. Boston drew him back a year later.
In Boston, where he learned word processing, a skill that has kept him solvent in lean times, something inside snapped. He had studied voice during college with a charismatic teacher named Atea Ring and developed a powerful second tenor. Now, he realized, he had to commit himself to acting lessons if he was to pursue a career in the theater. And so in 1985, with his parents' blessing and financial help, he enrolled in the intensive Shakespeare and Company Acting Workshop conducted at Wellesley College. It was, he said, an invaluable "boot camp for actors."
A college friend, Lori Glaser, attended the workshop, too, and remembers Mr. MacKenzie as "an amazing friend. At college we'd go swing-dancing at this little hotel with all these old couples. We'd take day trips to Boston, driving down to see a matinee, eating early, then getting on the road in time to make a 7 o'clock rehearsal."
Often they danced and sang together to Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney in Mr. MacKenzie's room at his fraternity house, the singing nearly obliterating the sounds of carousing frat brothers. "There was always something a little not mainstream about Jamie, which was what I loved about him," said Ms. Glaser, who is now a singer and actress in New York. "I hadn't thought of him as a risk taker. But I knew he would do well. He always had a phenomenal voice and was talented in so many ways."
Successful auditions for Boston theater and club acts followed Mr. MacKenzie's workshop experience. By 1988 he was earning a living by his performing alone; by 1990 he was a popular fixture on the scene. "I was spending 250 nights a year on stage," he said. It was time to try New York.
"I always swore I wouldn't come to New York without a show," he said. "But one day I woke up and said to myself: 'I'm almost 30. I've got to do it now.' "
 
 
The Early Days
 It was Michael Rafter, a college friend who is now a Broadway conductor, who helped encourage Mr. MacKenzie to move to New York in 1990, letting him sleep on his couch in his Upper West Side apartment until he found a place in New Jersey. It was a time of intense loneliness and disappointment. Mr. MacKenzie had started auditioning, one in a crowd now, a performer with a big, sweet voice, well-honed acting skills but an untrained body (5 feet, 11 3/4 inches of it) that betrayed his fear of auditions. There were many dismissive thank-you's.
"I had to sort of relearn everything: how to audition, what material to use," Mr. MacKenzie said. "In Boston I could get by on my voice. There was no real competition; a pool of about 30 people turned up for every audition. I wasn't prepared for here, where you're up against 300 guys at every chorus call."
Mr. Rafter came to his rescue by inviting him to an informal audition workshop for Broadway gypsies that he held every Monday. At first the experience was almost as unnerving as auditioning itself; this audience was gypsies who had performed in shows like "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Les Miserables." But the discomfort paid off. By February 1991 he had a dozen audition pieces prepared.
The process could still be painful and in at least one case devastating: Mr. MacKenzie lost his voice during an audition, after seven weeks of starring in "The Music Man" without a microphone in a regional theater. At the end, the casting director called out, "Everybody, please stay except the following people: Jamie MacKenzie." "Well, this is the worst-case scenario," he tried to reassure the person staring back at him from the elevator mirror as he left.
That year he landed a few small jobs in summer stock and on a cruise ship.
 
 
The Dance Class
 In February 1992 Mr. MacKenzie found a dance class, on the Lower East Side, "without attitude," as he put it. He realized that he needed to brush up on his dancing.
The teacher, Jerri Garner, a quick-moving woman with a Texas style, specializes in hard dancing and gentle encouragement in small tap and jazz classes in which even late starters like Mr. MacKenzie can learn to think on their feet. In one exercise the class is given a rhythm, each student calls out a step, and the sequence of steps is performed as a dance routine.
"You learn a broad vocabulary of basic steps so that 95 percent of the steps in audition combinations look familiar, and you can focus on the things you don't know," said Mr. MacKenzie. "Jerri has given me the ability to get through a dance audition with commitment."
 
 
Closing In On the Goal
 Mr. MacKenzie's preparation to become a triple-threat performer seemed to be paying off. By the summer of 1992 he was getting callbacks for things like the Robert Goulet "Camelot," the national tour of "Evita" and "Annie Warbucks." He knew he was getting closer. But the callbacks yielded only two jobs, both in summer theaters. At home on a visit, he called family members together. Should he give up and go to law school?
"I worry about the rejections," his mother said. "That's got to be terribly hard. But I think he handles it pretty well."
She did not hesitate to encourage him to stick it out in New York. "I know there are other things he could do," she said. "But he is so good, I want him to try as long as he wants to, so he'll know he tried." His family would support him through a year of auditioning.
 
The Big Break
 In December Mr. MacKenzie was one of about 1,500 performers seen over six days of open chorus calls for "My Fair Lady," which was due to open on Broadway about a year later. He chose "The Song Is You" and added a final E flat to show off his vocal range.
"We didn't need that last note, Jamie," the auditioners told him. But around Christmas he got a callback for Dec. 30.
"I was convinced I blew it," Mr. MacKenzie said of the second audition. There had been a long wait to enter the studio. "I was ticked off. When they called me, I threw down my 'Barchester Towers' and went in. I felt later I was going through the motions."
Five days went by without a word. The fifth night, frustrated after learning that he looked too young for a role for which he had auditioned and that he had felt good about, he stormed home, turned on the television and drank a lot of "bad Michigan wine."
But the next day there was a phone message for him from Charlotte Wilcox, the general manager of "My Fair Lady." She was offering him a job.
"Would you like to hear the details before you say yes?" she asked. "No," Mr. MacKenzie replied. Didn't he want the dates? No. How about the itinerary? No.
"There were two or three things she thought I was worried about," he recalled. "I wasn't. I said: 'It's all right, I'll take it.' "
Mr. MacKenzie was cast as an antic young Cockney in the quartet backing up Eliza Doolittle in the song "Wouldn't It Be Loverly." Rehearsals began in February. The show, starring Richard Chamberlain as Professor Higgins, went on tour on March 26, playing in 23 cities over nine months before opening on Broadway on Dec. 9 at the Virginia Theater.
"It was really a gift," Mr. MacKenzie said, remembering his earlier despair. "I don't know how much longer I could have held out."
"My Fair Lady" opened in New York to mixed but generally respectable reviews. But it was clear the musical was in trouble after Mr. Chamberlain left the show four months later, on April 3, and a closing notice went up three weeks later.
Over the summer, until some chorus members began to get jobs and others drifted away, they got together for baby and wedding showers and Broadway Show League baseball games and bowling. Many still keep in touch. More recently, in November, some attended the sixth annual gypsy-of-the-year competition, in which Broadway and Off Broadway choruses compete before their colleagues.
Mr. MacKenzie got an even more tangible bonus from the experience. By saving of his salary on tour, he was able to put a down payment on a studio apartment on the Upper West Side. It is decorated with photographs and prints, a piano from home and a few pieces of understated antique furniture from his grandmother. He wakes up every morning, he said, blessing "My Fair Lady."
 
 
Starting Over, Every Day
 Like any other gypsy, Mr. MacKenzie had to start all over again after "My Fair Lady" closed. Yes, a certain glow remained, and he returned to auditions with extra confidence. Nonetheless, it was as if he had never gotten that break.
Mr. Rafter, his audition coach, estimates that 95 percent of Equity members earn less than $20,000 a year from acting. Gypsies who make it into a Broadway show make a minimum, according to the union, of $975 a week. Mr. MacKenzie estimates that the year he performed in "My Fair Lady" he earned $60,000, counting per diem tour payments. Since the show closed, in May, he said wryly, he has earned "about $1,000."
He has lived off an income-tax refund and money from the sale of his car. These sums have kept him going financially, along with unemployment benefits of $300 a week. By early last month, Mr. MacKenzie was contemplating a return to temporary work, though even that can be difficult. "Temping is much more competitive now," he said.
His chief expenses are the training he needs to stay in shape: four dance classes a week, workouts at the gym and coaching with Mr. Rafter -- all of which adds up to $85 a week. He can't afford regular voice training, which averages $75 a session.
 
 
The Coaching Session
 In the summer of 1993, after "My Fair Lady" had closed, Mr. MacKenzie decided to respond to a cattle call, or big open chorus rehearsal, for the national tour of "Blood Brothers." Having an agent streamlines the audition process somewhat: shows that are casting notify agents, who may send out head shots of 10 clients; two or three are likely to be called for more select "agent-submission" auditions. Mr. MacKenzie did not yet have an agent; he planned to audition for "Blood Brothers."
As he often does, he scheduled an audition-coaching session with Mr. Rafter beforehand. As Mr. MacKenzie's coach, Mr. Rafter is probably one of his most important influences.
Mr. MacKenzie pulled sheet music from his knapsack. A song was chosen, and his huge, rich voice seemed to push up against the walls around him. There was a moment's silence after he finished. "Wow!" his teacher said softly. Then he played 16 bars of Noel Coward's nostalgic "Come the Wild, Wild Weather."
"The trouble with that is the bridge," Mr. MacKenzie said.
"It's a song that can be sung at auditions or funerals," Mr. Rafter responded dryly.
"Yeah, but it never goes above a C."
A good voice is obviously important, Mr. Rafter said later, but so is an honest treatment of the material. Concentrate on telling a story with the song, Mr. Rafter advised.
Mr. MacKenzie was afraid of sounding maudlin, he told Mr. Rafter, who then talked the two of them through a word-by-word analysis of the song.
"Higher stakes, O.K.?" Mr. MacKenzie sighed resignedly. He sang his way to the end again.
"It's not moving forward," Mr. Rafter said gently. "It's just bumping from section to section."
He then fixed on Mr. MacKenzie's hiking boots. "Are you going to wear those at the audition?" Mr. MacKenzie shook his head. "You should always wear the shoes you'll wear at the audition." Then he addressed Mr. MacKenzie's slightly stooped shoulders and diffident stance.
One moment the singer was a tiger, assertive, even cocky. The next moment he was a vulnerable child. Can both be one and the same person? Welcome, Mr. Rafter said, to the heart of the actor.
 
 
The Audition
 Actors line up as early as 5:30 A.M. at the headquarters of Actors Equity, on West 46th Street near Broadway, to sign up for auditions. Things are a little more relaxed for chorus calls, though no one auditions without an assigned time and an appointment card.
The room is decorated with Broadway show posters, job notices and a sign that warns "No smoking, eating, drinking, vocalizing." Auditioners file quickly in a single line past a woman everyone knows as Marilyn, a veteran actor who checks their union membership cards. Hal Blankenship, a tall, genial man and union audition monitor who has overseen two generations of job-seeking gypsies, records their appointments. Several soundproof studios line a corridor behind the waiting room.
It is in Studio D that the "Blood Brothers" tryouts will take place. On that day the door opens, and a man walks out. "Sixteen bars of a pop-rock ballad or dramatic," he orders. The auditioners begin to disappear into the studio.
Inside, two men in khakis and T-shirts sit behind a table, the accompanist to their right. "Hello, how are you?" they ask as each auditioner presents his photo, resume and music. The room is small and pink, with a mirror, a barre, a few chairs and a large clock. Somehow, it seems vast and empty.
Each person gets his moment, is thanked and disappears. It is Mr. MacKenzie's turn. Entering with a confident bounce, he greets everyone and chats a little. Then it is time.
His voice fills the room with warm, rich sound and all the subtle nuances his coach could have wished for. "Very nice," Mr. MacKenzie is told. Next.
Mr. MacKenzie feels good about his efforts. But then his mood is good anyway. He had a call from Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, New York, to audition for a singing commercial. He hurries downtown by subway to the luxurious offices of the huge international advertising agency.
"I was a little down at the coaching session yesterday," Mr. MacKenzie admits en route. "But I went to see 'Perestroika' last night, and I sort of used the positive, affirmed sense I got from watching that to get me upbeat."
Indeed, one antidote to the down times is attending theater, whenever he can afford it. "I'm constantly fighting to keep things real and fresh. The real process is to keep yourself from being bitter," he said. He mentions an exceptionally blase actor who turns up at most auditions, though he never seems to get jobs. "I want to say to him, 'Get away from me.' "
Mr. MacKenzie waits calmly in the reception room at Saatchi & Saatchi, his throat muscles moving almost imperceptibly as if vocalizing silently to himself. Eventually a casting director leads him into a small high-tech recording studio. He is to sing an upbeat, old pop standard with new lyrics, giving it an Andy Williams-Perry Como spin. He practices twice. Now it's time.
"Take one," a ghostly voice from the sound booth calls out. "State your name, please."
The voice describes the character to be portrayed: "Let's do a bit of a sendup, a singing-at-a-wedding kind of idea."
Mr. MacKenzie complies.
Pick up the pace for take two, he is told, and give it a little "lounge lizard."
Mr. MacKenzie juts out his pelvis a bit, greasily extending his vowels as he sings. The auditioners seem pleased, and Mr. MacKenzie leaves on a wave of warmth. Things are looking good.
But neither audition pans out. There's not even a callback for "Blood Brothers."
"Last week was really hard," Mr. MacKenzie said of the experience. "What keeps me from getting too bitter or too beaten is that I laugh. You have to laugh. You have to turn it into an anecdote, or it eats you up."
A few experiences make the bad times easier to bear. Mr. MacKenzie auditioned for "Kiss Me, Kate" and felt optimistic about his chances. But the producers were unable to get the rights to the show. In the brief limbo before news filtered that the show was dead, he drifted into the familiar gypsy blues. "I didn't know if they had liked me," he said. But the choreographer, Susan Stroman, had written a personal note to all the callbacks, adding to Mr. MacKenzie's letter a warm note of praise for his audition.
"She was so nice," he said. "That really raised the level, treating us like people."
 
 
What They Did For Love
 Older Broadway gypsies have endured the highs and lows of the life many times over, of course. But the theater world has changed since they began, said two veteran performers of the chorus of "My Fair Lady." "Show business suddenly became 'the entertainment industry,' " said Ron Schwinn, 54, who played Pearly King in the show. "I think that's when the 'business' took over."
Mr. Schwinn has worked fairly steadily, but it is getting harder.
"From 1960 to when I closed in '42d Street,' in 1985, my average span of idleness between jobs was six weeks," he said. "In those days you could go from show to show to show. There was a stock season, too, with three to four auditions a day, five days a week. There is no resident stock any more. It was a wonderful way for a young person to learn to work. You'd rehearse and perform and rehearse again."
There are other changes. Performers now spend as much time auditioning for agents as for shows, Mr. Schwinn noted. And this is the era of the absentee director and choreographer, he added, who often delegate their work with choruses to lesser mortals. The gypsy terminology, too, has changed.
"I learned a whole new language in 'My Fair Lady,' " said Patti Karr, a gypsy who has been in the business for 44 years. "You now have your 'station' in the dressing room. Excuse me? Those of us from the old school had to be nailed to our beds to miss a show. And now when you get your period you take a 'personal day.' It would never have entered my mind.
"I think the big difference today is that people want to have another life. This was our life. Some guy asked me once if I was going to give this up when I got married. What? Excuse me?"
While Ms. Karr talks of retiring, Mr. Schwinn plows happily on. "Every now and then I walk into an audition," he said, "and someone looks up and says, 'Oh, my God, are you still alive?' "
When he was called in to work on "My Fair Lady" on tour, Tommy Tune voiced similar surprise. "I said, 'Yeah, Tommy, I'm still here. It's what I do."
 
 
The Future
 Mr. MacKenzie gave himself five years in New York to find out if he could succeed in the theater. He has a year to go. "I've done enough now so that I don't feel as if I'll walk away after a year," he said. "I've started a life here. I don't know what form it's going to take: cabaret, theater or something else. That's one of the cool things about 'My Fair Lady.' It made it all make sense."
October was a good month for auditions, with 12 in the first three weeks, but November offered almost nothing. Things picked up early this month, but the holidays will be a dead time.
Mr. MacKenzie would like to be working. "You get to the point where you're so hungry to work, you take almost anything," he said.
He has done two training films, one in which he portrayed Vinnie the Vegetable Man for a supermarket, another in which he played a worker worried about the effect of a drunk-driving arrest on his job.
Mr. MacKenzie is at a critical age for gypsies. "It's so brutal. Some get tougher. Some give it up. There was a girl in 'Ain't Broadway Grand.' She'd been working for years, and that was her first show on Broadway. It opened and closed. She couldn't keep going; she went back to Ohio to start a new life. She was a talented, beautiful, incredible dancer. But over the long haul it just got too hard."
Mr. MacKenzie rehearses regularly with Wayne Barker, his accompanist for a nightclub act, and has now put together four acts that include bits like George Gershwin sung in French and parodies of Harry Connick Jr. and Garth Brooks. "I've kept my club act," he said. "I can do that anywhere."
Why keep going?
"I love the process," Mr. MacKenzie said. "I started because I love to sing. But I love the nuts and bolts of acting and creating life out of words on a stage. Theater pays you back in the satisfaction of doing something well, working on a great piece. It pays you back when the audience responds.
"This is your calling," he added. "And if you want it, no one else is going to do it. Nobody will come along and say, 'Oh, a new star.' I realize that I love this. I always just wanted to be a working actor. That's always been the most important thing -- the work."

HEADLINE: 2 SoHo Blocks: A Landmarks Notebook

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
FOR Spalding Gray, it's the cobblestones.
"When I come back from traveling and take a cab home," said the actor, writer and longtime resident of SoHo, "the cobblestones on the street give me the sense of returning to a place that's old, that has character, that has history, that has a name. That's so important to me."
He is not alone. It is more than two decades since the Landmarks Preservation Commission, on Aug. 14, 1973, designated 26 blocks of SoHo -- from Crosby Street to West Broadway and from Canal to Houston Street -- as a historic district. The designation has preserved the neighborhood's notable 19th-century cast-iron architecture. It even led to the reintroduction of such amenities as the Belgian block cobblestone so beloved by Mr. Gray, the rectangular granite stones, so redolent of roadbeds past, with which parts of Mercer and Greene Streets were repaved several years ago. 
 A look at the effects of designation on two blocks of Wooster Street, from Grand to Spring Street, shows that residents, landlords, store owners and representatives of community organizations give both the designation -- and the landmarks agency, whose approval is required for any changes to building exteriors in the district -- largely positive reviews.
There are complaints that renovations according to landmarks guidelines sometimes take too long and cost too much, that bureaucracy can create delays and that the increased price tag sometimes keeps owners from upgrading deteriorating facades. There is concern about owners who violate landmarks guidelines and about the difficulty the city has in enforcing the regulations. And there is a desire to plant trees in the neighborhood, an idea that the commission has questioned.
There is also mention, positive and negative, of the important role landmarking has played in SoHo's booming economic development, the neighborhood's transformation to a busy tourist and shopping area, a change that has caused chagrin among many residents, including Mr. Gray.
But there is also praise for the commission's often nonbureaucratic tendencies, its ability to make relatively fast decisions. The new owners of 42 and 46 Wooster Street, two long-vacant adjacent buildings just south of Broome Street, have nothing but accolades for the commission's cooperation in their plans to rescue from demolition and restore two currently shabby-looking examples of the glories of cast iron.
And in general, there is agreement that without the historic district, things would have been very different, and not nearly as good, south of Houston.
"A LOT of people say they don't like landmarking," said Sean Sweeney, chairman of the SoHo Alliance, a neighborhood organization, and a member of the landmarks committee of Community Board No. 2. "They complain that the whole rigamarole and the bureaucracy is a pain in the neck. But I think landmarking is a good thing. It increases property values. And it definitely improves the neighborhood. If it weren't for the historic district we'd be getting a lot of tacky buildings here. Broadway for instance, with all its retail stores, might look more like a suburban mall."
Margot Gayle, the founder of Friends of Cast-Iron Architecture and a crucial figure in the lobbying that helped established the district, put it this way: "Without landmarking, a lot of SoHo wouldn't be there at all."
"There was great pressure at the time," she recalled, "to tear much of it down and build a big public housing project like the one in Co-op City."
SoHo has not always been a choice destination. In the early part of the 19th century, the section of Manhattan north of Canal Street and south of Houston Street was given the name Hell's Hundred Acres, for the many fires that began in its warren of warehouses and small factories.
After a brief period in the 1850's that featured an elegant shopping district along Broadway, the area became a center of light industry, known for its furriers and doll, rag and box makers, all housed in Palladian or Italianate warehouses and factories built between 1860 and 1900 and featuring cast iron as a prime building material.
Over the years, though, little note was taken of the design of the closely spaced buildings. In 1959, the City Club of New York issued a report calling that part of town a slum and declaring that its architecture was of no significance.
But Ms. Gayle and other preservationists felt differently, and their views prevailed. Fourteen years after the City Club report, in designating as a historic district much of the neighborhood that had come to be known as SoHo (for South of Houston Industrial Area), the landmarks commission extolled its architecture, saying it contained "the largest concentration of full and partial cast-iron facades anywhere in the world."
In the intervening years, as manufacturers left the city, groups of artists, attracted by the neighborhood's low rents and its large, underutilized loft spaces, had begun moving into SoHo (at first illegally, because the area was not zoned for residential use). They were turning the once-desolate section -- which comprises about 40 blocks, including the 26 of the district -- into the lively and trendy center for art and artists of many kinds -- visual, performance, cinematic, musical -- that it remains today.
EARLIER this year, in the southern part of the historic district, the landmarks commission had a problem. It involved 46 Wooster Street, a six-story Romanesque cast-iron structure built in 1895 and designed by the architect F. S. Baldwin. The building had been vacant for more than 15 years, and the top two floors had collapsed after a construction crew replaced some beams.
The Department of Buildings issued an unsafe-building notice against the property, and the owner at the time, Simon Elias, whose renovation plans had been derailed by the real-estate recession and who was concerned about any further collapse, sought to have the building torn down.
A compromise, though, was reached with the commission, which agreed to allow Mr. Elias to remove just the top three floors. Then new developers came along interested in 46 and its next-door neighbor, 42 Wooster Street, an 1883 cast-iron building designed by Jarvis Morgan Slade that had been vacant for more than 12 years.
"We decided to ask him to hold up on demolition," Tony Leichter, co-developer with Dr. Axel Stawski (whose buildings include 565 and 579 Fifth Avenue) and Charles Blaichman. "We decided to go informally to the commission and see if they would be interested in our attempting to save the top three floors of the building and if they would work with us on the use changes we required to make it financially feasible. They seemed to indicate they would work with us."
Mr. Leichter and his partners worked with Brian E. Hogg, the deputy director of preservation, and with Jennifer J. Raab, the new commission chairwoman. Engineers studied the building's foundation and decided that it could be stabilized. In September, the commission approved a design for facade restoration.
The developers' plan involves 10,000 square feet of retail space and 50,000 square feet of residential space, for about 18 loft units. As part of the agreement the landmarks commission itself is applying to the City Planning Commission for a modification-of-use permit for joint living-work quarters and for retail space under Section 74-711 of the Zoning Resolution. The section gives landmarks very wide discretion to apply to the Planning Commission for modifications of use and bulk.
"I'M really excited about this project," Ms. Raab said. "This application gave us a chance to make preservation come to life by bringing a building back to life, by providing artists' residences and workplaces. Section 74-711 is very useful, because it allows us to say to another city agency that we believe there's a strong preservation purpose here and we support the applicant."
Lawrence B. Bogdanow, the architect for the project and a longtime SoHo resident, said the renovation would maintain the separate architectural identities of the two buildings, with each having its own access and egress.
"We will be restoring the original facades, cornices and architectural details of both buildings, with set-back penthouses added to both," Mr. Bogdanow said. "We will repair the masonry, mortar and terra cotta and replace virtually all the windows. In addition, at 46 we plan to add an atrium that will descend five floors down from the roof, with a terrace at the fifth floor and an outdoor walkway around the atrium on the sixth. We will also have basically new storefronts, basing them on precedents in the neighborhood and what remains of the old storefronts."
Mr. Leichter said that he hoped the applications would be before the Planning Commission in January and that final approval would be received by summer. He added that he had nothing but praise for the landmark's commission's role in the process.
"I can't emphasize enough what a surprise it was to me as a developer to find a city agency that was so receptive and cooperative," he said. "My initial reaction was always that the fewer governmental agencies one has to deal with the better. But our experience was totally favorable."
There are more Wooster Street success stories. No. 84, an L-shaped seven-story building dating from 1895 that is also 134 Spring Street, was also the recipient of help from the commission under Section 74-711 as part of a renovation plan.
"A couple of years ago, a very large and elaborate metal cornice was in very bad condition," said Shael Shapiro, a SoHo architect who designed the restoration. "At one point we had to cover it to protect it from falling on the street."
The owner wanted to repair and restore it, Mr. Shapiro said, but the commission wanted the restoration to expensively reproduce the original sheet-metal form. The owner, he said, suggested a deal. There are certain restrictions on the use of ground-floor retail space in SoHo; one rule requires a special permit for retail usage in ground-floor space of more than 3,500 square feet in the section roughly west of Mercer Street and north of Broome Street. No. 84 has 7,500 square feet.
"So the owners basically agreed to restore the cornices in the original manner," Mr. Shapiro said, "and the landmarks commission agreed to apply on behalf of the owner under 74-711 to the Planning Commission to modify the zoning, so they could get more rent to make up for the cost of restoration."
Susan Penzner, the building's managing agent, said the project, which included other repairs and repainting of window trim to comply with landmarks regulations, cost about $750,000. "It was very costly," Ms. Penzner said, "but our building is quite beautiful on the outside now and we feel it was worth it."
No. 35 Wooster, south of Broome, is occupied these days by the Drawing Center, a prominent gallery with a beautifully restored facade. The five-story building, known as Lyall House, was originally a department store and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. But in the early 1980's, it was the home of a rag baler and a futon retailer.
Then a developer, Affirmative Asset Group, took over and, with certification from the Federal Interior Department that allowed buyers to qualify for an investment tax credit for rehabilitation of a historic property, turned it into loft condominiums.
Not everyone, of course, cares about preservation. There are building owners in SoHo, and in other historic districts throughout the city, who ignore landmarks guidelines and make changes without consultation or approval. The commission has found that with its limited staff, enforcement is a problem. It can issue violation notices, but it is difficult to force people to remove the changes.
Ms. Raab, who was appointed in July, said she was hoping to change enforcement procedures. "I think we should be doing more effective enforcement and should consider moving to a system of fines for more egregious violations," she said. "But I think it only fair to first do a much better job of public information, education and accountability, making sure architects working in historic districts understand that our rules are the law."
THE agency's power comes into play if an owner wants to make other changes that require Buildings Department approval and a new certificate of occupancy. The owner will soon find that he cannot get the certificate unless the landmarks commission first signs off on the project, and the commission will not do so until the violations are corrected.
That is essentially what happened at 70 Wooster Street, between Broome and Spring Streets, when the owner sought to obtain a certificate of occupancy for the residential loft tenants in the building. The landmarks commission discovered violations issued in 1983 and 1985, apparently because a former retail tenant had made illegal alterations in the building's facade.
John Pasquale, the building's owner, said that until he filed his plans with the Buildings Department, he had had no knowledge of the violations. "Landmarks said we could do nothing until they were satisfied," Mr. Pasquale said.
Mr. Pasquale said he felt that "landmarks really dragged their feet" and that it took the commission more than year "to get it together." The delay, he said, caused him to miss deadlines, "and I can't get a mortgage to do the improvements; I have to take the money out of pocket, because the bank won't give a mortgage without a certificate
of occupancy." Ms. Raab said she could not comment on the process in Mr. Pasquale's case because it predated her arrival. But she added that she was "very committed to moving projects through the process expeditiously, in a way that does not discourage developers from investing in New York."
Now at 70 Wooster Street, the landmarks guidelines are being met. And Mr. Shapiro, who is also the architect for its nearly complete partial restoration -- which includes the storefront, the first two floors and a new cornice on the second floor -- said he felt that the landmarks requirements will, when work is completed, "make a significant impact on what was an eyesore on that block and turn it into quite a nice storefront."
"It's a good example of landmarking improving things," he said. "It's a case in which because there had been a violation, and because new work was proposed, the commission was able to say, 'You've got to remove that violation.' "
And even Mr. Pasquale agreed that despite his difficulties, "as a whole landmarking has to improve the area."
Bill Downey, an artist and a resident of 80 Wooster, a seven-story former warehouse that was by all accounts the first artists' cooperative conversion in SoHo, said he understood why some people objected. "It's another layer of bureaucracy," Mr. Downey said, "although compared to other city agencies they're actually relatively efficient and certainly more courteous. But it becomes another hurdle if you're doing anything as simple as painting a building, because unless you paint it the same color you have to get their approval."
"They're not the world's most practical people," he added. "It appears they never take into consideration how much things cost. Once when we had a little minor painting done on the front of the building landmarks wanted to have somebody approve the color of the grout."
BUT Ms. Raab said that money was on the commission's mind: "Our staff can often make suggestions to an applicant of ways to be appropriate and to do something economically."
Some SoHo residents feel that the commission's insistence on adherence to tradition can inhibit experimentation and creativity.
"It can have a chilling effect on architecture," said Jim Clayburgh, a designer and member of Wooster Group, a theatrical troupe that works out of the Performing Garage at 33 Wooster Street (where Spalding Gray began creating the monologues for which he is best known). Mr. Clayburgh said that because of landmarking, his group had not "even attempted to realize some of the things we wanted, particularly installing a marquee with an air-conditioning system above it, because we knew it wouldn't be approved."
Ms. Raab said, though, that there was room in landmarking for an architect's vision. She cited as examples Mr. Bogdanow's plan for 42 and 46 Wooster Street and the Smith-Miller and Hawkinson Architects' 141 Wooster Street, north of Prince Street, "a simple, elegant, creative and contemporary interpretation of the cast-iron esthetic of the area."
Despite the criticisms, landmarking basically gets good reviews, especially for what it has prevented.
"You only have to look at West Broadway," said Mr. Bogdanow, the architect for 42 Wooster. "The cast-iron district ends on the east side of West Broadway. The west side of the street is not landmarked, and two new buildings stand out like sore thumbs because they have nothing to do with the rest of the district."
Mr. Downey of 80 Wooster said many longtime residents miss the old days of SoHo, "when it was actually quiet down here at the end of a workday, when it was living in the country and there was a real sense of community.
But, said Ms. Gayle, the preservationist who championed the original designation: "You can't have it both ways. You can't have great economic success and a magnet for tourism from people around the world and make it a cozy and quiet place."
And a magnet it remains. "Something about SoHo draws people to the place," said Mr. Leichter, the co-developer of 42 and 46 Wooster. There's a feeling of cohesiveness, a feeling of excitement." And a feeling of history, of cast iron in all the right places.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: New Downtown Study;
An Updating For Brooklyn

 BODY:
The Regional Plan Association, which 11 years ago created a blueprint that spurred a surge of development in downtown Brooklyn, has been called upon again to create an outline for the area's growth.
H. Claude Shostal, president of the R.P.A., said that that much has changed in downtown Brooklyn since the association's last plan was released in 1983. 
 "The MetroTech Center has had a major impact," he said. "And there is a huge amount of high-tech infrastructure that wasn't there.
Mr. Shostal also noted that the demographics of the downtown Brooklyn have changed over the last decade.
"Iit is a much more diverse population than it used to be," he said.
The R.P.A.'s new plan will include recommendations for improving urban design and transportation as well as stimulating retail activity and institutional cooperation.
Mr. Shostal said that plans generally cover 10 to 25 years, and the new plan will cost $130,000. It will be funded with a combination of public and private funds, including $35,000 from the Borough President and $50,000 from the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
"As business people, we understand the importance of long-range planning," said Robert Bailey, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Development Association and the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, which, along with the Borough President's office, requested the study.
The 65-year-old R.P.A. is a non-profit research organization that helps develop programs to improve the quality of life in the tri-state area.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Setting A Price Limit

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
WHEN shoppers go out to buy a car or a microwave oven or a TV set they don't automatically go for the top of the line, even if they can afford to do so.
But when it comes to buying a home, brokers rarely ask how much you want to spend. Rather, they assume you will spend the most you can afford, based upon income and assets. They may even pull out charts that show how you can stretch that limit if you're willing to consider, say, a variable-rate mortgage. 
 By doing so they are playing on a sensitive nerve in American culture that suggests it is inconceivable for someone to actually set their sights lower than their purse permits.
For a home is more than simply shelter. It makes a statement about the owner's financial means and status in life. And few people want to look less successful than they really are.
Conspiring to keep this ideal alive is the fact that virtually everyone connected with the transaction -- from the salesperson to the title company -- is compensated on a formula based upon purchase price. So it's not in their financial interest to even raise the notion of settling for less.
In fact, certain brokers are known to ignore a self-imposed ceiling, taking a prospective buyer to see costlier homes in the hope they can tempt them upwards. They insist this is because the buyers are often disappointed by what they get at the price they initially decided to pay.
"If you can afford $550,000 and you say you will only spend $400,000 you usually end up paying around $475,000," said Barbara Mulrooney, manager of the office of Coldwell Banker Schlott Realtors in the Tara Hotel in Stamford, Conn.
But it doesn't have to be that way. David Donnelly, chief financial officer for the Mount Vernon Hospital in Westchester County, decided recently to spend no more than $265,000 for a colonial in Ringwood, N.J., when he could have gone as high as $325,000. Despite attempts to show him more expensive homes, he said, he stuck firmly to his self-created maximum by selecting the broker who really did take him at his word.
The limiting factor in his case was the specter of imminent college costs for three daughters that included two 14-year-old twins. "I wanted to save the difference for school," he said. By capping his monthly housing overhead at $2,200 rather than $3,000 -- the maximum he had been told he could afford -- he figured he could save at least $800 a month without too much difficulty.
When Jeff Binder and Stephanie Maxwell purchased a four-bedroom Tudor in Montclair, N.J., in September in a move from a much smaller condominium, they held to their limit by constantly reminding themselves of all the furniture they would need and how, if they paid any more, they would lose the chance to make even minor alterations. "And there's always something you want to change," said Mr. Binder.
Expressions like "house poor" and "living to pay the mortgage" didn't enter popular usage for nothing. They're manifestations of a frustration -- often discovered too late in the day -- concerning all the other costs that tend to pile up: decorating, heating, cooling, cleaning, landscaping, repairs and taxes -- all of which rise as the house or the lot grow larger and more expensive.
No wonder financial advisers are beginning to advise clients that less is often more in terms of overall fiscal health, especially at a time when values are not leaping upwards, property taxes are rising and jobs are being lost.
Marcia Levy, manager of the Montclair office of Burgdorff Realty, is already seeing more of these buyers. She maintains its also a symptom of a pervasive anxiety, articulated in the November elections, that life is not getting any easier for most people.
"They're afraid to max out," she said, noting that some also talk of friends who stretched to the limit at the height of the 80's market only to slip into foreclosure during the economic turndown of the early 90's.
Evelyn Atanas, president of Atanas Realty of Williston Park, L.I., has found similar resistance recently among buyers moving from Suffolk County where property taxes lately have been "going through the sky," she said.
Others refusing to get caught up in the buy-the-most fantasy, she said, are young couples eager to base their budget on just one income. They say they prefer to be in a position where one parent can stay home while the children are small. The recent upward spurt in interest rates has created an added level of conservatism, she said.
Buyers wishing to settle for less should weigh a variety of different methods they can use to scale back. They include looking in a less costly neighborhood, buying a home that needs work or might be suitable for later expansion and making a larger-than-necessary down payment to keep the monthly mortgage costs low.
Making the larger down payment is the option of choice among conservative buyers at the high end said Vicky Papson, a senior mortgage consultant with Emigrant Mortgage Bank of Darien, Conn. She has found the idea particularly appealing to those of her Wall Street buyers facing the possibility of lower incomes and layoffs.
But it can also include anyone taking a large chunk of cash out of a former home, even though it's normally in a homeowner's best interest from a tax standpoint to put down no more than 20 percent on the next purchase.
Christopher Plaut, a lawyer, and Nancy Winkelstein, a psychiatric social worker, decided they would rather trade size than location. "The two most important things for us were neighborhood and commute," said Mr. Plaut.
So instead of giving up Larchmont, N.Y., for a less costly area, they stayed in the community but confined their search to three-bedroom homes with asking prices around $275,000 instead of four-bedroom homes at $380,000. "We really didn't need that much space right away," said Mr. Plaut.
This way, they reasoned, they could also continue to save for retirement, enjoy expensive vacations and put money aside for their children's education or simply as a nest egg. "It makes us more relaxed," continued Mr. Plaut. "And if I ever want to switch careers and take a job with lower pay I can. That's a very nice feeling."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Tenant Complaints Activate Heavy State Machinery

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
WHEN tenants file a complaint with New York State government over services or conditions in their rent-regulated apartment or building, they probably do not say to themselves, "This is a complaint-driven system."
That is the expression state officials use to describe the task of handling complaints within the Office of Rent Administration of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. It is a thankless task, though government may not be displeased with that, since it positions itself as an intermediary force in what many New Yorkers seem to believe is an inherent antagonism between tenants and landlords. 
 But after 10 years of experience with state administration of the New York City rent-regulated housing stock it seems safe to conclude that the price of fairness, if such it is, is administrative gridlock. It takes very little to initiate a case -- filing a complaint costs nothing -- but it can take years to conclude it.
Small owners can be overwhelmed by the process and many tenants are frustrated by slow results. Because of rent-reduction orders, an untold amount of rent money is permanently lost by owners, even when housing deficiencies are corrected.
With George E. Pataki, a Republican, replacing Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, as Governor in January and a new leadership due to take over at the state's housing agency, the management of rent regulation is likely to get a fresh look. Republicans are less likely than Democrats to embrace the rigorous regulatory system now in effect. But that doesn't mean they will find reform a simple task.
The handling of tenant complaints over services and conditions is merely one aspect of the system -- separate, for example, from the system that handles overcharge complaints. It is run by the Service Compliance Owner-Restoration Enforcement Bureau, or Score, formerly known as the Tenants Services Complaint Bureau. The operation demonstrates the scale and stunning complexity of regulatory practice.
"While we've made progress, after 10 years we're still not on top of the caseload on tenant complaints," said Lula M. Anderson, the deputy housing commissioner in charge of the Office of Rent Administration, who previously had the job of running the Score section.
The state regulates 1.12 million rental housing units, all but about 50,000 of them in New York City. The cost is about $35 million a year, $11.5 million of it paid by owners and the rest by taxpayers. The Office of Rent Administration has a staff of 640.
Before state takeover in 1984, New York City had about 350 employees handling the rent-controlled (or pre-World War II) housing stock, and the quasi-public Conciliation and Appeals Board had 120 employees dealing with the rent-stabilized stock (postwar rentals, or prewar apartments with a tenancy turnover since 1971).
Last year the state office handled nearly 290,000 requests for assistance, with 223,000 coming over the telephone and 66,700 from appearances at a district rent office.
Tenant service complaints to the Score Bureau are made on forms available at district rent offices. They can lead to significant rent reductions. In a rent-stabilized apartment, even seemingly minor housing infractions lead by law to the loss of an entire rent-guideline increase once the infraction is confirmed by a state inspection. If the infraction is in a public space, the guideline increase can be lost for the entire building.
OWNERS may of course apply for a rent restoration. They usually contend that the alleged deficiency had been corrected prior to the inspector's arrival. The inspection comes three months to a year after the owner receives notice of a tenant's complaint, the agency says. Owners are not informed when the inspection will occur and are not allowed to attend it.
If deficiencies lead to an order of rent reduction and the owner chooses to challenge it, the owner may file a "petition for administrative review" and usually does. Tenants may also file for a review.
The dispute can go on for five years or more. The number of pending petitions for administrative review in the Office of Rent Administration at the end of last year stood at 20,800. There were 5,700 pending in the Score Bureau alone. The Overcharge Bureau had 5,800 pending cases.
Other petitions for administrative review concern actions by bureaus regulating owner applications for rent increases after building improvements are made, and rent levels in New York City rent-controlled apartments or controlled or stabilized apartments outside the city.
The normal wait for a decision in a petition for administrative review on a Score case is three years. Unwilling to wait that long, owners often go to court, demanding to have their petition "deemed denied" so they can challenge the rent-reduction order in court. The rent agency has no figures on what percentage of rent-reduction orders wind up in court.
Aside from the appeals caseload, there is a big complaint caseload awaiting action. In Score, 19,500 cases were pending at the end of last year. The largest category -- 8,800 cases -- concerned conditions within the apartment, such as leaky faucets and broken windows.
There are 15 inspectors to view these conditions. The inspection follows a notice to the owner, who gets 20 days to respond. It takes inspectors three to nine months to get to an apartment, the agency says. In 1993 there were 7,300 new complaints about apartment conditions and 1,600 about buildingwide conditions.
Half the complaints are dismissed after inspection, either because the condition has been corrected or didn't exist, or because the inspector could not get into the apartment after two visits. The otrher half get rent-reduction orders.
The average processing time for a tenant's complaint (from date of filing to the date an order is issued) is 13 months. The average time it takes for an owner to get an Order of Rent Restoration after the rent has been cut but the service has been found to be restored is 20 months.
Owners say that lost rent is often never recovered. The collection of lost rent can take effect only upon a re-inspection that confirms a restoration of services. But the process takes so long, owners say, that many tenants will have moved before retroactive increases can be collected. The restoration order in fact often precipitates a departure, they say.
Moreover, the re-inspection often comes so long after the owner's application that the same condition -- peeled paint or damaged flooring or a dirty hallway -- may have recurred to nullify a rent restoration.
In one recent situation, a stabilized apartment on Fort Hamilton Parkway in Brooklyn lost its 1994 guideline increase on the following grounds: "Vermin control, apartment; toilet bowl; living-room floor-baseboards; buzzer." Whether the conditions are flagrant or not is not clear from the notice. It is also irrelevant to rent loss.
In another case, a buildingwide reduction was ordered at a 36-unit building on 191st Street in Flushing because of "water leaks skylight; floor covering stairs; vermin control public area."
In rent-controlled apartments, the rent reductions are for specific amounts for specific service deficiencies. On Morris Avenue in the Bronx, one tenant's rent was lowered $6 a month for a defective intercom; $5 for a stair-rail condition; $3 for "paint-plaster bulkhead," and $6 for "paint-plaster hall."
The rent agency has tried to nip service disputes in the bud with a voluntary mediation service. A pilot program began March 1. When there is goodwill on both sides, mediation has been workable. But often there is hostility and a mistrust of motivation.
A case in point involves an apartment in an eight-unit co-op at 161 President Street in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn. The tenant in one of four sponsor-owned rental apartments in the building filed for a rent reduction in 1987 over allegedly inadequate painting. The sponsor then painted, and obtained an affidavit from the painter that the tenant had denied access to portions of the apartment.
The apartment was re-inspected 17 months later. The painting was found inadequate. Rent restoration was denied. Now the sponsor has gone to court. The tenant continues to pay only $500 a month instead of would otherwise be a rent of nearly $800. The sponsor says the tenant has filed a new complaint on deficient painting.
According to Harriet Thompson-Shand, a lawyer in Brooklyn who formerly worked for the rent agency and now represents small owners in real-estate matters, it is not possible for many non-English-speaking owner-managers to handle the procedures of rent administration. "Often they buy buildings that are riddled with rent-regulation problems and find they have to have perfect records going back 10 years or they'll lose part of the rent roll," she said.
IN Queens, Dorette Gallan, a broker who handles paperwork for some 200 small owners of six-family houses, mainly in Astoria, makes the same point. "Many of them are self-taught plumbers and painters who want to do the improvement work themselves, but they often can't get rent increases for it because they can't show paper to prove the work was done," she said.
But in a report called "Rent Regulation After 50 Years," the Division of Housing and Community Renewal last September identified the privately owned rental housing stock as part of the inventory of housing that government has a responsibility to maintain as "decent, affordable" rental housing, while assuring owners an "adequate return on investment" and safeguarding tenants from "burdensome rent increases."
These goals are far-reaching and perhaps contradictory. The usual way in which government assures affordable housing for renters of modest income is to subsidize the difference between the economic cost of providing the housing and the tenants' ability to pay.
The state does just that in several affordable-housing programs. But the regulatory system for privately owned buildings operates mainly as a counterweight to landlord power, needed, in theory, because a housing shortage gives them too much leverage. Many owners would be surprised to learn that it is also supposed to function as a way to sustain the quality of the housing product.
Already 33 percent of the privately owned rental apartments in New York City are unregulated. Their tenants are not without protection on habitability issues. New York City must enforce the multiple-dwelling code, and Housing Court enforces the Warranty of Habitability law.
The probability is that the quality of the 54 percent of rental units that remain regulated would be enhanced in the long run if they were deregulated at the time of a tenancy turnover. In the meantime, state regulation has come to mean a heavyhanded system of regulation in the name of tenant protection.

HEADLINE: Juggling the Needs of Taxpayers and the Poor

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
KNOWN as Rose City, Norwich was a flourishing industrial center at the turn of the century. But when Beverly Goulet, who was born and raised in Norwich, returned to her home town in 1985 after a 20-year absence, she was shocked to find empty storefronts and factory buildings and lines of people outside the welfare office. She watched as members of her family lost their jobs.
"I was taken aback when I returned to a community where the urban centers had been thriving," Ms. Goulet said. "The factories went South, and we never replaced those manufacturing jobs. It should be no surprise that we're in this situation now. We haven't invested in human capital in this country for a great many years. Now people are looking for quick fixes." 
 Ms. Goulet, now director of social services for the City of Norwich, is one of many local and state officials struggling to come up with a plan to cut the cost of welfare and at the same time enable a growing number of poor and jobless people in Connecticut to become self-sufficient.
Debate continues over a plan to turn municipal welfare over to the state to ease the financial and administrative burdens on cities and towns. Pilot projects aimed at getting people off state welfare and back to work have been started in New Haven and Manchester. The worry is that there may not be enough jobs to absorb those ready for employment. And the City of Bridgeport, adopting a state law passed two years ago, is cutting welfare benefits after nine months for able-bodied people. Legal aid groups have challenged the law.
After the November elections that swept Republicans into control in Congress, both parties are promising to cut benefits and put welfare recipients to work. President Clinton's plan would require people who receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children for more than two years to join a work program or accept a government-subsidized job. States would be allowed to place a cap on family welfare benefits.
But Ms. Goulet said she disagrees with that approach. "How do we get people in leadership positions to see the bigger picture?" she said. "This is about poverty. It's about unemployment. A check is not the answer. For every seven people on welfare in Connecticut, there is only one job available. Those same people have to compete with the newly unemployed who are better trained. People still don't want to face the facts."
Bridgeport reduced its welfare rolls under a 1992 state law that allows the cutoff of benefits for able-bodied people (they can re-apply after 90 days) and limits a community's obligation to shelter homeless people. Since the law was passed two years ago, 72 communities have imposed the nine-month limit on welfare benefits, said Carolanne Curry, a project director with the City of Bridgeport Welfare Department. Connecticut Legal Services Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides legal assistance to low-income people, challenged the law in court, as did the New Haven Legal Assistance Association after the city closed a homeless shelter. The state Supreme Court is expected to issue decisions on the two cases within the next few months.
Advocates for the poor argue that the Connecticut Constitution requires state and local government to provide basic care for the poor. Lawyers for the state maintain that the constitution does not guarantee welfare benefits despite the fact that Connecticut laws involving care for the indigent date back to the 1600's.
The Connecticut Alliance for Basic Human Needs, a nonpartisan group campaigning for welfare reform, argues that the assumption that people stay on welfare for years and thus a time limit is needed is wrong. Studies show that nearly three-quarters of new A.F.D.C. clients leave the rolls within two years. Furthermore, the waiting list for Connecticut's education and job training program numbers about 20,000, and people complain that they must wait up to two years for education or training.
Also mistaken is the assumption that people are poor because they lack a work ethic, the alliance states. The real reason they are poor is that they lack jobs with good wages. An estimated 40 percent of A.F.D.C. participants have some work history, but the jobs they held do not pay a living wage, offer benefits or provide long-term security. As a result, many people alternate work with welfare as the economy expands and contracts.
Nine studies in other states of the effects of eliminating or reducing General Assistance, which deals primarily with single adults, found that clients fared significantly worse after the cuts, said Irene Glasser, a professor in the department of sociology and anthropology at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.
Although the cuts were aimed at welfare recipients ready for employment, Ms. Glasser said, the labor market did not absorb most of those people. Instead, they were forced to rely on shelters and soup kitchens for survival, and the clients' overall health and ability deteriorated.
There were 12,400 people on General Assistance in Connecticut in 1988-89. By 1991-92, as unemployment rose, the number had risen to about 32,600.
The Connecticut Association of Local Administrators of General Assistance supports the idea of spreading the cost of local welfare more equally, since the poorest cities and towns with the highest case loads pay the greatest amount. But it opposes the General Assembly's moves during the last two years to shift General Assistance from the municipalities to the state.
Local welfare directors, who understand their communities and residents, do not trust the state to deal properly with clients. "We care about the communities in which we work," the association said in a report asking that the issue be given another look. "We fear that the present course will leave them in a worse position than they are at present."
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, an organization of town and city officials, favors either turning General Assistance over to the state or reimbursing all local costs. "Instead, takeover has been put off, and reimbursements have been cut," the manager of legislative services for the group, Gian-Carlo Casa, said.
In 1992, the General Assembly provided that the state assume the administration of General Assistance beginning July 1, 1994. But in 1993, it delayed the plan for two years. And Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s tentative 1995-96 budget proposed a further delay until 1998 and elimination of employable people from city welfare rolls by next year.
Meanwhile, under a program, called A Fair Chance, which attempts to remove some of the obstacles that prevent people from becoming independent, welfare recipients who work are allowed to keep more of their income and education, job training and opportunities for child care are being expanded.
Pathways, the first of the program's two pilot projects, places a two-year limit on benefits for randomly selected A.F.D.C. recipients in New Haven and Manchester. During the first two years, according to the plan, welfare recipients get help seeking jobs, and those who are not prepared receive education and training. At the end of two years, they are required to take a job or participate in work-related activities. Pathways also establishes a child support assurance system, which guarantees parents a monthly payment under certain guidelines.
The second pilot project, Family Strength, provides, among other things, an increase in the limit on A.F.D.C. clients' assets from $1,000 to $3,000, excluding the value of one non-luxury car. In addition, families may qualify for A.F.D.C. even if both parents are in the home.
"We were concerned that the message we sent out was that it wasn't good to have both parents in the home," said Nancy Wiggett, manager of the family support team for the state's Department of Social Services. "We'd much rather send a message that if the parents want to be together but are having financial trouble, we will help them."
While Family Strength is offered statewide, it will be tested only in New Haven and Manchester. Pathways, also being tested only in the two cities, can be expanded to other sites if it is successful. The social services department will run the seven-year projects.
"It's not just changing programs. It means changing a culture for both our staff and clients," Ms. Wiggett said. "Under the old program, the culture was to make sure people had the right amount of money, and then they were left on their own. Now there is more emphasis on encouraging people to go to work, even if they can't right now. The message of combining work with welfare for a while is a new one to clients and the staff."
Paul Russillo, program supervisor in the Manchester office of the social services department, said "If clients get the necessary training, they can at least go out and compete in the job market and find something. Maybe the best some people will get is a job that pays minimum wage or a little higher. Others may never be totally independent."
In that case, Mr. Russillo said, "We'll give them only a partial check. So, there's still some savings."
Sixty percent of the 750 welfare clients cut from Bridgeport's rolls last April, or about 450 people, are back on welfare for various reasons. The city takes a group of people off the rolls every month. New applicants for welfare are told that their benefits will be stopped after nine months. "But we tell them we'll work with them to get them into permanent employment. In nine months, we expect to do that," Ms. Curry added.
The city formed a partnership in 1992 with businesses and training schools in greater Bridgeport that offers job training for welfare clients. Those who complete the courses successfully are offered employment. More than 800 of the city's 2,200 able clients have been placed in permanent jobs in road construction, automobile repair and rehabilitation of blighted properties, Ms. Curry said. "There is work in the trades," she added. "We put clients into 16 or 17 apprentice programs."
The city provides clients with transportation to work for about 60 days, and social workers and employment counselors instruct them in personal hygiene and workplace behavior. "Individual attention is important," Ms. Curry said, "so that we can spot alcohol, day care or other family problems. Working with a small number enables us to see what the problems are."
As Ms. Curry describes the current mood, in which welfare money is considered money owed: "There is a drive to have some sort of accountability for the money loaned, and there is resentment for the money loaned. We try to let our welfare population know these changes are coming down."

HEADLINE: Off Welfare, and Into Self-Employment

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
SUSAN MAYBIN, who is divorced, held three or four jobs at once to support herself and her five children. Then she burned out. "I worked seven days a week," said Ms. Maybin, who lives in Norwich. "I realized my children were lacking a mother. I became overwhelmed and had to stop working."
Still, she held on to her dream of someday starting a nonprofit agency, a sort of extended family that would provide people who care for others with parenting classes, support groups, help with money management and child care and job information. "You have to have a stable domestic front if you want to pursue a career and get off welfare," Ms. Maybin said. 
 After years of experience as a counselor for rape victims, pregnant teen-agers and people with schizophrenia, Ms. Maybin felt she had the tools to start her own business.
A phone call led her to the Entrepreneurial Center in Norwich, a branch of the center at Hartford College for Women, which prepares low-income people and welfare recipients for starting their own businesses. Skills sometimes taken for granted, like managing on a small income, being flexible and making the best use of limited resources, are the ones that make a good business owner, according to the center.
Founded in 1985 and funded by the state's Department of Economic Development, the center has a 50 percent success rate for graduates starting their own businesses, said the assistant director, Marge Blizard, who owns a housecleaning service. The center's 12-week course covers marketing and advertising, bookkeeping, taxes, legal issues, insurance, negotiating and sales techniques, balancing personal and business roles and establishing credit.
Members of the group who met recently in Norwich said the course is changing their lives. Deborah Sage, who lives in Colchester with her mother and two children, receives state welfare benefits. She also earns $180 a month working one day a week. After the state deducts her earnings from her cash and food stamp allotments, her earnings amount to $2 a month, she said. "It wasn't worth going to work," she said. Ms. Sage plans to start a business that provides personal services like bookkeeping, shopping and deliveries.
Gene Champagne of Ledyard was a carpenter before he was injured on the job and went on unemployment. Also a singer and song writer, Mr. Champagne is trying to find a place in southeastern Connecticut's tourism and entertainment business. "I want to become an owner, not a loaner," he said, referring to the idea that those getting public assistance owe it back in some sense.
George Hnatowicz of Bozrah was devastated after he was laid off from his welding and is living on I.O.U.'s, he said. "I figured I would have that job until I retired. It was an ending but also a beginning for me." Mr. Hnatowicz plans to run a grease removal service for restaurants.
Owning a business is not for everyone, Ms. Blizard said. A first step is a four-session self-assessment workshop to help would-be entrepreneurs decide whether they are suited to the role. "These people are motivated and self-directed," she said. And the community helps. A bank in the Norwich area has agreed to give one participant, Brendia Merchant, an unsecured loan to open a consignment clothing store. The Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce sets up meetings with members of the business community.
So far, 420 people have completed training at the Entrepreneurial Center, and there are plans to open a branch in Bridgeport in January, the director of the program, Donna Wertenbach, said. She is concerned, however, that under welfare reform programs self-employment may not be considered an acceptable alternative, that welfare recipients are expected to enter a work program after two years of benefits. "We're almost going back to square one to establish this as legitimate," Ms. Wertenbach said.
To members of the Norwich class, however, the point is simple: Each new business creates employment for others.

WINTER HABITAT
 The waters off Norwalk have been chosen by some harbor seals as a nice place to spend the winter. Ever watchful for ways to keep the public in touch with the sea, the Maritime Center on North Water Street last year ran Creature Cruises to view the seals, and it will do so again every Sunday from Jan. 8 to March 26, weather permitting.
Sailing times aboard the research vessel Oceanic will vary with the tides, and since only one cruise will be offered each Sunday, reservations should be made early. 
 The seals, including some gray seals down from Maine and Canada, have increased in number to the point that last year about 40 of them were observed sunning themselves on the rocks and shoals at low tide.
Staff educators from the Maritime Center will provide commentary on the seals and on many winter birds to be seen along the way. Binoculars and warm clothes are strongly recommended. The fee is $15. One may call 852-0700, extension 206, for reservations or more information.
 
CHRISTMAS TREES
 Almost 100 members of Connecticut's Christmas Tree Growers Association are open for business, squiring customers around their tree farms, helping them cut a tree or cutting it for them. Every county in the state has a dozen or more tree farms listed in an Agriculture Department brochure, and a call to 566-3571 or 566-4845 will put customers in touch with the nearest one.
The state's Agriculture Department says the best way to buy a tree is fresh at the farm. Trees grown in Canada and Western states were cut at least a month earlier and shipped. There is the distinct possibility that they will shed needles long before the end of the holidays.
Among the oldest and largest of the cut-your-own farms is the 400-acre Jones Family Farm on Israel Hill Road in Shelton, where the tradition began 60 years ago. The first trees that were sold there in the 1930's were grown for a 4-H project that Philip Jones Jr. started in the backwoods of the family's dairy farm. The property was originally settled about 140 years ago by Philip James Jones, and the sixth generation, Jamie Jones, is now a horticulture major at Cornell University.
The farm, which is open daily until Christmas from 9 to 5:30, allows customers to cut their own trees. Large trees, hauled by a tree-tram and wrapped by the staff, cost around $40 with tax. Saws are available to borrow. Smaller trees, fresh cut and ready to take away, start at around $19, and there are living trees for sale as well, to plant in one's own backyard. Santa is in the barn from 1 to 5 each day, surrounded by a wide selection of wreaths and garlands and all the usual trappings of the holiday, and tree buyers get a pewter ornament to take home. Call 929-6235 for more information.
 
WREATHS AND FLOWERS
 Custom-made Christmas wreaths and holiday floral arrangements are available at Cricket Hill Garden in Thomaston. Kasha and David Furman, the owners, built their reputation on an exceptional array of Chinese tree peonies that bloom in the spring, but for the past few years they have added Christmas arrangements, turning the business into a sort of May-December affair.
Using real sugared fruit, lemons and oranges studded with cloves, roses, dendrobium orchids, holly, ivy, berries, as well as just about any material anyone wants, the establishment will dream up unusual wreaths, garlands, table centerpieces and arrangements for mantle pieces.
Some arrangements are on display and may be purchased, but "we like to have people come in and discuss their preferences," said Kasha Furman. "Sometimes they want to match the dining room wallpaper, or they are committed to a particular flower. It's hard to do over the phone." Prices range from $35 to $75, and a custom order takes about three days to complete. Delivery is possible at extra charge. More information: 283-1042 or 283-4707.
 
BUILDING BLOCKS
 An archway of giant blocks leading to a children's village of castles, bridges, towers, cabins and cottages will be on view in the main gallery at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center today from 1 to 5, Monday through Thursday from 9 to 5, and Friday from 9 to noon. Call 322-1646 for Christmas-week hours.
Covering a period from the mid-1800's to the present, the exhibition was put together from every kind of building block and interlocking construction set dear to the hearts of children of all ages.
A rare set of Crandall's Interlocking Blocks from 1867, Hill's Alphabet Blocks from 1858, and Richter's Anchor Blocks from 1900 are some of the golden oldies, while Bilt-E-Z and Legos form some of the 20th-century structures. In addition, an area has been set aside for children to create their own buildings.
The antique components are on loan from the Stamford Historical Society and several individual collectors, the contemporary blocks were provided by toy stores, and a child psychologist, Dr. Patricia Grimes, served as a consultant.
The museum is on Scofieldtown Road at the junction of High Ridge Road. Admission is $4, $3 for children 5 to 13 and older people, free for children under 5.
 
WORKING HISTORY
 A new limited edition print by Andrew N. Wyeth, titled "Millgirl at No. Four," was unveiled recently at the Windham Textile and History Museum in Willimantic, and will be for sale until the end of the year. One thousand prints, some of which have already been sold, are priced at $45 each.
The museum itself offers an unusual view of the history of the textile industry in Connecticut and the people who worked in the local mills throughout the Industrial Revolution and into this century. It is open to visitors at 157 Union-Main Street from Thursday through Sunday year round, noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $3, $2 for older people and students. More information: 456-2178.
 
GAY NETWORKING
 The Connecticut Business Guild, formed in April of this year as a statewide networking association for gay and lesbian business people will hold a holiday buffet dinner on Monday at 6:30 at Cafe 1150, 1150 Chapel Street in New Haven. Reservations cost $12 and may be made by calling 278-6666, extension 104.
The guild has 60 members, including lawyers, accountants, financial planners, travel agents, restaurateurs, retailers and people in the media. It has created a business-to-business directory as a first step in its commitment to promoting economic growth for its members.
Presentations for executives, professionals and business owners are planned throughout the year at meetings to be held in various parts of the state. Dues are $50 a year. The same phone number may be called for more information about the organization. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Social Studies Panel Hopeful Despite Delay

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
WHAT should students know after 12 years of social studies and how should they learn it? Members of a state-appointed committee, who spent nearly three years drafting a framework for a new social-studies curriculum, say they expect to save the core of a plan that failed to win the approval last month of the State Education Commissioner, Dr. Thomas Sobol.
Daniel Berman, chairman of the social studies department at Fox Lane High School in Bedford and the only county representative on the 18-member committee, said he felt "much better" about the framework's future since he and others met in Albany recently with Dr. Sobol and an assistant commissioner, Edward T. Lalor. 
 "It's not an issue of diversity," Mr. Berman said, referring to the multicultural aspects of the 120-page plan, which has not been made public. "The major need is to make sure the document is clearly understood by the public as well as by professionals in the field."
Contrary to published reports, Dr. Sobol will neither dissolve the Social Studies Committee nor discard the framework, said Christopher Carpenter, a spokesman for the Education Department. "In a nutshell, things will be added to it," Mr. Carpenter said, observing that the department had "studiously avoided any speculation" about specific changes. "Three social-studies-curriculum writers will work on it, and then it will go back to the committee," Mr. Carpenter said, adding that he expected the revisions to be completed by spring. The framework will be made public when it is presented to the State Board of Regents, which must approve all curriculum changes.
While many courses of study are being redesigned on a national level and by states, New York has had particular trouble with social studies. Two earlier efforts to revise the curriculum -- "The Curriculum of Inclusion" in 1989 and "One Nation, Many Peoples" in 1991 -- were rejected. "There has been enormous controversy in the past over this thing," Mr. Carpenter said. "People tend to tear away at this like a dog with a bone."
In writing its document, "The Social Studies Curriculum Framework," Mr. Berman said the committee grappled with eight "overarching goals" in the areas of American and world history, economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, geography, philosophy and psychology. He said the most controversial of the goals dealt with the ways Americans are "unified yet diverse" and how the multiple perspectives of blacks, women and other groups can be understood. "Do you teach the canon of the textbooks, or introduce real political perspective?" Mr. Berman said.
Mr. Berman said the committee's discussions reflected the national debate over the role that diverse viewpoints should play in education. "I think we found an excellent balance," he said of the committee's plan. "I think its not a radical document." In keeping with the state's Compact for Learning, a blueprint for educational reform, the committee was asked to devise a structure that would allow schools flexibility in carrying out the curriculum. Mr. Carpenter said that such an effort, in which frameworks rather than specific curriculums are adopted for different subjects, had never been undertaken before.
A separate debate about the framework concerns the elimination of economics and government as distinct half-year courses in 12th grade. In an effort to interconnect subject areas, Mr. Berman said the committee had recommended integrating those subjects into other social-studies courses, a move that Dr. Peter F. Bell, executive director of the State Council on Economic Education, said "would put back the cause of economic education about 10 years." He attributed the suggestion in part to the absence of anyone from the field of economics on the committee.
After the Board of Regents made economics mandatory in high school in 1986, the state council began a continuing series of workshops for social studies teachers, many of whom had only the slightest acquaintance with the subject. Partly state financed in the past, the council, based in Purchase, now operates with private funds to infuse economics into school programs as early as elementary school.
Dr. Bell, an associate professor who has taught economics at Purchase College for 22 years, said that only when schools were required to teach economics did they hire teachers with a background in the subject.
Steven A. Goldberg, president of the New York State Council for the Social Studies, said dropping economics as a mandate might wrongly suggest that the subject "is no longer important" for students. "It's clearly a controversial issue," said Mr. Goldberg. "But social studies always seems to be in the forefront of controversy."

Law Teacher Tutors The Owners on Perils That Might Lie Ahead

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
When Richard Ravitch was chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York in the early 1980's, an outside counsel to the M.T.A. was Lewis Kaden. When Ravitch more recently was trying to induce major league club owners to agree to a revenue-sharing plan, he sought legal opinion on what voting requirement would be appropriate for the adoption of a plan. The lawyer he asked was Lewis Kaden.
Ravitch, who has resigned as the owners' chief labor executive, effective at the end of the year when his contract expires, was not at the owners' meeting in Chicago last Thursday, but Lewis Kaden was. 
 Kaden was there at the invitation of the Mets and the Toronto Blue Jays, two of the few opponents among the owners of the plan to declare an impasse in negotiations with the players and implement a salary cap. A well-known New York lawyer, Kaden also teaches labor and antitrust courses as an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, a combination that made him peculiarly qualified to speak to the owners on matters most relevant to them.
Kaden addressed the owners on the perils they may face before the National Labor Relations Board as a result of their strategy in the fruitless negotiations.
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, declined to discuss Kaden's appearance, but another person who attended the meeting said, "He gave a good assessment of the risks."
Other people who were in the room offered a more comprehensive report of what the lawyer told the owners, all speaking on the condition they not be identified because, one said, "We had the riot act read to us about keeping quiet."
Kaden, they related, talked specifically about the complaint issued by the N.L.R.B. against the owners for their failure to make a $7.8 million pension payment Aug. 1 and generally about impasse and implementation.
If the board substantiates the pension complaint, Kaden was quoted as telling the owners, it could ultimately undermine their contention that they negotiated in good faith and truly had reached impasse. Proving that an impasse existed, he said, is as difficult as proving there wasn't an impasse, but he said the owners created uncertainty by not making the pension payment.
Warning of the potential risks of impasse/implementation, Kaden explained the potential antitrust ramifications if a court, in a lawsuit filed by the players, should hold that the antitrust exemption does not cover the owners' labor activity.
The players, Kaden said, have to overcome many obstacles to make their charges stick, but if they succeed, the owners would face such serious consequences -- he suggested the possibility of damages reaching hundreds of millions of dollars -- that they should evaluate the risks against the potential of the mediation route.
One of the risks they face, Kaden reminded the owners, is "joint and several liability," meaning if a monetary judgment were so great that some clubs couldn't pay their shares, the unpaid shares would accrue to those clubs that could pay.
One person who related Kaden's remarks said he appeared to be troubled by the direction the owners are headed. But 25 owners apparently preferred the advice of their lawyers. They voted for impasse and implementation. Only the Mets, Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles voted no.
 
Replacements, Pro and Con
 The use of replacement players was another topic of discussion at the owners' meeting.
Peter Angelos said the Orioles would not use replacement players. He punctuated his comments by talking about the importance to Baltimore and to baseball of Cal Ripken's consecutive-game streak that would come to an end if the clubs played regular-season games.
Paul Beeston said the Blue Jays are prohibited by Ontario provincial law from using replacement workers, but he added, "We wouldn't use them if the law didn't prohibit it."
Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies spoke after Angelos, pounded the table and said the clubs have to use replacements if the striking players don't play. It's the only step available to the clubs, he said.
 
Salary Cap 101
 Dan Duquette of the Boston Red Sox most likely echoed the thoughts of all of the general managers who had just undergone a briefing on the new economic system, a k a the salary cap, the owners still plan to impose on the players.
Asked what he learned in the briefing, Duquette said, "I learned I need to learn more."
For some of the general managers, sitting in the ballroom at the O'Hare Hilton last Thursday must have reminded them of the days when they sat in a large lecture hall in college listening to a boring lecture in a boring course, maybe even economics, they had to take.
They didn't want to be there, they didn't want to learn the subject and they never were going to need whatever it was they were learning.
In this instance, though, the general managers can only hope they never will need what they learned in Salary Cap 101.
"Here's what you have to know if you have to know it," Joe McIlvaine of the Mets said, describing the seminar conducted by management lawyers. "It's very confusing."
 
Yankees' Risky Trade
 Before fearlessly trading for Jack McDowell, the Yankees considered him along with three other pitchers, Kevin Appier of Kansas City and two free agents, Kevin Brown, formerly of Texas, and Bill Swift, most recently of San Francisco. They opted for McDowell even though his are the most uncertain circumstances.
McDowell could become a restricted free agent if the owners implement their Nov. 17 proposal, which includes free agency with right of first refusal for players who have been in the major leagues between four and six years. Or he could become an unrestricted free agent if an arbitrator rules that players should receive service credit for the 52 days of the strike.
What kind of free agent will McDowell be? "A high-priced one," a players' lawyer said.
 
Lucchino Back in the Game
 John Moores, a Texas software millionaire, is buying the Padres a couple of years too late to salvage a prospective pennant contender for San Diego. The 15-man ownership group, headed by Tom Werner, decided to decimate the team rather than fulfill its commitment to the city.
When the sale, which major league owners approved last week, is completed in a couple of weeks, the Werner group will remain as minority partners with about 10 percent of the club. Larry Lucchino, former president of the Orioles and a teammate of Bill Bradley at Princeton, will also own about 10 percent and is expected to be the club's president and chief executive officer.
Major league baseball can't be in critical condition if Lucchino is so eager to get back in. He also led a group that probably could have bought the Pirates in his hometown of Pittsburgh, but the city's prolonged process for finding a buyer prompted him to abandon that effort and go with Moores.
"We recognize these are uncertain times to be jumping into this process, but we're willing to take a risk and make a commitment," Lucchino said. "You have to believe in the city and the potential of the market, and you have to believe in the resilience of the game."
 
According to His Needs?
 From the looks of the owners' tax proposal that last week was on and off the table in 48 hours and could return this week in a variation, Fred Wilpon of the Mets must have written it. How else explain the windfall the Mets would receive in the first year of the transition phase, a payment of $1,996,000 instead of a contribution to the revenue-sharing pool of $3,365,000 under the players' proposal. That's a net plus to the Mets of $5,361,000.
Bud Selig, on the other hand, would lose $3,021,000 under the owners' plan compared with the one the players presented. How could the acting commissioner have allowed that document to reach the table?
It certainly raised serious questions about the owners' oft-stated desire to raise money for low-revenue clubs from contributions from high-revenue clubs.
The Mets rank sixth in projected 1994 revenue (based on a full season) and certainly don't need economic assistance, but the owners' plan would reward clubs with high revenues and low payrolls (the Mets rank No. 21 there). Help the low-revenue clubs? The San Diego Padres, 27th in revenue, would receive $10.2 million under the players' plan, only $5.5 million under the owners' proposal.
A person on the players' side said the clubs' negotiators have said several times at the bargaining table that this dispute is not about big markets-small markets, then amended their statements to say that's part of it but not entirely.
In another difference in the plans, the clubs would give money to the recipient clubs on a gradual basis -- 40 percent the first year, 60 percent the second, 80 percent the third and finally reaching 100 percent the fourth. The players would generate 100 percent of the money from the start.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
Baseball Fan: Heal Thyself

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
We came back after the Fix of 1919 and we came back after the Abandonment of 1957 and we'll come back after the Strikeout of 1994, sadder Budweiser, wearing our rally caps, salary caps, dunce caps, backward, of course. We need to be tested every four decades or so to prove that fan is short for fantasist.
"We're the problem," said Roger Sims, an acknowledged fan. "We have this unrealistic view of who they are, and what our relationship is. The owners are truly from another planet, these gray old men who smell of cologne, but what did we ever do about the reserve clause or the antitrust exemption? And the players haven't been one of us in years, but we still demand some connection between our lives and theirs, just because we need them so much. 
 "Which is the point. We are junkies. We will forgive and forget as soon as the next season starts. And so what? Baseball don't mean nothing. That's what's so good about it."
Sims, who played baseball briefly at Howard University 35 years ago and who was loving last season because the Yankees were winning, lost interest when the conversation got to Bud Selig and Darryl Strawberry, who will probably be the handiest effigies for those looking to hang Poor Sportsmen of the Year from columns and wrap-ups. Why can owners collude and players be in a position to take money under the table and all we can do is wax nostalgic?
"Two stories," said Sims, who was watching a night rain bat on his condo windows in Everett, Wash. "In 1948, my grandfather took me to my first baseball game, in Wrigley Field. Loved that place. I held his hand as we walked in, and he said, 'If anyone asks you your favorite Cub, say Phil Cavarretta.'
"I waited the whole game but no one came up to us. I mean, who interrogates an old black man and a fat 10-year-old at a ball game? But holding my granddad's hand and baseball and Phil Cavarretta are mixed up in my mind forever. That's why I'm a fan. How could it have anything to do with right now. I mean, Gregg Jefferies. How many millions?
"And some years after that, when I was living in New York, I was waiting outside Yankee Stadium, too cool to rush for autographs, just watching other kids run after the players, and here comes Hector Lopez, and he's friendly and he signs for everybody and he talks while he's doing it and then he goes off to the subway. I remember the little half moons of sweat under his armpits. To the subway. So his fielding wasn't always perfect. You better not call him Whatta Pair of Hands Lopez in front of me unless you're smiling."
Having established his credentials, Sims turned a little mean. "We keep talking about the greedy owners and the greedy players, but what about the third corner of that triangle, the greedy fan? Emotionally greedy for a romance that never existed. We helped create all this. They know we'll be here when it's over. So how will anything ever change?"
Nevertheless, there are theories of change: a young generation of fan will be lost to multimedia, for example, less of a blow to club-owning corporations already in that field than to players; the bursting economic bubble will send players' salaries sliding back toward their fans', and fans will return but emotionally distance themselves from the game to prevent further disappointments.
Maybe fans will take a closer look. The reflexive bashing of owners is based on the Figaro complex, the common man reaffirming his fate as servant by railing at the master for not being perfect. Did we really expect owners to be smarter, more virtuous than players because they're richer? On the other hand, owners ARE the future of the game because they amass the capital, create the arena and meet the payroll, which is at least as important as throwing and catching. In the history of the game, Bud Selig is more important than Paul Molitor, and has done far more to keep it going.
That players are not necessarily smarter and more virtuous than fans may even be excusable, certainly understandable. Fans masquerading as parents, teachers, lovers and friends have been letting these adolescents off the hook all their lives so long as they performed. And as soon as they get into trouble, we wonder how they could be so ungrateful. Some compassion, please.
How much of Strawberry's current problems for allegedly taking card show fees without declaring it grew out of the addict's need for unaccountable cash?
"C'mon," Sims said. "That's just another hero-with-feet-of-clay story. You guys love that. Build 'em up and knock 'em down. Look, the world didn't end without baseball, which is good. It means we can keep on being fans. As much as we love and need it, baseball don't mean nothing. It's based on unrealistic expectations. Enough for now. I'm just gonna wait for the new season." It was getting late, even on the West Coast, and his voice sounded dreamy.
"When I get to the hereafter," he said, and it was hard to tell if he meant heaven or spring training, "I've got two questions to ask granddad: Is he proud of the way I turned out? Why Phil Cavarretta?"

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring 

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
All Hail the Conquering Middle Class (Whoever They Are)
Clearly, the belles of the post-election ball are the middle class; politicians everywhere are groveling before these poor, forgotten souls. But who, exactly, are they? Magnanimous Republicans brandish tax cuts for the under-$200,000 set -- which, of course, is practically everyone (99 percent of taxpayers). Now comes President Clinton, hearing this drummer loud and clear, with a "middle-class bill of rights" featuring tax cuts for a far narrower group, families with incomes up to $75,000 to $100,000 or so. Both sides, of course, insist that this headlong rush to cut taxes will not add to the deficit, but that math remains murky. And even as he fell into political step, Mr. Clinton vowed to put "politics as usual dead last," but everyone -- right or left, culture or counterculture -- knew the awful truth: that the '96 campaign was officially open for business. 

The Mayor of Nottingham?
At first glance, Mayor Giuliani seemed like a dyslexic Robin Hood last week -- taking from the poor, giving to the rich. For even as New York's budget director, Abraham Lackman, disclosed plans to slash city poverty programs by 25 percent, Mr. Giuliani proposed real estate tax breaks for the Wall Street area -- hardly known as the needy's habitat. But Mr. Lackman defended the cuts by noting that the city has the nation's highest per-capita welfare spending -- and that the budget gap must be closed. And the mayor's office, noting the high vacancy rates in lower Manhattan, insisted that the incentives would mean more tax revenues, not less. Even Ruth Messinger, often a critic of tax breaks, called it a "well-thought-out blueprint." But then there's the poor . . .
 
If It's Worthless, Who'd Want It?
Companies love to post high earnings -- that's their main public report card -- but they also like to be generous with top executives. One method to have it both ways: give stock options, which, one could argue, have no value (and no impact on earnings). But options are nice goodies, because recipients can win but can't lose. The F.A.S.B. wanted to change this system -- which Senator Carl Levin called a "sham" -- and wanted to make companies report options' value as a current expense. But last week, under intense political and corporate pressure, the agency backed down. There was talk of putting the option value in footnotes -- but footnotes are, well, footnotes.
 
Orange County Digs Out
It's the morning after in Orange County -- no, make that "mourning." The county was picking up various pieces last week -- vowing, first, to just sell that blasting headache known as its investment fund, its loss at $2 billion and counting. Selling it will end the "and counting" part -- the pain will have a precise face. But this gets messy when it gets local: $2 billion out of a $7.5 billion fund sounds abstract, bloodless. But if 27 percent has to be cut everywhere, there are screams. Some loud screams came from schools, which insisted that they should get all their money -- that, being required to invest in the fund, they're exempt. Then again, a lot of people could call themselves exempt, but the money just isn't there.
 
Passive Smoke, Active Lawsuit
Smokers regularly sue tobacco companies for damages, so far without success. But last week a Miami judge allowed flight attendants to file a class-action suit -- the first involving secondhand smoke. While the E.P.A. says secondhand smoke kills up to 3,000 people a year, the tobacco industry denies it. "Tobacco companies have lied for 40 years about the effects of active smoking," said Stanley Rosenblatt, the flight attendants' lawyer. This case, he said, would show that they're using "precisely the same line of attack" to minimize nonsmokers' risks.
 
COMPANIES
 
I'm a Bank Spy, So Behave
Some people harbor the erroneous notion that mutual funds sold at banks are federally insured. How many such misguided souls are there? Pick your study. The S.E.C. says 28 percent; the banking industry puts it at 5 percent. Whatever the number, though, the F.D.I.C. wants to be sure banks disclose the risks, but it's being oddly public about its method. Last week it said it had hired a company to visit banks anonymously to make sure they level with customers. Some critics cried entrapment, but there's also the question of the effectiveness of a sting when everyone's gotten a loud warning. Not to worry, the F.D.I.C. said -- it will have a "salutary effect" on banks not visited.
 
Too-Easy Mortgage Money?
Once again, the free-wheeling 80's may be back to haunt bankers. Federal prosecutors say Dime Savings was often less than scrupulous in granting mortgages, lending money to unqualified borrowers simply to generate fees. Last week it turned out that a United States Attorney's office in New Hampshire is investigating Dime for possible fraud. One possibility being looked into is whether Dime wrapped up some of those iffy mortgages into packages to be sold to investors -- in other words, passing along the shaky products of its shortsightedness to people who thought they were buying something nice and safe.
 
Planes, Trains and . . .
Two bits of news last week had a certain "Gift of the Magi" quality to them (you know: He sells watch for combs; she sells hair for watch chain). After another fatal commuter plane crash -- the second in six weeks -- Transportation Secretary Pena pushed ahead for stricter safety rules for short-hop carriers. One plane, the ATR-72, has been barred from flying when it's icy, and some travelers glanced about nervously for alternatives . . . but even as this was unfolding, Amtrak -- a logical alternative for short trips -- said it would cut back sharply on its routes. Faced with an annual deficit of nearly $200 million, Amtrak will trim more than a fifth of the miles it travels, scrapping some routes entirely, like the New York-Vermont-Montreal run. That, of course, leaves driving, the deadliest method of all.
 
Who's Got the Pentium?
Enough already with the Pentium jokes! (Can't resist? Turn, if you must, to page 11.) The serious point is that it's already mind-boggling for a mortal non-techie to pick the "right" personal computer in that sea of megabytes. So last week, after I.B.M. suspended sales of its PC's that use the flawed Intel Pentium chip, shoppers felt lost. Does the Pentium, as Intel insists, make tiny errors only once in several millennia? Or, as I.B.M. now says, far more often? And how, in the name of Cyberspace, can you possibly make a many-thousand-dollar decision unless you know? Well, first pick a number between 1 and 9.98978695 . . .
 
Mme. Gres, 89; the Illusion, 91
Yes, of course, the purpose of fashion is to create an illusion, but this is pretty extreme. For the past year, the French designer Alix Gres has been much in evidence -- being quoted as saying, for instance, that she was "greatly touched" by colleagues' comments about a retrospective of her work at the Metropolitan Museum. As for Mme. Gres, whose dresses were known for their "Grecian draping," she "doesn't want to be disturbed," her daughter kept saying. And, no, she was not disturbed for quite a while: she had, after all, died over a year ago at the age of 89. Her daughter carefully shielded this fact until the news broke last week, shocking and puzzling former colleagues. Why the secret? "To protect her," her daughter said, and out of respect for Mme. Gres's older sister. Perhaps. Or just a refusal to let an illusion die?
 
Fiber Optics, Worldwide
Just to put the Orange County loss in perspective: with a little over half that $2 billion, you could lay 17,000 miles of fiber optic cable under the world's oceans. Well, AT&T could anyway. Last week it landed a $1.2 billion contract to lay such a cable, the world's longest, connecting Britain and Japan (by way of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea). The 14-month project will take five ships, dragging remote-control-equipped tractors along the sea floor, digging ditches where necessary. The resulting cable will be able to carry 320,000 messages, voice and otherwise.
 
Not So Fast, Morgan Stanley
On that Morgan Stanley-S.G. Warburg merger: Never mind. Yes, Morgan would have gotten a valuable foothold in Europe (ditto for Warburg here), but no one, it seemed, asked the folks at Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's independently run fund manager. They knew Morgan wanted Mercury, so they figured there should be some premium, but when they asked, Morgan refused; when no one blinked, the deal collapsed. That left Morgan saying it did not need to search for another partner, but the thinking was that if Warburg wants to go global, it will need an American partner.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Sharp Unveils a New Breed of Personal Digital Assistant

BYLINE: By Laurie Flynn 

 BODY:
IT'S probably never a good idea to name any new computing device after the dinosaurs, particularly when the competitive landscape for the product is already full of tar pits and carcasses. But Sharp Electronics, in announcing the Zaurus last week, said it picked the name -- derived from the "saur" in dinosaur -- to indicate it was taking an "evolutionary" step in personal digital assistants.
I'm still a bit puzzled by that throwback logic. But I'll concede that in many ways, the Zaurus does effectively mark the end of one age and the beginning of another. For the first time in a hand-held computing device, a company has found a way to build a truly usable keyboard into a unit that also allows use of a stylus for entering data and writing notes in "electronic ink." 
 The Zaurus isn't scheduled to reach the market until the middle of next month. But when it does, it seems certain to stir up the fern forest.
Already, Sharp owns at least 60 percent of the market for personal digital assistants, or P.D.A.'s, with its Wizard line, ranking far ahead of Hewlett-Packard, Casio, Apple Computer and other competitors past and present. In 1993, Wizards accounted for almost 800,000 of the total 1.27 million P.D.A.'s that were shipped, according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market research company.
But like the Wizard before it, the Zaurus uses a proprietary operating system and Sharp's own non-standard chip, which makes it hard for some software developers to justify writing programs for it. As a result, Sharp risks relegating itself to a market niche, some analysts say. The company might be better served by helping the industry create a P.D.A. hardware and software standard, a "reference platform" that was available to anybody who wanted to use it, said Kimball Brown, a Dataquest analyst. Otherwise, Mr. Brown said, Sharp could get left behind.
But that's not to say the Zaurus won't sell. At $500 to $600, the street price of the Zaurus is low enough to win it some converts among business people who spend a lot of time away from their desks.
Dan Glover, manager of field operations for a large East Coast pharmaceutical company, is considering buying as many as 3,000 Zauruses -- Zauri? -- for the company's field sales staff. He particularly likes the keyboard, which at roughly 4 by 7 inches is large enough and sturdy enough to allow bona fide word processing but is still small enough for easy portability. (Despite its monstrous name, the Zaurus weighs less than a pound.)
Mr. Glover also likes the fact that Sharp, which produced its own licensed version of the original and notorious Apple Newton, has realized that current handwriting recognition systems simply don't convert handwriting to computer text with enough accuracy to satisfy most people. Instead, with its digital ink capabilities, the Zaurus relies on handwriting that the computer stores as just that -- handwriting.
Technically speaking, the Zaurus is nicely implemented, with a crisper screen than the Wizard and a battery life of about 60 hours on two AA batteries. It lacks the flashy look of some of its competitors, like the Sony MagicLink or Apple Newton, but appears to make up for it in its utility.
A credit card-size PCMCIA slot will let users add additional memory or communications devices, including wireless links through cellular fax-modems and pagers. There's no mouse or trackball; the small pen that drops out of a little slot in the side is intended for use as a navigation device as well as a handwriting tool.
The idea with the Zaurus is to make it easy for people to communicate while on the road, and to exchange files with their office desktop computers -- whether remotely over phone lines or, once back at the office, by "squirting" out the data through the Zaurus's built-in infrared connector.
Given the rising popularity of messaging, Sharp could be on the right track. Gerry Purdy, editor of the Mobile Letter, an industry newsletter published in Cupertino, Calif., said the Zaurus seems to be an ideal device for two-way wireless paging, electronic mail and for "Internet on the go."
Initially, the Zaurus will come with a fairly complete collection of programs for managing your time, your contacts and your electronic correspondence, and Sharp is hoping that's enough for many people. Then once there are plenty of Zauri stalking the earth, software developers may have some incentive to create other uses for it, said Scott Campbell, marketing manager for the product.
But the software developers, the people who create more specialized application programs like expense-account trackers and trip planners, will have to wait until late next year for Sharp to provide the necessary software development tools, Mr. Campbell said.
"We see the Zaurus as an appliance, not a platform," Mr. Campbell said. "That's not to say we don't see third party applications as important, we do. But we want it to work right out of the box."
But some analysts are skeptical that Sharp will be able to drum up much interest from developers, even once the tools are available. And at the announcement last Thursday, only a few companies were on hand to endorse the device.
Compuserve Inc. said it would offer software to enable Zaurus users to connect with Compuserve's on-line network. And Logix Inc. of Denville, N.J., is working on an application for pharmacists, which would allow a doctor to write out a prescription on a Zaurus and immediately have it transmitted through a phone or wireless communications network to a pharmacy's computer system.
One thing the Zaurus does have working in its favor with developers is that the user can install software directly into into the system's main memory by downloading it from a personal computer -- a capability similar to that of the Apple Newton. With Sharp's Wizard, it has always been necessary to buy special add-in cards containing the software.
That said, the Zaurus is not intended to supplant Sharp's Wizard line as much as it is to extend it. Sharp does expect the Zaurus to cannibalize sales of its top-of-the line Wizard, the OZ 9520. That model, which with a fax modem sells for $450 -- only a few hundred dollars less than a Zaurus equipped with a modem -- will probably be phased out.
Sharp's venerable Wizard is not the company's only previous P.D.A. -- just its only successful one so far. And perhaps significantly, the Wizard, like the new Zaurus, does not use an industry-standard operating system.
Sharp's attempts to sell products based on other companies' software standards have been disappointments. In 1992, it licensed Apple's Newton operating system, only to scrap the project a year later. And it once sold a tablet-size pen computer using yet another operating system software.
Yet, rather than discouraging analysts, these earlier attempts to pursue an "open architecture" point toward Sharp's willingness to try any reasonable approach in the name of survival. "They're playing all sides," Mr. Brown said.
But about that odd name . . . P.D.A.

HEADLINE: The Great Social Security Debate: Phase 3

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Many of the responses to Floyd Norris's column on Social Security reflect misconceptions about the system ("Social Security: The Issue They Chose to Ignore," Market Watch, Nov. 6; "Coming Fiercely to the Defense of Social Security," Letters, Nov. 27).
Despite denials by the letter writers Jack Scarangella, William Luce and W. David Waters, cuts in Social Security benefits reduce the deficit in exactly the same manner other spending cuts do. The economically relevant deficit is the Government's net borrowing from the public because it competes with (and crowds out) private investment. This borrowing equals the general-treasury deficit minus the Social Security surplus; benefit cuts increase that surplus and thereby reduce net borrowing. 
 The letter writers Charles Wertheim and John Bruno, meanwhile, complain that Social Security's failure to match the returns on annuities and long-term bonds is because of Government wrongdoing, when it actually reflects the need to use the bulk of each year's F.I.C.A. taxes to pay benefits to current retirees, precluding investment of those funds.
Mr. Bruno and Mr. Waters further argue that Social Security is well-financed, though the system's trustees forecast that the surpluses will end in 2018 and that insolvency will occur in 2029.
In his letter, Paul Rehmet is concerned that Social Security benefits may be completely denied to retirees with $50,000 income, but the leading need-test proposal (by the Concord Coalition) phases out only 10 percent of Social Security (and other entitlement) benefits for each $10,000 of income over $40,000, with a maximum 85 percent reduction applying above $120,000. Whether or not this specific proposal, which would save $68 billion in fiscal 2000, is adopted, Mr. Norris was right to note that deficit-reduction efforts must include Social Security.

HEADLINE: The Contract Vintner's Motto: What's in a Name?

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: HOPLAND, Calif.,

 BODY:
THE Ravenswood winery in the Sonoma Valley is known for its intense zinfandel. McDowell Cellars makes a wine in the style of southern France. Hidden Cellars is a specialist in Mendocino County.
And while all of these wineries make different types of wine, they are following a growing trend in the California wine industry: letting someone else undertake the expensive process of making some or all of their grapes into wine. 
 The Associated Vintage Group, a winery situated here in the McDowell Valley, does't have its own label, but about a dozen customers from premium wineries to liquor distributors will turn to it this year to produce over 350,000 cases of wine.
Some elements of wine production have long been available on a contract basis, but they were typically offered by wineries with under-utilized capacity after making their own brands. Vintage Group, which opened in 1993, is a pioneer in offering the full range of production: from crushing grapes to designing labels to shipping cases of wine.
Wine making is capital intensive. Vineyards must be cultivated or grapes bought; specialized equipment like crusher-stemmers and wine presses are costly, yet they are used only part of the year; no winery ever has enough stainless steel tanks or oak barrels. With the exodus of several big banks from winery lending in recent years, many wineries have struggled or collapsed for lack of financing.
"There's just not enough capital. There never has been in this industry," said Allan J. Hemphill, Vintage Group's president and chief operating officer. "Even if they could get it, we'd say it's indefensible to invest it in a low efficiency operation that can be done better somewhere else." Turning over production to Vintage Group frees up capital better spent on high quality grapes and marketing efforts, he said.
"Wine is asset intense. Any way you can find to make do with fewer assets is desirable," said Jean-Michelle Valette, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist.
The source of Vintage Group's capital, and its chairman and chief executive, is Richard P. Godwin, a retired vice chairman and president of Bechtel Inc., the international engineering company. Mr. Godwin, who also served as the Undersecretary of Defense for acquisition in the Reagan Administration, entered the wine business as a grape grower.
Mr. Hemphill is well known in the wine industry, having been president of Chateau St. Jean. Kerry Damskey, Vintage's winemaker, worked in a number of California wineries.
"By using their equipment much more efficiently, Allan and his associates can produce wine for people more inexpensively than they can themselves," said Ed Everett, president of New World Wines in San Francisco, which markets a wine under the Huntington label that is produced by the Vintage Group.
Mr. Hemphill said that he can make a case of wine from $10 to $25 cheaper than most of his customers.
While contracting out production is commonplace in industries from computers to clothing, it required an attitudinal shift in the wine business. The image of the chateau, with all operations under one roof, still attracts would-be Mondavi's.
But the past decade saw the emergence of a new kind of wine business, even as many of the so-called boutiques foundered for lack of cash, like Gran Cru and Lyeth. Names like Clos du Bois, Kendall-Jackson and Glen Ellen became big national brands selling millions of cases with either no winery at all or a small token winery augmented by many custom production contracts with other wineries. And it is strong brands that command shelf-space at the supermarket.
"Wine has become increasingly a marketer's game," said Paul Gillette, publisher of The Wine Investor, an industry newsletter. "There are a lot of people with knowledge that the typical vintner doesn't have. These people from the marketing end will say, 'if I had a $7.50 bottle of whatever, I could sell a lot of it.' "
In the past, such guerrilla marketers bought wine on the bulk market, packaged it attractively and sold it cheaply. But this business was dependent on temporary or localized oversupplies. So some of the more successful marketers have looked for a more consistent source, over which they could exert some control.
One such operator is the Codera Wine Group of Emeryville, Calif. In April, Codera began buying wine produced by the Vintage Group, replacing six bottling operations it had contracted with in previous years. Codera will sell over 200,000 cases of wine this year, under a number of brands, including Cedar Brook, Blackstone and Angeline.
"We decided to build the brands, sales and distribution with the option of backing into production if and when that makes sense to us," said Steven Gomberg, Codera's chief operating officer. "This way we can run a very lean operation. We're doing 200,000-plus cases with just eight people here."
Vintage Group's ability to make a quality product at lower cost is partly attributable to economies of scale; Its fixed costs are spread over a higher volume of production. But it also reflects the company's ability to acquire production capacity at low cost, in large part because of the shake out among California wineries.
All of their operations are in Mendocino and Sonoma counties. In Napa, Vintage Group has competition from the Napa Wine Company, which operates a similar business in the former Inglenook winery.
After initially competing with Vintage Group for custom winemaking business, John Dickerson, president of Hidden Cellars, moved all of Hidden Cellar's 25,000-case production to the Hopland operation. "What we've got is a lot more toys to play with because of these guys," he said. "They've got a lab there with three full-time enologists whom we could never afford."
Of course, there is something lost going the custom production route.
"They're kind of undermining their own argument that you can only make good wine if you make it yourself," said James Laube of Wine Spectator, a magazine for wine enthusiasts. "It's kind of an admission that these wines are price-driven, supermarket products."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Russian Funds Are Coming!

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
AMERICANS interested in Russia's expanding private economy will soon find it easier to invest there, despite the daunting risks foreigners still face in this new Wild West of equity markets.
The World Bank calculated in October that half of Russian industry was in private hands after three rounds of privatization, in which Russian citizens received vouchers exchangeable for company shares. Typically, 30 percent of a privatized company's capital is reserved for employees and the remainder offered to the public. 
 Some mainly British financial institutions, including Robert Fleming and Barings, have already created funds that invest exclusively in Russian shares. But these are not available to most American investors, and no Russian country fund is traded as yet in the United States.
This seems set to change early next year, with both the Templeton Group and Robert Fleming planning to start closed-end Russia funds approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Templeton originally hoped to offer its fund, worth $300 million to $400 million, last November. But it ran into difficulties with the S.E.C., which balked at some of the more hair-raising features of Russia's emerging equities market, especially insuring proper custodianship of securities that the fund buys.
This is difficult because Russian companies do not issue share certificates but instead keep official registers of shareholders at their headquarters, which can be time zones away from Moscow. As a result, every share transaction involves a costly, time consuming communication with the headquarters to alter the register. And while extracts from it are available, these have no legal validity and can be forged.
Moreover unscrupulous company managers may tamper with the register, removing the names of shareholders they dislike. And many Russian managers fear foreign shareholders for the demands they make.
This is what Transworld, a metals company based in London, says happened to it in November. Its representatives were turned away from a meeting of shareholders in the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, in which it had taken a 20 percent stake worth some $300 million, after being told that their names had been removed from the register because of "irregularities."
"Russian law is a complete disaster," said David Reuben, president of Transworld. "Shareholders are at the mercy of factory managers." But Andrei Shleiser, a Harvard economist who advises Russia on privatization, said, "The system is evolving. Russian companies know they will not get Western capital unless the regulatory climate improves."
To meet S.E.C. concerns, Templeton plans to sign contracts with individual companies that allow representatives of Chase Manhattan's Moscow branch regular access to their registers to check that the fund is correctly credited with the shares it buys.
"We thought registers were sacred until the Krasnoyarsk dispute aroused our worst fears," Mark Mobius, the new fund's manager, said in a telephone interview from Moscow. "But we're well on the way to solving our problems." Other foreign investors say that Russia's equity register system, though cumbersome and expensive, works reasonably well, particular with bigger companies anxious for foreign capital. "We've never had any problems," said John P. Balfe of Robert Fleming's New York subsidiary, which plans to start its $250 million Russia fund in the first half of 1995.
A few Russian shares are already traded on Western markets, including Petersburg Long Distance and Avtovaz Bank. And Russia's natural gas and oil giants, Gazprom and Lukoil, plan to issue shares in London and New York next year.
But the delay in starting a Russian country fund, which would give Americans easier access to a wider selection of Russian equities, may not be a bad thing since the market has recently gone into sharp reverse after a phenomenal rise. The Russian market index of Credit Suisse-First Boston, which opened at 100 on Dec. 1, 1993, climbed as high as 1,706 by Sept. 15, 1994, before dropping to 861 this week.
"After a rise like that, a correction is no surprise," said Madhav Dhar, an emerging markets specialist at Morgan Stanley. By Western standards, he said, promising Russian companies are still "laughably cheap," with the oil sector valued at 10 to 15 cents a barrel of proven reserves, compared with a $4 to $5 valuation a barrel for Western companies.
Mr. Dhar also cites Russian enthusiasm for share ownership. "Capitalism has taken strong root among the younger generation," he said. "Russia created a mass equity culture overnight."
Dirk Damrau at Solomon Brothers believes that the Government is serious about free-market reforms. But he fears political fallout next year from Russia's parliamentary elections and a presidential election, when, he said, "the nationalists could turn against foreign investors."

HEADLINE: At Work;
The Office as a Work in Progress

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES a cigar is just a cigar and an office just a place to go every day to make a living. But an exhibit at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan makes a compelling case that the office is also a laboratory of social and material values, adapting and changing -- evolving, that is -- as new technology is introduced. The office is, in short, a work in progress, even if "progress" is a discredited 19th-century notion. As "Good Offices and Beyond: The Evolution of the Workplace" intriguingly demonstrates, there is less distance than one might think between the paper clip and the virtual office.
Anyone who keeps track of events at the Cooper-Hewitt will not be surprised that the museum has mounted a witty, down-to-earth exploration of the connections between design, technology and everyday life. It is in the tradition of last year's "Mechanical Bride" exhibit, which examined the historical relationship between emerging household technology and women's work. In addition to its other virtues, "Good Offices" encourages participation: Visitors have filled dozens of notebook pages responding to questions on technology, what constitutes a good office -- natural light, many visitors say -- and what work means to them. One room of the exhibit is dedicated to the Laboratory of Seating, where visitors may help test 15 ergonomic office chairs. 
 The history of the modern office, as the exhibit notes at the outset, is rooted in the profound social and economic forces of the late 19th century: industrialization, urbanization, technological innovation. Charles Darwin was still alive when the office began turning from a monastic enclave of scribbling clerks into the face of the industrial age, with flashy new machines and an assembly-line atmosphere. By 1900, when the exhibit's time line begins, Darwinian thought was still influential.
 Hence the choice of the exhibit's neo-Darwinian explanatory framework and the biological vocabulary its organizers employed to describe it. The show's "backbone," as the curator calls it, runs down the center of one large room given over to "Good Offices." A pair of decade-by-decade time lines are juxtaposed, one detailing technological events and types of work, one laying out the social and cultural contexts.
Most of the objects in a case that runs between the two time lines are instantly recognizable -- as, say, many objects from a kitchen 100 years ago would not be. There is a stapler, a typewriter, a copier, the old Tandy laptop computer that was known, with ambivalent affection, as the Trash-80. The debt recent technology owes to its ancestors is obvious, especially in the miniaturization of machines like the Dictaphone. But occasionally technology takes an evolutionary leap, as with the computer. "There are these glorious mutations, where suddenly a new machine appears," said David R. McFadden, the curator of "Good Offices."
Office technology is technology generally in the sense that it is used to do what can't be done naturally and to control what can be done: to exploit and control the natural world, in other words. In the office, technology has most crucially been put to use in the service of communications, information processing and calculating, essentially providing a means to conquer space -- the telephone reduces distances between people -- and to generate and disperse knowledge.
BUT the limitations of technology are also apparent. The exhibit proposes that time is to modern life what space was to the pre-modern world: an uncontainable, unknowable mystery, unsolvable even by scientific study. The great problem of the contemporary white-collar workplace is, of course, how to increase productivity, which is essentially a problem of time management. An entire case is dedicated to examples of "time-management systems" like Filofax and Day-Timer, and another to clocks and calendars. As the exhibit's notes point out, they "give us the illusion we are in control of our workloads and our lives."
The exhibit takes no stance on whether the evolution toward the so-called virtual office, which theoretically will free workers from the need to be physically present in an office, is a good thing or a bad thing, a trend toward freedom or to anomie. Clearly, technology does not satisfy all needs. "A Rolodex is a good example," Mr. McFadden said. "People keep using Rolodexes even though they have electronic equipment. There are sensual responses to things that can't be quantified or replaced." The exhibit, perhaps inadvertently, raises that quaint and wistful question of the Univac era: Are humans necessary? One of the last artifacts in the exhibit is "Oxygen" software, a fascinating program now being tested at Chiat/ Day, the advertising firm and one of the exhibit's corporate sponsors. " 'Oxygen' tries to replicate the informal exchanges and camaraderie of the old office in the limitless space of the new office," according to the exhibit's notes. But as George Beylerian, a designer quoted on the opening wall, points out: "At the close of this century, we seem to have come full circle. People working at home mimic cottage industry traditions." As we head toward the end of the millennium, we're doing piecework and worrying about Serbia. What exactly was the point of the 20th century?
"Good Offices and Beyond" runs through Feb. 19 at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Fifth Avenue and 91st Street. The Laboratory of Seating will be open until March 19. For information on hours call 212 860-6898.

Signs of the Tenants on East 96th: Talking About Rats and Repairs

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
It was mid-October when the signs first appeared in the windows of several 19th-century tenement buildings along East 96th Street, around the corner from Lexington Avenue. "Over 1 1/2 Years Waiting for Repairs, Larry," says one. Nearby is "Larry Ginsberg, When Do I Get a Stove?" Above a drawing of a giant rodent, another says, "Larry Ginsberg, I Am Afraid of the Rats."
The signs are the latest chapter in a long running saga of determined tenants battling years of neglect in the name of hanging onto some of the city's cheapest housing: 800-square-foot apartments that can cost less than $100 a month; the most expensive are no more than $400 a month. 
 Tenants in the eight buildings will tell you they have paid excessively in many other ways, from the rat infestation and a boiler that caught fire two years ago to a general state of shabbiness. The tenements stretch from 95th to 96th Street along the west side of Lexington Avenue and along 96th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues.
Peter Trigledas, a high school math teacher who has lived at 136 East 96th Street for 27 years, led the poster-writing effort. He and his neighbors, he said, were at the end of their rope. It wasn't the years they waited in vain for their landlord, Larry Ginsberg of Algin Management, to repair everything from plumbing to rusted fire escapes, Mr. Trigledas said; it was the appearance of rats. Hundreds of them.
"The rats pushed us to the point of the signs, because all our requests were going unheard," Mr. Trigledas said. "They were not just in the walls, but greeting some of the tenants when they would come home. These were not small rats, but big rats. The supermarket had a couple of cats, and they were no bigger than the rats."
On Nov. 1, the state Department of Housing and Community Renewal's harassment division released a report listing 41 pages of problems at the buildings.
Louis Ganim, a spokesman for the state agency said: "We've been trying to work with the owner and the tenants to resolve all these issues, and we have not been able to."
The report gave a 60-day deadline for improvements or explanations, and threatened steep fines. Residents say there have been some improvements. As of six weeks ago, there's a new super, Ramiro Miras. People seem to like him. Some hallways have been painted.
Repeated efforts to reach Mr. Ginsberg last week through various offices of his realty company were unsuccessful.
Rents have been frozen for 20 years, Mr. Trigledas said, because violations started mounting after Mount Sinai Hospital bought the buildings in 1968. The city refused to allow the hospital to raise rents, a situation that continued after Mr. Ginsberg's company bought the buildings in 1982.
Shortly after the sale, tenants received letters notifying them of Mr. Ginsberg's intention to demolish the buildings. It was a call to a war of passive resistance: tenants refused to move.
"Most of the people here, their economic status is not that good," Mr. Trigledas, who organized the tenants, said. "There's nothing much out there they could substitute for their present apartment."
Mr. Ginsberg is also the owner of 108 East 96th Street, a luxury doorman-attended apartment tower on a site that formerly held five tenements. It was found to have been built 12 stories taller than the zoning law allowed, and last year, he was forced to lop off the extra stories.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trigledas said, representatives from Algin Management have been asking him to take down the posters. He said they remain only in buildings that still have violations. "My feeling is, we've waited two years for these repairs," he said. "So don't rush me with these signs." CONSTANCE L. HAYS

A New Attraction on Tourist Maps: Chinatown East?

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
A tourist center opened in Chinatown recently. And not on Mott or Canal Streets.
It opened its doors several blocks to the east, on Pike Street, near East Broadway, and the placement tells a lot about how far Chinatown has come on that side of the Bowery and where it seems to be heading. 
 "We wanted to make sure we opened it near a thoroughfare and a place that has good growth potential," said Cristobal A. Garcia, director of the Manhattan Neighborhood Renaissance, a nonprofit economic development group that runs the center.
The booming area around East Broadway has become a popular stop for Chinese-Americans in the metropolitan area who are looking for something beyond the familiar winding streets and Cantonese restaurants of the traditional Chinatown. Now the thinking is that non-Chinese tourists can be lured there, too, and some tourist agencies say they are thinking of adding it to the regular tour routes to Chinatown.
Lee Gelber, a manager of tour guide services for Gray Line New York Tours, says he has begun recommending it to tourists. He said East Broadway's past as a main boulevard of the Jewish Lower East Side is an added attraction.
During the last five years, Chinese from the province of Fujian have taken root here, and East Broadway has emerged as a political and economical power center. It differs from Chinatown's traditional power base of Mott, Canal and Pell streets because people here are partial to the Chinese Government in Beijing rather than that of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Fujianese Associations like the Fukianese-American Association and the United Fujianese-American Association have headquarters there.
Business is strong. On the stretch between Pike Street and Chatham Square, four banks, three Chinese banquet restaurants and scores of smaller restaurants, fruit and vegetable stands and discount shops crowd the street. On weekends, the East Broadway Mall, also known as the Triple 8 Mall for its address, 888 East Broadway, is a bustling hub. Business is so good that the Triple 8 restaurant just announced a major expansion. Philip Lam, a real-estate broker, said commercial occupancy is at full capacity between Chatham Square and Pike Street.
Here, the flavor is unmistakably Fujianese. Fuzhouese is the main spoken Chinese dialect. Restaurants offer Fujianese delicacies, ranging from noodles made from fish flesh to meat dumplings made with sweet rice flour. Signs for businesses often begin with the word "Fu," which is the first character of Fujian, the province on China's coast opposite Taiwan, and which also means "prosperity" in Chinese.
Still, East Broadway has a long way to go before it can compete with Mott and Canal Streets. Simon Wai, vice president of the Wing On Group, a travel agency, says it needs to be more tourist-friendly -- that is, add more tourist-oriented businesses, like souvenir shops -- before it can attract droves of visitors.
But Mr. Garcia said: "East Broadway is a hidden treasure. It's Chinatown's best kept secret." JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE;
Goodbye, Garden! Hello, High-Rise!

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
For years, Claremont stables' western neighbor was a community garden, plots of carefully tended flowers and vegetables that filled the lot along Amsterdam Avenue, between 89th and 90th Streets.
But plans for a long-awaited new building are being completed for the lot, the last urban renewal site on the Upper West Side. And residents of the area are a tad nervous. 
 "We're concerned about the type of housing being put up and whether that is really going to serve the community," said Karen Jorgensen, a neighbor who serves on the parish council at neighboring St. Gregory's. "A long time ago, this building was supposed to be more of a family-type building, and now what we think is that it's just going to be studios and one-bedrooms."
Thirty years ago, the lot was set aside for a building in which 20 percent of apartments would be reserved for low-income families. The developer, Related Companies, plans an 18-story building with 267 units, including studios and one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. Fifty-three units will be rented to people with incomes from $10,000 to $21,450, for $323 to $526, said Mara Neville, a Housing Preservation and Development spokeswoman.
All necessary permits have been in place since 1989, said Ms. Neville. The project was blocked when neighboring residents filed a lawsuit challenging its bulk and size. The suit was settled the following year, but by then, said David Wine said, the president of Related Management Company, a subsidiary of the developer, the financing was lost. "Now," he said, "we believe that the economic cycle has come around again to enable us to finance the building."
On Thursday, neighbors will have their first chance to see the new plans when Mr. Wine and city officials present them to the Land Use Committee of Community Board 7.Construction is set to begin in May, and the building, with retail space and a parking garage, is to open in October 1996.
As for now, the 100 community gardeners are calmly preparing to remove their plants and tools.
"It's very sad," said Jane Weissman, director of Operation Green-thumb. "But everybody knew that this was the story." J.K.B.

HEADLINE: To Solve Tipping Problem, Simply Do Away With It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Those who defend the concept of tipping -- in your Dec. 4 article, "A Time to Give, to Everybody" -- argue that without tips, service people do not get paid enough. 
 Not to sound mean-spirited, but as a consumer, that is not my problem. It is the responsibility of employers to adequately compensate their subordinates.
If tipping were banned at the prevailing wage rates, qualified people would be less inclined to take jobs as waiters, bellhops and the like. Employers in the service industry would simply be forced by the market to pay higher wages, and would pass these pay raises on to consumers in the form of price hikes. Economically, everything would even out, but things would be a lot simpler.
As for the argument that tipping is necessary to motivate service people, that should not be the concern of customers, either. With tipping in vogue, service workers tend to discriminate when dealing with customers, dispensing preferential treatment to those from whom they expect more substantial gratuities. Ideally, managers in the service industry should train their employees to behave toward all customers with the utmost in courtesy and professionalism, regardless of who the customers are.

Looking to Trim Benefits, Federal Panel Fails

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

 BODY:
As Democrats and Republicans rushed to voice their support for tax cuts last week, they all but ignored a plea for fiscal responsibility from a bipartisan Federal advisory panel headed by Senator Bob Kerrey.
 Many economists and Government officials agree with the panel's conclusion: that the cost of commitments made through programs like Social Security and Medicare exceeds the money available to pay for them over the next 35 years. But the problem grows gradually, and Americans are unwilling to deal with such problems until a crisis is at hand, Mr. Kerrey said. So the panel concluded its work without recommending a package of specific changes to slow the growth of these programs. 
 The panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, established by Mr. Clinton in November 1993, said that benefits like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Federal employee pensions now accounted for 47 percent of all Federal spending and, with no change in current law, would account for 58 percent in the year 2003. Mr. Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, proposed savings that would have primarily come from Social Security and Medicare, but Mr. Clinton said no.
 Mr. Kerrey infuriated labor unions and spokesmen for the elderly, who said his proposals would gut social insurance programs. And he had the audacity to suggest that the middle class might need to make some sacrifices, just as the White House was proposing "a middle-class bill of rights," full of new tax breaks.

HEADLINE: Struggling Families Need Jobs, Not Orphanages

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Orphanages Are No Solution" (editorial, Dec. 12) argues that children are best raised in a family and that orphanages would be an expensive way to care for them. However, you neglect to mention two important ingredients that contribute to successful families. 
 Gainful employment for parents and supportive services help families thrive. When parents are able to fulfill their roles as providers, children are far more likely to be physically, emotionally, socially and educationally better off than children who are not in an economically secure family. And all families benefit from services that will help them function well.
In too many communities across America, particularly African-American communities, adults lack financial resources to support and care for their children.
The average unemployment rate in the third quarter of 1994 for blacks was 11.1 percent, compared with 5.2 percent for white Americans. The poverty rate for blacks is 33.1 percent, compared with 12.2 percent for whites. Jobs for African-American parents, not orphanages, would solve many problems for black children.
Moreover, in addition to employment, families need support services. Our own work with families in the District of Columbia provides life skills, parental skills and child development information to more that 40 low-income families.
While the focus has been on mothers, fathers also need and want support services. A men's group unexpectedly grew out of the project. Children need the support and guidance of two parents.
America's children and their families would be better served by welfare reform legislation that outlines job creation and investment in services for families to enable all their members to be healthy and productive citizens.

HEADLINE: Too Slow on Airline Safety

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration's belated crackdown on commuter airlines and on small planes that may be hazardous in icy weather conditions will upset holiday travelers whose flights have suddenly been canceled. The inconvenience is unwelcome, but five fatal crashes on major and regional airlines this year have heightened public concern about air safety and moved the F.A.A. to put safety first -- at last.
The response of the agency to new aviation hazards has too often been sluggish. Following the first of two recent crashes on the American Eagle commuter airline, the agency this month ordered airlines not to fly their ATR turboprop aircraft in icy conditions, or when such conditions are forecast. Just three weeks earlier it had rejected a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to do just that, ordering instead that pilots take extra precautions. 
 But the pilots themselves say they are ill prepared. After the grounding order finally came out, pilots complained that they were inadequately trained for winter flying. American Eagle, an affiliate of American Airlines, then suspended its Chicago commuter service and some of its service at Kennedy International in New York City. Last week the F.A.A. also suspended operations by another carrier, Kiwi Airlines, because it was not satisfied that Kiwi's pilot training met Federal standards; by week's end, arrangements had been made to start restoring Kiwi service.
Reflecting public concern about the rigor of airline safety procedures, the agency has announced that it will undertake a safety audit of all U.S. airlines. Meanwhile, it is preparing a requirement that pilots of small airliners take the same extensive training as pilots of big jets. That step is long overdue. The less-rigorous training rules for operating smaller planes predate the huge expansion of regional and commuter airlines, where small planes are more economical for short and less heavily traveled routes.
Here, too, the agency is following the safety board's lead; intensified training was recommended by the board last month after a broad study of the regionals' operations. Other recommendations by the board -- namely that the pilots of small planes be limited to the same hours of flight time as the pilots of big planes and that young pilots be paired with more experienced ones -- are to be addressed later.
The board is an independent agency that patrols safety and investigates accidents in all forms of public transportation -- ships, trains, planes and whatever. It cannot make anyone do anything, but has mighty powers of persuasion through its meticulous detective work and widely publicized reports on the causes of accidents. The F.A.A. is an arm of the Department of Transportation, with a contradictory assignment to promote civil aviation, including its financial well-being, while also imposing safety regulations, which can be costly.
Airline crashes in the United States this year have taken 257 lives, the most since 1987. Deaths on commuter airlines are the highest since at least 1982. Air travel remains safer than travel by road or rail, but crash reports do not reassure those who fly. Even though financial turbulence in the airline business has forced cost-cutting, there can be no excuse for skimping on safety.
The F.A.A. Administrator, David Hinson, announced two weeks ago that he was creating a new top-level office of safety administrator. Perhaps that will help where the agency has been especially weak, in anticipating safety problems rather than only responding to crises and crashes.

HEADLINE: A Leaner New York

BYLINE: By Felix G. Rohatyn; Felix G. Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres, investment bankers, was chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation from 1975-93.

 BODY:
New York City is heading for its most dangerous fiscal problems in nearly 20 years. And while this time there is no threat of bankruptcy, the size of the present and future budget gaps -- and some new aggravating factors -- make it clear that the city needs to take prompt and fundamental measures to put its finances in order. It could do worse than to look at the ways it resolved its desperate plight of the mid-1970's.
When he took office nearly a year ago, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani inherited a perilous situation. The local economy had never fully recovered from the recession that followed the 1987 stock market crash, nor had successive administrations dealt with the city's structural deficit -- the chronic imbalance between revenues and recurring expenses -- in a serious fashion. 
 Mr. Giuliani had to deal immediately with a deficit of $2.3 billion for the fiscal year that began last July, while correctly insisting that the city's exorbitant tax burden must be reduced. He proposed a variety of spending cuts and new or increased fees, along with a work-force reduction in which 15,000 people would take voluntary buyouts financed by surplus funds of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
But fiscal monitors warned of even larger shortfalls -- warnings painfully borne out in this month's struggle between the Mayor and City Council over how to close a billion-dollar gap in the current budget. No matter who wins that battle, the gap may still not be securely closed; worse, the city faces deficits that could reach $2 billion in the next fiscal year and rise in later years. And two recent developments make it likely that the city will face still greater pressure: the dramatic decline in earnings in the financial service industry, and the change of governors in Albany.
 The Wall Street downturn, which is likely to continue, will mean smaller than expected revenues in business and income taxes. It will slow Christmas business in the city. And it will mean smaller tax collections for the state, widening Albany's own severe budget gap.
 The election of George E. Pataki is likely to lead to other problems for the city. Even if the Governor-elect and the Mayor were best friends, their policy goals would still be in stark contradiction. Mr. Pataki is committed to closing a $4 billion deficit while simultaneously initiating a 25 percent income tax cut, which would cost $5.5 billion over four years; both these commitments are likely to mean state-aid cutbacks that will increase the city's deficit by several hundred million dollars a year. The Mayor, for his part, is counting on Albany and Washington for about $600 million in Medicaid assistance over the next three years. He is unlikely to see even part of it.
 All of this may well require cuts beyond what the city can safely endure in a short time. The Mayor's current plans call for a reduction of 22,000 employees this year, or 10 percent of the work force. Dealing with the new gaps might require a reduction of 35,000 to 40,000 to bring the budget into structural balance. The Mayor is talking about deep cuts in next year's Medicaid and welfare budgets. Reductions of that magnitude (or the additional taxes needed to avoid them) would very likely cause permanent damage to the city's social and economic fabric if imposed too quickly.
How to avoid such a painful reckoning? The Mayor and the Governor-elect should consider an approach similar to what worked in even more difficult conditions in 1975.
 At the time, the city needed to close a gap of nearly 10 percent of its budget (as against 3 percent today) and was effectively shut out of the credit markets. The city, the state and the municipal unions agreed on a four-year plan, to be carried out by the Mayor with the oversight of the state-appointed Emergency Financial Control Board. It was to be financed by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, using bonds backed by the city's sales tax.
The plan was comprehensive. It called for a balanced budget at the end of four years. In that time the work force was to be reduced by 40,000 people (beyond 20,000 layoffs that had occurred earlier) under a program of attrition and work-rule changes; the city agreed to lay no one off as long as the unions provided at least 6 percent attrition each year. Wage increases were deferred until the city's budget was balanced. Certain city functions were taken over and paid for by the state.
 The plan was successful. The budget was balanced in four years, the city was back in the bond market in six years, and all deferred wages were repaid in 1981. And the restructuring of the municipal debt and the creation of M.A.C. as a lender of last resort meant that the city would always have access to credit -- a near-ironclad guarantee against bankruptcy.
 Today, as in 1975, righting the structural imbalance between revenue and spending requires much greater cutbacks than can be absorbed in one year. Yet such a plan is imperative if the city is to be spared the annual agony of cutting again and again. Here are six elements of such a plan:
* Just as the state took over certain city functions in 1975, it should begin to take over Medicaid for every local government -- a move that would benefit not only the city but all the upstate counties that voted for Mr. Pataki. Given the state's budget problems, such a move would be only nominal at first, but it would point the way to significant relief in the future.
* If the unions guarantee an attrition rate of at least 4 percent a year, that would reduce the size of the work force by 32,000 people over four years. While hardly painless, such a reduction should not result in layoffs: 4 percent a year is about half the turnover rate for city employees.
* Wage increases should be deferred until the budget is in balance.
* Any such plan should include some gradual reduction in city taxes to encourage businesses and taxpayers to remain while keeping quality-of-life services -- law enforcement, education, sanitation -- at an acceptable level.
 * The city might have to eliminate certain functions entirely. As the Mayor suggested during his campaign, the hospital system might have to be privatized; provisions would have to be made for heavy initial costs and employee relocation.
* New sources of revenue need to be explored, too. One politically difficult measure would be to impose tolls on the East River bridges and use the proceeds to finance all transportation-related maintenance costs in the city budget.
The 1975 agreement was termed a social contract. A similar contract is needed now. It must involve the unions and the business community. It could be partly paid for by refinancing the M.A.C. bonds and extending their maturities -- something that could be considered only under a plan that guaranteed successful execution. Although the credit-rating agencies are leery of such financing, a plan that leads to structural balance would actually improve the city's credit and should get the agencies' blessing.
 The Mayor and the Governor-elect have conflicting agendas. But they have an overriding interest: the economic and social health of New York City and New York State. One cannot flourish without the other. For humanitarian reasons as much as economic ones, the two men need to begin work now on a long-term plan for a restructured city government and permanent fiscal balance.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Draconian In the Extreme

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A HALF-DOZEN times this month alone, social and economic programs being pushed by the new Republican majority in Congress have been described by one source or another in this newspaper as "Draconian."
 Everyone knows why the relationship between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson was called Platonic. But Draco? 
 For the record, he was chief magistrate of Athens in the 7th century B.C. Some textbooks call him a lawgiver the way some reporters call Newt Gingrich a lawmaker. His claim to fame was that he codified the laws of his city-state. They were considerably more severe than three strikes and you're out.
 As the champion of alms houses, orphanages and capital punishment, Mr. Gingrich may be strict. Next to Draco, he looks like a criminal-coddling do-gooder.
 Under Draco's code, the penalty for almost every infraction, from vagrancy to murder, was death. He once explained the lack of gradations in his punishments by saying that, hard as he tried, he could not think of any tougher penalties.
 Much as Mr. Gingrich is revered today by the Republican back-benchers he brought into power, Draco was adored by law-and-order Athenians. Ultimately, they loved him to death.
 It seems that when he entered a theater one day, the partisan crowd rose, cheered and threw their clothing upon him -- the Athenian version of throwing confetti or ticker-tape. The volume of garments was so great this time that Draco was smothered.
 A generation later, Solon came to power, having been given expansive power to reform the state in a time of huge social unrest. He gave the lowest class of Athenians seats in the assembly. He established courts of justice. He was a legislator, a poet, an intellectual -- definitely a member of the liberal elite and probably part of the counterculture of his time. And he repealed most of Draco's laws.
 All of which is why people nowadays who oppose the spending cuts and social policy of the Republicans call them Draconian. And why the old bulls who ran Congress for years and who will not be around next year -- the Tom Foleys and Dan Rostenkowskis and George Mitchells -- are called solons.

HEADLINE: Healing Process -- A special report.;
While Congress Remains Silent, Health Care Transforms Itself

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

 BODY:
In the two years that Congress wrangled over health care before quashing proposals for fundamental change, private market forces were acting on their own to transform the country's medical system dramatically.
Indeed, cost cutting, intensive competition and the growing role of large, profit-seeking corporations in health care escalated some of the very trends that many members of Congress said they most opposed, like limitations on the choice of doctors. Among the milestones American health care reached without fanfare during 1993 and 1994 were these: 
 *A majority of privately insured Americans were enrolled in managed-care plans that limit choice of doctors and treatments. Sixty-five percent of workers at medium and large companies were in such plans by 1994.
*For-profit health maintenance organizations grew so fast that they overtook nonprofit H.M.O.'s as the dominant force in managed care. Today the majority of all people enrolled in H.M.O.'s, the most common and stringent form of managed care, are in plans run by for-profit companies.
*At least three-fourths of all doctors signed contracts, covering at least some of their patients, to cut their fees and accept oversight of their medical decisions. Among doctors who work in group practices, the share of such managed-care contracts was 89 percent by 1993, up sharply from 56 percent the year before.
Run for decades more like a collection of cottage industries than a system that now accounts for one-seventh of the economy, medical care is increasingly the domain of big business, offering a rich new playing field for Wall Street. Mergers and acquisitions of hospitals, clinics, medical laboratories, doctor groups with their patient lists, and other patient-care services, have totaled $20 billion this year, up from just $6 billion in 1992. Combined with the $22 billion in pharmaceutical deals, health care mergers surpassed in value those of any other industry for 1994, according to the Securities Data Company, a research firm in Newark.
But this restructuring has done nothing to ease the plight of the uninsured, whose numbers keep climbing, and it is also raising profound new questions about how quality care and medical ethics can be guarded.
"There's never been a time in the history of American medicine when the independence and autonomy of medical practitioners was as uncertain as it is now," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine. "I think that in this process businessmen and their agents will begin to exercise unprecedented control over the allocation of medical resources."
But proponents of H.M.O.'s say that their brand of medical care, prevention-oriented and centered on a family doctor, is generally better as well as more economical. They say consumers have little to fear.
"It's the corporatization of health care," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, who advises health investors. "And what's wrong with that?"
"Corporations produce hotel rooms and toothpaste and automobiles, and the country does fine. You still have to produce a service and monitor and improve it, for a finite price."
The rapid changes have been driven, above all, by the desire of those who pay most health bills -- employers and the government -- to rein in costs. In response, insurers and H.M.O.'s are offering to care for people at reduced, all-inclusive prices, confident that they can suppress spending enough to offer good care and still make a profit. And in turn, investors and speculators are attracted to companies that hold the promise of delivering the health care "product" for less.
The national debate over how to revamp health care only speeded up the changes in the marketplace, many experts think, as doctors, hospitals and investors realized that one way or another, managed care was likely to reign supreme.
H.M.O.'s seek to cut costs by curbing tests, surgery, referrals to specialists and hospital stays they consider unnecessary, as well as by paying lower fees, pushing prevention and seeking out efficiencies wherever they can. In regions where H.M.O.'s have begun to compete with each other for business, there is, in fact, evidence that they can hold down overall medical spending.
In California, a bellwether in the transition to managed care, three-fourths of all privately insured patients are now in H.M.O.'s, and even one in four elderly Medicare patients have joined them, said Albert Lowey-Ball, a consultant in Sacramento. In the most recent sign of savings, larger employers in the state, in negotiations with fiercely competing H.M.O.'s, have obtained rollbacks in health premiums for next year of up to 10 percent.
Nationwide, health spending slowed considerably over the last two years, though it was still double the general inflation rate.
Whether recent reductions in H.M.O. premiums can be maintained for long is disputed. And over time, many experts believe, health spending will still grow faster than the economy as a whole because of new technologies and the aging of the population.
Whatever it may do to cut spending, market competition has not halted the rise in the number of uninsured, which is linked to broader economic trends. According to Federal surveys, the number of Americans living without health insurance climbed to 39 million in 1993, from 37 million in 1992, and further increases are expected this year.
While President Clinton's ill-fated health care plan sought to encourage the trend toward market competition, it also proposed numerous new regulations and agencies intended to keep the system fair and cap future spending. These regulatory measures were seen as potentially suffocating by many in the health industry, who turned against the plan.
Market competition portends drastic change for many doctors and hospitals. The scale of the possible dislocations is suggested by a single example. In southern California now, the going rate paid by H.M.O.'s for heart-bypass surgery is $15,000, including all doctor, hospital and other fees. In contrast, total fees for bypass surgery under traditional insurance in much of the country can easily be $45,000 or more. There is no evidence of any differences in medical outcomes.
Already in California, "the incomes of specialists are dropping like stones," said David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern California. Hospitals throughout southern California are now only 48 percent full on average; 40 have closed in the last five years and many of the remaining 279 are in financial straits.
Doctors who are not well ensconced in H.M.O.'s are in a state of near-panic, said Dr. Gary Krieger, a pediatrician in San Pedro, Calif. "They're joining physician groups, signing any contracts put in front of them and losing control of their patients."
 
The Changes
A New Breed Of H.M.O.'s
 In the vanguard of change is a new breed of for-profit H.M.O.'s, aggressively competing for contracts to provide care for a preset monthly fee and exercising strong controls over the decisions of their doctors and hospitals.
Some of these H.M.O.'s are run by the large insurance firms, like Prudential and Aetna, while others are newer, independent companies like U.S. Healthcare, based in Pennsylvania or FHP Inc., based in California. Together, they have eclipsed the older nonprofit groups like the Kaiser Foundation of California that pioneered in the creation of H.M.O.'s, under-pricing them and often providing extra services like longer office hours.
As they take over a larger share of insured patients, the for-profit H.M.O.'s are forcing the rest of the system to emulate their practices, with private doctors and nonprofit hospitals joining new groups searching for ways to market their services and cut costs.
From 1992 to 1994, nine million people joined H.M.O.'s, bringing the total of participants to more than 50 million, a fifth of the country's population. This was more than double the growth of four million in the previous two-year period, and it largely occurred among for-profit companies. In some cases, the H.M.O.'s allow patients to use outside doctors if they pay extra fees.
Tens of millions more people are in looser forms of managed care like "preferred provider" networks that require use of doctors who have agreed to work for a discount, but that do not oversee daily medical decisions as closely as the H.M.O.'s do.
In parts of the West, Minnesota and recently Massachusetts, more than a third of all residents, including most privately insured patients, are already in H.M.O.'s. The numbers are climbing fast everywhere except in sparsely populated regions, where H.M.O.'s are less practical. In New York City, long a holdout, enrollment in H.M.O.'s jumped by 20 percent in the year ending in April, and now includes 18 percent of the total population.
As H.M.O.'s and medical groups swallow each other, fewer, larger systems are taking over the market. Over the last two years in southern California, seven large medical systems have gained control over 75 percent of the private insurance market of some 7.2 million people, said Dr. Jacque J. Sokolov, a physician and chief of Advanced Health Systems, a consulting firm in Los Angeles. The largest one is the nonprofit Kaiser group, but all the others are for-profit H.M.O.'s and medical groups.
Even where H.M.O.'s are not yet dominant, their looming presence is prompting a frantic burst of acquisitions and speculation more typical of the airline or telecommunications industries than the formerly staid world of medicine.
Insurers, hospitals, doctor groups and new kinds of hybrid health care companies are buying each other out, forging strategic alliances and sometimes engaging in cutthroat price wars as they seek to position themselves for the coming competition.
The object is to gain the best position for signing up insured patients -- "money-generating biological structures," as Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University, says they might be defined today.
No one is chasing after the uninsured, whose plight may actually be worsening as financially strapped hospitals cut back on charity care, said Glenn A. Melnick, a researcher with the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif.
 
The Competition
Seeking to Control The Market
 Even as insurers, doctors and hospitals begin to link up, the three groups are jostling to see who can dominate. So far, the insurers and H.M.O. companies generally have the upper hand, but in the last two years doctors and hospitals have begun to regroup, trying to build large organizations of their own to salvage some autonomy and bargaining power. In the most dramatic example, in just two years one private hospital company, Columbia/HCA Healthcare, has grown from a small regional chain into the owner, when recent deals are completed, of 311 hospitals -- half of all the for-profit hospital capacity in the country.
This chain and others are now starting to buy up nonprofit hospitals as well. At the same time, larger nonprofits are buying up small hospitals and doctor groups in hopes of securing their own share of the market.
The nonprofit hospitals were often formed with a charitable purpose and are exempt from many taxes. In the new competitive climate, many are behaving more and more like the investor-owned chains, which seek a profit for shareholders, leading some to ask whether the distinction is meaningful. But leaders of the nonprofits say they retain a deeper commitment to serving their communities.
Doctors are often forming associations for negotiating purposes and in one case, in Florida, a group of private surgeons have tried joining a union to bolster their bargaining power over fees.
Meanwhile, Federal antitrust enforcers are struggling to define when consolidation by hospitals or doctors amounts to the illegal infringement of competition.
"It's a free-for-all, with different groups vying for control," said Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a partner of Ernst & Young in Washington and, like Dr. Sokolov, one of a growing number of physicians working full-time as business consultants.
Huge sums are required to create giant, low-cost health plans to pay for everything from the computer systems used to monitor doctors' decisions, to mass advertising.
With their broader ability to raise funds from investors, the for-profit companies should have an edge over nonprofit H.M.O.'s and hospitals, said Dr. Sokolov. "The future of the nonprofits is in jeopardy," he said.
Competition for patients in southern California has become so intense that, in the view of many industry analysts, some of the H.M.O.'s and medical groups may be losing money in that region this year, covering the losses with profits made elsewhere. Desperate to keep a flow of patients, hospitals are agreeing to fees that are below their true costs.
And now, with the pie shrinking, conflict over the division of revenues is building among the insurers, doctors and hospitals.
"The H.M.O.'s are taking extraordinary profits," said John C. McDonald, chief executive of the Mullikin Medical Centers, a for-profit group of 400 doctors based in Long Beach, Calif., that subcontracts with H.M.O.'s to provide patient care at a set price. "They're taking one-third off the top and using that money to expand in other parts of the country."
Doctor and consumer groups have attacked the H.M.O.'s for spending from 15 percent to 30 percent of their revenues on marketing, administration and profits. But defenders say this is not out of line with other industries, and that it takes extra oversight to rechannel medical practices.
"I would not characterize this as money being diverted from health care," said Alan Hoops, chief executive of Pacificare Health Systems Inc., an investor-owned H.M.O. based in Orange County that has expanded into five other states. "It's no different from any other business. Management is part of health care."
In the fierce competition for contracts, Dr. Sokolov said, "There has been less focus on quality measures, report cards and the like and an extreme focus on price."
Over time, as all groups offer care at similar rock-bottom prices, he said, customer service should become a more important arena for competition. Larger employers, many working together in the Bay Area Business Group on Health in San Francisco, have already begun demanding that health plans produce data for public release on medical performance and patient satisfaction.
"But on the downside," Dr. Sokolov said, "there may be no money left in those systems to invest in quality studies."
 
The Care
Is Quality Sacrificed?
 At the heart of the transition occurring in American health care is a basic switch in the way medical services are paid for, from one in which fees are paid for each service provided, to one in which health plans receive a preset fee to meet all medical needs.
In the traditional system, doctors and hospitals made money by doing more, creating an unhealthy incentive to perform marginal tests and surgery. In the new system of prepaid care, the H.M.O. receives the same fee no matter what; an extra sonogram comes out of its profits. And increasingly, the H.M.O. pays physicians and hospitals on a similar basis, known as capitation, giving these groups a direct incentive to hold down expenses.
Dr. William S. Andereck, an internist at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, said he resigned from an H.M.O. after 10 years because he felt the incentives were unethical. "You get the same amount whether you see the patient or not," he said.
"For the black and white stuff they still make the same calls," he said. "But most of medicine isn't black and white. It's judgment calls, and that's where the incentive system has its impact."
If a woman has a lump in her breast, the doctor can wait three weeks or send her to the surgeon down the hall for an immediate biopsy, he noted. "Probably the outcome will be the same," he said. "But over that three weeks, what if it was your wife?"
The H.M.O.'s argue, though, that since they take financial responsibility for a patient's care over time, they actually have an economic imperative to perform useful tests and surgery.
"The lesson we've learned, and it cost us quite a bit to learn it, is that you do well only by keeping patients well," said Mr. McDonald of the Mullikin group. He noted that poor management of hypertension, diabetes or congestive heart failure can lead to catastrophic expenses.
"Those delayed procedures this year will cost you far more next year," Mr. McDonald said.
In some cases, the detailed scrutiny of medical decisions by H.M.O.'s can mean better care for less. The Kaiser plan in southern California, for example, found that by offering Pap smears to women on a scientifically based schedule, in most cases every three years, they could perform fewer total tests on more women. They spent less money, but detected more cases of early cervical cancer.
Well aware that their future hinges on public perceptions of the quality of care, H.M.O.'s now stress that commitment whenever they can. Most have physician medical directors who work closely with the doctors, monitoring patterns of care and outcomes, seeking consensus on the most cost-effective treatments. Some have panels including outside doctors or consumers that help rule when a patient appeals an H.M.O. decision to deny a service.
The plans say they reward doctors not only for holding down referrals and tests, but also for improving the rate at which children are immunized and for their scores in privately conducted surveys of consumer satisfaction. They also foster the use of scientific guidelines for care and peer review of doctors' decisions.
"The many non-financial influences balance out the financial incentives," said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, director of the Center for Health Policy of the University of Pennsylvania.
"The part of the system that has the best quality, the part of the system that is most accountable, the part that is best able to present information to the public is the managed-care part of the business," said William Roper, former head of the Federal Medicare and Medicaid programs who is now chief medical officer of Prudential Health Care.
 
The Decisions
'Who Are The Managers?'
 But questions of what gets covered and who decides are certain to crop up again and again. The mantra of managed care is "high quality and cost-effective," but there is no objective way to say how much extra benefit an expensive antibiotic, for example, has to bring in order to justify substituting it for a cheaper one. And when is heart surgery that can make a patient more comfortable, but is unlikely to extend life, a cost-effective choice?
"I'm all in favor of managed care," said Dr. Melvin H. Kirschner, a family practice physician in Van Nuys, Calif. "But who are the managers and why do they manage?"
Critics worry, above all, that in the emerging system, those in charge of care, from corporate overseers answerable to stockholders down to individual doctors worried about their own income, will have too much incentive to shortchange patients.
"The doctor can make more money if he doesn't prescribe the test or the X-ray, if he doesn't send you to the hospital, or if he discharges you as quickly as possible," Dr. Relman said.
"I don't think the patient can feel comfortable," he said. "Whose interest is the doctor serving -- his own, the company's or the patient's?"
Geraldine Dallek, director of the Center for Health Care Rights in Los Angeles, a patient-advocacy group, has fought against H.M.O.'s scrimping on needed care, like physical therapy for elderly patients.
One recent client was a man who needed unusual throat surgery. His H.M.O. said he had to use its surgeons, who had never performed this particular procedure. The man balked, arguing that the H.M.O. should pay for an experienced specialist elsewhere. Only after persistent calls from the advocacy group did the health plan relent.
"I'm not against managed care, but more needs to be done to protect people against under-service," she said, calling for broader Federal and state regulations. Consumers should be able to know, for example, what financial incentives their doctors are working under, yet many insurers will not disclose their financial arrangements.
"Just because we did a lousy job in fee-for-service is not an excuse to do a lousy job with H.M.O.'s," Ms. Dallek said. "At least in fee-for-service if you didn't like a doctor's decision you could go somewhere else. If you're in an H.M.O., you're really stuck."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. IS DETAILING BROAD PROPOSALS TO TRIM WELFARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
In a scramble to keep the political initiative, Congressional Republicans today provided fresh details of sweeping proposals to cut Federal welfare spending, while Administration officials struggled to figure out how they would pay for the tax cuts promised by President Clinton.
The Republicans also staked a claim to the high ground of fiscal responsibility in the coming battle over the Federal budget. They expressed concern that Mr. Clinton had not specified how he would pay for the tax cuts promised as part of his "middle-class bill of rights." Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican in line to become chairman of the Finance Committee, said he saw no evidence that the Administration had figured out how to pay for the tax breaks. 
 "I'm not going down that road unless we match tax cuts and spending cuts dollar for dollar," Mr. Packwood said in an interview. "The best thing we can do for the middle class is to prevent the deficit from increasing. The worst thing we can do to the middle class is to raise their mortgage payments by $30 or $50 or $60 a month by increasing the deficit." Higher interest rates are likely to follow larger deficits as the Government borrows more money, he said.
Mr. Packwood said the experience of 1981, when President Ronald Reagan's call for tax cuts led to a political bidding war, served as a cautionary lesson, showing that tax reductions could widen the deficit if not completely matched by budget cuts.
For their part, House Republicans offered new details today on far more ambitious proposals to consolidate Federal grants that go to the states for more than 300 domestic programs into 8 block grants covering many types of social activities, including welfare.
Documents circulated this week by House Republican leaders and Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee show that the programs now receive a total of $125 billion a year from the Federal Government, or 9 percent of all Federal spending. The Republicans would turn most of these programs over to the states with fewer strings and about 15 percent less money.
"If we achieve half of this, we would close down whole buildings in Washington and whole libraries of Federal regulations," said an aide to the House Republican leaders. He also said the Republicans intended to propose much more stringent work requirements for welfare recipients.
Administration officials toiled through the weekend to figure out precisely how they would pay for Mr. Clinton's tax cuts, estimated to cost $60 billion over five years. Transportation officials, for example, said that they were discussing proposals to consolidate programs providing money for highways, mass transit and railroads. State and local governments would receive less money, but would have much more leeway in using it, the officials said.
Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other Cabinet officers plan to unveil the budget cuts at a White House news conference on Monday, six weeks earlier than the budget is normally made public. They have not decided how many details to disclose; indeed, many decisions are still up in the air.
"We have to be specific enough to get some credibility," the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Mortimer L. Downey, said in an interview.
President Clinton used his weekly radio address today to promote his proposal for a tax deduction up to $10,000 a year for families paying tuition at colleges, graduate schools and some vocational schools. From the campus of Northern Virginia Community College in nearby Annandale, Va., Mr. Clinton said that "many people are being priced out of a fair shot" at higher education, and that the United States was therefore in danger of becoming "a two-tiered society."
White House officials joined lobbyists for the nation's colleges and universities today in asserting that a little-noticed Republican proposal would sharply increase the cost of higher education for students from middle-income families. Under current law, the Government pays the interest on guaranteed student loans when the borrower is in college or graduate school. Under the proposal suggested by House Republicans as a way to help finance their "Contract With America," students would be responsible for such interest costs, but could defer payment until they left school.
In the Republican response to the President today, Representative-elect Steven C. LaTourette of Ohio said Republicans could support Mr. Clinton's proposal to establish a tax deduction for tuition costs.
Prof. Michael J. Graetz, a tax law expert at Yale University who worked at the Treasury Department in the Bush Administration, said the proposed deduction for tuition costs was a good idea. "If this is a bidding war," he said, "that proposal looks like a pretty good bid." People go to vocational school to increase their earning potential, he said, but the tax code has historically been stingy in its treatment of such expenses, in contrast to the more liberal treatment of business travel and entertainment costs.
But the Administration is finding difficulty with other parts of its strategy. Mr. Clinton recently announced that he would meet with governors, mayors and Congressional leaders at the White House in mid-January to seek a bipartisan approach to changes in the nation's welfare system. White House officials said today that they feared they would lose control of this conference to Republicans, who intend to present fully developed proposals for giving the states more discretion but less money under block-grant programs.
The Republican documents say that in the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 1995, the Federal Government is expected to spend nearly $17.2 billion on "cash welfare programs for low-income people," mainly Aid to Families with Dependent Children. "We plan to reduce this amount by 15 percent, leaving $14.595 billion for the block grant," the Republican proposal says.
The proposal would require states to put at least 2 percent of their adult welfare recipients in work programs by 1997, and they would have to have 20 percent in such programs by the year 2003. That represents a huge increase from the number in work programs today.
Federal officials say that no more than 1 percent of the five million adults on welfare are now in programs that require them to work for their cash assistance. Under the Republican proposal, officials would have to find or create jobs for one million welfare recipients.
The Republicans' other block grants would cover these areas: child welfare and child abuse programs, child care, employment and training, social services, food and nutrition, housing and health care.
"Our bill is going to end the school lunch program as we know it," the documents say, explaining that it could be placed in a block grant with nutrition or child care programs. House Republicans have also listed the food stamp program as a candidate for inclusion in the "food and nutrition block grant," but they say they know that many Republican senators want to keep food stamps separate. The food stamp program costs $25 billion a year and helps feed 27 million people.
Block grants are subject to annual appropriations, which may or may not be sufficient to meet the demand. By contrast, under current law, money is automatically made available to pay benefits to anyone who satisfies the eligibility criteria for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and other such "entitlement programs."
In a confidential analysis of the Republican welfare plan, the Clinton Administration says that "families with children might be denied benefits, or benefits might have to be reduced, sharply in some instances," to comply with the proposed caps on welfare spending. Moreover, it says, there is no guarantee of child care for welfare mothers who would be required to participate in work programs.

HEADLINE: Carter Visit Instills Hope Among Serbs

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 17

 BODY:
It is bitterly cold here today in the mountain stronghold of the Bosnian Serbs, but a conviction has taken hold that Jimmy Carter might extract the Serbs from a long winter struggle and isolation.
The conviction is not shared by everyone. But the fact that a former United States President may soon come to this village, the Bosnian Serbs' "capital," has instilled the hope that America will now play a decisive role in breaking the long Bosnian deadlock. 
 "Mr. Carter has the moral stature to get peace talks going again," said Branislav Ilic, the director of the Bosnian Serb news agency. "Up to now, America has damaged peace prospects by not treating the two sides equally and by encouraging the Muslims in their offensives."
His statement reflected the almost universal conviction here that the United States has played a one-sided role in the war. Many Serbs believe the Clinton Administration has backed the Muslim-led Bosnian Government because of American economic and strategic interests in the Arab world.
The impact on American opinion of Serbian atrocities against Muslim civilians is widely dismissed because the atrocities are generally regarded as inventions of journalists or wild exaggerations.
For a long time, anger at the United States led the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic to place his faith in Russia. But this policy appears to be changing as Russia has sided with the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, against Mr. Karadzic in their conflict over what peace terms to accept in Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serbs have tried to encourage a change in the American attitude by allowing the opening of the Sarajevo airport, where two United Nations flights arrived today, and by ending their restrictions on United Nations personnel and convoys in Bosnia.
The hopes the Serbs place in Mr. Carter seem vague. But at the least, they hope he will secure a long cease-fire that would provide a backdrop for negotiations toward a final peace settlement.
The Bosnian Government, worried that an end to hostilities would merely cement the Serbian hold on 70 percent of Bosnian territory, has long resisted any cease-fire of more than three months. This position was reiterated this week by Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic.
"The snow alone would give us three months," one Bosnian Serb official said. "We hope that Mr. Carter can do more than the snow."
But a basis for ending the conflict still appears elusive. The Serbs of Pale are still united, as they have been since the beginning of the war, in the conviction that Bosnia and Herzegovina has ceased to exist as a state and that the Muslims, Croats and Serbs living in it should therefore go their separate ways.
"Bosnia does not exist any longer," said Zejka Domazet, a journalist and refugee from Sarajevo. "From the beginning it was just a fiction."
Zoran Jelic, a soldier just returned from the front, pointed to his home and said: "This is Serbian land. My house is there. We are not aggressors. We simply want to be masters of our own ground and decide our own future. We are realistic people. We will not give away what is ours."
He said the war could go on for several more years if a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serbian entity were not allowed to form separate states. "As you go to have a coffee, so we Serbs die," he said. "But it is easy to die when you know you're defending what is yours."
But another Bosnian soldier, Djordje Vukadin, expressed the apparently widespread war-weariness that is putting pressure on Mr. Karadzic to seek a way out.
"Everyone is tired of this," he said. "At the beginning I thought I was fighting out of patriotism and high ideals. Now I fight for survival, just to defend my home and my parents against the Muslims. But if this goes on until next spring, I'm leaving for Chicago."
The Clinton Administration insists that the only basis for ending the war is the so-called contact group plan. Prepared by the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany, this offers 49 percent of Bosnia to the Serbs and 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat federation.
Mr. Carter will have no mandate to change this plan. He will therefore be looking for means to coax the adversaries into negotiations where they can discuss mutually acceptable adjustments to the plan. A long cease-fire might be one such means.
But the basic problem that has confounded all attempts to bring peace to Bosnia -- disagreementover whether it should exist as an independent nation -- remains as virulent as ever and suggests that Mr. Carter will have a hard time doing better than the many mediators who have preceded him.

HEADLINE: Small Cities Like Fresno, Calif., Start to Hear Gunshots

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., Dec. 17

 BODY:
At the age of 8, when most little girls are learning how to dress Barbie or ride a two-wheel bike or skate the whole length of the driveway without taking a tumble, Laquita Johnson and her playmates have picked up a special skill.
"Soon as the shooting starts, we fall down and cover our heads," she said. "That way we don't get hit, just like you see on TV." 
 As in many small and mid-size cities, Fresno is beginning to experience a deadly surge in street gunfire as youth gangs proliferate, equip themselves with assault-type weapons and feud over turf and drug deals. And as in many other cities, the children of Fresno sometimes do not fall to the ground and cover their heads fast enough.
Three young bystanders have been critically wounded in crossfires here in recent weeks, leading law-enforcement authorities to take their most drastic step yet to try to stem the violence.
On Friday night, after an 11-year-old girl was felled by a spray of gunfire that raked her outside her house, the city's special weapons and tactics teams -- the SWAT squads -- were ordered onto the streets full time, their booted, masked, heavily armed presence bringing a war-zone feel to this central California community of 400,000.
Elsewhere around the country, increased street violence has drawn similar drastic policing action in a few cities. But almost all have been considerably larger than Fresno.
For example, Los Angeles called out its SWAT teams to deal with a rash of drive-by shootings at one point and Washington sent beefed-up patrol teams onto the street after the murder rate in the capital became the worst in the nation.
"Truth is, there's an honest-to-God war going on now in Fresno of all places," Police Chief Ed Winchester said as he dispatched his 40-member SWAT force.
Ten years ago, police veterans say, the city's gangs were loosely organized groups of teen-agers. Their violence was mainly fistfights over playground space.
Today, there are at least 68 organized gangs with names like "Modoc Street Boys." Most members tote weapons, often assault-type rifles, and they use them to secure their turf, now mainly defined by drug-dealing locations.
"Things have gotten out of control over the past two or three years," Chief Winchester said. "Fresno has become like a smaller Los Angeles or New York or Washington, D.C. We've got little kids being cut down by drive-by shootings. One was just doing his homework at the kitchen table. We've got police officers outnumbered and outgunned and being shot and sniped at -- 11 times since summer. We've got nearly a hundred people murdered so far this year, one of the state's worst rates, double what it was five years or so back. The bad stuff elsewhere is beginning to filter down to cities like us."
On their first night out, the SWAT teams worked the southern half of Fresno, the poorest section, heavily populated by Asian, black and Hispanic residents, who often work in the agricultural enterprises that support the economy of this city in heart of California's sprawling, flat central valley. Team members reported they made no big hauls of guns, drugs or gang members, though they did at one point manage to burst from the bushes upon half a dozen young men smoking crack in a cul-de-sac.
There was a brief moment of high tension during that raid when a man with a rifle suddenly appeared out of the shadows at a garage door. But it turned out that he was not associated with the drug suspects and instead was heading off on a weekend hunting trip.
"We don't expect to arrest all the trouble-makers overnight or even in the first month or two," said Sgt. Neal C. Manha, an officer overseeing the new law-enforcement strategy. "We're going to keep this going at least into the spring, maybe longer if we can come up with enough money and manpower, which is a never-ending problem in the Fresno Police Department. We've come very close to loosing control of this city."
For the most part, the increased police presence has been welcomed by Fresno residents, especially those living in high-crime areas.
"Can't put too many cops on the street far as I'm concerned," Eloise Johnson, Laquita's mother, said as two police cars rolled past the corner where she and her daughter were standing. "It's so bad that not a night goes by that I don't hear gunfire or my kids don't hit the floor at least once. I've gotten so I can tell what kind of gun is being fired -- AK-47, pistol, whatever -- just by the sound. Bring on the SWAT teams, I say."
Still, a few words of caution have been voiced.
"There are innocent people out there," said the Rev. El Swillis, pastor of St. Paul Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, which is in a high-crime neighborhood. "The community will have to keep an eye on the police to make sure they don't just start gathering people up like cattle."
The Mayor of Fresno, Jim Patterson, promises that there will be no heavy-handed policing. But he says the city will do whatever it has to do to bring crime under control.
"I was elected to fight crime," he said. "There is no other issue. It's a problem that's in every major urban city across the nation, and now it's in Fresno. We're not going to let gangs rule the streets. We're going to put them in jail."

Members of a SWAT team backed up uniformed officers who were apprehending a group of drug suspects on Friday. (Thor Swift for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Death in the Mail -- Tracking a Killer: A special report.;
Investigators Have Many Clues and Theories, but Still No Suspect in 15 Bombings

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
They have thought he might be a sullen student or teacher. They have thought he might be an enraged airline or computer worker. They have thought he might be someone at the post office or in a lumberyard. They have thought he might work at a factory that makes artificial limbs.
When he resurfaced last Saturday, mailing a package that killed an advertising executive named Thomas J. Mosser at his home in North Caldwell, N.J., investigators once again found themselves grimly sifting for clues to a bomber who has baffled them for 16 years and now seems to have escalated his rampage. The early returns, investigators said, have been achingly familiar -- no especially tantalizing leads to freshen a scent that remains faint at best -- but the searchers hint that they are exploring some new directions. 
 A $1 million reward, posted in 1993, still awaits anyone who helps find the wiliest mail bomber in modern history, one who has struck 15 times, killing 2 people and wounding 22. In further hopes of eliciting leads from the public, investigators have deliberately chosen to share an unusual amount of information in the case, which they call Unabom because of the early university and airline targets.
Extensive interviews last week with investigators, including officials of the Federal task force based in San Francisco assigned to the case, reveal a more detailed picture of a remarkably exhaustive manhunt -- thousands of leads, hundreds of suspects and endless computer searches into everything from the initials of someone's name to the phases of the moon. At one point last year, the trail led to an ex-convict who disappeared after he was questioned.
And yet, to the consternation of investigators, all the thousands of clues and theories have produced no solution. They do not know who the bomber is.
But some intriguing links have emerged. One of the more captivating ones is that the bomber is trying to say something through wood or trees. First, authorities noticed that all the bombs had various forms of wood in them, an illogical material rare in an explosive. The second device actually had tree twigs glued to it.
Then there are the names. One target was Percy Wood, who lived in Lake Forest, Ill. He got a bomb inside a novel, "Ice Brothers," published by Arbor House, whose symbol is a tree leaf. Moreover, some of the fake return addresses the bomber wrote on parcels referred to trees or wood. One listed Ravenswood, another Forest Glen Road. It may mean nothing, or it may mean a great deal, that Mr. Mosser lived on Aspen Drive.
To investigators who have spent years staring at this maddening puzzle, the recurring wood motif suggested its own swarm of possibilities. Was the bomber a crazed environmentalist? A demented lumberjack? Or, in an enigmatic case flush with blind alleys and an interminable web of theories, was it one more ploy in a macabre game?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Postal Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are all actively searching for the bomber. Jim R. Freeman, the special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the F.B.I., is flying to Washington to personally brief Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, on Monday. How close are they to catching him?
"How close?" asked Mr. Freeman. "One phone call away with the right tip. One computer run. Or years away."
 
A Pattern Emerges
Computers, Planes And Lots of Wood
 It was the third bomb, in November 1979, that first outlined the dimensions of the problem.
An explosive designed to go off at high altitude caught fire without exploding in a mailbag aboard an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Washington. Twelve passengers suffered smoke inhalation. The bomb, nearly intact in its juice-can container, was dissected by an F.B.I. bomb examiner in Washington named Christopher Ronay. The label was scorched but seemed to be addressed to a business ending in "lines" in northwest Washington. Since the bomb was mailed in Chicago, Mr. Ronay sent photos to the Chicago authorities.
The photos reminded the Chicago police of a device found in May 1979 at the Tech building of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. They sent the remains to Mr. Ronay.
"Both had two initiators, which is unusual, that were identical," he said. "Each was carved in a round dowel form with grooves cut into it on each side for the wire. There were identical wire leads, and so on. I had never seen the design before in the thousands of bombs I had examined. The chances of two different people making them were nil. We knew we had a serial bomber."
Some time later, the F.B.I. learned of an earlier bomb found in an unmailed package in May 1978 in the engineering department's parking lot at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois. Mr. Ronay concluded that it, too, came from the same hands. Presumably, it was the bomber's debut.
For tactical reasons, the authorities did not yet announce the presence of a serial bomber. And, given the evidence they had, they treated it as a Chicago matter.
In June 1980, he struck anew, mailing the bomb-in-a-novel to the home of Percy Wood, the president of United Airlines, in Lake Forest, a Chicago suburb. Now the investigation intensified, especially into anyone vindictive against the airlines. United itself had recently laid off thousands of workers; they came under suspicion. Investigators again pondered the American Airlines bomb. The bomber could not have known what flight would carry a mailed package, but 70 percent of the mail out of Chicago at the time went on United. Was he playing those odds?
A curious clue emerged. The initials FC were inscribed in a piece of metal on the bomb received by Mr. Wood. They showed up either on a metal tag or tapped into the metal on seven of the next eight bombs.
What did they signify? Who knew? Investigators pursued many people, as well as companies, with those initials. They speculated it might be an obscene phrase directed at computers. Thought was given to the fact that the identifying letters on the license plates of foreign diplomats were FC. To this day, the initials remain one more mystery.
Three more strikes occurred over the next two years, over broader territory. A bomb was dismantled in a business classroom at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Another, mailed from Utah, exploded at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. A third exploded after being placed at the University of California at Berkeley.
Authorities homed in on the seeming likelihood that the bomber had lived around Chicago, then moved to Utah and on to California. They devised lists of people who had done that. There were many.
No strong suspect emerged. But there were several new clues. A note was left with the Berkeley bomb: "Wu -- it works! I told you it would -- R.V." Investigators looked into countless Asians named Wu as well as people and groups with the initials R.V. And a janitor described a thin stranger with a mustache who was in the building at the time, but it was never clear if he was the bomber.
By now, investigators had noticed the unusual presence of wood in the bombs -- including birch, walnut, mahogany and cottonwood -- as well as the wood connections to some victims. One bomb had four varieties of wood.
"I think the wood is some sort of calling card," said Mr. Ronay, who worked on the case until his recent retirement from the F.B.I. "Maybe he's a woodsman or wants to save the trees. Wood is a significant part of the case."
Investigators began looking into environmental groups and into lumberyard workers.
 
Growing Deadlier
New Technology Creates a Murderer
 For nearly three years, the bomber was silent. Some investigators thought he was dead. Other suspected he was in prison or a mental hospital, or out of the country. It was conjectured that he had multiple personalities, and that for three years he was the other person. Some agents supposed that for three years, he simply wasn't angry at anybody.
His fury returned. Between May and December 1985, he struck four times -- a bomb placed in a computer room at the University of California at Berkeley, a bomb mailed to a fabrication division of the Boeing Company in Auburn, Wash., a bomb mailed to a psychology professor's home and one left behind a computer rental store in Sacramento, Calif.
The bombs had the telltale signs -- with one important difference. Instead of smokeless powder, they now contained a chemical combination that burned longer and hotter. The new bombs were far more lethal. And the Sacramento one killed Hugh Campbell Scrutton, the computer store's owner. The bomber was now a murderer.
Every incident implied new possibilities. The Boeing bomb, only the second not to explode, was enclosed in a wooden box with various cutouts and niches. An investigator noticing it said, "That's how prostheses are shipped." He consulted a doctor specializing in prosthetics, who agreed. Investigators began checking factories and doctors dealing in artificial body parts.
"That's how things can get away from you," said Mr. Ronay, who never thought much of that lead. "Someone makes a quantum leap -- wooden box; it's got to be prostheses. Some delicate aircraft parts are shipped in wooden boxes. That was looked at. Could he work at an aircraft parts maker? They really worked at the university and aircraft angles. They still are."
Eleven bombings now, the first death. No hot lead. In meetings between investigators, the frustration resulted in a decision: Go public. Shortly after the Scrutton death, the F.B.I. announced that it was pursuing a serial bomber.
Many more leads poured in. The mail bomber always used stamps, not metered postage, presumably to avoid having to deal with a post office clerk. Investigators noticed that the postage was either the precise amount or slightly more than necessary. They looked into whether the bomber might work at a post office. Nothing.
The bomber remained a ghost. Was it a man or a woman? A teen-ager or a retiree? A giant or a dwarf?
 
Some Answers
A Witness And a Rash of Tips
 The next attack gave some answers.
In February 1987, the bomber left a bag containing a bomb in the parking lot of a computer company in Salt Lake City. As he did, a woman sitting inside an office looked directly into his face.
She described to police a white man, 25 to 30 years old, about 6 feet, weighing about 165 pounds, with a small mustache, reddish-blond hair and a ruddy complexion. She said he was wearing sunglasses with smoked lenses and had a sweatshirt hood over his head. The police prepared a sketch from her description and made it public.
The sketch eliminated innumerable possibilities. And it brought a rash of tips, many from former wives.
Behavorial experts began drafting theoretical profiles of the bomber, drawn from his methodology and interviews with serial bombers. He was described as a loner of high intelligence who was quiet, meticulous, a maker of lists, an ideal neighbor. He was likely to drive an old car but keep it in good condition. He probably had difficulty dealing with other people, especially women. Or he could be nothing like that.
The bomber either makes his parts or uses common household items with identifying marks scraped off. He has even made screws himself, though he mostly uses commercial ones. Investigators gathered scrap metal from junkyards and trash bins in areas where bombs had been mailed and tested them to see if they might be the same batches from which he drew his materials.
No possibility was readily discounted. In pursuit of patterns, investigators studied academic calendars, phases of the moon, the positions of stars. They did computer searches of almanac information to see whether the bombings coincided with historical anniversaries.
The sketch remained the biggest breakthrough. But it also may have frightened the bomber. For more than six years, nothing was heard from him. The investigation wound down. Maybe this time he was dead.
 
A Letter
A Public Dare And a Rare Lapse
 He was not. Within the space of two days in June 1993, he sent bombs to a geneticist at the University of California at San Francisco and to a computer scientist at Yale University.
For the first time, he also spoke to the world. The New York Times received a letter from Sacramento, postmarked before the bombings, in which the bomber claimed to be part of an anarchist group calling itself FC. The letter included a nine-digit number, written in the form of a Social Security number, to be used to authenticate future communications.
Because of his methods, investigators say they do not believe that the bomber is working in concert with others; and if he were, they think a $1 million reward would have impelled someone to inform.
After much internal debate, the F.B.I. decided to announce that the bomber left FC on many of the bombs.
Other theories arose. One of the June targets worked in the field of massively parallel computing and the other in gene therapy. Both of those technologies figure prominently in the movie "Jurassic Park." The bombs were mailed the week the movie opened.
The nine-digit number in the letter was seized on. Investigators looked into whether it might be a real Social Security number and found that it matched the number of a small-time career criminal from Northern California who had, at one point, also lived in Sacramento. It turned out he was in prison during the bombings last year, and the authorities did not feel he could be the culprit. They said they might want to talk to him again. But he recently violated parole and vanished.
Another promising clue emerged from the letter, possibly the bomber's only mistake since apparently being seen in 1987. From the letter, investigators were able to discern an impression of a message the bomber may have written on another slip of paper: "Call Nathan R Wed 7 pm."
Authorities laboriously pursued that lead. Driver's license records and phone books were scrutinized throughout the country to identify anyone named Nathan with a middle or last name beginning with R. Ten thousand Nathan R's poured forth. Agents interviewed them all. Nothing.
Given the bomber's success, investigators feel he must have tested some of his devices outdoors. People are unlikely to blow up bombs in their bathrooms. The authorities prowled into rock quarries and deserts, and sought out forest rangers who may have seen people testing explosives.
A few months ago, investigators talked again with the Salt Lake City witness. She had never been entirely happy with the police sketch, and investigators brought in a new artist who redid it, notably filling out the hair style. The artist also added aging to the face. The new sketch was shown to the public after the Dec. 10 bombing.
 
The Latest Attack
Promising Clues, Too Many of Them
 Last Saturday's bombing that killed Mr. Mosser has not yet introduced any clearly important clues, the authorities said, though there is much still to be studied. The FC initials were not found in the debris, the third consecutive bomb missing them. There was, however, wood. Moreover, the bomb contained a chemical mixture he had never used before that was more powerful, suggesting an escalation. The package it came in bore a fictitious name and address, H. C. Wickel of the Department of Economics of San Francisco State University, and was mailed from San Francisco.
In the last week, something like 5,000 tips or theories have poured into the "800" number of the task force, as well as numerous E-mail messages. Last week, the task force appealed for help to computer users over the Internet, the vast computer communications network.
Still, investigators have yet to find a common thread among the victims -- scholars, computer people, airline people, high-technology people -- and no one seemed to share anything with an advertising executive. It has been pointed out that some of the clients of Mr. Mosser's company, Young & Rubicam, are computer companies. It has been pointed out that his brother is an immunologist. It has been pointed out that he lived on a street named after a tree.
Investigators continue to sniff into the prevalence of wood, though Mr. Freeman of the F.B.I. said that several other lines of inquiries that he would not discuss were "more interesting."
Some bombs went to places, some to specific people. Of the 15 bombs, seven went to or were sent from California. Nine involved universities. Investigators say they believe there is something in those frequencies, and are especially keen on the possibility that he lives in California. Several times, the bomber sent innocent-sounding messages to victims ahead of his bombs, diabolical enticements to open the packages personally.
They are reconstructing the Mosser package and plan to show it to mail carriers in San Francisco in the hopes that it will be recognized. They are also asking if anyone in San Francisco knows of someone who recently relocated to the city or if anyone had a house guest in early December who asked that they mail a package, allowing the possibility that the bomber did not mail the bomb himself.
They are now looking into advertising, a previously unexplored field. Some agents, however, say they think the bomber has gravitated from sending bombs with a purpose to simply playing a devilish game with law enforcement. Agents said that the bomber's sending a letter to a newspaper suggests that he craves notoriety. That he mailed the latest bomb from San Francisco, right under the noses of the task force, may imply he is mocking his pursuers.
"We don't know the motive," Mr. Freeman said. "Is it revenge? Is it publicity? We see a consistent span of targets. If you were to try to ascribe a motive, it's only a theory, a theory that he hates computers, hates airlines, hates universities, hates professors. But we don't know if he hates at all."
Or, as Mr. Ronay put it: "Even something outlandish is possible. Maybe he got cut off by these guys in traffic."
Suspects do keep cropping up. A handful, investigators said, were compelling enough to be put under surveillance for a while. A few years ago, a university worker was scrutinized. He was outspokenly contemptuous of computers and technology. His initials were F. C.
"The guys went nuts over that," Mr. Ronay said. "They ran it to the ground. He sure looked good. But he was out of the country at some points and there were other things that made it clear he couldn't possibly have done it."
By now, given all the people they have spoken to, investigators think it is entirely possible that they have interviewed the bomber himself.
"He may well be in our files," one agent said.
"The problem is not that there are no leads; there are too many," said James Cavanaugh, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who has worked on the case. "And Unabomber hasn't told us enough. I feel he wants to tell us more."
No one is giving up. They remain hopeful that at some point, if he has not already, the bomber will brag of his deeds to someone who will turn him in. Or that he will slip up. "Unabomber is human," said Mr. Cavanaugh. "He has a flaw. When we find it, we'll catch him."

HEADLINE: Shoppers and Visitors Create Visions of a Record Christmas

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
The Empire State Building is drawing at least 50 percent more visitors than in any previous December, greeted by King Kong in a Santa hat, who began a week of appearances starting yesterday.
Contributions to the Salvation Army and the New York Cares Coat Drive are up markedly; Tourneau, the Swiss watch emporium, is having its best Christmas season, even selling a few $400,000 watches, and hotels and restaurants at all price levels are packed. 
 Buoyed by perceptions of a better economy and a safer city, residents and visitors have come together in the city's vibrantly decorated streets and stores to make this one of the headiest holiday seasons in recent years. The evidence includes record attendance at Radio City Musical Hall's Christmas Show.
"The interest in the show is astronomical," said Rose Polidoro-Taylor, a spokeswoman, who says shows are more than 90 percent sold out.
Cabdrivers say tips are hefty, although it's hard to make way in the heavy traffic. Shoppers are crowding both the new superstores like Bed, Bath and Beyond and the traditional department stores like Bloomingdale's and Macy's to take advantage of pre-Christmas bargains. Even interior decorators, who say this is usually a dormant period, say business has been booming for small makeovers in advance of holiday parties.
A telling mark of the surging seasonal optimism: At Cleopatra's, a nightclub on West 44th Street, patrons are again throwing big bills at the belly dancers after several years of singles.
"This is a great end to a great year, the best year in a long time," said Herb Brinskelle, an insurance salesman visiting the tree in Rockefeller Center.
In Harlem, where merchants have banded together to festoon 125th Street with decorations -- wreaths, red lanterns, candy canes and red and white candles -- spirits are high. "The season's hustle and bustle have come early," Abdul Hakein, manager of the Isis Card and Book Store, said.
New York cabdrivers may still be rude and public toilets almost nonexistent, but this holiday season there is an unmistakable feeling of cheer. It may reflect a reduced crime rate, or what environmental authorities say is measurably cleaner air, or perhaps just the winning national impression cast on New York by the Letterman and "Today" programs.
Economic reasons include a drop in the unemployment rate, and the cascading effects of foreign tourists drawn by the cheap dollar. But the effect is as surely apparent in people's smiles as in the clanging cash registers.
"I see an air of graciousness returning to our town," said Jonathan M. Tisch, president and chief executive officer of Loews Hotels, which has four New York hotels, each of which is running 10 percent ahead of the pace of a year ago. "People aren't barking as much as they used to."
The hustle and bustle is inherently not quantifiable, at least until the end of the month, when sales receipts and other statistics are tallied. But the Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that 24 million people will visit the city this year, an increase of 10 percent. Stephen Morello, president of the bureau, says the surge began with the Gay Games and World Cup in the summer, crescendoed in the fall and has now flowered into what appears to be one of the biggest holiday seasons in memory.
"It's not a miracle, and it's not limited to 34th Street," Mr. Morello said.
Alhough the Metropolitan Transportation Authority does not yet have statistics on train trips to the city, an indication of heightened visits is a 21 percent increase in ridership on New York Bus Service, which transports people from the North Bronx to Manhattan. On return trips, the overhead shelves are laden with presents.
There is hardly enough hotel space to go around. John Fox, senior vice president of PKF Consulting, which monitors the industry, said that although final numbers will not be available until next month, this is almost certainly the biggest December in history for New York hotels. Hotel visits have been steadily rising since September 1993, he said.
Jessica Miller, who owns a public relations company, said she looked frantically for a hotel room for friends visiting from Belgium. "I called everywhere, from the Waldorf to you name it, and I couldn't get a room," she said.
Tim Zagat, who publishes a guide to local hotels and has many contacts in the industry, said he has had to scramble to find rooms for visiting friends. "We've had to make enormous efforts to get in," he said.
Mr. Morello suggested that some of the upturn in the hotels' business is the result of a recent cut in the city and state hotel tax from a combined 21.25 percent to 15.25 percent. "We're no longer the highest in the country," he said. "Columbus, Ohio, is."
Restaurants seem to be doing well. Mr. Zagat, publisher of Zagat Surveys, said he visited 30 restaurants on a recent night, and most were packed with local and foreign customers. "Things were really busting at the seams in most of the restaurants," he said.
Marc Sherry, owner of the Old Homestead restaurant on Ninth Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets, said, "People are overspending and overpartying and it's absolutely great."
In particular, Mr. Sherry said demand for Kobe steak from Japan is exceeding supply. In order to get the best cut, the $150 Kobe supreme, customers must order weeks in advance, he said. He also said people are ordering bigger lobsters and more expensive wine. Customers who several years ago were ordering a $35 or $40 bottle, these days are asking for vintages costing $70 to $150, he said.
More moderate restaurants are also doing well. The Mulholland Drive Cafe on Third Avenue at 63d Street offers customers the chance to have an extra large portion of a regular entree. A bowl of pasta usually costing $12 may be ordered on what is called a "big platter" for $15. It is enough for two.
Even though this means Mulholland gets less per customer, a spokesman for the restaurant, Bernie Bennett, said sales are running higher because of the sheer volume of holiday business.
Penny Glazier, who with her husband, Peter, owns the Symphony Cafe, the Monkey Bar and Bridgewaters, a caterer, has noticed several upbeat trends. At catered holiday events for companies, the number showing up has been far exceeding those with reservations. There are more groups of 8 or 10 in restaurants, twice the usual size for dinner parties, she said.
"The city is coming back," Mrs. Glazier said. "I can really feel the difference."
Indicative of the new friskiness is a 1936 Lincoln Zephyr, called the High Life Mobile. It is bedecked with wreaths and garlands, and goes from bar to bar, particularly to the two establishments it represents, the High Life Bar and Grill on the West Side and the High Life Restaurant and Lounge on the East Side.
"There are just more people hitting the bars," said the owner of the two restaurants, Earl Geer, who grew up on a Christmas tree farm. "Things are really jamming this year."
Another indication that people have more money to spend is at a pet supply store called Karen's for People Plus Pets at 1195 Lexington Avenue, between 81st and 82d Streets. People have been lined up to bring their dogs and cats to see Santa, said to be a veteran of Macy's. Carol Nolan, the store manager, said the dogs have been asking mainly for handmade coats, which start at $95.
People have also been giving more. Gifts to the Salvation Army have been up 9 percent, with many contributors including emotional notes referring to the theft of 5,000 toys from an army building two weeks ago in the Bronx. Ed Abrahams, director of the New York Cares Coat Drive, said his group will distribute 75,000 donated coats this year, an increase of 10,000 from last year.
"I like Christmas because I get to be very charitable," said Stacey Mondschein, a lawyer shopping in Macy's for children's sneakers, blankets and a piece of jewelry for a new mother. She had gone to the post office to read a needy child's letter to Santa, and was responding with her time and money.
Nearby, Kristin Baker, a graduate student visiting from Boston, said she was a bit overwhelmed by the holiday hordes. "Is this the way it always is?" she asked. "Or is it Christmas?"
She was not alone in wondering if this Christmas season might be getting a touch out of hand. Per Odgren of Stockholm paused outside a SoHo gallery to say he could not get a table in any nice restaurant, much less his first choice, the Rainbow Room. He was worried that Radio City's Christmas Show would be sold out.
"If you walk down Fifth Avenue, it's very, very, very crowded," he said tiredly. "And the traffic jams. I've never seen anything like it."
But it takes a mailman to truly see the dark side of Christmas. "My foot hurts me and the customers are belligerent," said a midtown letter carrier, who would not give his name. "But I love Christmas for my wife and kids and grandkids; for my family, I love it."
 
STATUS REPORT
Stand in Line, Santa
 
The streets are teeming, hotels and restaurants are full, the crime rate is down and it's looking a lot like Christmas in New York. Some hopeful symptoms:
 
Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Show is drawing more people than ever, with last Saturday's 35,000 attendees the highest in history.
 
Contributions to the Salvation Army are up 9 percent, but more tellingly, there has been an outpouring of personal letters accompanying contributions.
 
At Cleopatra's, a nightclub with belly dancers at 327 West 44th Street, people are again throwing $5 and $10 bills at the dancers, after years of singles.
 
 Tim Zagat, who publishes a New York City hotel guide, can't get reservations for his friends.
 
At Gourmet Garage, root vegetables reflect a new simplicity; but caviar is an even bigger seller.
 
Tourneau has sold several watches for nearly $400,000, and Fortunoff reports a resurging demand for 18-carat gold.
 
Visits to the Empire State Building exceed any previous December by more than 50 percent.
 
Old Homestead Restaurant, on 10th Avenue, is requiring customers to order its expensive cut of kobe steak, $150 each, weeks in advance.
 
After years of having the highest hotel tax in the country, New York doesn't, as of Dec. 1. Hello, Columbus, Ohio!

HEADLINE: City Hall and Schools

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's brash campaign to oust Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines shows how the city's changing political machinery has helped cut the school system loose from the politics of City Hall.
The chancellor is still chosen by a board of seven members, two appointed by the mayor and one each by the five borough presidents. But the legal and collegial ties that bound them have all but evaporated since the dismantling five years ago of the city's Board of Estimate. 
 That legislative body, made up of the borough presidents and three citywide officials, including the mayor, was abolished after the Justice Department ruled that it violated the principle of one person, one vote. For decades, it had served as a ready-made back room for bartering, dividing the spoils and, in some cases, choosing schools chancellors.
Now, with no such structure, Mr. Giuliani is on his own and lacks the leverage his predecessors had.
When Mayor Edward I. Koch wanted Frank J. Macchiarola as chancellor in 1978, the lobbying began with the borough presidents, their patrons and their appointees to the Board of Education. The swing vote on the board was cast by the Manhattan borough president's appointee, whom the Mayor later named chairman of the city's Human Rights Commission.
"It's important that you reward loyalty," Mr. Koch recalled recently.
For all its faults, the board provided political glue that sealed opportunistic coalitions among city officials as well as institutional gravity that prevented the supposedly autonomous but financially dependent Board of Education from spinning off into its own orbit.
"All of that went away," said H. Carl McCall, the Board of Education president installed by Mayor David N. Dinkins and the current State Comptroller, "because of the absence of the Board of Estimate, where the mayor and the borough presidents were in constant negotiation about everything."
Herman Badillo, a former borough president himself, a deputy mayor under Mr. Koch and now Mr. Giuliani's special education adviser, said: "When the borough presidents appointed a Board of Education member they got no patronage, but if they went along with Koch's appointment of Macchiarola they got something else: an appointee in an agency, a public works project, something that had nothing to do with education."
Conflicts with City Hall and even between the board and the chancellor -- if the mayor couldn't control one, he usually could the other -- often were resolved in private.
"I don't remember Mayor Wagner getting deeply involved in who was the chancellor, and that was when the mayor then appointed the whole Board of Education," said Edward N. Costikyan, who was named last spring to revamp the city's system of school governance. "It was a lot more informal and subterranean. Now, the underlying interconnections that enabled it to be subterranean aren't there anymore."
Those connections once gave Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, the leverage to withhold her vote for building a new Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan until Mr. Koch and the school board also approved a $6 million swimming pool for the proposed West Queens High School.
"I did it with the Board of Estimate far easier than I could do it without the Board of Estimate," she recalled.
Since the administration of Robert F. Wagner, every mayor has demanded more control over the education system, which spends about 25 cents of every budget dollar and which, by state law and court decree, requires minimum levels of financing from the city. Now, unlike during the city's 1970's fiscal crisis, school enrollment is rising -- further crimping the Mayor's budget and the Chancellor's agenda.
"If the mayor is ultimately held accountable and is virtually mandated to give over a certain percentage of his budget, a mayor has a legitimate claim to more control," said Meyer S. Frucher, a trustee of the School Construction Authority.
But how much control?
"Koch wanted 11 members with six going to the mayor, and the teachers union finally agreed to nine with four members from the mayor," said Peter Piscatelli, whom Mr. Koch recruited from the Board of Education as his chief Albany lobbyist. "Koch turned down their offer and I never understood why."
Debates about education had been infused with politics long before William Marcy Tweed, the 19th-century Tammany Hall boss, began his political ascendancy by joining a school board. That was why the Board of Education was insulated from City Hall in the first place. Without the political symbiosis that the Board of Estimate fostered and because Mr. Giuliani is a Republican whose educational agenda seems dominated by budget-cutting, what is left of the Democratic organization is reluctant to accommodate him.
Four of the five borough presidents are Democrats; the fifth is a Republican, but has been feuding with the Mayor for months.
Mr. Giuliani's adamancy in budget negotiations has also driven a wedge between him and another potential ideological soul mate, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone. Mr. Vallone, a Queens Democrat, is also a supporter of Carol A. Gresser of Queens, the Board of Education president, who may want to become borough president herself someday.
When Mr. Dinkins was Mayor, Mrs. Gresser was a leader of the so-called Gang of Four, the board majority that, with prodding from Mr. Giuliani, ousted Joseph A. Fernandez as Chancellor and installed Mr. Cortines. That conflict was largely ideological.
In the latest clash, Mr. Giuliani maintains that Mr. Cortines is resisting the budget cuts being demanded of other city agencies and that the board's resilient bureaucracy has shrunk but not withered under the Chancellor's begrudging economies.
"Under Fernandez, you had the establishment and the Mayor for him and what was missing was the Board of Education," said Stanley S. Litow, who was Mr. Fernandez's deputy chancellor. "Now, you have the same array of support and the Board of Education, but what's missing is the Mayor."
Also missing is a political structure that encouraged compromise.
And because so much of the school system's budget is raised by a mayor but spent by a chancellor, Mr. Frucher said, "this is not going to be resolved by whether or not there is a temporary truce between two individuals." He added, "The problem is structural."
 
LOOKING BACK
Restructuring Public Schools
 
Since the schools were decentralized in 1969, proposals have been drafted to to revamp the system. These are among the most prominent:
 
MORE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- In 1991, the Temporary State Commission on New York City School Governance, headed by State Sen. John J. Marchi of Staten Island, proposed that the 32 districts be replaced by about 50 smaller ones. The goal was to give parents more control.
 
MORE CITY HALL INFLUENCE -- The Marchi Commission also proposed expanding the seven-member central Board of Education to nine members by giving the Mayor four appointees, rather than two. The other five are named by the borough presidents.
 
SHIFT POWER TO BOROUGHS -- Last year, Borough Presidents Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan and Claire Shulman of Queens creating five borough school boards over the local school boards. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a mayoral candidate, embraced the proposal with a caveat: that the combined spending of the five boards be no more than was being spent centrally.
 
PUT SCHOOLS UNDER CITY HALL -- In July, a report commissioned by Mayor Giuliani recommended that a commissioner of education appointed by the Mayor replace the schools chancellor, who is now hired by the central Board of Education. It alsa recommended that borough boards replace the central bureaucracy. The report, by Edward N. Costikyan, sought to shift budgetary control to individual schools and to free them to experiment with independent -- even private -- management.

HEADLINE: NEEDIEST CASES;
Cabdriver's School Benefits to Public Hardly Need Explaining

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The tour bus lurched down Columbus Avenue and stopped near Lincoln Center. Mor-Sourang Mbaye and his companions stared silently ahead, unimpressed. Later, when they passed the World Trade Center, not a single neck craned skyward.
But when the bus approached a no-taxi zone, Mr. Mbaye and the other passengers murmured appreciatively. And when it hit gridlock on Third Avenue, they leapt to their feet for a better view. 
 "Just look at that," Mr. Mbaye said as cars piled into an intersection. "People like that are going to make our lives very difficult."
For Mr. Mbaye, a Senegalese immigrant struggling to learn the warlike art of cab driving, the bus tour was about strategy, not sightseeing. It was part of a private class that teaches prospective taxi drivers -- nearly all of them immigrants -- how to navigate the five boroughs and get along with passengers.
The class was begun in 1984, in response to customers' complaints about how hard it was to find drivers who could speak English or find their way around New York.
The city requires the class for all new drivers, who have to pass an English-proficiency test and pay their own tuition. Thousands do so eagerly, hungry for the chance to gain a marketable skill and a foothold in the economy.
Although it is dangerous and tiring, the taxi business has always drawn immigrants -- Irish and Italians a generation ago, Bangladeshis and Indians today. Newly arrived New Yorkers often turn to taxi driving because it promises steady work and above-average pay, said Leonard H. Katz, coordinator of the Federation Employment Guidance Service's New York City Taxi Driver Institute, which sponsors the class.
The service, which receives financing from UJA-Federation of New York, a charity supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provides an array of training programs for immigrants, teaching things like business management and appliance repair. But as the percentage of foreign-born cabbies continues to rise -- it was 90 percent in 1991, up from 75 percent in 1984 -- the program whose results are the most visible to New Yorkers is taxi school.
"Immigrants drive taxis because they can't make this kind of money in the other jobs available for them," Mr. Katz said, adding that cabbies can make up to $12 an hour. "If they're not driving cabs, chances are they're working very long hours in a very menial job," he said.
Ali Sibtain, who immigrated from Pakistan in 1990, earned $4 an hour in a toy store before he quit this month. His boss paid him off the books, and if business was slow, he would send Mr. Sibtain home early.
"Driving a taxi means you are the boss; you can work 24 hours a day," said Mr. Sibtain, 38. "I wish I could go to school and prepare for a better job, but I have two children and rent to pay. Right now this is the best choice."
That is why Mr. Sibtain, a former customs official, sat in a taxi institute classroom on the eve of the bus tour, poring over a map to determine the quickest route from the Bronx to Staten Island. When the instructor, Andrew Vollo, asked a question, Mr. Sibtain and his classmates answered in a singsong melange of accents:
"What do you do if you get stuck in traffic?"
"Alternate route!"
"What if you get really stuck?"
"Sit back and enjoy it!"
The taxi school, mandatory for new drivers, consists of a 40-hour course that covers regulations, geography, courtesy and crime prevention. Students pay their own tuition, which ranges from $70 to $275 based on language proficiency. Those who speak poor English take an 80-hour course with emphasis on driver-passenger conversation, learning essential terms like "scofflaw" and "anti-lock brakes."
If they pass the course, immigrants can look forward to 12-hour days, unpaid vacations and constant worries about mechanical breakdowns, robberies and even murder. (A record 43 livery drivers and cabbies were killed in New York last year.)
Durand Dormelus, a Haitian immigrant who has driven a cab in New York for six years, said he was happy if he cleared $80 in a 12-hour day. Mr. Dormelus, 38, of Irvington, N.J., said the job was dangerous and hard on his health. "It's a killer," he said. "A few months ago I had a problem with my back, and it hurt so bad I had to stop work for a while." But he says he considers himself fortunate: he has steady work, and has never been robbed.
"This is the perfect American job," said Mohammed Iqbal, 32, a Pakistani immigrant who worked in a convenience store before enrolling in the taxi school. "We work hard, we can make as much money as we want." Mr. Iqbal said his previous job was the only one he could find in his first two years here. Like others in the class, he said he planned to drive a taxi for several years and save enough money to attend college or start a business.
In the 1980's, when fewer people immigrated to New York and the economy was booming, entry-level jobs were easier to find. But now, an estimated 111,500 immigrants are coming to the city each year, and a long recession has forced many to work in the underground economy or seek public assistance. Job-training opportunities are rare, but invaluable, said Ilene Margolin, associate executive vice president of the employment guidance service.
"A lot of immigrants are highly educated, very bright, but they have no language skills," Ms. Margolin said. "Our programs help them hit the ground running, to shorten the time it takes for them to learn English and get placed in jobs."
In addition to the taxi institute, the guidance service operates a business school with the New York Association for New Americans. And in Brooklyn, a trade school trains immigrants, many of them refugees, in building maintenance and appliance repair.
Oksana Lvova, a Ukrainian immigrant who is studying bookkeeping at the business school, said she hoped secretarial training would eventually lead to a high-paying job. "In America, it is impossible to find a job without work experience," said Ms. Lvova, who was an engineer in Kiev before she came to New York this year. "I hope that this will be the first step. Being a secretary is better than sweeping the streets."
Even when low-wage jobs are available, Ms. Margolin said, educated and skilled immigrants are sometimes reluctant to take them. "They don't realize that their first job is not necessarily their last job," she said. "They have to go through many levels, layers and careers to reach their eventual goals."
But even the most patient immigrants grow frustrated. Shib Das, a taxi institute student, came from Bangladesh with an electrical engineering degree. Since he arrived in New York two years ago, he has worked at a fast-food restaurant for the minimum wage.
"It makes me cry to see others with no education, no English, working next to me for the same wages," he said. "For the last two years I have not taken one day off, and still I cannot afford school."
Mr. Das said driving a cab would help him reach his goal of returning to school. But thousands of others will not have the same opportunity. The demand for job-training programs far exceeds the supply, and government cutbacks make the prospect of new programs unlikely. Mr. Mbaye, the Senegalese immigrant, said he did not understand why the city did not offer more services to help immigrants find work.
"If I am not mistaken, the Mayor, Mr. Giuliani, has parents who came from Italy," he said. "If the system did not provide some chances for them, he would not be the Mayor today."
Before Mr. Mbaye went to taxi school, he worked in restaurant kitchens, clothing stores and, most recently, selling watches on the street. He said he was willing to drive seven days a week to realize his dream of becoming an actor. But after several years of menial jobs and poverty-level income, he is cynical.
"You come here with wishes to make money, to make a good life," he said. "But you have to kill yourself to make it happen."

Expecting a decrease in financing over the next few years, Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, is recruiting volunteers to deliver social services to the poor.
Thomas A. DeStefano, executive director of the agency, said it is relying more heavily on a network of 1,600 volunteers, saving money that would otherwise be spent on salaries or contracted services. He pointed to the example of a retired couple who cook meals in a center for the elderly in their Brooklyn neighborhood. 
 "There are some things the local communities just cannot provide, so we step in with our volunteers," Mr. DeStefano said. "They are working in their own communities, where they are already invested and really want to make a difference."
Catholic Charities may fall about $100,000 short of its $5 million budget because longtime donors are not able to give as much this year. "Up until this year we have been holding our own," Mr. DeStefano said. "But times are harder and people are really feeling threatened by the economy."
A loss of $150,000 from the city Department of Youth Services means 15 staff positions will be eliminated, affecting services for children. Project Bridge, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, will lose four after-school programs for 240 children aged 6 to 12. A skills-building program in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, called Pass II Play will be eliminated.
Catholic Charities was founded in 1899 when several smaller agencies in Brooklyn and Queens pooled their resources. It now offers dozens of services, including job training for teen-agers, prison ministry and day-care centers. Six mental health clinics provide individual and group counseling for people of all ages. A program delivers hot meals to more than 5,000 homebound elderly people. A refugee resettlement program provides emergency help, counseling and job training to new immigrants. And a Human Mobile Outreach Team provides help to mentally ill homeless people in Brooklyn and Queens.
Mr. DeStefano said the organization's four Family Action Centers, which receive no government funding, desperately need private donations. The centers, which provide crisis intervention, emergency assistance and long-term counseling, serve more than 35,000 families a year. Their services include parenting workshops, support groups for grandmothers and child safety workshops. But only 10 to 15 people staff each center, with a total budget of $2 million.
"People come to these centers with every kind of issue you can imagine, and our staff monitors each case," Mr. DeStefano said. "But with limited resources, there's no way they can cover the whole barrage of issues that arrive on their doorsteps."

SLY AND ABLE
A Political Biography of James F. Byrnes.
By David Robertson.
Illustrated. 639 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $29.95. 
THE rather unflattering title -- "Sly and Able" -- that David Robertson has given this valuable work suggests a main difficulty presented him by his subject. James F. Byrnes (1882-1972), who 50 years ago was widely deemed the second most powerful man in American political life, was a small man physically and, save for his ambition, not large in other ways. Though he was at different times in his career a United States Senator, a Supreme Court Justice and a Secretary of State (in 1946 Time magazine selected him as its Man of the Year), he had no grand vision, no great compassion, no capacity for inspirational leadership. In personal relationships he manifested a good deal of "Irish charm." He could and did make himself liked by those who might advance him. But he was an intensely private, rather cold personality, shrewd, quick, manipulative, hard-working, the very opposite of colorful or dramatic, with a sharp eye for the main chance and a talent for seizing it.
Byrnes's ambition, which was immense, was for power per se; he seems never to have asked himself why he craved it or what ultimate ends he would pursue with it once he had it. He was a remarkably adroit politician, with a flair for resolving conflicts through more or less creative compromises. But when he achieved a position that demanded high statesmanship of him in a historical crisis, he remained exclusively a domestic political animal who measured possibilities and made decisions exclusively in terms of their perceived effect on coming elections.
Faced with the problem of writing an interesting book about so essentially uninteresting a man, Mr. Robertson, a poet and former newspaper editor, has solved it triumphantly by emphasizing context. Prodigious research has enabled him to produce a richly detailed narrative, and the details are almost as much about the people, the forces and the issues amid which Byrnes made his way as they are about Byrnes himself. There are full-length portraits of the men who most helped his career, notably the South Carolina populist leader and demagogue Pitchfork Ben Tillman and the financier Bernard Baruch. There are illuminating accounts of every project, every historical development in which Byrnes had even a minor part. As a result, "Sly and Able" is history as well as biography, rising to a climax in its account of the years 1945-46, when Byrnes's attitudes and decisions at the very apex of American political power helped determine some of the main features of the America we live in today.
Born an Irish Catholic in Charleston, S.C., in 1882, but converted to Episcopalianism after his marriage in 1906, Byrnes began his national political career in 1910 when he was elected a Democratic Congressman. He served seven House terms as a typical Southern politician of his time, if far more able than most. He was conservative in his socioeconomic views and a white supremacist as a matter of course, less eager than some to use race as a campaign issue yet capable, in 1919, of delivering on the House floor a virulently racist diatribe incited by the demands of black war veterans for citizenship rights in the South.
After losing a bid for the Senate in 1924, he won a seat six years later with the financial help of Baruch. Once there he actively opposed anti-poll-tax and anti-lynching bills, helping to lead a notorious filibuster against the latter in 1938. However, his tactical skill in political warfare, influence with fellow conservatives and party loyalty enabled him to serve President Franklin D. Roosevelt well on important occasions, especially after the 1938 midterm elections drastically reduced Congressional liberalism.
But it was with the establishment in 1942 of the Office of Economic Stabilization as one of the President's war emergency agencies that Byrnes entered his period of greatest fame and power. He had been appointed a Supreme Court Justice in 1941 -- a lifetime post of great honor for which, however, he was ill fitted and in which he was unhappy. He longed to return to active politics, especially after Pearl Harbor, and jumped at the chance to do so when Roosevelt, in October 1942, offered him the directorship of the new agency. He moved into an office in the White House's East Wing, whence he exercised authority over activities, as Executive Order 9250 put it, "relating to the control of civilian purchasing power, prices, rents, wages, salaries, profits, subsidies and all related matters." He proved a highly effective wartime inflation fighter, if in ways that helped business and hurt organized labor (wages were pretty well frozen at mid-1942 levels; there was no such freezing of business profits). When Roosevelt at last established, in May 1943, a long-needed superagency, the Office of War Mobilization, with blanket authority over virtually the whole of the civilian side of the war effort, Byrnes was the natural choice to head it.
As "economic czar" or "assistant President" he administered a planned economy that was far from socialistic. Every key economic post in the
Federal Government was occupied by a big-business man, thanks to Roosevelt's reliance on wealthy "dollar-a-year" men; these individuals set a basic planning pattern that was profitable to their corporations (they successfully fought off all efforts adequately to tax what were called excess profits); and they were generally enthusiastic about Byrnes's operations, especially during the winter of 1944-45, when, with the winding down of the war effort, his agency became by executive order the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion.
Byrnes was by then embittered by the disappointment of his hopes for the 1944 Vice Presidential nomination -- Roosevelt having led him to believe he was the White House's choice, then picking Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri instead. If there was poetic justice here (Roosevelt's decision was partly determined by opposition to Byrnes from black people and organized labor), it only increased Byrnes's bitterness. This in turn increased his willingness to side with big business and the armed services during the vehement arguments over reconversion that raged in 1944 and 1945.
The reconversion Byrnes opted for assured the continued concentration in large corporations of economic strength that had been drained away from small businesses by wartime Government procurement policies. It also weakened organized labor. Hence, to the extent that Byrnes, as economic czar, made a permanent contribution to American institutional life, it was by helping establish that "military-industrial complex" President Dwight D. Eisenhower later uncharacteristically deplored.
When Roosevelt died in April 1945, Byrnes was a private citizen in Spartanburg, S.C., having just resigned from government. But within a week or so President Truman appointed him to a committee to advise on the use of the atomic bomb (Byrnes had been one of the very few in Washington who knew of the Manhattan Project, and had been included in the American delegation to Yalta). In July he became Truman's Secretary of State.
During this crucial period when the cold war began, his chief foreign policy contributions, Mr. Robertson indicates, were to make sure that the atomic bomb was dropped, without warning, on Japan, and to see that it remained exclusively an American possession. To these ends, he resisted the efforts of many atomic physicists for a demonstration rather than a murderous employment of the awesome weapon they had created, and for international atomic controls to prevent an otherwise inevitable arms race with the Soviet Union.
Simultaneously, he refused to consider, until after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese peace feelers that were first put out in April 1945 -- offers to surrender on the condition that Japan be permitted to retain its Emperor and his prerogatives. Failure to use the bomb, after $2 billion of the taxpayers' money had been spent on it, would outrage the electorate and destroy the Administration, Byrnes argued, and failure to demand unconditional surrender from Japan would have the same effect. Truman agreed. Yet five days after the Nagasaki bombing, Japan was permitted to surrender on terms that retained the Emperor.
THE remainder of Byrnes's Cabinet service was considerably less controversial. He capably managed the Iranian crisis of the winter of 1945-46 and bravely resisted, on behalf of his department, the onset of McCarthyism. But under the new pressures he revealed character traits (arrogance, vanity, conceit) hitherto concealed or perhaps undeveloped, antagonizing both the men closest to Truman and Truman himself. His resignation in January 1947 was welcomed by the President, who promptly appointed George C. Marshall his successor.
Returning to South Carolina, Byrnes was elected Governor in 1950 and as such, after the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, became a leader of the South's massive resistance to racial integration. Leaving office in 1955, he soon left the Democratic Party also, since the party's civil rights policies had become anathema to him. As one of his last activities in the public arena, he helped Richard Nixon devise the "Southern strategy" of the 1960's, whereby Republicans were able to pry much of the white South away from the Democrats. Byrnes died in relative obscurity on April 9, 1972, less than a month before his 90th birthday. Today he is almost entirely forgotten. "Sly and Able" should help revive the memory of a man whose career -- as Congressman, Senator, Governor, Supreme Court Justice, Secretary of State and "assistant President" -- continues to affect us all.
 
 
 
F.D.R.'S FIXER
 Despite his later success in other branches of government and the comparative financial insecurity of his years as a senator, Byrnes at the close of his life declared this period of his public service to have been the happiest -- the period of political inheritance in the U.S. Senate beginning with Franklin Roosevelt's 100-day special session of the 73d Congress. . . .
Unemployment, bank failures and depressed prices for manufactured goods and farm commodities were, as Byrnes knew, now the responsibilities of the Democratic Administration. Consequently, Byrnes was of one mind with the President on the necessity for action. During the four months between March and June 1933, during the first session of the 73d Congress, President Roosevelt and his advisers released what could be described as a God's plenty of proposed legislation; and in the U.S. Senate, Jimmy Byrnes was the embodiment of that Presidential energy. Byrnes assisted in drafting major New Deal legislation of the Hundred Days, including the Emergency Banking Act . . . allowing Government purchase of preferred bank stock; the Farm Credit Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act, providing Federal financing of mortgages to distressed farmers or urban homeowners; and the Economy Act of 1933, which in the name of promoting greater efficiency gave Roosevelt unprecedented powers to reorganize the Federal bureaucracy by executive order. Additionally, Byrnes during the special session acted as the Administration's whip on the passage through the upper chamber of the bills creating the Civilian Conservation Corps (C.C.C.), the Agricultural Adjustment Act (A.A.A.) and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. During this sustained activity, Byrnes was often described as the mercurial figure in a pin-striped suit working behind the scenes for the Administration. . . .
Jimmy Byrnes knew the angles. He became known in the Senate as the Administration's "fixer," who could take control of a piece of legislation stalled by opposing viewpoints, improve the bill's chances for passage through compromise and then quickly get the bill passed and off the legislative calendar. Cassandra Connor, personal secretary to Byrnes, later recalled how frequently Franklin Roosevelt telephoned the Senator's office during the Hundred Days and subsequent legislative sessions. "I don't want to talk to him," the President sometimes told Miss Connor. "I just want to know what he's up to." From "Sly and Able."

BOREDOM
The Literary History of a State of Mind.
By Patricia Meyer Spacks.
290 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $24.95. 
BOREDOM is one of the ways we break our habit of believing in the future. When there's nothing we want, nothing to look forward to, the story stops. Boredom, as Patricia Meyer Spacks says, "defies narration." A boring detective novel, for example, is a contradiction in terms: when we are bored, nothing happens next (there's no next next). A capacity to be interested in things -- in virtually anything -- is so fundamental to our sense of well-being that we are unlikely to imagine that a preoccupation with boredom could even have a history. One of the many engaging things that "Boredom," Ms. Spacks's immensely informed (and sometimes overinformed) book, shows us is that boredom began in the 18th century, that it was then "a new concept, if not necessarily a new event." So one of the intriguing subplots of this book is how such an "event" -- and a mood is always something of an event -- turns into a concept.
Nowadays, everything seems to have begun in the 18th century. But Ms. Spacks's enthusiasm about boredom, so to speak, is infectious and convincing. In chapters whose subtitles may sound drearily academic -- "Eighteenth-Century Women, Boredom, and Narrative," "Nineteenth-Century Women and Their Fictions," "Postmodern Enlargements of Boredom," etc. -- she manages to tell a spry and often illuminating literary history of boredom.
Ms. Spacks's lucid approach brings with it some revealing insights. "The invention of boredom as concept and of the novel as genre," she writes, "coincided in time and implicated one another." And by the same token, insofar as women were more likely to be the readers -- and eventually the writers -- of novels, boredom was, as it were, a woman's activity. Because boredom is circumstantial, Ms. Spacks points out, "it is not so clear that women . . . have the same evasive resources" as men. If the ambiguity of "evasive resources" is unintended, Ms. Spacks nevertheless makes a telling point that men and women confront boredom in different ways. But if boredom is all about resources, both psychic and economic, it is also always potentially a transgression or a route to transgression, a threat to good manners. As Ms. Spacks implies in her account of 18th-century fictional heroines, it is of some moral significance that being interesting and interested is often incompatible with being good. "Only by violating decorum might a young woman avoid tedium."
Avoiding tedium, of course, has to be both the project and the subject of this book. As a title, "Boredom" is something of a provocation. We can't help wondering how Ms. Spacks, who is the author of "Gossip" and "Desire and Truth: Functions of Plot in Eighteenth-Century English Novels," is going to go about keeping our attention (there are, including the extensive bibliography and the index, 290 pages of "Boredom"). As it happens, it would be difficult not to be interested in this book, despite the occasional academic drawbacks (throwing in too many plot summaries and too assiduously proving her points), partly because Ms. Spacks is so alert about the problem at hand.
"As action and as product," she writes in the first sentence of the first chapter, "writing resists boredom, constituting itself by that resistance." How writing goes about doing that and how boredom became something to be resisted are the subjects of this timely book. Timely because, as Ms. Spacks knows, boredom has become the forbidden thing -- the state of mind we must avoid at all costs, and yet the one to which we find ourselves being drawn, as to a riddle without a sphinx. ("There is nothing so troublesome," the poet Thomas Gray wrote, "as that one has nothing to trouble one.")
Faced with the enigma of boredom and its pervasiveness as a modern preoccupation, Ms. Spacks offers "four hypotheses to explain the new importance of boredom" that began to emerge in the 18th century. First, there was the development of the notion of leisure. Being bored takes time and costs money, so boredom becomes one of the things you can do (or feel) when you are not working, and very soon, of course, boredom becomes something felt even at work. Second, as Christianity's importance declined, boredom began filling the space left by God. Initially, boredom was a kind of sin that betrayed a lack of faith, the important assumption being that faith was necessary to sustain interest and occupation, that killing God was killing curiosity because He was the object of interest. Third, there was what Ms. Spacks calls "the intensification of concern with individual rights," including the right to happiness and the spurious need to be endlessly pleasured by commodities. Today, as confidence in sexuality wanes, the best available, if temporary, cures for boredom are drugs, glamour and shopping. And finally, the fourth change, which in a sense unifies the other three, was an evolving focus on "inner experience," on the growing sense that people have complex worlds -- of feelings, wishes, thoughts, desires, prejudices -- that are located somewhere inside them. As we become more psychically discriminating, or more seduced by psychobabble, we become more sensitive to our emptinesses, and more obsessed by what we lack.
At one point, Ms. Spacks quotes Samuel Johnson: "So few of the hours of life are filled up with objects adequate to the mind of man . . . that we are forced to have recourse every moment to the past and future for supplemental satisfactions." When we are bored, of course, nothing is adequate. But it's not clear in these long moments of boredom whether the world has let us down -- just isn't alluring enough -- or whether, for some obscure reason, we are not up to it. Ms. Spacks's remarkable book shows us in detail how boredom "menaced ethical energy," and what the minds of women, in particular, have to tell us about this.
 
 
 
IT'S NOT HER PROBLEM
 For one who has written a book on boredom, Patricia Meyer Spacks has frighteningly little personal knowledge of it. Speaking by telephone from her home in Virginia, she said "I am very rarely bored." And when she tried to dredge her memory for an experience of boredom, she remembered her daughter's boredom instead of her own. "When my daughter was little," Ms. Spacks said, "the only thing that made me angry enough to yell at her was when she said she was bored. It seemed ridiculous for a child to be bored. I couldn't stand my daughter being bored."
Clearly Ms. Spacks's new book, "Boredom," wasn't hatched in hours of heartfelt tedium. Rather, it was inspired by a friend's observation that "it was a sin to say to anyone else that he or she was boring." Ms. Spacks, the Edgar F. Shannon Professor of English at the University of Virginia, said she went home after that conversation and did "what English teachers do." She looked up "boredom." She found a word without roots, a word invented in the middle of the 18th century. And she spent the next five years studying how boredom grew, yawn by yawn.
When she told people she was writing a book on boredom, "their immediate response was 'I'm never bored.' " In their unsolicited denials, Ms. Spacks detected a touch of moral defensiveness. "People will deny their own boredom," she said, "but they'll often attribute it to others: they'll say adolescents are always bored, workers in a factory are always bored." Why? "Many people say their mothers said that if you're bored, you're boring; you have no inner resources." Ms. Spacks seems preternaturally unworried about that. She has already begun her next book -- on self-love. SARAH BOXER

THE RANSOM OF RUSSIAN ART
By John McPhee.
Illustrated. 181 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
$20. 
IN his previous 22 books, the indefatigably inquisitive journalist and essayist John McPhee has addressed topics as various as canoes, the game of Monopoly and Scottish distilleries. His 23d, a skinny volume padded with illustrations, ponders something rather different: the fate of Russian visual artists just before and after the collapse of Communism. Heavily traveled of late by a wide variety of critics and groupies, this is no longer the virgin territory it was only a few years ago. Now that the cold war is over, Russia has become cool, especially on the artistic front.
But Mr. McPhee approaches this trendy story from a new angle in "The Ransom of Russian Art." He focuses (with many chatty digressions) on a quirky and elusive personality, Norton Dodge. An economics professor at the University of Maryland who began collecting Soviet "nonconformist" art 30 years ago, Mr. Dodge eventually amassed 9,000 works by 600 artists at his farm in southern Maryland. His collection is now the largest of its kind in the world. Several years ago, he donated his art to the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, where the works are currently being catalogued. The Zimmerli will open the collection to the public in October 1995.
Mr. Dodge's feat was not accomplished without considerable expenditure of cash, energy and flying time. Over the years, this man, whom one of the Russian artists calls "the Lorenzo de' Medici of Russian art" spent more than $3 million of his own money, operating under secretive and quasi-legal conditions that posed considerable risk both to himself and to the artists whom he befriended and patronized on his many trips to the former Soviet Union.
In those years of Brezhnevian stagnation, which are already beginning to seem a distant and dangerously unreal memory, citizens in the Soviet Union were strongly discouraged even from having casual contact with foreigners -- let alone inviting them to their studios and selling them art. Accepting foreign currency was a crime with very serious consequences. So was the unofficial export of artworks, particularly these abstract, highly spiritual pieces that pointedly ignored (and often mocked) the pompous "accessible" vocabulary of Soviet Socialist Realism. "We were scared to death," one of the artists who dealt with Mr. Dodge told Mr. McPhee. "All of us" -- including Mr. Dodge.
It was after a chance meeting with Mr. Dodge on a train between Washington and Trenton that Mr. McPhee became intrigued with his story. Mr. McPhee then began a piece for The New Yorker on Mr. Dodge that was subsequently adapted into "The Ransom of Russian Art." This genesis helps to explain its breezy, somewhat superficial style, more suitable for an essay than a book.
Nor does it help that Mr. Dodge's many years of covering his tracks and eluding both the K.G.B. and the C.I.A. have clearly made him extremely resistant to the kind of direct questions Mr. McPhee kept trying to ask. Despite the author's conscientious probing and pushing, Mr. Dodge and his motivations slip away time and again from Mr. McPhee's grasp, rather like the cartoon road runner always just beyond the coyote's grasp.
Even now, Mr. Dodge is understandably reluctant to say exactly which foreign diplomats helped him smuggle art out of the Soviet Union. Like all of us who spent considerable time in the former U.S.S.R., Mr. Dodge has internalized a certain reticence and secrecy about what went on there. After years of conditioning, it's hard to discard the feeling that such information might later be used against ourselves and others.
The character who emerges most vividly from this volume is not Mr. Dodge, in fact, but one of the artists whom he befriended and enriched in the 1970's. Yevgeny Rukhin, of what was then called Leningrad, was a Rasputin-like figure of legendary proportions and prodigious appetites on the Russian avant-garde scene. "He was nearly two meters tall," Mr. McPhee writes. "Under his head of dark hair -- its rolling curls spreading out in great radius -- his beard, brown and red, broadly fell halfway down his chest. When he walked on a street anywhere, people turned around."
Mr. McPhee's description is secondhand, since Rukhin perished in 1976, at the age of 32. He suffocated in a suspicious fire in his studio, set (many of his friends believe) by K.G.B. operatives who had discovered him and a friend making love to a woman "sandwich-style." Terrible accidents ran in Rukhin's family; his father, a popular geologist at Leningrad State University, was killed by the K.G.B. in 1959, run over by a truck.
In order to win the confidence and trust of the artists whose work he began collecting, Mr. Dodge also had to learn to stay up most of the night and tolerate often-wild parties with artists. The parties at Rukhin's home were particularly celebrated. (One of the best, according to Rukhin's widow, Galina Popova, took place in August 1971, with the participation of the touring Russian Chorus from Yale University. As it happens, I was on that tour and at that party. My awareness of its future historical significance was deeply clouded, however, by the general, rapid and massive consumption of vodka.)
Unfortunately, Mr. McPhee never alights on any one artist or idea for very long. There is a jumpy, almost unfinished quality to the writing here, as though the author could not quite find the key either to Mr. Dodge or to the nonconformist art scene. The question of why Mr. Dodge did all this remains unanswered. One is all too aware that Mr. McPhee is observing from a comfortable armchair distance, and without the firsthand emotional and cultural knowledge of Russia that would make the tale come alive.
Like many accomplished writers who have attempted to penetrate the Oriental mystery of the Russian psyche and its irresistible appeal for certain Westerners, Mr. McPhee is undone by his cheerful American optimism and his desire to explain things rationally. He should have listened more closely when he was cautioned by the poet Konstantin Kuzminsky, formerly of Leningrad and now residing in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, that "Americans are afraid of everything which causes too much emotion and tragedy. That is the problem between East and West."
That is also the problem with "The Ransom of Russian Art."

From the Springtime of China
to the Fall of Rome.

HERE is a scenario for the holiday season of 1994. Two children are playing at home with the presents brought by their favorite uncle. One child -- let's call her Wendy -- has just been given a CD-ROM set. Idly clicking the mouse on her parents' multimedia computer, she watches and listens to the little figures jostling by in a torrent of words. Suddenly the image of a woman catches her attention. She has the beak and protruding eyes of a duck or goose, her hair is wild and tangled, she holds an enormous bloodstained knife, and as Wendy clicks the mouse a voice declaims, as the same words appear on the screen:
"Each dying breath flung from his breast swift, bubbling jets of gore, and the dark sprinklings of the rain of blood fell upon me. . . . Not sweeter is the rain of heaven to cornland, when the green sheath teems with grain."
Wendy has never heard words like those before! Clicking back one panel, she finds the duck-billed woman is called Clytemnestra, and the man she has just killed is called Agamemnon. Wendy remembers that her new CD-ROM program began with a picture of a professor's time machine, and that in the picture was a file marked "Index." Clicking her little mouse again, she looks under Clytemnestra, clicks back to the screen, and finds the mystery partly explained, partly deepened. Clytemnestra is not a duck or goose. She is part swan! Her mother, Leda, mated with a swan, and then had her and her sister, Helen. That's why they call her "Goosy." She learns that Clytemnestra kills Agamemnon because he killed their daughter Iphigenia in a sacrifice. A little note on the screen says someone called Aeschylus wrote this account of Agamemnon. Wendy decides it is such a good story that she must read more by this person Aeschylus.
Wendy's little brother, Peter, is lying on the floor beside her. He has been sulking because his uncle gave him only a book, not a CD-ROM disk. But the book turns out to be fun to leaf through, just like a comic, with pictures of lots of people being killed and lots of sexy women. The words are difficult and full of curious names, and many of the people seem to be Chinese. Peter's attention is caught by a calm and thoughtful portrait of a Chinese man, with an oddly ornate hat and long but wispy beard. The explanation says this is Ssuma Chien, author of "one of the greatest histories ever written." Yet in the panel just above, this Ssuma Chien man is being dragged away, crying "Gleep," while an angry looking man is shouting "OFF WITH HIS --." The words in the intervening panel are really long and complicated. "Mommy," shouts Peter, "who is Ssuma Chien? And what's 'castrated'?"
Is this the end of the civilized world as we know it? Or the birth of a new and dazzling technology with the capacity to transform us all and open up a new age? It's probably a bit of both, for what we are contending with here is the world according to Larry Gonick. Wendy has been playing Mr. Gonick's new two-disk CD-ROM set, "The Cartoon History of the Universe," volumes 1-7, which spans the period "From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great," and Peter has been reading Mr. Gonick's latest book, "The Cartoon History of the Universe II," volumes 8-13, which goes "From the Springtime of China to the Fall of Rome." In combination, they suggest a preview of where we may be heading.
The question that Mr. Gonick forces one to think about is both a simple and a complex one: Why should nonhistorians bother to learn about history at all? Most professional historians draw from a pool of more or less stock answers: because history gives us a context for our lives, because it humanizes us, because it illuminates the rise and fall of races and communities and thus helps us understand our own, because it shows the interconnections of economic production with social relations, because it highlights the very different fates of men and woman, because it shows the wellsprings of human greatness and compassion, because it shows the baseness of which human beings are capable, because it defines the various relations we have constructed between our individual lives and the unknowable forces that seem to control our destinies. To this list Mr. Gonick adds another. We bother about history because it is interesting and because it is fun.
Four years ago, Mr. Gonick began to present history in his own eclectic and eccentric way with the first seven volumes of "The Cartoon History of the Universe." Now he has expanded his terrain considerably, with the appearance of volumes 8-13 as well as a CD-ROM version of volumes 1-7. Mr. Gonick impels us to ask a basic question: If this is the wave of the future, then what on earth is going to happen to the past?
Mr. Gonick himself, by his own description, was a student of mathematics at Harvard University for nine years who "dropped out" in 1972 and thereafter lived for a time in India, programmed computers, worked in pharmacology labs, swam laps, read books in the local libraries and spent all his other time drawing cartoons. Like a true outsider, he mocks academic pretensions and jargon in his books; yet, as a former insider, he has respect for intelligent theories and will present them, even if in shortened form, when he feels it to be appropriate. He follows his sources with precision in a clear attempt at accuracy, and carefully lays out the bibliographies at the end of each book, embellishing them with lots of funny drawings and with a cheerful acknowledgment of the titles he has misplaced and the books he couldn't finish. The result, as one might expect, is a curious hybrid, at once flippant and scholarly, witty and politically correct, zany and traditionalist.
Mr. Gonick's approach to the past is personal, free-wheeling and immensely ambitious: in these books he tackles the origins of the solar system, the beginnings of animal and human life, the ancient civilizations of the Near East and China, the origins of the Hindu gods and the roots of Buddhism, the Trojan War and Greek mythology, the Old Testament and the birth of Christianity, the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. The text, even in the cartoon format, is surprisingly dense, larded with names and dates, so dense indeed that despite the drawings one occasionally gets the same sense of glut one gets from certain history textbooks, where all is presented and nothing is explained. This is especially true with the grisly presentations of the wars that have so ravaged the people of this planet: "splam" and "oof" and "thwok" and "paf" and "gleep" form odd accompaniments to the passages from the "Iliad" and Herodotus, the Vedas and Ssuma Chien, "Exodus" and Tacitus.
WHY then mix the lot together, the grunts of comic-book warfare and the greatest chronicles of the past? Do the grunts make the past more fun, more real? And why try to be accurate at all?
The combination of density and accuracy in the print versions of the "Cartoon History of the Universe" leads one to hope that the CD-ROM version of the first seven volumes might have some useful applications. Academic presses have already begun to use CD-ROM technology to integrate archeology, art, sound and movement into historical studies, and this is surely a field that is bound to grow, initially as a supplement to traditional learning rather than as total substitute -- though later, who can tell?
Disappointingly, the CD-ROM set of Mr. Gonick's "Cartoon History of the Universe" makes no use of the intellectual possibilities implicit in the form. It is basically a filmed copy of the original text, unimaginatively colored, with the simplest level of animation to the figures in a given panel. The text is voiced-over for each panel, so one need not read at all, though the mouse must be clicked occasionally to obtain the dialogue; there is an unimpressive musical score to accompany the text; and the professor's voice is oddly ineffective, high-pitched and wheedling, a voice clearly meant to mock the teaching of history as we have known it.
The main addition to the original text, the feature that was supposed to make this an "interactive joy ride through history," as the CD-ROM's box promises, are three "games" that take one (if one so chooses) to the Pyramid of Cheops, the maze of the Minotaur and the Acropolis. But even though these "game concepts" were designed by Matt Costello, who is famous among young connoisseurs of CD-ROM technology for his game "The 7th Guest," they do not seem to reach the level of difficulty, imagination or fun of even moderately advanced video games. And once the games have been played there is no incentive to move into the text and endure the weariness of acquiring information.
For those who do not want to try the games, the CD-ROM set offers nothing that is not in the printed text except an index. (And incidentally, the games and the integration of the text with the index are not
really usable on what is the "minimum configuration" of a 386-series microprocessor. The crank-up time is so slow that most people would simply abandon the alleged adventures altogether. A 486-series microprocessor is the absolute minimum.)
The shortcomings of this particular CD-ROM set in no way diminish the challenge it represents to conventional historians. If large segments of the population are drifting toward virtual illiteracy as they acquire new types of skills through handling computer technology, and if we want to keep alive the idea that history has meaning, then cartoon books and CD-ROM sets like Mr. Gonick's might end up becoming lifelines, rather than mere diversions. And thus "splat," "pow," "ouch" and "whoof," along with whatever has by then replaced the mouse, will end up as our descendants' last points of entry back into the inner mysteries of their pasts.

HEADLINE: One Aviator Was Killed in North Korea Helicopter Downing

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The White House announced today that the pilot of an Army helicopter that was shot down or forced down in North Korea was killed in the incident, while the second pilot was alive and apparently unharmed.
"This tragic loss of life was unnecessary," President Clinton said in a statement today, taking a tougher tone toward the Korea than American officials did when they first learned of the incident late Friday. 
 President Clinton said his primary concerns were the return of the body of Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon of Clarksville, Tenn., and the release of the other pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall of Brooksville, Fla.
Eager to resolve the incident to prevent a major rupture in relations, American diplomats negotiated today for the quick release of Warrant Officer Hall and of Warrant Officer Hilemon's remains, but they said North Korea had not indicated that it would comply with the request.
American military delegates met today with North Korean officials in the border village of Panmunjom while American diplomats met in New York with North Korean representatives to the United Nations. In addition, Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who was on a visit to North Korea, sought to resolve the crisis in several meetings in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
North Korea has insisted that the unarmed two-seat OH-58 Kiowa helicopter was on a hostile surveillance mission three to five miles inside North Korean territory, but Pentagon officials maintain that the two pilots strayed innocently across the demilitarized zone during a routine training mission. The helicopter went down in the area of Kungang.
Pentagon officials said today that they remain unsure whether the helicopter was shot down, forced down or perhaps had mechanical difficulties, although many officials said they assumed the helicopter was downed by hostile fire.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today that he was eager to learn how the Army scout helicopter had strayed so far over the 155-mile long, 2.5-mile wide demilitarized zone. The Kiowa helicopter is a reconnaissance aircraft frequently used for scouting and training.
"The Defense Department has launched a full investigation of the circumstances that led to this tragic loss on a routine training flight," Mr. Perry said in a statement. "Results will be reported as this investigation reaches its conclusion."
The White House statement said that Warrant Officer Hilemon "was killed in the downing of the helicopter" and that Warrant Officer Hall "is alive and reportedly uninjured."
Several American officials said they were frustrated with North Korea's handling of the incident, saying it has been slow to release information. They also questioned why North Korea's official news agency at first said the two pilots were being held for questioning.
Administration officials said that some North Korean diplomats had informed them and Mr. Richardson early on that Warrant Officer Hilemon had died when the helicopter went down. But they said other North Koreans, especially some officials in the army, were sending different signals. One American official said the lack of a clear message could indicate that the country's new leader, Kim Jong Il, was not firmly in control.
In its initial comments, the Clinton Administration was eager to get the pilots released quickly to ease tensions in the hope that Washington and Pyongyang could concentrate on the delicate task of putting the month-old agreement to restrict North Korea's nuclear program into effect. But with the news of Warrant Officer Hilemon's death, Administration officials took a tougher line.
Mr. Clinton said he has asked Representative Richardson to extend his stay in North Korea to help resolve the crisis. Mr. Richardson arrived in North Korea early Saturday for a two-day visit to examine the human rights situation there and discuss the nuclear accord.
In the agreement, the North agreed to scrap its current policy on nuclear weapons. In return, the United States pledged to lead an international effort to build $4 billion in new, less-threatening reactors for North Korea.
American officials said the biggest move Pyongyang could make to reduce tensions would be to let Mr. Richardson bring Warrant Officer Hall and Warrant Officer Hilemon's remains with him back to the United States on Monday, the day he was scheduled to leave North Korea.
"The first and most important thing is a full accounting of what happened, and the release of the body and of the other pilot," said a senior Administration official. "If that doesn't happen, it would be hard not only for Congress, but the Administration to proceed with other discussions, like exchanging liaison offices."
American officials said they told North Korea that the wisest course would be to follow what South Korea did last January after capturing two North Korean soldiers who drifted into South Korean waters. They were released to the North four days after being captured.
One message American diplomats say they have conveyed to North Korea is that if it moved quickly to turn over Warrant Officer Hilemon's remains and release Warrant Officer Hall, the nuclear agreement will not be threatened.
Stu Nagurka, a spokesman for Representative Richardson, said he has warned Pyongyang that "failure to aggressively investigate this case and failure to return the missing servicemen would have a serious impact on U.S.-North Korean relations."
According to the Pentagon, Warrant Officer Hilemon was 29 years old and is survived by his wife, Berit. He joined the Army in February 1988 and became a pilot in August 1989. He was assigned to Fort Campbell, Ky., from June 1990 to March 1994 and earned a medal for combat service for flying a helicopter in the Persian Gulf war. On Nov. 4, he arrived in South Korea, where he and Warrant Officer Hall were stationed at Camp Page at Chunchon with Company A, 4th Battalion, 501st Aviation Regiment of the Army.
Before the White House announced Warrant Officer Hilemon's death, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, issued a warning to the North Koreans on the CBS news program "Face the Nation."
"They're not exactly in an enviable position in the world, are they?" he said. "Their dictator's dead. Their economy's dead. And they've got two American pilots, and they'd better get them back fast."

HEADLINE: Bradford Morse Is Dead at 73; Held High-Ranking U.N. Posts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
Bradford Morse, a former Republican Congressman from Massachusetts who rose to become a top-ranking United Nations official, died yesterday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 73.
The cause was heart failure, his family said. 
 A lawyer who was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1960, Mr. Morse served six terms before resigning to join the United Nations. In his 13-year career there, Mr. Morse supervised a diverse series of relief efforts that ranged from job-training for two million Colombians to a program that built hundreds of miles of secondary roads in five African nations.
As head of the United Nations Development Program, which helps finance and administer development projects in more than 150 nations, Mr. Morse became an advocate for aid to poor countries and for victims of famine in Africa. In the mid-1980's, when droughts ravaged Ethiopia and the Sudan, Mr. Morse organized a large-scale relief effort with help from a Canadian official, Maurice F. Strong, executive coordinator of the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa.
Bradford Morse, a native of Lowell, Mass., returned from Army service in World War II to graduate from Boston University and Boston University Law School. In 1953, he was appointed as special counsel to the Senate Armed Services Committee; in 1958, he was named Deputy Administrator of Veterans Affairs by President Eisenhower.
Mr. Morse resigned from the Veterans Administration in 1960, the same year he was elected to Congress. According to friends and associates, Mr. Morse was one of the first Republicans in Congress to express concern over the sharp division among Americans over the country's role in Vietnam, and helped develop the strategy advanced by President Johnson to coax the North Vietnamese into negotiations in 1968.
In 1972, Mr. Morse was appointed Under Secretary General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. Four years later he was asked to take over as administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which was then facing bankruptcy. He secured record pledges, and was credited with turning the program around financially.
After retiring from the United Nations in 1986, Mr. Morse became president of the Salzburg Seminar, a nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Mass., that brings together politicians, academics and business leaders from the West, developing countries, and countries in the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Morse is survived by his wife, the former Josephine Anne Neale, and three children: Stephanie Hillary Jennifer Morse, of Naples, Fla.; Susanna Francesca Morse of Cincinnati, and Anthony Bradford Morse of Washington.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New York 1 News Becomes Global Role Model

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER 

 BODY:
New York 1 News, the 24-hour local cable channel that has been in existence since September 1992, has not yet turned a profit. Neither has any similar enterprise in the United States.
But a small and encouraging new source of revenue has materialized for the channel, which is owned by Time Warner Inc. and is available to 1.3 million cable subscribers in the five boroughs of New York City. 
 Representatives of foreign media companies, intrigued by the channel's highly automated, tightly focused, relatively low-cost news operations, are flocking to the New York 1 studios at 42d Street and 10th Avenue. They are observing, learning, and occasionally copying the methods -- and paying for the privilege.
New York 1 may not be a financial success yet, but the number of cable channels is multiplying overseas, as government broadcasting monopolies are eased and entrepreneurs search for useful role models.
Other regional news channels, particularly Chicagoland Television, which is owned by the Tribune Company, offer consulting services. But most of the dozen or so others, available in cities like Washington and in the San Francisco area, are too distracted by their own battles for survival to offer more than brief tours and words of encouragement.
The management of New York 1 thinks differently. "We've been flooded with requests to come visit us," said Paul Sagan, a founder of New York 1 and senior vice president of Time Warner's cable programming division. "If we didn't charge, we'd spend our entire lives working as tour guides, for nothing."
The minimum charge for an introductory tour is $3,000 a day, but longer-term consulting projects have reached $100,000.
"I'd say for us, right now, consulting is a six-figure business over all," Mr. Sagan said in a recent interview. "We've made a big investment in developing proprietary knowledge, and now that we've got it, we appreciate its value."
As he spoke, seated in his office in the converted bus terminal that is the headquarters for New York 1, many of the channel's 30 or so "video journalists" -- camera-carrying reporters who report, videotape and edit their own stories -- were at large in the five boroughs.
In the newsroom, a small crew of producers, technicians and on-air announcers were feeding the channel with recorded news stories covering, among other things, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget battles with the city council, the day in New York City's history, the continuing struggles of New York's football teams and borough-by-borough weather reports.
The channel also has interview programs, including a public affairs program co-produced by The New York Times five nights a week.
Several thousand miles away in London, a remarkably similar all-news operation called Channel One -- owned by Associated Newspapers, the publisher of The Daily Mail and The Evening Standard -- was getting ready to go on the air. New York 1 was a prime consultant in its creation.
In Miami, a 24-hour Spanish language news service called Telenoticias, jointly owned by the Telemundo Spanish-language television network and Reuters, was preparing to begin sending its signal to cable and broadcast outlets in North and South America, using the New York 1 model for its studio operations. Other American broadcasters have shown interest in New York 1's operations, but not enough to contract for consulting services.
Paul Ramsay, chairman of Prime TV, an Australian company that owns 14 television stations in Victoria and New South Wales, recently sat in a second-floor conference room at New York 1. Mr. Ramsay, an amiable Australian who also controls a chain of psychiatric hospitals in the United States, said he was looking to start his own news channel, perhaps in Asia.
Mr. Ramsay was being given a morninglong tour of the operation by Steve Paulus, head of programming at New York 1, and Laurie Ward, the channel's director of finance and administration.
"Unlike other local news operations, we don't have to go live unless there's news happening at the moment," Mr. Paulus said.
Ms. Ward added: "We use technology differently. We use people differently. Instead of sending three our four people out on a story, we send out one. When that person comes back inside he works as a writer and an editor."
After a brief discussion of the station's finances -- including the projection that New York 1 was "right on schedule" to match its $10 million annual budget with advertising revenue -- Mr. Ramsay was shown the way that prerecorded news and feature stories formed a one-hour programming "wheel."
He was escorted downstairs and shown the software that tied together the assignment, editing, scheduling and programming processes -- allowing a video journalist, for instance, to create on-screen captions and send a scripted introduction directly to a news anchor's prompter.
Mr. Ramsay was also shown the hyperkinetic one-woman assignment desk, an editing bay, the sparsely-manned control booth, the anchor station and a nearby "producer pod," a small second studio equipped with robotic cameras and a "reporter package," consisting of a 20-pound Sony Hi-8 video camera, a microphone and cable and a tripod.
A highlight was a visit to the Sony LMS-1000, a "video jukebox" the size of a walk-in closet, whose robotic arm snatches videocassettes of commercials as well as news features from storage racks and feeds them at preprogrammed times into a tape player for transmission.
"Very interesting," Mr. Ramsay said. Several days later, several of his employees visited New York 1.
"You've got to hand it to them for enterprise," a video media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, Tom Wolzien, said of New York 1's consulting efforts. Any additional revenue is helpful, he added, in an industry whose march to profitability has been "excruciatingly slow."
Since 1986, when the Cablevision System Corporation began News 12 Long Island, the first regional news channel, broadcasting companies have struggled to make low-cost all-news operations profitable. Some of those channels employ numerous repeats of live newscasts rather than taped programming wheels. The obstacles to profitability have included cable regulations, the economic recession and an inability to attract a mix of national and local advertising.
Foreign operators appear to be unfazed. "The whole plan starts to work around 2002," said Julian Aston, the director general of Channel One in London. With most of Britain only now being wired for cable, only 200,000 Britons will receive the news channel initially.
Since Associated Newspapers decided that "the New York 1 model could be applied absolutely to our situation," he said, Channel One should look familiar to New York expatriates.
There is one exception: While in New York, Mr. Aston and his associates admired New York 1's subway reporter, who courses through the transit system, camera at the ready, rating the various subway lines for cleanliness and comfort.
"We went to the London Underground and asked them for permission to do something similar," Mr. Aston said. "They told us, 'You wouldn't be like that New York 1, would you? Always criticizing the Underground service?' Then they turned us down."

HEADLINE: As Deng Fades, China's Leaders Tighten Grip on Power

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 18

 BODY:
With a new wave of repression and nationalistic bluster on issues like trade and national defense, China's Communist Party leaders are asserting their authority in ways that Western diplomats attribute to the further decline of Deng Xiaoping's health.
As Mr. Deng's health has deteriorated through the fall, the Chinese leadership has handed down long prison sentences to dissidents, increased overall security in Beijing and threatened trade retaliation against the United States if Washington cracks down on the rampant pirating of compact disks in China. 
 China's Trade Minister, Wu Yi, said last week that a trade war would erupt if Washington decided on sanctions over copyright piracy in China.
"The day when the United States produces its list for retaliation will be the day when China produces its own," Ms. Wu told the official People's Daily.
What's more, negotiations over China's bid to enter the World Trade Organization by the Dec. 31 deadline have been marked by escalating political rancor.
At the same time, while military cooperation between the United States and China has been improving, a cat-and-mouse encounter between an American aircraft carrier and a Chinese nuclear submarine in late October has rankled Chinese officials and resulted in sharp recriminations.
Pentagon and State Department officials have confirmed the incident, which was first reported by The Los Angeles Times, saying the carrier battle group of the Kitty Hawk detected one of China's five Han-class nuclear attack submarines in the Yellow Sea. The carrier's antisubmarine escorts dropped sonar buoys to track the submarine, which headed for its base at Qingdao on the Shandong peninsula, and China scrambled air force jets that flew within sight of the American battlegroup as it tracked the submarine.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry official said last week that China was seeking "clarifications" over the incident. Yet at a dinner with a United States military attache in Beijing, a Chinese official later asserted that another such incident could lead to a military clash.
American analysts attribute the tough talk to political uncertainty in Beijing.
"No one dares be anything but a strong nationalist in these circumstances," said Michel Oksenberg, a White House aide on China in the Carter Administration and now president of the East-West Center in Hawaii.
"I think in each major dimension of relations with China, one can expect to see recalcitrance as Chinese leaders and the various contestants for power position themselves to make sure they don't lose their nationalist bona fides."
Chen Yizi, a onetime top Communist Party official now living in the United States, said: "I believe that the situation in China right now is in a very delicate state. No matter what, Deng's health isn't going to get any better. The second reason for the fragility of the situation is that there is a series of sensitive problems facing Chinese society, for instance: inflation, corruption and the legacy of the June 4, 1989, incident," the military crackdown on student-led prodemocracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. "If something goes even slightly wrong with the handling of these questions, the consequences will be severe."
Mr. Deng's declining health, a Western diplomat added, "has been a factor for the last year, but more so in the last few months -- everything is just waiting."
Western officials say that the 90-year-old paramount leader is extremely frail and that his doctors are using life support systems to sustain him. Mr. Deng reportedly suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease and other ailments. Mr. Chen said his sources had told him that Mr. Deng has suffered from progressive kidney failure since October 1992 and undergoes frequent dialysis treatments.
The Chinese Government and members of Mr. Deng's family continue to maintain that he is in good health, but Western officials indicate that he has markedly weakened. One indicator of his health is that Mr. Deng and his family remain in Beijing, and have not gone to his winter residence in Shanghai.
On Friday, the harsh sentences -- including one for 20 years -- were handed down to nine prodemocracy dissidents who had been held in jail for 30 months. The punishment followed the sentencing of Gao Yu last month to six years in prison. Ms. Gao, a prominent journalist who was invited to Columbia University as a visiting scholar this year, had written articles about the political maneuvering of China's leaders for Hong Kong-based magazines.
Hu Shigen, a 39-year-old lecturer at the Beijing Languages Institute, received the heaviest sentence, 20 years, for "spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda."
The New York-based Human Rights in China organization said Mr. Hu and the other defendants had drafted four articles on human and workers' rights. They mimeographed them and began distributing them by mail and by hand before the 1992 anniversary of the1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Robin Munro, the Hong Kong director of Human Rights Watch called the sentences "appallingly severe." He said the dissidents' activities "were all entirely peaceful."
The other dissidents sentenced on Friday received terms ranging from 3 to 12 years. Five others were convicted and released, and one was placed "under surveillance" for two more years.
China's top leaders, who certainly approved of the length and the timing of these sentences, appear to be warning dissidents that the slightest challenge to the Communist Party in this sensitive season will be severely punished.
China's most vocal campaigner for democracy and free speech, Wei Jingsheng, remains a captive of the State Security Ministry, which refuses to charge him or release him. Mr. Wei was initially released in September 1993, after serving more than 14 years in prison, but was rearrested in April.
Chen Ziming, one of two dissidents released from 13-year prison terms last spring, remains a captive in a tiny apartment where as many as 56 policemen have kept him under guard and surveillance. Mr. Chen and Wang Juntao, sentenced in 1991 to 13-year prison terms, were accused of being behind the Tiananmen Square uprising. They were released on medical parole, and Mr. Wang went to the United States for treatment.
Although Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown announced in August that he had won China's commitment to renew its dialogue with Washington on human rights, three months later the dialogue has produced no results.
The State Department's top human rights official, John Shattuck, has announced that China agreed to resume talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross to allow access to thousands of political prisoners. But China has yet to resume negotiations with the Red Cross. And no date for a meeting in 1995 has been set.
Last week, because of Washington's warming toward Taiwan, China withdrew an invitation to United States Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, who stopped in Taipei before a scheduled visit to Beijing.
On the issue of copyright piracy, Dec. 30 is the deadline for the results of Washington's investigation, and they could lead to higher tariffs or import restrictions on $800 million worth of Chinese goods, the estimated value of annual American losses that result from Chinese copyright infringement.
Lee Sands, a negotiator for the United States trade representative, walked out of talks in Beijing last week, saying China had put nothing substantive on the table. After 18 months of discussions, Mr. Sands said, there are still 29 factories in China churning out pirated compact disks.
Earlier this month, a Chinese Trade Ministry questioned Washington's motives by suggesting that pressure on Beijing to drop trade barriers arises from the fact that China "is led by Communists" and that it may someday threaten American dominance in the world economy.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Vows to Make Cuts In Spending Before Taxes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Trying again to outflank President Clinton, the four Republican members of Congress in charge of budget and tax policy said unequivocally today that they intended to cut Federal spending before they cut taxes next year.
House Republicans said that to enforce fiscal discipline they would begin slashing spending next month and would use the savings to pay for tax cuts to be passed later in the year. 
 "We're going to cut spending first," said Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, who is in line to become chairman of the House Budget Committee. "We will take the savings by cutting spending first, and we're going to put them in the bank." Then when Congress cuts taxes, he said, "we'll draw down the bank; we will draw down the savings account."
Mr. Kasich appeared on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" with Representative Bill Archer of Texas, who is in line to become chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Senators Bob Packwood of Oregon, the incoming chairman of the Finance Committee, and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, who is in line to be chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
Their coordinated comments -- reflecting a strategy formulated at a meeting with Haley Barbour, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, on Friday -- revealed a shift in emphasis from the course laid out in the House Republicans' election manifesto, the "Contract With America." That document made very few specific commitments on the timing or details of budget cuts.
Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic affairs, said tonight that the Republicans had still not specified how they would slow the growth of Federal spending. He challenged the Republicans to give "a line-by-line, program-by-program account of how they'll balance the budget and pay for all their tax cuts."
Mr. Sperling said the Republicans were using "gimmicks" like the balanced budget amendment and caps on various types of spending to conceal the potentially unpopular details of the cutbacks they will make.
The positions staked out today were the latest moves in a long-running chess game over tax and fiscal policy.
In the 1992 Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to cut taxes for the middle class. But after taking office, he deferred action on that pledge, saying it was more important to reduce the Federal budget deficit. In the year that ended Sept. 30, the deficit declined to $203.4 billion, the lowest level since 1989.
In this year's Congressional elections, Republicans promised tax cuts for the middle class as part of their "Contract With America." Mr. Clinton responded to that promise last week, proposing his own package of tax breaks for the middle class, including a tax deduction for college tuition costs. With their vow to cut spending before cutting taxes, the Republicans today tried to outdo Mr. Clinton in fiscal responsibility.
President Clinton plans to hold a news conference on Monday to explain how he would pay for the tax cuts he proposed last week.
In general, the House Republicans said today that they were not backing away from the tax cuts promised in the Contract with America. Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican in line to become House majority leader, said the House Republicans intended to pass all their tax cuts by April 15.
But Mr. Archer added a qualification, saying it might be necessary to scale back the corporate tax cuts proposed in the "Contract With America." "We may have to trim that in such a way" that the official estimates of revenue losses are acceptable, he said.
Mr. Packwood, who has served in the Senate for nearly 26 years, was more cautious. "I'm not even going to consider what tax cuts we're going to do until I see spending cuts that will match them," he said today.
"I am not going to support any tax cuts that are going to widen the deficit, period," Mr. Packwood added. "I just don't want to see us once again send out tax cuts with a lick and a promise and a hope that the spending cuts are coming later. We somehow never quite seem to get to them."
In his address to the nation on Thursday, Mr. Clinton said he did not want to make "any new cuts in Social Security or Medicare." Republicans today agreed that Social Security was off the table, but Mr. Kasich and Mr. Archer said they had given no such immunity to Medicare. Mr. Archer said Congress should consider cutbacks to slow the growth in Part B of Medicare, which pays doctors' bills for elderly people and is financed with large amounts of general revenue.
The White House asserted today that the tax cuts proposed by Mr. Clinton were much fairer and more fiscally responsible than those proposed by House Republicans. From 1995 to 2000, it said, the Clinton tax cuts would cost $60 billion, whereas the Republican tax plan would cost $197 billion. Mr. Sperling said that 54 percent of the benefits of the Republican tax proposals would go to families with incomes exceeding $100,000 a year, while 13 percent of the benefits of the Clinton plan would go to such families.
Mr. Packwood, Mr. Domenici and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said that the Senate, in keeping with its constitutional role, would follow a slower, more deliberate pace in handling the legislation on which House Republicans plan to vote in the first 100 days of the new Congress.
The Republicans' Contract with America proposes a Constitutional amendment to require balancing the Federal budget by 2002 or soon thereafter. And Republicans often talk about fiscal conservatism. But under President Ronald Reagan, the deficit nearly doubled, from $79 billion in 1981 to $155 billion in 1988. Under President George Bush, the deficit soared to $290 billion in 1992.
Mr. Armey outlined the House Republicans' plans today on the ABC News program "This Week with David Brinkley." "What we have decided to do, in January, we will build an American tax-relief savings account," he said. "Through rescissions, through lowering the spending caps and through other budget reforms, we will actually bank the money.
"We will bank the money in January with the spending cuts. Then as we pass the tax proposal, all of which we intend to pass before April 15, we will spend out of that savings account to pay it down."
In this way, he said, Americans "will be reassured that the spending cuts come first."

HEADLINE: Capitol's New Jobless Greet the Future

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Boxes were packed, the desk was bare, and the Rayburn House Office Building was no longer home to Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas.
Along with Congressional aides, press officers, staff assistants, secretaries and elevator operators, Mr. Glickman was joining the ranks of the 3,600 Capitol Hill workers left unemployed by the demise of the Democratic majority. Even worse, so was his wife, Rhoda, who for the last 13 years has headed one of the 28 Congressional caucuses whose financing the new Republican-controlled Congress plans to eliminate. 
 One recent day, the Glickmans sat among packing crates in his cream-colored office, eating shoestring potatoes from a can and reminiscing about the election, their 18 years in Washington and what they would miss. And although they said they had no immediate money worries, they wondered about their future.
"I was a little more prepared than some folks because I had worked for the White House Committee on the Family during the Carter Administration, and when he lost I had six months of depression," said Mrs. Glickman. " But this is Washington. This is part of the life." Until the election, Mrs. Glickman had headed the Congressional Arts Caucus.
Joking about the Capitol's notorious reputation for abandoning those out of power, Mr. Glickman said, "The only one working in the family now is our son, and he won't take our calls."
But in truth, Mrs. Glickman said, she and her husband had been spared that humiliation. "We were overwhelmed by the number of people who called," she said. "Everyone says that once you lose, the phone calls stop. But they haven't."
Before last month's election, when the balance of power shifted further than most people had expected, Mr. Glickman -- who was well liked back home in Wichita -- had expected to be re-elected to a 10th term in Kansas's Fourth Congressional District. On a coffee table cluttered with items to be shipped or discarded sat a letter from a constituent saying that it was not Mr. Glickman, but the anti-Democratic, anti-Washington tide that had swept him away.
"The race was not on the radar screen," said Mr. Glickman, who lost to Todd Tiahrt, a Republican who ran a grass-roots campaign fueled by evangelical and Catholic conservatives. "I thought I had very little chance of losing until a couple of weeks before the election."
Mr. Glickman is losing more than just the office, the perquisites, the ability to deliver services to constituents and the salary. As the departing chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he is also losing his access to the most sensitive of secrets -- the inside information on Russia and North Korea, the Central Intelligence Agency's most highly classified papers.
Mr. Glickman also said he felt that his last two years had been his most productive for his district. For example, he won passage of a bill that limited manufacturers' liability for older planes, freeing companies from the threat of many costly lawsuits. In Wichita, an airplane plant reopened, with the promise of 2,000 new jobs.
But in the end, that did not make enough of a difference. "I honestly believe that in people's minds, I had become identified with Congress, even though I hadn't fallen victim to the royalty," he said. "I liken it to a bear market; sometimes the good stocks got hit every bit as much as the bad stocks. In this case, I think I was a good stock."
Since Nov. 8, the Glickmans have spent evenings dining with other displaced Democrats, commiserating and replaying various campaign scenarios.
"You spend a lot of time talking about the race," said Mrs. Glickman. Completing his wife's thought, Mr. Glickman added: "Thinking to yourself, if so-and-so had been my campaign manager, would this have happened? And interviewing for jobs."
For now, the Glickmans have not decided whether to leave Washington. She said she was interested in finding a job that affected social policy. Although Mr. Glickman mentioned several options, he is reportedly being courted by law firms here who see his pro-business stance as a plus.
In addition, Mr. Glickman is among those being considered to replace Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Still, Mr. Glickman said he would miss being a Congressman.
"I'll miss being recognized and being fawned over," he joked. "Now the only unrequited love I'll have is from my beagle."
Despite Mr. Glickman's touch of humor, a wistful note crept into his voice as he fingered his tie tack shaped like a sunflower, the state flower of Kansas.
"I came in with the class of '76, with Al Gore and Panetta and Gephardt," he said. "The class that's running the country. These are my contemporaries. Everybody gives their eyeteeth for this job.
"And this office," Mr. Glickman said. "I'll miss this office. And the mail. I just love opening the mail. I'd come in on the weekend just to open the mail."

HEADLINE: Mexican Banking's New Scorecard

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Moving boxes were stacked by the reception desk and no one knew the number of the telephone in the conference room, but the new J. P. Morgan financial group in Mexico City opened for business anyway this month as one of the first new American banks in Mexico since 1932.
The arrival of Morgan, along with a pack of other foreign competitors, has opened a new era of global competition in Mexico's financial sector. The new institutions could push Mexico's 36 banks, which were privatized or created in the last few years, to become more aggressive and efficient. The Government sold the country's large national banks to private investors starting in 1991 after a disastrous period of Government ownership. 
 "The presence of foreign competition is one of the great challenges we face," the new president of the Mexican Bankers Association, Jose Madariaga, said at the annual bankers' convention. "We must recognize that as one of the forces of the process of opening and something that will form part of our strategy of the future."
The foreign banks were allowed in by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which not only lowers tariffs but also removes regulations covering trade and commerce among the United States, Canada and Mexico. On Oct. 17, Mexico opened its financial markets to outsiders like Morgan by approving the presence of 18 foreign banks, 16 brokerage houses, 12 insurance companies, 1 leasing company and 5 financial groups.
Some American financial institutions have moved into more than one sector. The Morgan financial group, for example, consists of a bank and a brokerage house.
"We bring to the table not only our checkbook to start lending to the top corporations in pesos, but better techniques and better banking practices," said Eduardo Cepeda, 37, the managing director of Morgan in Mexico. Mexican banks, he said, "will have to basically speed up and catch up."
Until the trade accord, Citibank, which has done business here for 65 years, was the only foreign banking institution operating openly in Mexico. It remained after tough Government restrictions prompted other foreign banks to leave. Citibank now intends to expand its branches, market its credit cards and offer brokerage services.
Just how much competition the new banks represent worries Mexican bankers. During the first half of 1994, many Mexican banks reported declining profits and expanding portfolios of bad loans. The banking industry was shaken last September when Government regulators seized control of two national banks and accused the president of the group that runs them, Carlos Cabal Peniche, of lending himself $700 million.
Mr. Cepeda said he expected some head-to-head competition in specialized fields like underwriting and corporate lending. But he said it was unlikely that the new foreign banks would open branches and go into the retail market, or that an interest-rate war would break out as the banks scrambled for market share.
"Ultimately, the man on the street will also benefit," Mr. Cepeda said. "Some of the domestic banks will say, forget about competing with J. P. Morgan in, say, trading derivatives, if they can make money by providing a very good service and doing a good margin on the retail side."
Some financial analysts see the market differently. "We cannot ignore the fact that the spirit of Mexico's financial opening was to increase competition," said Rafael Bello, a banking analyst with Morgan Stanley, which has approval to establish a brokerage office in Mexico.
Competition in corporate lending may force some Mexican banks to shift their focus to less profitable and more risky consumer banking. They will be pressured to improve service and perhaps offer more competitive interest rates. Some Mexican banks without sufficient resources could try to ally with stronger institutions.
Morgan, which has initial capitalization in Mexico of $114 million, looks unlikely to go after passbook savers. Its threshold for most transactions is $50 million.
Morgan has done business with the Mexican Government and Mexico's 100 largest companies for a century without being here. In 1980, it opened a representative office in Mexico, through which it could make loans and sell bonds for Mexican clients, but only outside Mexico. Last May, the company arranged $700 million of a $1.1 billion internationally syndicated loan for the Government oil company, Pemex. Morgan, which has subsidiaries in 17 countries, can now handle peso-denominated instruments and trade stock for clients in Mexico as well as in New York and the rest of the world.
Under the terms of North American accord, foreign banks in Mexico are treated the same as national banks, but with these restrictions: At first, the foreign banks as a group are limited to 8 percent of the total banking capital in Mexico, and no single bank can account for more than 1.5 percent. By 1999, that overall limit will be raised to 15 percent. The cap will be lifted in 2000, although the Government reserves the right to reimpose a cap if foreign participation in Mexico exceeds 25 percent of the total banking capital.
No Canadian banks sought a Mexican license, preferring to rely on their representative offices here, but French, German and Spanish banks applied and are poised to enter. Financial analysts here said the approvals given Fuji Bank and the Bank of Tokyo are especially significant for the Mexican economy, because these institutions tend to do business with Japanese manufacturing companies, which could arrive after the banks.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New President of Conde Nast Predicts Clear Sailing Ahead

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
Reflecting the new upbeat mood spreading through the magazine industry, Steven T. Florio, who became president of Conde Nast Publications Inc. in April, said that in 1994 the company experienced its largest financial improvement in years.
"And as we go into 1995, it is my belief that every single magazine will be up in ad pages for the first quarter," Mr. Florio said in an interview last week. "We are just closing the March issues, and we will have a better idea by the first week in January. But right now it looks as if we will be up 20 percent in advertising pages for all the magazines." 
 It has been five years since this kind of talk has been heard in the magazine industry. After seeing an overall increase in advertising pages for the 185 magazines measured by the Publishers Information Bureau for 10 of the first 11 months of 1994, many publishers are sharing Mr. Florio's belief that the advertising recession that has dogged the magazine industry since 1989 is finally over.
"Advertising has really turned around," said Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine consultant. "But remember the first quarter of 1994 was a disaster, so the 20 percent increase is coming off a very low base."
The real question, or course, is not whether advertising is up, but whether overall revenue and -- more to the point -- profits are up.
Conde Nast is a privately held company that plays its cards close to the vest and does not disclose financial information. But earlier this month, at a lunch in a private room at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan, S.I. Newhouse, the chairman of Conde Nast, told about 50 executives that the improved performance in 1994 reflected profits as well as revenue, according to people who attended the lunch.
Mr. Florio declined to identify the magazines that were losing money. But an executive at the company said all the magazines were profitable except Mademoiselle, Bon Appetit and Details, which were described as "close, but not over the top."
The other big Conde Nast magazines include Allure, Architectural Digest, Bride's, Glamour, Gourmet, GQ, Vanity Fair, Self and Conde Nast Traveler. In addition, Conde Nast's parent, Advance Publications, owns The New Yorker.
In terms of advertising pages, six Conde Nast magazines showed losses through November: Architectural Digest, down 3 percent from the first 11 months of 1993; GQ, down 8 percent; Vanity Fair, down 16 percent; Mademoiselle, down 25 percent; Bon Appetit, down 36 percent, and Glamour, down 8 percent.
Still, Mr. Florio is clearly on a roll, anticipating a turnaround based on January and February ad pages, which have already been scheduled.
As soon as the announcement was made in January that he would leave his job as president and chief executive of The New Yorker to become president of Conde Nast in June, Mr. Florio moved into the company's headquarters at 350 Madison Avenue and began to make his presence known, even though his predecessor, Bernard H. Leser, still held the title.
By April, Mr. Florio had made so many new appointments that the pretense that he was only president-elect was dropped and he officially assumed his new position.
He has appointed 18 top executives, which include new publishers for Bon Appetit, Details, Conde Nast Traveler, GQ, Glamour, Self and Vanity Fair. He said his teams were now in place. "What's done is done," he said.
Conde Nast is considering several ideas for new magazines and will probably announce a start-up around the middle of next year to begin publication in 1996. "It would be a natural extension of what we do best," Mr. Florio said, but he declined to elaborate.
James Truman, editorial director of Conde Nast, said an entertainment magazine was not under consideration, contrary to a published report. "There are several ideas knocking back and forth and we are going to see which one germinates," he said.
Mr. Florio also expects to announce early next year a new interactive publishing project involving food and travel. The company is still deciding on the way in which it will participate in the new media, but Mr. Florio made it clear that the emphasis would be on editorial content. "That's what drives the company," he said.
Mr. Florio has been a strong presence since taking charge, an exuberant man whose enthusiasm has re-energized the company. He is known as a good manager with a keen instinct for appointing the right person to the right job.
"He taught me how to manage a big staff, how to be fair, how to be exacting and how to create an environment that focuses on creativity while giving people latitude to make their own decisions," said Lynn W. Heiler, publisher of Bon Appetit.
Mr. Florio hired Ms. Heiler to work for him at GQ and then brought her with him to The New Yorker as publisher. Mr. Florio came to the New Yorker from GQ, where he had risen through the advertising ranks to become publisher.
"It is a tremendous help that he came out of sales," Ms. Heiler said. "He is still a salesman and can relate to the situation."
Perhaps the most successful coup engineered by Mr. Florio so far was convincing General Motors to start advertising again in Conde Nast publications, after the auto maker had pulled its advertising eight years ago because Conde Nast would not give it special discounts. People close to the company estimate that the return of G.M. will mean about 500 pages of advertising in 1995, valued at $20 million in revenues.
"Steve's genius is that he got the G.M. deal done," the editor in chief of Self, Alexandra Penney, said. "It was there to do but nobody could do it but Steve."
What distinguishes Mr. Florio from the presidents at many other magazine companies is that he is clearly interested in editorial content. He is said to enjoy a good working relationship with Mr. Truman.
Mr. Florio and Mr. Truman are constantly wandering into each other's offices in what Mr. Truman described as "a casual but close partnership."
So casual is the partnership, in fact, that one day when Mr. Truman, a boxing enthusiast who spars with a teacher once a week, mentioned that he had a pair of boxing gloves in his office, Mr. Florio, who can never refuse a challenge, suggested a quick round. They each put on one glove and began dancing around the office. "He stole the advantage," Mr. Truman said. "We're both right-handed and he took the right glove."
The two men, whose relationship is under constant scrutiny by the company, provided a spectacle that, had it been witnessed, would probably have sent the Conde Nast rumor mill into double overtime.

WHERE THE SUCKERS MOON
An Advertising Story
By Randall Rothenberg
478 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.
"When business is good it pays to advertise; when business is bad you've got to advertise," an old adage holds. By the late 1980's business had finally gone bad for Subaru of America, which sold 183,242 of its practical if unsexy Japanese-made sedans and wagons in 1986 but saw sales drop to 108,547 in 1990. 
 So when the sales company was taken over in 1991 by Fuji Heavy Industries, the manufacturer of the cars, and the decision was made to retool Subaru's image by hiring a new advertising agency, Randall Rothenberg, then a media reporter for The New York Times, saw an irresistible opportunity. Knowing how much it meant to an agency to land a lucrative car account, he got Subaru's permission to cover the selection process from the inside and report on it, first in an article for The New York Times Magazine and now in this book, "Where the Suckers Moon: An Advertising Story."
As one can sense from its title, which comes from a line by the writer A. J. Liebling, "Fortune swims, not with the main stream of letters, but in the shallows, where the suckers moon," the book does not tell a story of resounding success. After screening hundreds of agencies, Subaru of America finally settled on Wieden & Kennedy, a hot young outfit in Portland, Ore., put on the map by its contribution to Nike's high-flying advertising.
As Mr. Rothenberg tells it, Wieden & Kennedy created a series of ads for Subaru that were based on the tag line "What to drive" but were richer in trendiness than in detailing the virtues of the product. Understandably, this didn't play well with the dealers, who saw the message as implicitly designed to drive the customer away. Defects in the quality of the ads, the balky Bush economy and Fuji's refusal to lower production quotas combined to do the rest of the damage. Wieden & Kennedy ended up being dismissed.
Mr. Rothenberg follows the entire process like a gray-flannel fly on the wall, reconstructing those few scenes at which he was not present. At every opportunity, he whizzes back into relevant history, for instance to trace the migration of the ad business to and from Madison Avenue or to describe the watershed of so-called creative advertising that was represented by the famous Volkswagen ads ("Think Small") created by Doyle Dane Bernbach.
The author's skeptical outlook can be entertaining and instructive, particularly where he digs up stories like the one in which George Lois, "the Marat of the Creative Revolution," signed up a Japanese baseball star as a pitchman for Subaru -- "You taught us baseball; we're teaching you how to make cars" -- only to discover that the player was actually Korean.
Or where he traces the rise of West Coast advertising and explains the development of "a post-modern sensibility in the advertising industry." As he puts it, advertising could be "metacommentary," or "art that explicated, through irony, camp, iconic reference or self-reference, the commercial itself and the consumer culture of which it was part."
The drawback of "Suckers" is that Mr. Rothenberg goes on at too great length with a story that doesn't quite bear the weight of his commentary. A greater handicap still is that moral disdain for the culture of advertising is such an ancient exercise that this reader for one tended to discount Mr. Rothenberg's subtle ridicule and to look for the virtues of effective salesmanship, a necessary evil in a free-market economy, despite all of John Kenneth Galbraith's complaints.
But what you get in "Suckers" is a surfeit of people who themselves have contempt for the advertising game; whose attitude is summed up by one art director's television commercial that began with the statement "Karl Marx once described advertising as maggots feeding on the rotting corpse of capitalism," and concluded with the response "Let's do lunch."
In fact, as Mr. Rothenberg presents his story, this attitude lies at the heart of why Wieden & Kennedy's Subaru campaign failed: it was written by people who not only disliked advertising in general but also despised cars in particular. As Jerry Cronin, the creative director on Subaru of America's advertising account sums up his own attitude: "I want people to know what cars can do. They won't make you feel better or more successful. . . . I want to separate people from their cars, get rid of the emotional bind. People are far too attached to their cars. I want them to see that cars are a hunk of metal. Automotive advertising is the biggest lie of all time. You want to live better, look better -- buy a grill, go to the gym!"
So despite the distastefulness of so many of its characters, Babbitts and anti-Babbitts alike, "Where the Suckers Moon" remains a revealing job of reporting. Mr. Rothenberg concludes his narrative by describing a party given to watch the 1993 Super Bowl on television for people more interested in advertisements than in football. His immediate point is that in their awareness of the advertisements, Subaru's finished dead last. But the deeper message of the anecdote is that there are people who care about what advertisements tell them. And the way to their hearts and minds is not through condescension.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Leading From Behind

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In the final part of his speech to the nation last Thursday hardly mentioned in press reports -- President Clinton spoke with eloquence about the need for civility and community in our politics.
"Citizens have to listen as well as talk," the President said. "We need less hot rhetoric and more open conversation, less malice and more charity. . . . we have got to be a community again." 
 True. But a democracy also needs leadership -- leadership that speaks to citizens in terms of reality, not popularity. On that score Mr. Clinton's speech was a disaster, for the country and for him.
"It was a moment when he had to show command and conviction," Doris Kearns Goodwin said. "That was the way to restore respect for him and the office. Instead he changed his policy and followed the Republicans."
Ms. Goodwin's new book, "No Ordinary Time," is the story of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt during World War II. As an example of Presidential leadership, she cited Roosevelt's calling for lend-lease aid to embattled Britain when polls showed little support for aid -- and persuading the country that it was right.
"That is what leadership is all about," Ms. Goodwin said the other day: "Staking your ground ahead of where opinion is and convincing people, not simply following the popular opinion of the moment."
Virtually all economists, right across the political spectrum, think tax cuts now are a terrible idea. Among other things, they take the focus away from the need to bring down the budget deficit.
The Federal Reserve Board, seeing a relaxation of budget discipline, is likely to raise interest rates even higher than it already has. That would take the steam out of a growing economy, leaving more Americans unemployed and more with falling pre-tax incomes. What good will largely symbolic tax cuts do then?
During his first two years in office, President Clinton emphasized deficit reduction and achieved remarkable results. The annual deficit has been cut from $290 billion to $160 billion: the first downward movement in many years.
In calling for $60 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, Mr. Clinton said he would pay for that with reductions in Federal spending. But he was slow to say how; and his own budget director, Alice Rivlin, was strongly opposed to the idea of lowering taxes.
The public does want leaner government. But if the President has good ideas on how to reduce spending, he could and should carry them out regardless of tax cuts -- and use the saved money for valuable programs and for deficit reduction.
Of course anyone would enjoy lower taxes. When people were polled after the President's speech, 75 percent said they liked his proposals. But in the same poll, 64 percent said they thought reducing the deficit was more important than reducing taxes. Americans are not so stupid.
The reason Mr. Clinton switched policy gears and went back to this long-abandoned campaign call for a middle-class tax cut was obvious to everyone who heard the speech. Newt Gingrich's winning "Contract With America" promised lower taxes. The President was mimicking Newtonian politics.
How could a man as smart as Bill Clinton believe that copy-cat tactics would enhance his standing? Would make Americans look to him for leadership?
A speech that actually led the country -- and made Mr. Clinton look like a leader -- would not have been hard to write.
"The tax cuts you hear about," he might have said, "would buy the average American family a pizza a week. And we would pay a high price for that as a country: the risk of inflation and higher interest rates that would make most people worse off."
In short, he might have appealed to the sense of community that he extolled last Thursday. Instead, we are likely now to have a bidding war on lower taxes, with one irresponsible proposal topping another. And Bill Clinton will be like Gilbert and Sullivan's Duke of Plaza Toro: "He led his regiment from behind / He found it less exciting."

HEADLINE: Despite Request for Freeze, Cuomo Is Filling State Jobs

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Despite a request for a hiring freeze by Governor-elect George E. Pataki, the Cuomo administration has hired hundreds of people in the five weeks following the Nov. 8 election.
Most of the new state workers were hired to fill relatively low-level positions, the kinds of jobs that state officials say are necessary to insure that roads are cleared of snow, sheets are changed at psychiatric centers and bathrooms are cleaned at state buildings. But others have filled jobs considered less essential to the public's health and safety. 
 The new employees include a grant processor at the Department of Economic Development; a conservation educator at the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation; clerks at the Department of Motor Vehicles, and an assistant business officer at Rockland Psychiatric Center.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican who will take office on Jan. 1 after defeating Mr. Cuomo last month, said in an interview that he found the hiring "very disturbing."
"I just don't know whether it's a deliberate political decision or it's simply a business-as-usual approach, but either way I don't think it's right," he said. "We have requested a hiring freeze from the Governor. Obviously, it hasn't happened, and that's disappointing."
Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff, Andrew J. Zambelli, said that Mr. Cuomo had never promised to freeze hiring. "We said we weren't going to do a freeze per se but that we would reduce costs and would remind people of that as they moved forward," Mr. Zambelli said. "The vast majority of these new positions are in institutions, where the issues of staffing ratios and Federal requirements are constantly being monitored."
Mr. Pataki has been concerned about the Cuomo administration's post-election hiring practices since late November, when news reports revealed that a Department of Motor Vehicles official had sent a memorandum to subordinates announcing that his goal was "to fill every item before an anticipated job and promotion freeze."
Mr. Pataki says the standard for hiring during the transition should be whether the position is absolutely essential and whether it needs to be filled now. He added that the post-election hiring would complicate the task of closing a large projected gap in the budget for the fiscal year that begins on April 1.
"It's important to us to keep those positions vacant if they're not essential, because we don't want to have to be in a position where they get a job and then they're laid off," he said.The gap in next year's budget has been estimated at $4 billion, even without the estimated $1 billion first-year cost of Mr. Pataki's plan to cut income tax rates.
The Governor-elect believes the gap could grow even larger in the next few months. A report released by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall shows that the state's personal income tax receipts in November fell $99.3 million below projections made in October, contributing to a $96.5 million shortfall in this year's general fund budget.
After learning of the size of next year's projected budget gap, Mr. Pataki wrote Mr. Cuomo on Nov. 21 requesting "a freeze on hiring new state employees, promotion of current employees, reclassification or other personnel action in all but essential areas until after Jan. 1."
The Governor responded in a letter that his staff would "work to limit the filling of vacant positions in the state general-fund work force."
Two days later, Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Rudy F. Runko, informed his staff that state agencies should not do any hiring that would increase the size of the state's general-fund payroll unless workers were needed to protect the health and safety of employees or clients, said Claudia S. Hutton, Mr. Runko's spokeswoman.
But those determinations were left up to the agencies, and many apparently have continued to hire employees without following Mr. Runko's standard.
The Office of Mental Health, for instance, hired 116 workers after Nov. 23, the day that Mr. Runko issued his edict. Many of them provide direct care to patients in psychiatric centers. But others -- like a laborer hired on Nov. 28 for the agency's headquarters in Albany and the assistant business officer at Rockland Psychiatric Institute, who was hired on Dec. 2 -- do not.
Similar cases were found at many of the three dozen state agencies surveyed by The New York Times. At the Department of Environmental Conservation, an environmental engineer, an engineering geologist and a forestry technician were hired on Nov. 28.
The Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation hired 11 people on Dec. 1, ranging from park workers to a mechanic to an assistant purchasing agent to the conservation educator. The conservation educator "teaches people what kind of trees they're seeing, not to mess up trails, what kind of leaves, that kind of thing," said Steve Osborne, a spokesman for the agency.
In all, close to 1,000 people have been hired by the state since Election Day.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 29, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 19 about hiring by New York State during the transition between the Cuomo and Pataki administrations referred incorrectly in some copies to the agency being monitored by Michael Clemente, a Pataki transition aide. It is the Department of Civil Service, not the Department of Motor Vehicles.

HEADLINE: Watching Out for 'Panic Shoppers'

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN

 BODY:
Marian Goodman is waiting for the men to arrive.
 "The men'll be here," said the 40-year-old assistant store manager at Bloomingdale's flagship in midtown Manhattan, accelerating past a snow-white Clinique counter toward trays of ties layered like freshly caught fish. "You see the panic shopper. You can see the look on their faces." 
 Men," she declared, "are panic shoppers."
 After 18 years in department stores, Ms. Goodman's instincts, about shoppers, hot items and men's buying habits, are honed like a good boning knife. And this is the time of year when those instincts are tested.
 In this last week before Christmas, Ms. Goodman and thousands of buyers and executives at department stores, toy stores, apparel shops and jewelry boutiques across the country are on trial. "Many typical stores generate 50 percent of their sales and 70 percent of their profits during the period from Thanksgiving and Christmas," said Walter F. Loeb, a retailing consultant in New York.
 No hard data are yet available about how this Christmas shopping season is faring but Wall Street analysts are estimating that sales will be up 6 to 8 percent, and profits somewhat less, over last year.
 Across America, from the biggest retailers to the neighborhood toy shop, the sounds most eagerly awaited are not Santa's "Ho Ho Ho," or Bing Crosby's liquid "White Christmas," but the beep, ratchet and ring of cash registers and the rustle of shopping bags filling.
 And though those bags are filling, come January many retailers may rue their bottom lines. Some shoppers are buying with abandon, but others seem cautious as they browse.
 "I'm getting people things they would not spend money on for themselves," explained a harried Debra Fulscher, the director of client services and administration in the Chicago office of Trimedia Inc., an advertising and marketing firm, who was shopping in downtown Chicago last week.
 After driving in from her home in Barrington, Ill., Ms. Fulscher visited Tiffany's -- and bought a $425 gold cross for her boyfriend. "I wanted to make it something special instead of just going to a regular jeweler," she said. Besides gifts for her own family, she bought some presents -- mostly clothing and toiletries -- for a 4-year-old girl on Chicago's South Side, whose family was "adopted" by a church group that provides gifts to the needy.
 Also cruising Chicago's stores was Brenda Large of Ironton, Ohio, who was shopping between sessions at a conference she was attending. Ms. Large said she expected to spend about $3,000 on Christmas gifts. "The economy continues to be pretty good in our area," she said. "It hasn't had much of a negative effect on us."
 There were the usual presents of clothing for some of her adult children, but this year she also plunked down money for some pricier gifts -- a television for a daughter who attends Ohio State University and an exercise bicycle for another daughter and her husband.
 Yet, even with such enthusiastic shoppers, blips of concern are popping up across the retailing map. Pre-Christmas sales are already in full swing at many stores, paring profits dramatically even as sales volume surges.
 "Many retailers are looking at the lower end of their expectations," Mr. Loeb said.
 Vicki Malafronte, her ears wedged with rhinestone earrings, bustled around one of her perfume counters at Nordstrom's in San Francisco, and fretted: "It's frustrating. The crowds aren't showing up yet, even though the weekends have been okay. It's just not cranking up like it was last year."
Many senior executives, when questioned about sales, begin by exuding holiday and commercial cheer in equal bounty, but, when pressed, they acknowledge some worries.
 "Last year we had the best Christmas in our history, and this year we expect to do better," said John H. Costello, a senior vice president for marketing at Sears, Roebuck & Company in Chicago.
 At the 2,000 Sears stores across the country, Mr. Costello said customers were "focused on both wants and wishes," adding, "They are buying practical gifts they need, as well as little luxuries that make Christmas a little more special."
 In the Sears store in Hicksville, L.I., "the bags are nice and full, but certain categories are doing better than others," said Thomas Clarke, the general manager there. Hardware, a Sears staple, "has been coming through very, very nicely," he said. "In men's wear, ramie cotton sweaters with lots of vibrant colors mixed in together, wrinkle-free pants by Docker and Haggar, are all doing very well. And outerwear is finally starting to kick in. You know, when it starts to get to 30 degrees, you can't go out without a coat on, so that's definitely picking up."
 What is not doing so well, he said, is women's wear. "Women's is not really cranked up because the men are not shopping yet," he said. "But jewelry is a really big boomer. Very large increases over last year. The average ticket is well over $100, from $100 to $200."
 Other retailers are singing the apparel blues, too. "I think generally speaking apparel sales throughout the industry have not been up to expectations," said Henry J. Russman, a spokesman for the 1,250-store J.C. Penney chain, which offers lower-priced men's and women's wear.
 And Donald Hess, chief executive of Parisian Inc., a Birmingham, Ala., clothing retailer with stores from Detroit to Sarasota, Fla., said, The year continues to be a pretty tough year for apparel."
 Yet some companies, like Talbots Inc., which specializes in classic women's wear, are less concerned. Clark J. Hinkley, the executive vice president and chief executive of the 392-store company, said, "It's not as big a dependency for us, Christmas. We run a more balanced business throughout the year."
 The hottest items, he said, involve velvet: sportswear, dresses, trim on dresses. "It's just a great trend we're seeing," he said. "Vests are next; that's a new trend for us. And the third major thing is jumpers, fine gauge sweaters and pants. We've seen a major swing from skirts."
At Carson Pirie Scott & Company, which is based in Milwaukee and operates 32 department and furniture stores in the Midwest, snow and a biting wind have warmed Ed Carroll's heart. "Cold weather goods, which were backing up on us and other retailers the last few weeks, well, when the snow hit, the sales skyrocketed," said Mr. Carroll, the executive vice president for marketing. Hats, gloves, coats, boots and sweaters have all posted double-digit increases in sales over last year, he said.
 In Atlanta, Marsha Brinkley, co-owner of Hermit Island, a small shop selling eclectic goods from Central and South America and Asia, said things were looking good.
 "Business is definitely up over last year," Ms. Brinkley said. "The retailers all over the mall are talking about it. Our business is much stronger."
 Ms. Brinkley said that in addition to increased volume, shoppers seem willing to spend more. "Last year, our best-selling item was $6.95," she said. "This year we have things priced at $50 and $60 that are walking out the door as fast as we can get them on the shelves."
 In San Francisco, shoppers are deluging stores, large and small. At Williams-Sonoma Inc., a high-end cookware store -- La Cornue French stoves run from $11,000 to $17,000, though none yet have sold yet this Christmas -- the hottest items are terra cotta garlic bakers, made in Taiwan, selling for $7 and $16.
 "Sales are still up comfortably over last year," said Howard Lester, the company's chief executive, who was, nonetheless, chary with hard numbers. "We've got nothing to worry about."
 Yet there were some signs of moderation.
 "We're doing something this year that we see more and more of," Linda Bertolli of Berkeley said of her family's plans. "We pick names and get a present for that one individual." But she cheats on that system, she said, by buying something for her mother and her mother-in-law, and small presents for a gaggle of nieces and nephews.
 Aside from winter clothes for her husband, Ms. Bertolli said she had found "a terrific gift" for her brother -- a miniature Etch-a-Sketch that can fit on a key ring.
 "I'm definitely spending less this year, and for a couple of reasons," she said. "We made a conscious decision to spend less and to give more to charity. This year we'll donate to Fresh Start Farms, a group that tries to put homeless parents to work developing rooftop urban gardens."
 Ms. Bertolli also said her company, which buys and trades mailing lists for left-of-center nonprofit organizations, had not had a great year.
 At Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, in a windowless office tucked behind racks of Barbie dolls and infants' wear, David L. Fisher, a senior vice president, was plotting the last days of the Christmas season.
 "November was spectacular for 59th Street," he exuded. "The first reason is we consciously put a lot of effort into being in stock and in depth in key items -- basic sweaters, cashmere sweaters, candy and novelty foods. The second reason, frankly, is the weakness of the dollar. Bloomingdale's is on the hit parade for foreign tourists."
 Yet, like many other retailers, Mr. Fisher acknowledged, "December has not been as strong for the first two weeks as November was."
 One problem for retailers, he said, is that people keep delaying their Christmas shopping. "It's just getting later and later," he said. "A box of Godiva chocolates will wind up being something you buy at the last minute."
 Down on the floor, maneuvering though clots of shoppers, Ms. Goodman stooped to pick up a scrap of paper, glanced at her ever-chirping beeper and shooshed a shopper toward kitchenware.
 "This is my 19th Christmas," she said, between words of encouragement to people folding sweaters, tying ribbons and trying to spritz perfume on customers. "This week I was here 'til midnight on Tuesday. At this time of year, I need to be flexible."
 As she zoomed past racks of children's clothing on eight, she swung by Santa Claus, who was twiddling his thumbs, the vicinity clear of wandering children. Ms. Goodman popped onto his lap.
 "And what do you want for Christmas, my dear," he asked through a bush of clip-on white beard.
 "Happiness, for my kids to graduate," she said, "and to make my sales plan."

HEADLINE: Orange County's Emergency Expert

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 14

 BODY:
Thomas W. Hayes, the former California state treasurer hired to help salvage Orange County's loss-plagued investment fund, is no stranger to fiscal emergencies.
Gov. Pete Wilson, upon taking office in 1991 just as California plunged into a recession that shattered the state's economy, turned to Mr. Hayes as the principal architect of his $55 billion state budget, which required both painful spending cuts and tax increases. Earlier, Mr. Hayes defied state tradition by putting the underwriting of its bonds up for public bid. Along the way, he developed a reputation as a better financial expert than as a politician. 
 "He's willing to take on big challenges and get down in the foxhole," said Larry Thomas, a campaign adviser to Governor Wilson, who recommended Mr. Hayes to the county's Board of Supervisors.
In an interview, Mr. Hayes said his strategy in Orange County is to liquidate the remaining $5 billion or so in assets as soon as possible but "without a fire sale," replacing them with more conservative securities that mature in no more than 180 days. Orange County has now began disposing of some of the more plain vanilla bonds in its portfolio.
Hired for 90 days, Mr. Hayes has also developed a work-out plan that, if necessary, calls for arm-twisting some Government-sponsored agencies that issued bonds especially sensitive to interest rates to buy them back at an advantageous price. He is also trying to spread the county's fund losses over several years, a process that involves rescheduling interest payments owed on debt.
Since being chosen on Dec. 8, Mr. Hayes has seen his workdays stretch, sometimes to 22 hours. His phone rings at least 100 times a day. Among the calls are those from some of the 187 investors in the county's pool, which has a loss of $2.02 billion, or 27 percent. A lot of the calls go unanswered.
"You have to keep your focus on the main goal," he said. "Unfortunately, that's going to irritate a lot of people because they aren't going to get through to you."
Being pulled back into the public arena, with all its demands, is one reason, among others, that Mr. Hayes's wife, Mary, did not want him to take the job. The family, which includes two daughters, live in the exclusive Sacramento suburb of Rancho Murieta, where Mr. Hayes has been working as a private investment adviser and trader.
Gray-haired and mild-mannered, Mr. Hayes, who is 49, acknowledges: "Quite frankly I'm not comfortable with politics." He prefers to be "invisible" and professes no further political ambitions. Indeed, he was not registered with any political party until he was appointed state treasurer by then-Gov. George Duekmejian. He then registered as a Republican.
Until taking on the around-the-clock job in Orange County, Mr. Hayes devoted his spare time to his two hobbies, golf and cooking, and gave financial advice to emerging nations. After the Ferdinand Marcos regime toppled in the Philippines, for example, he made 10 trips to Manila. Meanwhile, 100 Filipino officials came to California under his sponsorship for study and internships.
Appointed treasurer in 1989, Mr. Hayes replaced Jesse Unruh, a longstanding California legislator and public official who died in office and was best known for saying that money is the "mother's milk of politics."
In his two years managing the state's $20 billion investment portfolio, Mr. Hayes decided to put the job of underwriting state bonds up to bid, a highly lucrative task previously at the discretion of the treasurer.
"It was not well received on Wall Street," said Donna Lucas, Mr. Hayes's former campaign manager. Still, she added, some firms that had been shut out of state business were pleased the playing field had been leveled.
In some ways, his even-handed policy came back to haunt Mr. Hayes in his first run at elected office in 1990, when he campaigned to stay in the treasurer's post. He was defeated by his opponent, Kathleen Brown. While both candidates accepted contributions from investment houses and Wall Street firms that did business with the state, Ms. Brown was much more successful, raising $7 million to his $1 million.
Mr. Hayes has long favored competitive bidding. After succeeding his fired boss to become auditor general, Mr. Hayes expanded the bidding process to many more state projects. And in a decade as the state's top auditor, Mr. Hayes issued 600 audits -- many of which were critical of his elected bosses.
"He was completely nonpartisan," said Alfred E. Alquist, a Democrat from San Jose, and chairman of the state Senate budget committee.
Last year, Mr. Hayes quit his job in the Wilson Administration to specialize in international investing at Metropolitan West Securities of Los Angeles, where he was recently chosen as president. The firm trades securities and gives technical advice to institutional investors, including California's two big pension funds for state employees and teachers.
Mr. Hayes says he can't wait to return.

HEADLINE: Bridge City Journal;
In Taking On a Corporate Goliath, A Small Town Saves Its Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRIDGE CITY, Tex., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Maybe it was the 2,064 signatures on the petitions in this East Texas community of 8,000 people. "Don't do it! Will shop Kmart if you do," one person added. "Don't want a Super store, want this one," wrote another. "I have to have you here!" said a third.
Or maybe it was the impassioned letter from Libby Mitchell and Cheryl Meeks, two housewives who led the protest against the planned closing of the Bridge City Wal-Mart. "Wal-Mart was built on small towns like ours," they said. "Now all over America, corporate Wal-Mart is chipping away at their own foundations, store by store." 
 Or maybe it was the face-to-face meeting between the housewives and executives from the Arkansas-based retailing giant who flew down here on the company jet to see just why people were so angry about the closing, which was intended to make way for a new "Wal-Mart Supercenter" four times larger and a few towns up the highway.
Mrs. Mitchell, a mother of two toddlers, showed up at the meeting clutching a copy of "Made in America," the autobiography of the company's late founder. She had made liberal use of a yellow highlighter to show the founder's canon, right there on page 218, of "thinking small" and his dread of what he termed the "big disease."
" 'Gentlemen,' " the 24-year-old Mrs. Mitchell recalled herself telling the executives, " 'If Sam Walton was here today, I believe Sam would have kept this store open.' "
Whatever it was, the store will stay open.
For the first time on record in a 32-year history, Wal-Mart officials say they have rescinded a planned closing, or a "consolidation" as Wal-Mart prefers to call it. The announcement this week set off a celebration here and prompted a banner headline in the Penny Record, a weekly newspaper: "Wal-Mart Saved!"
The supercenter will still open next month and feature everything from general merchandise and groceries, to a hair salon, a minibank, a dry cleaner and a McDonald's.
There are towns in the United States that have feared and fought the arrival of Wal-Mart, but Bridge City, sitting amid a vast collection of chemical plants near the Louisiana border, was definitely not one.
"Me and my wife, we just love this place," said Mark Howard, a taxi driver. "It has everything you need, clothing to automotive." Mayor Don Peters proudly describes the 14-year-old store as "our local country club."
Indeed, while parts of the Northeast have been hostile to Wal-Mart, in Texas the chain is part of the cultural landscape. There are 234 stores in the state, more than in any other.
But in an odd way, the battle to save the Bridge City Wal-Mart in the face of the new Wal-Mart Supercenter in nearby West Orange is an echo of the battle that many other communities have waged against Wal-Mart in the first place.
People here said the 200,000-square-foot supercenter, the size of nearly four football fields, would be too big, too impersonal. One petitioner wrote: "Superstore too big for senior citizens to walk around."
And people fervently argued that even if the profits did go to Arkansas, the local Wal-Mart supported the local economy, providing a quarter of the town's sales tax receipts, around $150,000 annually, money that would be lost if customers were diverted to the supercenter.
On the other hand, at least in Bridge City, Wal-Mart no longer has to worry so much about competing with local mom-and-pop operations, many of which closed in the face of competition from the store here, though without any evident ire of most townspeople.
Now, Wal-Mart may simply be vying with itself.
"The fact of the matter is, a supercenter is just that," said Don Shinkle, the vice president for corporate affairs of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. "It has nothing but state-of-the-art shopping conveniences for the customers. And the supercenter no doubt is going to provide a lot of competition to that smaller Bridge City store."
While the store here is profitable now, Mr. Shinkle said, the company had believed that it might no longer be so once the supercenter, seven miles away, opened. Nonetheless, he added, "The decision was made by Bill Fields -- let's give Bridge City a chance."
Bill Fields is the president and chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores, a division of the Wal-Mart company, and the man who flew down to hear what Mrs. Mitchell and Mrs. Meeks had to say.
To Mrs. Mitchell, an expressive woman with a huge mane of blonde hair whose husband, Barney, works in a local chemical plant, Bill Fields is "a great guy."
Mrs. Mitchell said, "At first, to tell you the truth, our opinion started to get negative on Wal-Mart."
"We couldn't get to these people," she continued. "It was like a big corporate giant with a mask, pretending to be as American as apple pie and listening to their customers when they're really just the opposite and don't care what we think. But as soon as we got to the top, they were everything we hoped they would be. They were so friendly and down to earth."
Mrs. Mitchell and Mrs. Meeks, who waged their campaign around the constant demands of their children, sent cookies by Federal Express to Wal-Mart's corporate offices after the decision to stay was announced. "It was like 30 bucks or something, but we didn't care," she said.
It is possible, of course, that in keeping the Bridge City store open, the company was simply acting to head off a public-relations disaster. The protest had attracted the local press, and some of the petitions seemed to border on desperation:
*"You'll kill Bridge City."
*"When you leave us, you leave us with nothing."
*"Crippled and elderly people can't go to another town!"
*"Care about people, not about money, just this once."
*"Where will we get film developed?"
But Wal-Mart insists that the incident is a classic example of how assiduously it is willing to pay attention to its patrons.

HEADLINE: Harvard Chief Is to Return Next Semester

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 19

 BODY:
The president of Harvard University, Neil L. Rudenstine, is recovering from what officials here describe as "severe fatigue and exhaustion" that led him to take a leave of absence last month. He is expected to return to work next semester, the university said today.
Harvard's announcement on Nov. 28 that its 59-year-old president was too tired to perform his duties surprised the academic world and led to speculation about what caused him to leave, and to discussions about the difficulties of managing a modern university. 
 Today, in a brief statement, Harvard officials said they expected him to resume his full duties by the end of February, but they continued to be vague about Mr. Rudenstine's condition.
"He has been resting at home and sleeping well," said Dr. Daniel C. Tosteson, the dean of Harvard Medical School. "Diagnostic tests have provided no evidence for bacterial, viral, cardiovascular disease or cancer. His doctors believe that his condition was related to overwork and insufficient sleep."
Although Dr. Tosteson is serving as Mr. Rudenstine's official medical spokesman, he was not available for interviews today. Other Harvard officials declined to comment on Mr. Rudenstine's health, refusing to identify his doctors or to say whether he was treated at a Harvard-affiliated hospital.
James H. Rowe, vice president for community, government and public affairs, said that Mr. Rudenstine has been resting at home, reading biographies of Andrew Jackson and James Madison and a history of D-Day. Mr. Rudenstine went to his annual staff holiday party on Dec. 9. "He joked about how well things were going without him," Mr. Rowe said.
Charles P. Slichter, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the seven-member board that governs the university, issued a statement about Mr. Rudenstine that said, "We expect that he will begin to resume some of his activities early in the second semester, with a return to full-time duties by the end of February."
The Harvard president's first three years in office have been marked by two major projects: instilling more cooperation among Harvard's nine historically independent faculties, and supervising a $2.1 billion fund-raising drive.
The goals are connected. Rich parts of the university, such as the Harvard Business School, have long been able to raise more money from their wealthy alumni than, say, the School of Public Health. Mr. Rudenstine tried to make the current fund-raising campaign a coordinated effort among all the schools.
One of his first major actions after he became president in 1991 was to appoint Jerry R. Green, an economics professor, to become Harvard's second provost, a post that had not been filled in four decades. But last April, Professor Green resigned his post and returned to teaching. The resignation, coming just weeks before the fund-raising drive began, reflected dissension within Harvard's administration.
As of early December, the university had raised $782 million. Professor Green was succeeded by Albert Carnesale, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Dean Carnesale is serving as the acting president in Mr. Rudenstine's absence.

HEADLINE: Mayor and Medicaid: Old Puzzle, New Approach

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration's call for sharp reductions in health and welfare benefits for the poor represents a new approach to an old problem: how to get New York City out from under the burden of Medicaid.
With the cost of Medicaid steadily rising over the years, New York City mayors, Rudolph W. Giuliani included, have long battled for the state to pay the city's share of these health care costs for the poor. But now Mr. Giuliani has opened a second front and is seeking state approval simply to slash city spending on the Federal program by nearly a third. 
 The shift in strategy, intended to appeal to the new Republican administration in Albany, was signaled last week when Mr. Giuliani's budget director wrote to all city commissioners that the Mayor's second fiscal plan for the city would rely more on cutting health and welfare benefits for the poor than on scaling back government bureaucracy to close a $2 billion gap.
The memorandum by the budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, showed that the Mayor's single largest target was Medicaid, with the Department of Social Services instructed to draft proposals for cutting city spending on the program by $900 million.
Why mayor after mayor has been concerned with Medicaid costs has to do with New York City's peculiar relationship with New York State.
In most parts of the country, Federal and state governments split the costs of Medicaid. But in New York -- in a formula that was born of upstate reluctance to pay for New York City's poor -- the state and its localities share Medicaid costs that are not met by the Federal Government.
The result has been that Medicaid, at a cost of $2.6 billion a year to the city, is now the second largest item in its budget behind education, and more costly than the Police Department.
The growth in Medicaid expenses has far outstripped inflation or the overall growth of city spending. "It has been growing on average at about 12 percent a year for the last four or five years," Mr. Lackman said. "It is the single biggest budget buster."
For more than a decade, New York's mayors sought relief from this burden. Gov. Hugh L. Carey, a Democrat, was the first to propose that the state assume the full local share of Medicaid, as most states do. But neither Mr. Carey nor Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, who embraced the idea after him, was able to push a complete Medicaid assumption through a Republican Senate loath to see the state take on such a fiscal burden.
George E. Pataki, who will be the state's first Republican Governor in 20 years, parting company with his Democratic predecessors, says the state's fiscal condition is too dire even to consider a state Medicaid pickup in the coming year. But he has expressed interest in freeing cities from state mandates to provide services and programs. He has also asked Elizabeth P. McCaughey, the incoming Lieutenant Governor, to find ways to cut Medicaid costs.
While Mr. Giuliani says he has not abandoned the quest for the state to assume all local Medicaid costs, he is betting that Mr. Pataki will allow him to make vast reductions in the program, reductions that a Democratic governor would have blocked.
How the administration would actually reduce Medicaid expenditures is unclear. Mr. Giuliani could follow the lead of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, whose administration recently announced a 20 percent reduction in Medicaid payments to hospitals.
He could propose that the city stop paying for anything besides the basic services required by the Federal Government, no longer picking up the bill for prescription drugs, elective abortions, eyeglasses and prostheses.
He could require many more of the city's 1.8 million Medicaid recipients to use managed care, or require the middle-class elderly who turn assets over to children so they can qualify for Medicaid payments for nursing homes to contribute to their own care.
The Mayor could propose that the city sharply cut the number of single adults allowed on Home Relief, a state welfare program that automatically qualifies its recipients for Medicaid. Mr. Lackman has already called for scaling back public assistance programs by $300 million, which would mean a reduction in the number of individuals who receive Home Relief.
In fact, some analysts said Mr. Giuliani would have to use every cost-cutting option imaginable to achieve his goal of nearly $1 billion in Medicaid savings. "That's a 33 percent cut," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund. "To do that you would probably have to be implementing all of the strategies simultaneously."
Success for such changes of policy are far from assured, with virtually all of them needing approval from Albany either through legislation or a change in regulations, and some also needing Washington's sign-off.
While Mr. Pataki might embrace plans to scale back health services for the poor, it is far from clear that the Democratic-controlled State Assembly would. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said that without details he could not comment.
Hospitals also maintain a strong lobbying presence in Albany.
And even with state government support, Mr. Giuliani would still have to push plans through an already restive Democratic-controlled City Council.
Opposition is already building. Penelope W. Pi-Sunyer, executive director of the City Project, a coalition of advocacy and labor groups, wrote in an angry open letter to the Mayor that Mr. Lackman had outlined the proposals for cutting health and welfare for the poor on the same day that Mr. Giuliani had unveiled a package of tax breaks for landlords in lower Manhattan.
Yet by planning to make more than half the savings needed to close next year's budget gap through cuts in Medicaid and other public assistance, Mr. Giuliani was challenging those who might oppose him yet share a commitment to New York City's fiscal health. How else would they find such savings in the new city budget?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Toyota's Tercel infomercial draws a significant response from its youthful, hungry audience.

BYLINE: By James Bennet 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE Toyota Motor Corporation believes it may have hit on the right technique to get through to young people today: a combination of daytime television, computer software and free food.
Groping for a fresh way to promote the 1995 model of its small car, the Tercel, Toyota decided to try its first infomercial, testing a 28-minute advertisement in New York and Los Angeles during November. Toyota was hoping for a way to make the Tercel stick out from among its numerous competitors, which include Honda's Civic, Chrysler's Neon and General Motors' Saturn. The results were so encouraging that last week Toyota began broadcasting the advertisement in 15 markets around the country. 
 The infomercial features brief comments from unidentified young Tercel buyers and customers in dealerships describing what they're looking for, and from youthful Toyota product specialists describing features of the car. It also includes interviews out on the street with young people, some of whom, Toyota said, were actors.
A highly caffeinated hostess, Molly Scott, periodically bounced into the picture to urge callers to telephone a toll-free number for more information, and to sum up the ad's message.
"You know what is so amazing about what we're seeing?" she asked at one point. "We're seeing that you can finally have the best of all worlds."
The infomercial proved to be a superb vehicle for reaching the target audience, 18- to 35-year-olds, said Irving A. Miller, corporate advertising manager for Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. "They're a tough demographic to reach, and they also tend to watch television, when they do, at off hours," he said.
Other auto makers have experimented with infomercials, but none has invested heavily in the format yet. As a result, the Tercel ad has the virtue of standing out from the crowd of 30-second spots showing cars racing through deserts. Mr. Miller said infomercials might be better suited to small cars for young people than to Toyota's more upscale products, like the new Avalon sedan.
Toyota broadcast the advertisement on network affiliates on weekends, in the early morning hours or the middle of the afternoon, when ad time is cheaper. The infomercial, called "I want a car," was produced by Hudson Street Partners, a subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi's Kobs & Draft Worldwide direct marketing agency.
While the effects of normal television advertisements are hard to measure, Toyota started tracking the infomercial's results immediately. About 7,000 people in the two markets called to order more information during the three-week tests, a result that Mr. Miller said delighted Toyota. A few months from now, Toyota plans to compare vehicle registration data with the addresses provided by callers to see how much of the curiosity resulted in sales.
The Los Angeles test drew more responses than the one in New York, because in Los Angeles Toyota also offered a free "night on the town" to anyone who requested the brochure and then visited a dealer to test-drive a Tercel.
The evening out, the infomercial explains, consists of two movie tickets and dinner for two at "one of America's favorite restaurants" -- a Chili's Grill and Bar, in Los Angeles. Ads with the offer garnered twice the response of those without, so Toyota incorporated it into its general campaign. "They went for the burger every time," Mr. Miller said.
Perhaps a more surprising result came from the New York test, where Toyota offered to send information either in a brochure or on a computer disk. Sixty percent of the people who called requested the disk.
The advertisement is broken down into seven segments, each for a specific aspect of the car: its styling, performance, interior, and so on. The ad does not dwell on price, but it does mention that the car starts at less than $10,000, and sells "nicely equipped at around $13,000."
Interspersed with the product information are snippets from twentysomethings commenting on what they look for in a car.
"I want my car to say that I'm 25," said one man, wearing a tie and what appears to be a leather jacket.
Since none of the young people are identified, their observations do not always seem credible and occasionally they seem off the wall. One young man said he was concerned about fuel economy because "the cost of fuel has just skyrocketed."
In another, more poignant moment, a young woman, who Toyota said was not an actress, explained why she becomes tearful when describing driving away from the lot in her Tercel, her first new car. "I've worked really hard to get to the point in my life where I could do something like this, she said, "so I feel pretty fortunate."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
3 Steelmakers in $450 Million Mini-Mill Pact

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
In an indication of how the two sectors of the basic steel industry are converging, three integrated steel companies announced plans yesterday to build a $450 million mini-mill in the Southeastern United States.
The new mill will be half-owned by the LTV Corporation of Cleveland, with the remaining half split evenly by Sumitomo Metal Industries and British Steel P.L.C. Although joint undertakings involving Japanese and American steel companies have become common, this is the first time American, Japanese and European steelmakers have invested together in a new production plant. 
 Integrated steel companies are those that make steel from iron ore, coal, limestone and other minerals. They argue that this approach produces the highest quality steel.
But the better economics of mini-mills, companies that melt steel scrap in electric furnaces and recast it into new products, has changed the nature of the industry. Whole ranges of products, like bars for reinforcing concrete and light structural beams, have been captured by the mini-mills because they could price them lower than the integrated mills.
One of the key advantages enjoyed by the mini-mills as they have developed over the last 25 years has been nonunion plants operated with a high degree of flexibility by workers whose pay is tied to production. The integrated companies were organized in the 1930's by the United Steelworkers union, and many remain saddled with detailed, restrictive contracts with the union.
David H. Hoag, the chairman of LTV, said the company hoped to duplicate the mini-mill system at the new factory, which will be operated by a new entity, the Trico Steel Company. "All three companies involved are committed to a high performance organization," he said.
All three companies will supply executive talent, but most of the blue-collar work force will be hired locally. The plant is expected to employ about 300 people when in full operations.
LTV and Sumitomo jointly operate two electrogalvanizing plants in the United States and Sumitomo holds about 10 percent of LTV's stock. British Steel owns a plate mill in Tuscaloosa, Ala., but does not have plants for thin rolled products.
Construction is expected to begin in the second quarter of next year, with operations scheduled to begin in late 1996. The companies said they were looking at several sites in the Southeast, but they did not disclosed the specific locations.
Operators of mini-mills have been fiercely opposed to unions and have been able to discourage labor organizers by offering pay incentives equivalent to the income of union workers. In addition, many mini-mills are in states where laws make organizing difficult.
The new plant will be equipped with the latest technology for producing liquid steel, thin casting and hot rolling that may enable it to eliminate processing steps needed in older plants, reducing costs. In addition to scrap steel, the plant will be designed to use the new types of ore-based scrap substitutes being developed by the industry.
The mill will have an annual production capacity of 2.2 million tons of flat rolled steel. Though the current boom in steel production has provoked a flurry of new mill announcements, Mr. Hoag noted that the United States imported 14 million tons of steel in the categories to be produced by Trico this year.
"In the past, bars from mini-mills put a dent into bar imports, so I think we have reason to be optimistic," Mr. Hoag said.

HEADLINE: BMW to Help Rolls-Royce Develop a New Model Line

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., perhaps the quintessential British company, said today that it would turn to BMW of Germany for help in building a new generation of luxury cars.
After months of negotiations, BMW beat out Mercedes-Benz to supply engineering expertise and key components, including engines, for future Rolls-Royce and Bentley models. 
 Rolls-Royce said it would also collaborate with BMW in developing a proposed new Bentley sports coupe,tentatively known as the Java, that could go on sale at the end of the decade.
The deal was the most far-reaching that Rolls-Royce had made with an outside supplier and the biggest with any non-British supplier.
The parent company of Rolls-Royce, Vickers P.L.C., and Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. provided few details of the arrangement, but said it would not involve an equity investment by the German company in Rolls-Royce or Vickers.
Vickers has toyed in the past with selling Rolls-Royce, and held talks about a sale or joint venture with BMW several years ago. More recently, Vickers has said that it intends to keep Rolls-Royce, but that it will need a partner to share the costs of developing new models.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, said the BMW deal was "extremely significant" in planning the medium- to long-term strategy for Rolls-Royce.
"Having said that we would find a partner for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars for longer-term collaboration, we are delighted that we have reached agreement with such a prestigious company," he said in a statement.
After losses totaling $150 million in 1991 and 1992, Rolls-Royce recorded a small profit last year and is expected to earn money this year as well. Vickers does not provide details of the car company's financial results.
Rolls-Royce sold 1,360 cars worldwide last year, and through Sept. 30 had sold 1,051 this year, at prices starting at about $140,000. Its peak sales year was 1990, when it sold 3,333 cars.
The turnaround at Rolls-Royce was driven by the economic recoveries in the United States and Britain and a rigorous cost-cutting program at the production plant in Crewe, England.
The deal with BMW centers on engines. Rolls-Royce wants new V8 and V12 engines for models that would go into production around the turn of the century, but cannot afford the high cost of developing them on its own, especially given the rigorous emissions and fuel-economy standards that auto makers face in key markets like the United States.
BMW would supply its engines to Rolls-Royce, but would permit the British company to modify them to meet its needs. For example, Rolls-Royce requires a turbocharged V8 engine, and BMW's V8 is not turbocharged.
Vickers executives said that as Rolls-Royce developed plans for its new models and as Rolls-Royce and BMW engineers learned more about each other's needs and capabilities, the relationship between the companies might be expanded.
BMW already supplies air bags to Rolls-Royce, and through BMW's Rover subsidiary, the British car maker it acquired earlier this year, it also supplies body panels.

HEADLINE: School Board Rebuffs Giuliani On Terms of Cortines's Contract

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
The New York City Board of Education yesterday brushed aside Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's demand that Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, if he stays on, be limited to a one-year term and meet specific performance goals.
The board president, Carol A. Gresser, said the Mayor, who had backed down from his opposition to a contract renewal for Mr. Cortines, was in no position to dictate conditions. She said she would urge the board, which has sole legal authority to hire and fire chancellors, to offer a two-year contract, at least. And although Mr. Giuliani outlined "worthy suggestions" for budget and administrative reforms, she said, the board and Mr. Cortines had developed similar initiatives on their own. 
 Mr. Cortines, 63, declined to comment on the contract dispute yesterday morning and spent the day in Washington pursuing a $15 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The Chancellor, who has served for 15 months, has not said whether he will accept a contract extension, but his aides said that they expect a decision before Friday.
In endorsing an extension of Mr. Cortines's tenure, the Mayor abandoned an effort to pressure Mr. Cortines into leaving the chancellorship when his contract expires in June. But the Mayor kept up his criticism yesterday, and expressed continuing irritation with the board's support for Mr. Cortines.
"If we can't do a better job with $8 billion than the board or the Chancellor are doing, then they have to turn the movement of that money over to someone else," he said. "The Chancellor is largely held unaccountable, and what the board apparently wants to do is to continue that."
Mrs. Gresser's statements of independence, which were echoed or stated even more energetically by four other representatives on the seven-member board, underlined their sense of confidence that they and Mr. Cortines had prevailed in their latest confrontation with the Mayor, at least for now. Mrs. Gresser and other board members also said they hoped more respectful mutual relations might result from their bruising confrontation.
"We need a working relationship with City Hall," she said. "That's something that I'd like to build, not just on City Hall's terms and not just on the board's terms, but on terms agreeable to both. City Hall is the seat of this city's government and we are the city's school district. We need each other desperately."
Mr. Giuliani's turnabout prompted other reactions yesterday ranging from suspicion to bewilderment. "This was a clever change in tactics in City Hall's vigorous spin-control war," said John Beckman, the spokesman for the Board of Education. "But there was no real change in substance. City Hall is not offering a compromise, they're making a demand dressed up as a compromise."
One board member said he was confused. "The Mayor spent the last week beating the hell out of everybody, us included," the member said. "You get beat up, you're part of the problem, and then suddenly his story is: 'I'd like to make a peace offering -- but I'm not going to talk to you about it.' "
Mrs. Gresser said she heard about Mr. Giuliani's call for a compromise late Sunday from a reporter. Neither the Mayor nor any of his aides ever spoke to her directly during the recent dispute, she said. The last time that she talked face to face with Mr. Giuliani, she said, was at a party on Dec. 4.
Mrs. Gresser and her four board colleagues appeared in a joint news conference with the city's five borough presidents, all of whom urged an extension of Mr. Cortines's contract. Their appearance was scheduled last week.
Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, criticized the Mayor's call for limiting Mr. Cortines's extension.
"It is my own belief that a one-year contract is insufficient, and that, next year, we will once again witness the same jockeying and political posturing that is simply not good for our city or its schoolchildren," he said.
The general tenor of the Borough Presidents' remarks was to praise the Chancellor and to support the board's independence. But Howard Golden of Brooklyn and Claire Shulman of Queens both called on the board to take seriously Mr. Giuliani's ideas and to seek a closer working relationship with him.
"I'm here to support Chancellor Cortines," Ms. Shulman said. "But I also believe the Mayor is a good mayor. I think we ought to give the Mayor the benefit of the doubt in his attempts to get a handle on the board's budget."
Mr. Giuliani, acknowledging that his two representatives on the board, Ninfa Segarra and Irene Impellizzeri, were likely to be outvoted when the contract comes to a vote, scheduled for tomorrow, said the contract should be tied to the condition that Mr. Cortines show measurable progress in four areas of management and budgeting.
City Hall has a stake in the budget process because it supplies about 40 percent of the board's $8.4 billion annual budget, but the Board of Education has the power to allocate the funds. But in two recent rounds of budget cuts, made to meet a city budget deficit this year, the Mayor has demanded specific personnel reductions, which the board is close to meeting.
Mr. Giuliani said any new contract ought to require Mr. Cortines to establish a school-based budgeting system in which each of the city's 1,100 schools would be required to draw up their own budgets, to develop a less confusing budget system, to make further reductions in the number of administrators working at the board and to overhaul the special education system, which serves 130,000 of the city's one million schoolchildren.
Mr. Giuliani said that his representatives would seek to insert language into the Chancellor's contract reflecting those four points, but Mrs. Gresser said neither Ms. Segarra nor Dr. Impellizzeri had made any such request.
The board has been carrying out a formal review of Mr. Cortines's work and future agenda. Mrs. Gresser and other members argued that the four points on which Mr. Giuliani wanted the contract to be made conditional were all initiatives that the board had already, on its own, discussed with the Chancellor. Last week, for instance, Mr. Cortines appointed a commission to develop specific proposals for reforming the special education system, she said.
And the Chancellor has also outlined specific plans for making school budgets easier for taxpayers to understand and to reduce further the number of administrators at board headquarters. To date, Mr. Cortines has eliminated 1,400 of the board's 6,300 headquarters employees, and he has pledged to eliminate another 800 employees by June, Mr. Beckman said.
Board members did not specifically respond to Mr. Giuliani's call for the establishment of school-based budgeting, an innovation that would, for accounting purposes, allocate all of the board's $8.4 billion budget, including money spent on board administration, debt service and other centralized functions, to the city's 1,100 schools. That would allow parents and taxpayers to have a clearer view of how their education tax dollars are spent.


GRAPHIC: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's four conditions for renewing the contract of Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines reflect an agenda that both men generally share. These are the Mayor's conditions and a report on the Chancellor's progress in each area:
 
A BUDGET FOR EVERY SCHOOL
 
Mayor's Condition: Last summer, Edward N. Costikyan, whom the Mayor appointed to explore ways of improving school governance, recommended that the Board of Education's budget be drafted and allocated to show how much of the Board's $8 billion budget is being spent on each of the system's 1,100 schools. Mr. Giuliani wants the Chancellor to move "aggressively" to do this and estimates it would take a year.
 
Chancellor's Progress: Mr. Cortines has committed himself to imposing a "transparent budget" within two years, one so clear that the average taxpayer will be able to tell where every dollar was spent.
 
SPECIAL EDUCATION
 
Mayor's Condition: Educating the city's 130,000 students diagnosed as having some disability is expensive -- the 13 percent of the system's students account for 25 percent of spending. But Mr. Giuliani has called for a reduction of the disparity between spending on special education students and those in regular classes.
Chart: "POINT BY POINT: What the Mayor Wants"
Herman Badillo, whom the Mayor named to monitor school spending, says the Chancellor can impose some economies. Mr. Costikyan says it is mostly City Hall's burden to seek more leeway from the Federal judge who approved a consent decree that specifies what services the schools must provide.
 
Chancellor's Progress: Last May, Mr. Cortines postponed a promised reorganization that would have, among other things, transferred control of nearly 3,000 special education employees from the central board to school principals. In October, he said he would appoint a panel to review the system; last week, he named two committees to set academic standards and to restructure delivery of special education services.
 
COST OF THE BUREAUCRACY
 
Mayor's Condition: The Mayor wants the Chancellor to clearly identify administrative costs. Nobody disagrees with the goal, only with what constitutes an administrator. In October, an audit commissioned by Mr. Badillo found that central and district operations consumed 9.95-cents of every school budget dollar. That estimate was revised last month to 3.75 cents.
 
Chancellor's Progress: Nobody disagrees with the goal, only with what constitutes an administrator.
 
CUT MIDDLE MANAGEMENT
 
Mayor's Condition: Mr. Giuliani demanded that 2,500 "bureaucrats" be pared from the Board of Education payroll. Mr. Cortines "has done some," Mr. Badillo acknowledges, "but until we get a total breakdown we don't know how much."
 
Chancellor's Progress: Mr. Cortines has cut 1,400 employees at the central headquarters and 700 more will be cut, nearly the target Mr. Giuliani had originally set.

HEADLINE: Wall St.'s Rescue Squads Also Turn A Tidy Profit

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The investment-fund disaster in Orange County, Calif., is shining a spotlight on a little-noticed corner of brokerage firms' trading floors: the investment rescue desk.
It is there that financial instruments that have gone sour can be repackaged as something sweet enough for a bank, mutual fund or other investor to want to buy. 
 Because they have these rescue operations, Wall Street firms are clamoring to buy the Orange County portfolio, which is still laced with risky securities whose value will continue to plummet as interest rates rise. But if the firms can buy the debt at a nice discount, they can restructure it and sell it at a tidy profit.
Every major brokerage firm and many large banks have a handful of traders who specialize in such financial rescue. The larger firms involved include Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Sachs, Bankers Trust, Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan.
While the maneuvers involved in such a rescue operation may sound complex, they actually have become fairly routine. The rescuers are usually junior traders.
Brokers say the business of swapping assets, which is what the rescue desks do, is up slightly this year even as most other bond business has fallen off sharply. Many of the deals this year have involved buying up volatile bonds, similar to those owned by Orange County, that have fallen sharply as interest rates rise.
Orange County said last week that it would sell the remaining $5.4 billion of assets in its portfolio and Salomon Brothers, the county's adviser, began auctioning it off last week. The losses on the portfolio have already topped $2 billion and forced the county into bankruptcy.
Both Orange County's problem and Wall Street's solution relate to the controversial and rapidly growing market for derivatives, a wide range of financial transactions that are custom-designed for an investor.
Orange County's problems involved, among other things, investments in notes on which the interest rate payment the county earned increased as market interest rates fell, and vice versa. That made the notes twice as profitable as regular bonds if short-term interest rates declined. But they were doubly vulnerable if they rose, because both the price of the notes and the interest they paid would fall. The county bought most of the notes from Government-sponsored agencies, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association.
To neutralize such notes and limit their risk, the rescue desk uses what are known as interest-rate swaps. Swaps, the most common form of derivative, were invented 15 years ago to let companies that borrowed money at fixed interest rates switch to a floating interest rate, or vice versa.
The rescue desk can combine Orange County notes with a swap to form a more attractive, less volatile investment.
Investors buying the two-part package will get a note with the strong credit of a Government agency at a yield that is slightly higher than they would otherwise receive for such an investment. The price of the note will still fall as interest rates rise, but the swap offsets this by paying a higher interest rate under those circumstances.
Depending on the terms used, the Orange County note in combination with the swap could now perform as if it were a Treasury note, with a fixed interest rate paid to the new owner and the price of the note moving in the direction opposite that of market interest rates. Or it could be a note with a fixed principal and an interest payment that moves up and down with market rates.
None of the investors will get rich from these deals, which will earn perhaps one- or two-tenths of a percentage point more interest than normal notes.
But for the brokers, these are especially lucrative trades. Brokers make their normal markup selling bonds for slightly more than they paid for them and they make a second profit selling the swap. And that is why the salvage specialists on the rescue desk are always on the lookout for any kind of cheap bond or note that they can buy, transform and sell for a profit.
"We get two trades for the price of one," said a trading executive at a large bank that is eager to buy some of the ill-fated Orange County paper.

HEADLINE: Peasants Block Roads in Troubled South Mexican State

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Peasants who said they were part of a mobilization ordered by the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army blocked several highways in the southern state of Chiapas today and took over the town hall in at least one community outside the zone that the rebels have held for almost a year.
But no shots were reported, and Government officials insisted that the actions were a civil protest by peasants and Indians and not the resumption of the insurrection that began in Chiapas on Jan. 1. 
 It is not clear whether the peasants are members of the Zapatista army or sympathizers of the mostly Indian movement in Mexico's poorest state.
Rebel leaders who had been warning for the last two weeks that resumption of war was "imminent" said at a news conference that their forces now were present in 38 communities in Chiapas, but here, too, it is not clear whether they meant troops or supporters.
Many of the 38 communities are poor Indian settlements that have pledged their allegiance to a "government in rebellion" formed by the official loser in August's gubernatorial election.
The masked rebel leader called Subcommander Marcos told reporters this morning that he had ordered a troop mobilization as the first "military action" since the uprising began nearly a year ago. At the same time, he offered to honor a Government truce if the official Governor of Chiapas resigned.
The rebel leader rejected a recent plan by President Ernesto Zedillo to form a multiparty commission to negotiate a peace settlement, demanding instead that an existing panel headed by Bishop Samuel Ruiz of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas handle the negotiations.
In the last week, President Zedillo has sought to take the initiative away from the rebels in Chiapas by proposing a new peace commission including members of the opposition and by divulging details of offers he had sent to the rebels before taking office on Dec. 1.
The moves were intended to take advantage of growing public sentiment against the Zapatistas for their insistence on threatening to use violence to resolve longstanding problems of poverty and injustice suffered by Indians in Chiapas.
This afternoon, Governor Eduardo Robledo Rincon announced the formation of an economic development program for the state, in a move that also was intended to increase pressure on the rebels to negotiate in peace, advisers to Mr. Zedillo said.
But the rebel leaders repeated their demands for Mr. Robledo's resignation. Since he took office on Dec. 8, Chiapas has been stuck between the war threatened by the rebels and the peace promised by the Government.
Before dawn this morning, a group of peasants peacefully took over the town hall of Simojovel de Allende, about 30 miles northwest of San Cristobal de las Casas and outside the zone of conflict.
Witnesses reported that 50 to 150 peasants, some armed with shotguns and sticks, occupied the town hall without firing a shot.
Adelfo Gutierrez Velasco, a local official from Huitiupan, a small community near Simojovel, said armed men also showed up about a half-mile from his town this morning and said they were part of the Zapatista movement. The armed men handed out Zapatista literature and stopped buses, telling residents "to listen to the instructions about this movement."
Heriberto Velasco Castaneda, a state government spokesman, said the local police in Simojovel had offered no resistance. He said that there were no other reports of armed peasants today, and that tree trunks used to block several highways had been removed by early afternoon.
This morning's action resembles the initial offensive of the Zapatistas in the first few hours of Jan. 1, when they took over government buildings in four towns in Chiapas.
The rebels retained control of the towns for about two days before the Mexican Army mobilized to retake them. Officials estimate that 145 people were killed in the fighting, but human rights groups and the Catholic Church say the toll was much higher.
A cease-fire agreed to on Jan. 12 has so far been honored by both sides. Negotiations between the Government and the rebels in February resulted in a proposed settlement that was rejected by the rebels in June.

HEADLINE: Will Jesse Jackson Beat Queen in British Ratings? Stay Tuned

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, December 19

 BODY:
One of Britain's most familiar holiday rituals -- the annual Christmas Day television broadcast by Queen Elizabeth II -- will run up against some unexpected and, in some quarters, unwanted foreign competition next Sunday: a pre-recorded, nationwide lecture by the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the sorry state of British race relations.
At the same time the Queen is scheduled to appear delivering her Christmas Day homily, at 3 P.M. on Channel One and Channel Three, the American civil rights campaigner will be making his own 15-minute appearance on Channel Four, one of Britain's four nationwide broadcast television networks. 
 Billed by the station as an "alternative Queen's speech," Mr. Jackson is appearing at the invitation of station officials, who are promoting his appearance as part of a weeklong schedule of holiday programming devoted to minority affairs and entertainment, built around the theme of celebrating a "Black Christmas."
In The Times of London this morning, Mr. Jackson was quoted as saying he did not mean to undermine the Queen's annual Christmas message, nor did he intend her any disrespect, by agreeing to present his own holiday address.
But some British politicians are already steaming over the timing of the broadcast, and accounts in British newspapers in the last two days quoting excerpts from Mr. Jackson's remarks, including an appeal to blacks and other disadvantaged groups in Britain to engage in what was described as mass political action to bring about change.
"The lives of too many of our young people are going to waste," Mr. Jackson is quoted as saying. "The oppressed must engage in sane, sober, sensitive and disciplined resistance to their oppression."
Among other things, Mr. Jackson blames economic insecurity in Britain for breeding fear, which he says has contributed, in turn, to growing intolerance and racial violence, including several racially motivated killings.
Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, was quoted as dismissing Mr. Jackson's remarks, in an account in The Sunday Times. "We have nothing to learn from Mr. Jesse Jackson on these issues," he said. Sir Ivan Lawrence, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, was even sharper.
"It will be a broadcast surpassing impertinence by someone who doesn't have the faintest idea what he's talking about," Sir Ivan was quoted, in The Times. "He should look to his own country, where racial attacks occur far more frequently than they do in this country."
Earlier this year, Sir Ivan's committee issued a report on race relations in Britain, concluding that "racial attacks and harassment, and the spread of literature which preaches racial hatred, are increasing, and must be stopped."
A week later, Britain's Commission for Racial Equality issued another report saying that the number of racial incidents officially reported to the police have doubled in the last five years to 9,000, with a 20 percent increase last year alone.
Like the Queen's annual message, Mr. Jackson's remarks are also pre-recorded. A spokesman for Channel Four said he taped his remarks in Washington within the last two weeks.
This is the second year that Channel Four has promoted its own alternative to the Queen's speech. Last year, as part of a "Camp Christmas" theme, they broadcast an appearance by Quentin Crisp, an outspoken British homosexual.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Natural Gas Takes a Tumble On Mild Weather Forecasts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Natural gas futures prices tumbled yesterday as mild winter weather forecasts deflated expectations for a seasonal surge in heating-fuel demand.
Heating oil prices also sagged, dragging crude oil lower. Elsewhere, orange juice and wheat futures rose sharply, while corn and soybeans declined. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.21 point, to 231.85. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas for January delivery plunged 10.8 cents, or 6 percent, to $1.577 for 1,000 cubic feet, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Oct. 20.
Last week, the National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperatures this winter in the densely populated Midwest and Northeast, the key regions for heating-fuel demand. The weather in both regions has been unseasonably mild this autumn.
A forecast released after the close of trading yesterday for above-normal to much-above-normal temperatures in most of the United States through Dec. 29 reinforced expectations for light demand.
United States natural gas in storage was at 90 percent of capacity Dec. 7, about 10 percent above last year's level, the American Gas Association reported last week.
"The market's falling like a rock in a pond," said Tom Curtis, director of energy research for Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. "You have basically very high levels of supply and very little demand."
In other energy trading, the January crude oil contract, which expired yesterday, rose 15 cents, to $16.91 a barrel. January wholesale home heating oil fell 0.60 cent, to 47.86 cents a gallon, and January wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.13 cent, to 51.42 cents a gallon.
Orange juice prices surged on the news that Brazilian processers had raised their prices to customers in the United States to $1.40 from $1.30. January deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice rose 4.85 cents, to $1.195 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange
Wheat prices reached a five-week high on the Chicago Board of Trade on persistent rumors of Chinese buying interest.
Early in the session, March wheat touched $4 a bushel for the first time since Nov. 11 as talk circulated that China was interested in buying as much as one million metric tons of United States wheat. Profit taking cut the gain before the close. March wheat ended 3.5 cents higher at $3.9625 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits 8-Month High Against Lira in Italian Crisis

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar hit an eight-month high against the Italian lira yesterday as confidence eroded that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Government would survive.
The dollar was otherwise little changed against other leading currencies in light trading. Dealers sat on the sidelines ahead of a meeting today of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. 
 Investors have dumped the lira in favor of the German mark and the dollar in recent weeks as Mr. Berlusconi's coalition Government slowly unravels. Mr. Berlusconi faces a confidence vote in Parliament tomorrow, an effort led by an important member of his coalition.
"If Berlusconi is pushed out, the political picture becomes very unclear and that's not good for the country's currency," said Tom O'Malley, foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1,645.50 lire from 1,638 on Friday. The last time the dollar traded that high against the lira was in mid-April.
The lira also fell to a record low against the German mark, trading at 1,048.01 lire to the mark before settling at 1041.09.
In other currency trading, most market participants were waiting to see what would happen to interest rates.
Most participants expect the Fed to postpone another increase in short-term interest until its next meeting in late January, yet participants were not betting on the Fed action.
"People are just prepared to wait and see what the Fed will do, but no one wanted to bet any money on it," said Chris Iggo, foreign exchange specialist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Higher interest rates create demand for the currency because higher rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
With many participants out this week for the Christmas holiday and no economic news yesterday to influence trading, activity was light and the dollar exchanged hands in tight ranges against the yen and most European currencies.
In New York , the dollar slipped to 1.5730 marks, from 1.5737 on Friday.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL: A Freshman Light at Colgate;
Just Another Basketball Star, Foyle Reads Faulkner for Pleasure and Writes Poems

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FREY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAMILTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Adonal Foyle had not heard of Michael Jordan when Jay and Joan Mandle approached him one summer afternoon and offered him a future he had never dreamed of. He did not know about the National Basketball Association. He did not know Magic Johnson from Larry Bird from Julius Erving.
He was 16 years old, and he had first set eyes on a basketball less than 12 months before that eventful meeting, which took place on the island of Dominica in the Caribbean. At the time, Foyle was a raw basketball talent, a 6-foot-9-inch, 240-pound kid with breathtaking athleticism and an underdeveloped sense of the game. 
 "They told me that if I came to the United States, I could get an education by playing basketball," Foyle said. "I was stunned. I wanted to know what I had done so spectacular to deserve this."
The Mandles, professors at Colgate University, gave him that chance by offering to become his legal guardians. They did not intend to groom Foyle to be the savior of the basketball program at tiny Colgate, a school that has had just four winning seasons in the past two decades. They thought he would accept a scholarship to a major program, play in the big leagues, and aim for the N.B.A. But Foyle surprised them.
Recruited heavily by Duke and Syracuse, Foyle chose to recruit Colgate, a school that he felt suited his academic interests. A poet and budding actor who earned honors grades in high school and who reads William Faulkner for pleasure, Foyle decided he wanted to play at a school where the pressure to win did not supersede everything else in his life.
"People were saying that Duke was the school for me and Syracuse was the school for me, and I was shocked," said Foyle, who attends Colgate on a need-based scholarship. "It's confusing to me, this idea that the decision has to be based on what's best for my basketball life. I still want to play in the N.B.A., but isn't this supposed to be about education and what's best for me as a whole?"
Foyle has revitalized the Colgate basketball program and captured the fancy of both the campus and the town. When freshmen were asked to fill out their housing request forms, more than 70 percent of the male enrollees requested Foyle as their roommate. He is a hero to the children in town, and served as the show-and-tell item for "big and small" day at a local kindergarten.
To showcase Foyle's talents, the Red Raiders scheduled early-season games against difficult teams, like Syracuse, Stanford and Maryland, and were invited to participate in the ECAC Holiday Festival, which will be played at Madison Square Garden next week.
Now 6-10 and 260 pounds, Foyle has developed into an an all-round player with a quickness and agility rare for a player his size. After the first seven games of his freshman season, he is averaging 14 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocks as the Red Raiders (1-6) have struggled to find ways to get Foyle the ball.
It is an awkward situation for a player who has already been compared to a young Karl Malone. But he still does not question his college choice or that he is playing out of the limelight.
"You have to understand Adonal," said Jack Bruen, the Colgate coach, who broke out a bottle of champagne when Foyle committed to his program, which does not award athletic scholarships. "Kids who grow up in American basketball, they understand what TV is all about, what commercialism is all about. That's not important to Adonal. It's just not a factor."
There is no basketball culture on the island of Canouan, one of the smallest of the islands that make up the Grenadines. Foyle was raised there by his grandmother, Faith, and his great aunt, Isla. Just as the other 700 or so inhabitants, they had no electricity and, consequently, no television. Children were raised on track and soccer and a game called "net ball" that consisted of a tall pole with a loose net that swung freely from a string.
Having exhausted a limited educational system by age 15, Foyle moved to neighboring Union Island (population 2,000) to live with his mother. He had been there a few days when he was approached by another teen-ager who barely came up to Foyle's waist.
"You, hey you," he said, jabbing Foyle, who already stood 6-9, in the stomach. "You have to play basketball. You're tall."
Foyle had almost no idea what he was talking about.
"He taught me how to rebound and block shots and then pass the ball up to him -- that's all," said Foyle, laughing at the memory. "He kept scoring, and I noticed that everybody seemed to get excited about scoring, not rebounding or blocking shots. And I figured, 'Hey, I'm not chopped liver, I want to score, too.' So the next time I rebounded the ball, I ran down the court and tried to dunk. Everybody just stood there staring at me like I was nuts."
Foyle had forgotten to dribble. Actually, he hadn't realized that he was supposed to dribble. It was not something he had been taught.
"Humiliating," Foyle said. "I never wanted to play again."
He learned to play at night, to minimize his embarrassment. And, within a year, he was invited to play in a tournament in Dominica with an island club team. It was there that he was spotted by the Mandles.
"He was not a terrific basketball player -- when we look at the tape now, he looks skinny and he wasn't the best player, not by far," said Jay Mandle, who is an economics professor. "It was his athleticism that caught our attention."
Foyle first moved to Philadelphia, where he took his first ride in an elevator, attended an Eagle game -- "I had never seen that many people," said Foyle -- and became the centerpiece of the basketball program at Cardinal O'Hara High School. After one year, he chose to move to tiny Hamilton, N.Y., and live with the Mandles, who helped prepare him for applying to college and encouraged his academic interests.
Last Friday night, the Mandles were in the stands when Colgate opened the home season with the team's first victory, against Harvard. Foyle calls them mom and dad now, and they acted like proud parents. Joan, Colgate's director of women's studies, videotaped the game from her seat. At 2,863, the crowd at Cotterell Court was the largest home crowd in 20 years. The fans cheered for everyone, but especially for Foyle, who cannot walk across campus without students yelling his name.
"He has a charisma about him," Bruen said. "Already you can see he is going to be a star. I don't think anyone has any doubt about that."

HEADLINE: SOCCER REPORT

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS 

 BODY:
United States
It appears very strongly that Bora Milutinovic, who piloted the Americans through the second round of the World Cup last summer, will be the coach of the United States for the 1998 World Cup as well. 
 Reliable sources in the United States Soccer Federation have said that Milutinovic has made a verbal agreement with Alan Rothenberg, the federation president, and an official announcement will be made in the near future.
Timo Liekoski, Milutinovic's top assistant for the last two years, was given an additional task yesterday by Hank Steinbrecher, the executive director and secretary general of the U.S.S.F.
Besides his duties as the coach of the United States Olympic team, Liekoski was named director of coaching and player development for the U.S.S.F. He replaces Bob Gansler, who coached the Americans in the 1990 World Cup in Italy.
 
European Championship
 Although Germany came up with a 2-1 victory over Albania at home in one of three games for the European Championship played on Sunday, the Germans' performance was far below the standard of a world class team.
"That's like a defeat for us Germans," midfielder Matthias Sammer told The Associated Press after the game, which was staged at Kaiserslautern.
Coach Berti Voghts, who has piloted Germany since Franz Beckenbauer resigned after the World Cup triumph in 1990, said: "I didn't like it at all. For some reason, the players tightened up."
Lothar Mattaeus and Juergen Klinsmann, two of the team's harshest critics, scored the goals that helped the Germans tie for the lead in Group 7 with Bulgaria, the team that eliminated Germany in the quarterfinals of the World Cup last summer at Giants Stadium.
In Group 6, Portugal opened a three-point lead in the standing after scoring eight goals, including three in a three-minute span, in an 8-0 thrashing of Liechtenstein in Lisbon.
A goal from the penalty spot by defender Stratos Apostolakis gave Greece a 1-0 triumph over Scotland in Athens. The victory was the fourth in a row for the Greeks, who are making some progress after finishing last in the World Cup last summer.
 
Italy
 All games in the Italian League were delayed for 45 minutes on Sunday by a players' protest. The union staged the demonstrations in an effort to gain $5.6 million from league owners for unemployed players and coaches.
When the games were over, Parma was back in first place after a 2-1 triumph at Bari, and a 1-1 tie between Juventus and Genoa in Turin dropped Juventus to second place. Juventus got a goal from Fabrizio Ravanelli in the 74th minute and was a minute away from victory when Fabio Galante scored on a header for Genoa.
Massimo Crippa scored the winner for Parma with 13 minutes left after Gianfranco Zola had put Parma ahead and Sandro Tovalieri tied it for Bari.
Gabriel Batistuta's league-leading 14th goal at Florence salvaged a 1-1 tie with Fogia for third-place Fiorentina.
Lazio of Rome posted a 2-0 victory over Inter at Milan on goals by Roberto Cravero and Diego Fuser, while Roma played a scoreless deadlock with three-time defending champion AC Milan at Rome's Olympic stadium.
Milan is in ninth place and has apparently made a mistake letting Ruud Gullitt get away. Gullitt had two more goals for Sampdoria in a 5-0 triumph over Cagliari at Genoa.
 
The Netherlands
 Dick Advocaat, who coached the Dutch to the quarterfinals in the World Cup last summer, will leave the national team on Jan. 1 to take the job as coach of PSV Eindhoven.
The Dutch federation (KNVB) said that Advocaat's job on the national team would be taken by Guus Hiddink, who has signed a contract through the European Championship finals, which will be staged in England in 1996.
The 47-year-old Advocaat, who played for the Chicago Sting in the long-defunct North American Soccer League, has shouldered the task of reviving the glory days that Eindhoven enjoyed as the European champion a decade ago. ALEX YANNIS

HEADLINE: Harsh Wind From Beijing

 BODY:
It is extraordinary and more than a little alarming. The world's most populous country, a nuclear power with a booming, internationalized economy, is frozen into hard-line immobility on a wide range of policies because its nonagenarian supreme leader lies dying and those beneath him fear jeopardizing their own political futures by appearing too flexible.
Some of the effects of this succession crisis are now being felt throughout the world. But the primary and most brutal effects are felt in China itself. Crucial reforms of state industry have been postponed repeatedly. Arbitrary challenges and revisions have left foreign investors questioning the reliability of their contracts. Most recently, human rights and democracy activists have been subjected to a new round of repression that is ferocious even by China's harsh standards. 
 Last week, nine defendants drew cruelly excessive sentences for distributing four articles on human and workers' rights. One man was condemned to an incredible 20 years' imprisonment, seven years more than was imposed on the alleged masterminds of the Tiananmen Square movement.
These sentences form part of a pattern that includes the re-arrest last spring of China's most famous democrat, Wei Jingsheng; the six-year sentence imposed last month on an internationally respected journalist, Gao Yu, and the menacing harassment of a former student leader, Wang Dan.
The roots of this crackdown are domestic, but its severity reflects Beijing's perception that it can now ignore international human rights pressure. The trial that brought last week's sentences had twice before been postponed: in 1993 when China was seeking the 2000 Olympics, and last spring when President Clinton was weighing extension of China's low-tariff access to the U.S. market. Turning down that Olympic bid and extending trade access without human rights conditions reduced the outside world's leverage.
Despite President Clinton's conciliatory policies, the U.S. too has felt the new chill from Beijing. Washington's favorable tariff decision brought no honeymoon but a fresh burst of Chinese threats. Beijing warned it would retaliate if the U.S. persisted in holding China to reasonable standards for joining the new World Trade Organization, and in demanding that it crack down on copyright piracy.
Meanwhile, as the U.S. hastens to re-establish military cooperation, Beijing has escalated its rhetoric over a minor naval surveillance incident earlier this year.
Given this present touchiness, Washington needs to avoid gratuitous provocation. But it cannot avoid asserting legitimate U.S. interests from trade to security to human rights.
Republicans who have criticized the Clinton Administration's overly accommodating China policies will soon hold key committee chairs. The Administration, which is considering sending either Vice President Gore or Hillary Rodham Clinton to Beijing next year, would be wise to consult first with Republicans and seek bipartisan agreement on how to stand up to today's Chinese bullying without wrecking a valuable long-term relationship.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Missing at The White House

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Russell Baker is on vacation.

 BODY:
The three men, New Yorkers of the center-right, had voted for Bill Clinton.
"Do you think he can be salvaged?" one of them asked. 
 "What for?" another said. "To do what?" There was a silence then, a long invisible shrug.
That was after Bill Clinton surrendered. The Republicans trounced him on Election Day but the surrender came nine days later, when he had had plenty of time to think about what to say. Essentially what he said after all that cogitation was that the Comeback Kid was again the Turnaround Kid.
The President of a country where children shoot children, where drugs are on the rise again, where workers have not had a real raise in 20 years, where skilled mechanics can find themselves flipping hamburgers part time, decided that the best thing he could do for his country was to pick up political crumbs from the Republican table by handing out a few tax cuts.
Some of the better brains around him thought it was exactly the wrong thing to do; never mind. Never mind that he had promised to devote himself to fighting the deficit that loads Americans down with billions in interest payments. Never mind that tax reduction could lead to inflation, which would take from the American pocket a lot more than tax reduction would put in.
Mr. Clinton knew what he was doing was economically risky and ran against the heart of his preaching. The proof is that although he had mentioned a "middle-class" tax cut during the 1991 campaign, he did not move until he decided it might appease all those angry voters.
Don't politicians appease all the time? Maybe -- but when Presidents take the turnaround trail they gamble with the public's trust. And this President does not seem to understand that he has already squandered any public assumption of his constancy; no free turnarounds left.
Constancy is not simply consistency. Nobody expects a President to follow a narrow path every day, never looking down to dodge a hole.
But constancy -- you know it when you get it. Steadfastness, faithfulness to purpose and promise, no ducking, no turnarounds, no who-me? no playing around with word and intent.
President Clinton began the journey from constancy soon after inauguration. Do you understand exactly what his legal policy toward homosexuals in the armed forces is, or is not? On Bosnia, he is unpredictable from day to day; in wartime, Presidential unpredictability can cost lives. Now, almost offhand, he lets us know that he may do what he swore he would never ever do -- send combat troops into Bosnia.
He did well on Haiti in the end -- after he had backed and forthed miserably on Haitian refugees. But Cubans now are locked in tropical detention camps for being naive enough to think that it was still heroism, not a crime, to flee dictatorship.
Human rights as an instrument of foreign policy -- candidate Clinton said that would be fundamental to his Presidency. Into the can with that, right there with his promise to pressure Beijing for human decencies for Chinese and Tibetans. So long, suckers, hello Deng baby.
But still -- there's shock when a President whirls around, to get Chinese contracts, or a scrap from the new Republican platform. But I would hate for us to become so cynical about a President that we would not feel pain when he was not true to his promises and premises.
Mr. Clinton gathers his team on TV to present tax cuts as a sudden part of "rethinking" government. If he ever says he is dropping out of the race, millions of Americans who voted for him would be relieved and start candidate-shopping at once, no tears. But I doubt he would or should do that. Politics can turn around fast; see Thomas Dewey Bush.
I vote candidate, not party -- Republican or Democrat, President to State Assemblyman. On the Presidency, I dearly would love to vote for somebody twice in a row.
But I know if tax cuts ever become my major political motivation, there is a long list of interesting Republicans who will give me more than the Turnaround Kid, and I might as well vote for the real stuff.
I just looked up something tickling my mind and found that a poet did give fair warning about 350 years ago -- love me not for comely grace, nor for a constant heart. Maybe that goes for Presidents too, but it is very sad to think so.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Government Securities Hold Steady

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of government securities were little changed yesterday, holding to very narrow trading ranges ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making committee.
The 30-year bond rose 4/32 , to a price of 964/32 for a yield 7.84 percent, down from 7.85 percent on Friday. In the shorter-maturity bill market, rates were up a few basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Traders said that President Clinton's news conference yesterday concerning plans to cut $24 billion in spending from the Federal budget to help pay for the middle-class tax cut had little impact on the bond market.
Many dealers and traders do not expect the Fed to raise its short-term interest rate target today, which would be the central bank's seventh increase this year. The Fed last raised interest rates at its Nov. 15 meeting, when it increased the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent. It also raised the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges on loans to member banks, to 4.75 percent from 4 percent.
Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said he thinks that many investors have become less worried about inflation. And this fact, he said, "should give the Fed an avenue to avoid raising rates at this meeting and passing it off until the meeting in January.
"While the inflation numbers were a little higher this month," he added, "they weren't that much higher than the previous months."
But while Mr. Chan thinks the Fed will not act today, the rise in short-term interest rates recently shows that investors and traders still expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the beginning of next year.
The spread between the yield on the six-month Treasury bill and the yield on the 30-year bond narrowed to 154 basis points yesterday, down from 284 basis points a month ago. The yield on the six-month bill moved to 6.66 percent yesterday from 5.73 percent, while the yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 7.84 percent from 8.62 percent, a decline that Mr. Chan says shows growing confidence in the Fed's ability to contain inflation.
Today the Treasury is selling $17.25 billion of new two-year notes and tomorrow, $11 billion of five-year notes. Yesterday in when-issued trading the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.62 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 7.76 percent.
Also little changed were the prices of municipal securities amid growing concern by dealers and traders that selling by bond funds may increase following a resumption of investor redemptions. Money managers say investors have been withdrawing money from bond funds in the wake of the bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif.
With most bonds unchanged, Bloomberg Business News reported that the 5 percent California revenue anticipation notes due in 1995 were among the actively quoted securities, unchanged at a price to yield 4.85 percent.
Traders said they do not expect too much of a decline in prices because few issues are scheduled to be sold before the Christmas holiday.
At the regular weekly auction of new bills yesterday, the average rate on a new three-month issues was down 17 basis points, to 5.59 percent, while a six-month maturity was down two basis points, to 6.30 percent. Both were down to their lowest level in nearly a month.
The following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions:
 
 3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo. Bills Average Price<Y<98.587 96.815 Discounted Rate 5.59% 6.30% Coupon Yield 5.75% 6.60% High Price 98.592 96.830 Discounted Rate 5.57% 6.27% Coupon Yield 5.73% 6.57% Low Price 98.584 96.815 Discounted Rate 5.60% 6.30% Coupon Yield 5.76% 6.60% Accepted at low price 41% 61% Total applied for $45,274,797,000 $46,286,510,000 Accepted $13,068,076,000 $13,084,670,000 Noncompetitive $1,536,817,000 $1,288,094,000 Both issues are dated Dec. 22, 1994.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened In October

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The American economy pulled in a record amount of imported goods in October as the nation's trade deficit with Japan soared to a new peak of $6.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported today.
Over all, the gap between what this country buys abroad and what it sells abroad widened to $10.14 billion for the month, an increase from the September total that was revised sharply downward. Initially the department had estimated a September deficit of $10.13 billion. 
 Despite some figures moving into record territory, analysts and currency markets took the report largely in stride, with the dollar steady even against the Japanese yen, before it drifted down a bit after the Federal Reserve adjourned a policy meeting without announcing another rise in short-term interest rates.
"When we grow rapidly, we bring in a large amount of imports," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. She called the $1.3 billion rise in the deficit with Japan largely a "bilateral manifestation" of the broad trend in which the strong United States economy is buying more foreign goods that its trading partners that have recovered more recently from recession.
Nor did most private analysts express much concern about the latest figures, which also included a narrowing of the trade deficits for July and August as well as for September.
They pointed to, among other things, the so-called J-curve effects of the dollar's 1994 weakness that should help shrink the deficit in 1995.
When the dollar, for example, depreciates against the yen, it makes Japanese goods more expensive for Americans and American goods more affordable for Japanese, thus setting in motion a tendency to reduce the trade imbalance by increasing American exports and lowering imports. But until this adjustment occurs, toward the bottom of the "J", the figures reflect high volumes of imports at high prices.
"Improvement will be throughout 1995," said Harald B. Malmgren, a trade consultant in Washington. "The squeeze going on in corporate Japan is really severe," he said, because the high yen makes exporting difficult.
But some dissented, including Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group that has often complained of limited American access to foreign markets. "The macro-economic explanations are getting a little thin," he said. And now that Japan has been building cars in this country for a decade -- and is now also manufacturing parts here -- record bilateral trade deficits suggest "some structural problem," Mr. Prestowitz said.
The Clinton Administration is seeking to resume talks that could lead to more sales in Japan of American automotive products.
The October deficit with Japan, surpassing the previous record of $6.4 billion in October 1986, brought the 10-month total to $53.9 billion, compared with $48.4 billion for the comparable period in 1993, the report today showed.
October is a big month for importing holiday merchandise, and the figures pertaining to individual countries are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
Last week Japan reported that its merchandise surplus with the United States surged in November to $5.17 billion from $4.78 billion in October and from $4.29 billion in November 1993.
In the aggregate, the report today also showed, imports of goods and services climbed $400 million, to a record $69.8 billion, the sixth consecutive advance.
Exports eased by a similar $400 million, to $59.7 billion, the second consecutive decline, mainly reflecting a sizable decline in deliveries of civilian aircraft and parts.
The nation's oil bill eased during October, apparently reflecting an unusually mild autumn. Imports of crude oil totaled $3.3 billion, down $600 million, as volume shrank by 39 million barrels from September, while prices were 20 cents a barrel less.
While the American deficit with Japan was widening, the deficit with Western Europe narrowed slightly during the month and the gap with China, a fast-growing trade presence, was about unchanged, at $3.5 billion, the Government found. For the first 10 months of the year, however, the deficit with Europe soared to $10.4 billion, from $800 million in the comparable period in 1993.
The deficit with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner, rose $300 million, to $1.6 billion, while the balance with Mexico swung to a deficit of $89 million from a surplus of $37 million.

Insurers Were Hit Hard in 1994, Report Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Claims from the Los Angeles earthquake in January, followed by declines in stock and bond prices, made 1994 a poor year for property and liability insurance companies.
According to a report released yesterday by the Insurance Information Institute and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, after-tax profits for property and liability insurers will fall to an estimated $7.2 billion this year from $19.3 billion in 1993. The profitability of insurers, which has been lower than the average for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index every year since 1986, remained low in 1994, with insurers earning a meager 3.9 percent return on capital, down from 10.6 percent in 1993. 
 Insurers' profits in 1995 are expected to improve modestly to more than $11 billion and a 7.5 percent return on equity, Peter Wade, an associate director at S.& P., said.
Keen competition among companies will prevent sharp increases in premiums, he said, noting that earnings improvements will be tied closely to cost-cutting within individual companies and the level of catastrophe losses.
Unfortunately for property insurers, catastrophe losses have been rising, as population growth and building construction in vulnerable areas have increased risks at the same time as the weather seems to have turned harsher.
Five of the six largest insurance catastrophes in the United States have occurred in the last five years, led by the $17 billion of losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the $9 billion of losses from the Los Angeles earthquake in January.
The Los Angeles earthquake accounted for most of the $13 billion of catastrophe losses in 1994, making it the second-worst year ever. The worst year was 1992, when catastrophe losses totaled $23 billion.
Because the property and liability insurance industry has long paid more in claims and expenses than it collects in premiums, it relies on earnings from investments to produce profits. In 1994, profits from capital gains in securities trades dropped to only $1.9 billion from $9.8 billion in 1993.
At the same time, the maturing of old bonds with high interest rates and the reinvestment into new lower-yielding securities caused a slight decline in investment earnings, primarily interest.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
For the third time in two months, shooting erupted near the White House today. This time a Park Police officer critically wounded a homeless man holding a hunting knife.
President Clinton, who was working in the Oval Office when the shooting occurred at 9 A.M., was not in danger, officials said, and witnesses said he was not the target of threats by the homeless man. 
 Witnesses said the man, identified as Marcelino Corniel, was angry because homeless people who had been sleeping in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, were being rousted early in the mornings by the Park Police.
The incident was the second shooting this week near the White House and the fourth violent incident there since September.
Mr. Corniel was in very critical condition tonight at George Washington Hospital after a second operation was performed at 9:30 P.M., said Merle Goldberg, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Earlier, he underwent six hours of surgery for extensive liver damage, she said.
Today some witnesses questioned whether Mr. Corniel had been the victim of a jittery security detail.
A videotape of the incident taken by a photographer for a satellite-news cooperative, Conus Television, showed Mr. Corniel being shot as he stood still holding the knife, in his left hand, pointed to the ground. The officer who fired the shots had just run to the scene, joining three other officers who, with guns drawn, had been facing down Mr. Corniel from 10 feet away.
The standoff developed after Mr. Corniel, waving his knife, had chased at least one officer across Pennsylvania Avenue. With dozens of tourists looking on, the three officers shouted at Mr. Corniel to drop the weapon. He refused, and he glanced over his left shoulder. As he turned to face the officers again, the fourth officer, whom the Park Police refused to identify, fired two shots. Mr. Corniel fell to the ground, wounded in the chest and leg.
Ms. Goldberg, the hospital spokeswoman, said one bullet had penetrated Mr. Corniel's right hand and chest and struck him in the back. The second bullet struck his right leg.
A spokeswoman at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Susan Lloyd, said prosecutors were considering charging Mr. Corniel with assaulting a Federal officer. Other officials said such a charge would be in connection with his chasing the officer across Pennsylvania Avenue.
A spokesman for the Park Police said the officer who shot Mr. Corniel had been put on administrative detail pending a review of the shooting.
Law-enforcement officials said prosecutors were also studying whether the officer was justified in using potentially deadly force.
Federal law-enforcement procedures allow officers to use guns only when their lives or the lives of others are threatened or if they face a threat of serious bodily harm.
Police officials asserted that the force was not excessive. "If somebody is brandishing a knife, it's justified to shoot him," said Maj. Robert Hines, a spokesman. "The officer feared for his safety. So he shot the man. This was a seasoned officer. I don't think he was too quick to fire."
Major Hines said the National Park Police, who guard the White House along with the Secret Service, had recently stepped up security.
But some witnesses wondered whether the shooting was a reflection of an overly security force that had been on edge since a small plane piloted by a drunken and unemployed man crashed under the President's bedroom window in September.
"There were more than enough police officers there to subdue him without shooting him," said Wade Varner, an antinuclear protester from Portland, Ore., who watched the shooting today from across Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Varner told reporters that Mr. Corniel had complained about how before tourists arrived each morning the Park Police woke up homeless people in the park by banging their clubs on signs erected by protesters.
Mr. Varner and other witnesses said Mr. Corniel, standing in the park this morning, began shouting profanities at an officer.
"He had been sitting quietly drinking coffee under a jacket when he stood up, grunted, threw off his jacket and ran in front of my stand," said Concepcion Picciotto, who said she had been holding a vigil in the park for 11 years. Mr. Corniel then chased an officer across the avenue to the sidewalk in front of the North Portico of the White House, she said.
"They could have subdued him with gas or something," she said. "He didn't have a gun."
The Associated Press reported today that relatives who filed a missing persons report on Marcelino Corniel on Aug. 26, 1994, notified the authorities that he was the man shot in front of the White House. The news agency also reported that the police in Culver City, Calif., said a man named Marcelino Comiel, also known as Marcelino Corniel, pleaded guilty to armed robbery in 1986 and was convicted in 1985 of assault with a deadly weapon. His date of birth was listed in police records as Aug. 17, 1961, the same date that the F.B.I. gave for the man shot today.
Tension between the police and the homeless has long been present in Lafayette Park. Ten years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the Government might ban overnight sleeping in the park without infringing on constitutional rights.
Mr. Corniel, described as a 33-year-old artist, started living in the park early in the summer, people who live there said. The homeless people said Mr. Corniel had burn scars on his hands and face and walked with a limp.

HEADLINE: Mexico Devalues the Peso, Dealing a Blow to Stocks

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The Mexican Government devalued the peso yesterday, presenting Americans who have been pouring millions of dollars into Mexico through stocks, bonds and mutual funds with a nasty surprise that essentially cut the value of their investments by about 15 percent.
Under the new exchange-rate policy announced early yesterday, the peso will be allowed to fall to 4.0 to the dollar before Mexico's central bank will intervene -- not far from its close yesterday of 3.9750. The previous intervention limit was slightly more than 3.46 pesos to the dollar. 
 For all the immediate pain, however, fund managers and investment advisers -- who have helped spur the boom in Mexican investing -- contended that the move would be positive in the long run. Indeed, it may provide opportunities for buyers now, they said.
"Let's put it in perspective," said John Boich, a portfolio manager with Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco. "Yesterday the peso was worth 29 cents; today it's worth 25 cents. The positive effects of the devaluation in terms of economic competitiveness overpower the short-term negative."
Though the Mexican stock market rallied a bit after the devaluation, shares of Mexican companies favored by Americans dropped sharply, as did mutual funds that are heavily weighted in Latin America. American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, which is probably owned by more Americans than any other Mexican stock, dropped in heavy trading more than 5 percent, or $2.50, to $46 a share. The Mexico Fund, a closed-end pool that trades on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped $1.75, to $25.875
The dozen stock funds that specialize in Latin American shares fell about 5 percent yesterday, leaving them down an average 5.2 percent this year, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund-tracking service in Chicago. Among the largest such funds, Merrill Lynch Latin America fell 4.7 percent, while Fidelity Latin America dropped 6.5 percent.
Funds that buy the debt of emerging markets were also hit, falling 1.6 percent yesterday, putting their losses for this year at almost 12 percent. The kind of debt that many of these funds hold, known as Brady bonds, fell to the lowest level in three years.
The losses come at a time when Americans have increasingly been venturing overseas in search of better returns than those available in the United States. Much of that money has flowed into Mexico, which has attracted the bulk of investment in Latin America.
Last year, Latin American funds zoomed more than 50 percent while those made up of United States stocks rose roughly 13 percent. As a result, the amount of money in Latin American equity funds multiplied -- quadrupling in the year ending on Sept. 30, 1994, to $4.4 billion, from $950 million a year earlier, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
"We think there are a lot of exciting opportunities down there -- you just need to think in a three- to-five-year time horizon," said Mark W. Headley, director of international investments at Litman/Gregory & Company in Orinda, Calif.
"Next year could be a banner year, so-so or downright dismal," he added. "But three years out, it will be one of the most attractive places to invest."
Mr. Boich of Montgomery Asset Management said he would probably start buying short-term Mexican Treasury notes, or cetes, which he expects to yield about 15 percent. He said he was confident that the Mexican Government would not devalue the peso again any time soon.
The devaluation of the peso came amid resumed tension in a southern state, Chiapas, and continuing pressure on the nation's financial system. Yesterday, the peasant rebels and their sympathizers in Chiapas again expanded the area of conflict, taking over town halls and blocking major highways, then vanishing.
Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche said the devaluation was needed to take pressure off the peso. "What we are doing is simply expanding the band to insure that the central bank has the sufficient flexibility to deal with the disturbances that have come forward in the Chiapas conflict," he said.
Speculation about a devaluation has been rampant since the election victory of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon on Aug. 21. The decision is a major reversal for him. Before taking office on Dec. 1, Mr. Zedillo argued that the exchange-rate fluctuation band did not require any changes despite political uncertainties and a growing trade deficit.

HEADLINE: New York Is Picked to Get Federal Development Zone

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton will designate part of upper Manhattan and the South Bronx -- including the area around Yankee Stadium -- as one of the first Federal Empowerment Zones, Congressional officials said today.
The officials said the Federal aid and tax breaks that would be provided through the zone would help the city in its efforts to keep the Yankees baseball team and provide a huge windfall for the team's owner, George Steinbrenner. 
 New York is one of six cities and three rural areas that will be awarded empowerment zones this week, officials said, bringing to fruition an idea in urban development that was first conceived during the Reagan Administration, when they were called enterprise zones.
Congressional staffers and others familiar with the program said the other urban zones would be in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago and Detroit, in addition to one that will include parts of Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. Administration officials, who plan to announce the grants on Wednesday along with other urban-aid grants, would not confirm that list today.
It was not clear where the three rural empowerment zones would be.
Under empowerment-zone legislation, cities with the zones will receive up to $100 million in block grants over two years for community development projects inside the zones. Rural empowerment zones will receive up to $40 million in block grants.
In addition, businesses in the zones will receive some tax incentives, chief among them a tax credit of up to 20 percent of the first $15,000 earned by any worker who lives in the zone.
"We're very happy," Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said in an interview on the New York One television channel. "It's going to bring $100 million into the economy."
Officials were not able to say today how much the Yankees could benefit. But they said it would be more attractive for the team to hire people who live within the zone, since doing so would make it eligible for a break in its corporate taxes.
In a telephone interview, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem, whose district will contain much of the zone, said: "We hope to be the flagship of the empowerment-zone fleet."
New York's zone will encompass much of West, Central and East Harlem, as well as Washington Heights and a predominantly industrial area in the Bronx that includes Yankee Stadium. It represents a victory for Mr. Rangel who, along with Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat from Chicago, managed to keep the idea of enterprise zones alive during the late 1980's and first years of this decade.
The zone's final configuration also represents a different kind of victory for Mr. Rangel, who turned back the attempt of the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, to have a larger slice of the Bronx included in the zone.
Mr. Ferrer sought to amend New York's application so that the zone would also cover Melrose and Mott Haven, two sections of the Bronx that are among the poorest regions in New York City. The Borough President argued that if the zone was going to give a tax break to the Yankees, one of the richest franchises in major league baseball, the zone ought to benefit these poverty-stricken neighborhoods as well.
But despite appeals to Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Democrat from the South Bronx, Mr. Ferrer was unable to have the zone map altered.
Mr. Rangel fought any change, since Federal law limited the zone's size to 200,000 people. Any increase in the number of people in the Bronx would therefore have meant a reduction in the number of people in Mr. Rangel's district who could be included in the zone.
Mr. Ferrer declined to comment on the award today, but Clint Roswell, his spokesman, said the Borough President was "deliriously happy."
The selection of the zones is the latest chapter in a saga that began during the Reagan Administration when a group of conservatives, including Jack Kemp, the Buffalo-area Republican Representative who later became HUD Secretary, and Stuart M. Butler, head of domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institute, argued for their adoption as a means to spur economic development in blighted inner city areas.
For years, the concept languished in Congress. Many Democrats viewed it with suspicion, asserting that it was a way for the Reagan and Bush administrations to justify cutbacks in programs to aid cities. Republicans, whose constituencies tend not to be based in cities, did not rally behind the program.
The idea was revived during the Bush Administration chiefly through the efforts of Mr. Rangel and Mr. Rostenkowski, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in his re-election bid in November.
When the empowerment-zone legislation was passed in 1993, Congress authorized the program to run for 10 years. But it has appropriated financing for only two years, leaving questions about the program's long-term viability in a climate of reduced Government spending.
After it took office, the Clinton Administration requested that cities and rural areas submit elaborate applications to compete for the zones. In the applications, cities and rural areas had to list what kinds of projects would be financed through the block grants and list how local residents would share in the planning and implementation of the zones.
Some students of the enterprise-zone concept say the detailed and complex application process spurred cities to undertake planning and community relations initiatives that will be beneficial even if they did not win an empowerment zone.
But such requirements have disappointed conservatives like Mr. Butler who say that Democrats have hijacked the original idea of enterprise zones and turned it into another micro-managed development program.
"This is more of a Model Cities throwback," said Mr. Butler, referring to a old Great Society program for the cities. "They will send Washington their plans, and Washington will see how well they do things that Washington wants them to do."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Unchanged But Soars vs. Devalued Peso

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against most leading currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rate unchanged. But the dollar soared against a devalued Mexican peso.
The Fed ended a policy meeting yesterday without announcing any change in interest rates. The decision was widely expected, dealers said, and therefore had little effect on the dollar. 
 Most analysts expect the central bank to nudge short-term rates higher when it meets again on Jan. 31, an expectation that should keep the dollar on a solid footing. The dollar tends to benefit from a widening in the gap between American and foreign short-term interest rates.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5698 German marks from 1.5730 marks on Monday. It edged up to 100.15 Japanese yen from 100.12 yen.
But the dollar rose sharply against the Mexican peso after the Mexican Government devalued its currency.
The decision was intended to calm markets that have been battered by investor fears over a rebellion in Chiapas state and other political and market uncertainties. The devaluation, which lowered the peso's value by about 15 percent, went against the advice of many financial analysts in Mexico and on Wall Street.
Currency traders quickly followed the devaluation's path. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 3.9750 pesos, from 3.4657 on Monday.
The devaluation, Mexico's first in seven years, came early in the day, after the peso hit the bottom of its trading band against the dollar -- a level where the central bank must either step in to defend it or let it slide. Under the devaluation, the upper limit of the exchange band within which the peso trades against the dollar would rise by 53 centavos. There are 100 centavos to a peso.
Official United States reaction to the move was more favorable than the market's. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Mexico's exchange-rate action would "support the healthy development of the Mexican economy."
In currency dealing elsewhere, the dollar rose to 1,647.50 Italian lire, up from 1,645.50 lire on Monday. Political troubles for Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Government have battered the lira's value.

Former Kidder Chief Named To Two Posts at Travelers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Michael A. Carpenter, who left in June as chief executive of Kidder, Peabody & Company and before that was a deal-maker for GE Capital, was named to senior positions at the Travelers Group yesterday.
In one of his new jobs, Mr. Carpenter, 48, will be responsible for the life and annuity businesses of Travelers Insurance, reporting to Robert I. Lipp, chief executive of all the Travelers Insurance businesses. 
 Mr. Carpenter was also named an executive vice president at the Travelers Group, where he will report to Sanford I. Weill, chairman, on business development and strategic planning.
The Travelers Group, based in Manhattan,is the parent company for Travelers Insurance; the Smith Barney securities firm; the Commercial Credit Corporation, a consumer loan company, and Primerica Financial Services, a network of agents, many of them part time, who sell term insurance.
Mr. Carpenter said he was not sure how his time would be divided between the two jobs. Although he has no experience operating an insurance company, he said he was familiar with the industry as a result of deals he arranged while at GE Capital, including the acquisition of the Employers Reinsurance Corporation of Overland Park, Kan., and a leveraged buyout of the John Alden Financial Corporation of Miami.
James Dimon, president of the Travelers Group, and Mr. Carpenter both said they expected the Travelers life insurance business to grow, but added that there had been no determination to begin buying other companies.
"There will be opportunities as the industry consolidates," Mr. Carpenter said, but he added that there were also opportunities to expand the existing network of sales agents and to sell insurance investments, such as annuities, through the Smith Barney network of securities brokers.
The appointment of Mr. Carpenter comes one day after the announcement that Robert W. Crispin had resigned as vice chairman of the Travelers Insurance Companies to become executive vice president at the UNUM Corporation, a leading disability insurance company based in Portland, Me. The life and annuity businesses had previously reported to Mr. Crispin, who was one of the most senior executives of Travelers Insurance to remain with the company since it was acquired in 1993 by Mr. Weill's firm, then known as Primerica.
At Kidder, Mr. Carpenter never succeeded in revitalizing the firm to meet the profit standards of other GE Capital subsidiaries. He resigned the Kidder job as rising interest rates caused big losses for the bond business at the same time the company discovered a bogus bond trading scheme that caused it to report $350 million of fictitious profits. GE Capital, a unit of the General Electric Company, recently announced plans to sell most of the Kidder firm to Paine Webber Inc.

HEADLINE: Iraq Hinders Arms Monitors, U.N. Panel Reports

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Setting the stage for a Security Council debate next month on easing sanctions against Iraq, the head of a commission monitoring the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction said today that Baghdad was falling "far short" in some areas.
Of particular concern are questions about existing biological weapons. These are difficult to answer because Iraq has been reluctant to provide information on past production. 
 Questions also remain about chemical weapons and the purpose of one radar installation that the commission has ordered destroyed. Most of the missing information concerns imports.
In a report to the Council, the commission head, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, said the monitoring system was at least provisionally functional. But he then listed enough problems to give ammunition to the United States and Britain, which want to hold Iraq accountable not only for technical compliance but also for demonstrations of good intent.
France, Russia, China and to some degree Spain want to begin releasing President Saddam Hussein from some of the sanctions that have crippled the Iraqi economy and held up payment of foreign debts.
Diplomats from several countries say it was Bush Administration's policy to build openings into the web of sanctions to allow President Hussein to be rewarded for steps showing cooperation with the Security Council. The Clinton Administration has been taking a harder line.
Today Russia and France were circulating a draft Security Council statement praising Iraq for its level of compliance while calling for an immediate "full and transparent accounting of its past programs" and of its current industrial programs that could have dual civilian and military use.
During closed-door Council consultations today, the United States and Britain strongly opposed even this step, diplomats said.
When information on imported components of Iraqi weapons is withheld -- and imports were critical to many programs -- the monitors press foreign governments for details about the sales. Gradually, they are building a dossier with which to confront the Iraqis.
"The commission has been provided with very important information from governments and also managed to put that information into a systematic and analytical framework," Mr. Ekeus said. "That has given us quite powerful tools and knowledge about Iraq's past programs, which demonstrate that Iraq has been far from open with regard to these programs."
Mr. Ekeus also hinted that if Iraq was allowed to sell oil under a resolution adopted in April 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf war, it would take some time to install controls over those sales so that Iraq would be obliged to use at least some earnings in ways defined by the Council.
In another matter, the United States informed the Security Council sanctions committee on Dec. 7 that it had evidence that Iraq was smuggling oil into the Persian Gulf, passing it off as Iranian.
Iran called the new allegations "a funny old story, which has no truth at all."

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid And G.O.P.: Deep Cuts, Selectively

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Republican leaders in Congress are planning a tough new approach that treats foreign aid much like welfare: as a multibillion-dollar handout that needs to be overhauled and cut.
In mapping strategy for the foreign aid budget, which is $13.7 billion this year, the Congressional Republicans want to focus on advancing the United States' national security and economic interests rather than what they say is an entitlement program for poor nations. Many of them talk about using their new majority to cut foreign aid by 15 to 20 percent. 
 The Republican lawmakers who will have the greatest influence on foreign aid suggest that assistance to Africa will be cut sharply, while aid to the Middle East and former Soviet bloc nations -- two areas viewed as vital to national security -- will be maintained at or near current levels.
These lawmakers say they intend to slash the $1 billion in annual aid to Africa because in their view African countries have little strategic importance and have grown dependent on aid without using the money to improve their economies.
"The only way to break the devastating cycle of dependency is to end foreign aid entitlement programs," said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who will be the new chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which oversees foreign aid. "If we're going to change welfare here at home, we certainly ought not to be using American tax dollars to foster that kind of dependency abroad."
Africa is not the only target of Republicans; they also aim to cut the $450 million in aid for population stabilization programs overseas as well as the American contribution to the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican whowill be chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said "American taxpayers are being gouged" by those development banks.
Republican lawmakers have proposed placing tighter strings on assistance and barring aid to countries unless their policies promote free markets, free trade and private property.
Clinton Administration officials have asserted that the Republicans' aid strategy takes a myopic view of the security interests of the United States and undercuts its leadership role and moral authority overseas.
"We cannot exercise influence over the international community in some rosier future if we abdicate responsibility now," said J. Brian Atwood, Administrator of the Agency for International Development, the Government's chief aid arm.
In part, the clash reflects a difference in philosophy, with Republicans viewing foreign aid primarily as a means of cementing strategic alliances, and the Administration focusing on the long-term benefits of combating poverty and environmental problems.
"My view is it ought to be directly targeted toward areas of the world where we have a clear national security interest," Mr. McConnell said.
Under this approach, he and other Republicans say aid -- including military assistance, which represents almost one-third of the aid budget -- should be continued to Israel, Egypt, Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia. To further the use of aid for strategic purposes, Mr. McConnell has proposed cutting off the $700 million in aid to Russia if it intervenes militarily in any other former Soviet republics.
Supporting the $3 billion in annual aid to Israel, Mr. Callahan said: "Aid to Israel is not an entitlement. Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East, and we ought to do everything we can to continue that relationship."
Mr. Atwood responded that while aid to strategic allies like Israel is vital, it is also valuable to provide money to the poorest countries in Africa and elsewhere to combat hunger, overpopulation and environmental degradation. He asserted that in the post-cold-war era, problems like those in Somalia and Rwanda are increasingly causing conflicts that ensnare the American military. In his view, such aid is not a handout, but preventive medicine.
Accusing many aid critics of being isolationists, he said, "If we don't deal with programs to help stop these countries from failing, we'll spend a lot more money in the aftermath dealing with their crises."
In defending foreign assistance, the Administration notes that after adjusting for inflation, the aid budget has slipped to its lowest level since World War II, and is down 20 percent from 1991. Officials add that the aid budget is less than 1 percent of the $1.6 trillion Federal budget, although in a recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Kaiser Family Foundation, 27 percent of those polled identified foreign aid as the largest Federal expenditure.

HEADLINE: A Study Says U.S. Schools And Families Aren't Failing

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
A study by the Rand Corporation takes a much rosier view than usual of American schools and families. Contrary to popular belief, it says, schools have improved over the last 20 years, and better-educated parents and smaller families are helping students learn.
The authors of the study said their research should dispel the notion that schools and parents are failing the nation's children. 
 "If you listen to the national debate, you would believe that families and schools are failing and government programs and policies don't work," said David W. Grissmer, who led the study at Rand, a research institute in Santa Monica, Calif.
The study said standardized test scores for black and Hispanic teen-agers improved significantly between the mid-1970's and 1990, narrowing the gap with white students, who made smaller gains.
The average math and reading scores of students 13 to 17 years of age increased the equivalent of 3 percentile points for white students, 11 points for Hispanic students and 19 points for black students.
The study was based on scores in the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests from 1970 to 1990. The scores were analyzed along with information from government surveys of families.
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, in announcing the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress results in August, said that although the nation's students were doing somewhat better than 20 years ago, the progress was inadequate.
Mr. Grissmer said today that "we aren't saying that American education is good enough," only that it is not as bad as many believe.
The Rand study said that the gains in test scores suggested that desegregation and increased spending on schools, especially programs designed for minority students, had paid off. Early education and nutrition programs for poor children may also account for some gains, it said.
The researchers said their next goal was to determine which programs work and why, so school spending would be more cost-effective.
"The country should be cautious about dismantling programs until we know which deserve to go and which to continue," Mr. Grissmer said.
While minority students benefited from changes both at school and at home, the small improvement in white students' scores seems to be tied to family life, the study said.
The factor that helped students most, it said, was better-educated parents. In 1970, for example, 38 percent of the mothers had not completed high school, but in 1990, the figure was only 17 percent.
Students in smaller families also seemed to do better, the study found. Average family incomes remained stable while average family size decreased, leaving more resources to care for each child.
The Rand analysis found that two trends that have worried policy makers -- an increase in the number of working mothers and an increase in single mothers -- had no significant effect when considered alone.

HEADLINE: The Fed Forgoes a Seventh Rate Increase

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's top officials met for nearly four hours today but adjourned without announcing any change in interest rates.
Most economists and traders still expect the Fed to raise rates again, possibly at its next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, or perhaps before then. 
 The Fed is prepared to brake economic growth, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned a Congressional panel on Dec. 7, if necessary to prevent recent increases in raw materials and other manufacturing costs from showing up in consumer prices.
But the central bank's top officials also hinted earlier this month that they would probably pass up the chance today to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year. Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, emphasized on Dec. 9 that reliable information on the economy's health for the fourth quarter would not become available until January.
Financial markets showed little reaction to the Fed's decision today. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 7.84 percent. [Page D17.] Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.55 points, to 3,767.15. [Page D8.]
The Fed's difficulty lies in judging how much the last six interest rate increases will slow the economy. Interest rate changes take up to two years to affect economic growth because companies plan far ahead in making big investment decisions. Strong growth, in turn, can fuel inflation by creating bottlenecks that allow companies to bid up prices.
Lawrence A. Hunter, the Republican staff director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said that the Fed faced the same dilemma now as a bather who has just turned the hot water on full in a shower but still finds the water coming out cold. "You have to wait a long time or you'll burn yourself," he said.
Today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee marked only the third time this year that the Fed's top policy-making body had met without announcing an interest rate increase. The statement issued at the end of today's meeting was virtually identical to the statements from the previous meetings on July 6 and Sept. 27.
"The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 12:45 P.M.," today's statement said. "There will be no further announcements."
At the July 6 and Sept. 27 meetings this year, Fed officials voted to give explicit discretionary power to Mr. Greenspan to raise rates on his own authority before the next meeting.
Although Mr. Greenspan did not use this authority following the meetings on July 6 and Sept. 27, some experts said that he had likely received similar authorization today and might use it next month.
John Lipsky, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said that Mr. Greenspan would be particularly likely to raise interest rates next month if there is a sharp jump in underlying inflation, which excludes changes in volatile food and energy prices.
The Fed was able to leave interest rates untouched today in part because it raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on Nov. 15, the largest increase since 1981. The size of that increase reassured bond investors that they could make long-term investments without worrying that inflation would erode the returns.
Interest rates on long-term bonds have fallen by nearly a quarter of a percentage point since Nov. 15. Within the Fed, J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and others who advocated pushing short-term rates up have argued that tighter money is needed to respond to rising long-term rates. Now that the bond market has responded favorably, this faction may not have pushed hard for a rate increase today.
Starting in February, the Fed pushed up its target for the Federal funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, to 5.5 percent from 3 percent. The Fed has also raised the less important discount rate, which it charges banks for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 3 percent.
The interest rates that Americans pay for mortgages, home-equity loans, car loans and other borrowing have climbed steeply this year, but seem unlikely to change much in response to today's meeting of Fed officials.
White House officials, in line with the Administration's policy of respecting the Fed's independence, declined to comment on today's decision.
Still, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that recent Labor Department figures on consumer and factory prices showed no signs of accelerating inflation.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bills Gain On Inaction By the Fed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bills and notes rose yesterday as the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee adjourned its meeting without altering interest-rate policy.
But the price of the 30-year bond slipped 2/32 of a percentage point, to 96 2/32 , for a yield of 7.84 percent, unchanged from Monday. 
 Many investors stayed on the sidelines yesterday ahead of any news that could signal a change in monetary policy. The market's focus now turns to the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to begin on Jan. 31.
Many market participants think the Fed will choose that time for another increase in short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.
Treasury bills and notes with maturities of five years or less are more vulnerable to interest rate increases by the Fed. The shorter maturities rose after the Fed announced that the final meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee for 1994 had ended at 12:45 P.M. and that there would be "no further announcements."
Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said there were a number of reasons the Fed took no action on interest rates yesterday. "For one, they bought themselves a little time with the 75-basis-point hike in November," he said, noting that the effects of a rate increase take time to work through the economy.
Also, he said, "the dollar has not been under pressure since the November meeting." And he added that the fiasco involving the investment fund of Orange County, Calif., had given the Fed "another reason not to tighten."
Today the Treasury will auction $17.25 billion of new two-year notes and tomorrow it will auction $11 billion of new five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 7.57 percent, and the five-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 7.74 percent.
Elsewhere, municipal bonds were little changed amid growing concern that bond funds will increase selling as investor redemptions resume. Some speculate that those redemptions could increase if Orange County misses a coupon payment or if it is in technical default, according to one trader.
In the corporate bond market, USA Mobile Communications Holdings Inc. moved ahead yesterday with a planned bond offering, taking the company a step closer to thwarting an unwelcome $200 million merger bid from Metrocall Inc.
The company priced a $100 million junk bond offering through Morgan Stanley & Company in anticipation of a USA Mobile shareholder vote on Friday to issue the notes.
Metrocall opposes the junk-bond offering, saying USA Mobile's interest costs are too high. On Monday, Metrocall warned that it would "immediately and irrevocably withdraw" its $14.50-a-share offer for USA Mobile if the bonds are sold.
Metrocall has also has threatened to revoke its offer if USA Mobile proceeds with its planned merger with Premiere Page Inc., a paging company based in Leawood, Kan., that USA Mobile has agreed to buy for about $36 million in cash and stock. That transaction is also scheduled for a vote at the shareholder meeting in Cincinnati on Friday.
The 10-year bonds were priced at par to yield 14 percent, according to MCM Corporate Watch. MCM said the issue was rated B3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and CCC+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Metrocall wants to buy USA Mobile and Premiere Page in separate transactions for about $200 million in cash and stock, creating the nation's second-largest publicly traded paging company. Metrocall, based in Alexandria, Va., has offered to buy Premiere Page for $12 a share in cash and stock.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mostly Lower in Heavy Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed but generally lower in heavy trading yesterday after the Federal Reserve took no action on interest rates, a move that, at least in the short run, should have helped lift stock prices.
But several weeks ago, the market had begun to anticipate the Fed's possible reluctance to raise rates and therefore lifted prices in advance of a deferred action, some analysts said. 
 Meanwhile, the devaluation of the Mexican peso prompted a rush to sell the American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, which represents a large portion of the Mexican stock market's capitalization. The A.D.R.'s dropped 2 1/2, to 46, and was the second-most-active stock at 14.6 million shares, just behind the 15.9 million shares traded in Microsoft. Each A.D.R. represents 20 ordinary shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.55 points, to 3,767.15, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.81 point, to 457.10. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.62 point, to 728.51.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 327 million shares changing hands, about 13 percent above this year's average of 290 million shares.
The confusion of traders on which direction to go was evident in the performance of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Almost exactly the same number of stocks rose in price as fell: or 1,126 advancing stocks and 1,125 declining stocks. But 101 stocks established new lows and only 29 established new highs.
And some traders cast doubt on whether a "December rally" would materialize. They attributed an almost unbroken advance of seven sessions that lasted until Friday to mainly technical factors, like purchases related to the "triple witching" expiration of options and other instruments last week.
Dudley A. Eppel, managing director of listed trading for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said, "I wouldn't trust anything that happens on the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of a triple-witching week."
The market is jittery because few traders have made money this year, Mr. Eppel said. Therefore, most traders are not trading on the merits of a stock, but on inflation figures, stock indexes and the bond market, he said. "It wouldn't take much to take this market down 200 points," he said.
Some stocks rose sharply. Class B shares of Nike Inc., rose to a new 52-week high of 71 7/8, before closing at 71 5/8, up 5 5/8. The shoe maker reported a strong second-quarter earnings increase, its first in a year and half. Intel shares rose 37/16 , to 61 1/4, after it agreed to adopt a more generous return policy for its flawed Pentium microprocessor.
Other stocks fell. United Companies Financial established a 52-week low of 22 before closing at 22 1/2, down 4 1/2. United Companies, a provider of mortgage loans, said it expected fourth-quarter net to be below Wall Street expectations. Monsanto, the chemical conglomerate, fell to a 52-week low of 66 1/2 before closing at 68 7/8, down 4 points. It agreed to buy the Kelco specialty chemicals business of Merck & Company for more than $1 billion.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.24 point, to 249.80, and the American Stock Exchange market-value-index fell 0.43 point, to 425.30.

HEADLINE: Germany Shuns Biotechnology

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOECHST, Germany

 BODY:
Hoechst A.G., the pharmaceutical company, has poured $90 million into its biotechnology operations. Its rival BASF has opened an $80 million biotech research operation. And Bayer has just entered a $25 million biotech joint venture.
These investments by the three German pharmaceutical giants were made not in Germany but in the United States and elsewhere. 
 German businesses are reluctant to invest in biotechnology at home not only because of innate caution about risky ventures, but also because of opposition from militant environmentalists and the bad name given genetic engineering by the Nazis in World War II.
"Biotech is almost nonexistent within Germany," said Ulrich Langer, a chemicals analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "Public opinion is still very much against it, so German companies find they have to go abroad, to the U.S. or Japan."
So BASF opened its $80 million biotech research center in Worcester, Mass. Bayer entered its $25 million joint venture with Onyx of Richmond, Calif., following an earlier joint venture with Viagene in San Diego on Factor VIII, a treatment for hemophilia. And Hoechst has spent more than $90 million on its biotech operations in France, Japan and New Jersey.
The problems were illustrated when Hoechst decided a decade ago to open Germany's first production plant for genetically engineered human insulin.
Ten years later, after battles with German laws, red tape and court challenges from local politicians and environmental groups, the plant sits unfinished at the company's home base here. Hoechst officials do not expect to start selling insulin until 1996 and estimate that the years of delay will lose them more than $300 million in revenues.
When Hoechst, BASF and Bayer gave respective annual presentations to financial analysts earlier this month, none of the biotechnology investments they outlined were in Germany.
"North America has not replaced Germany as a location for business, but there are certain innovative activities which are best performed in the U.S.," Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chairman, said.
With Germany struggling to emerge from its worst recession in decades, and with more than three million unemployed, exporting biotech jobs to other countries carries some long-term ramifications.
Most pharmaceutical industry officials predict that the majority of new wonder drugs will emerge from genetic engineering. This has led to doubts that German pharmaceutical companies can compete in the long term with competitors from the United States and Asia.
Lack of domestic support for the biotech industry here has also created a brain drain, with German scientists being hired away by companies abroad.
President Roman Herzog of Germany lamented in a recent interview with the news magazine Focus, "Especially for gene technology, I have the feeling that there is no more chance for Germany here."
Resistance in Germany to producing such wonder drugs as EPO, which stimulates the growth of red blood cells vital to dialysis patients, or TPA, a blood-thinning agent for heart attack patients, has roots in German history as well as in more recent political movements.
The ghastly experiments by Nazi doctors during the war on prison camp inmates plus the Nazi notion of creating a superior race still haunt Germans, giving the concept of gene manipulation sinister overtones.
The politically powerful Green movement in Germany has led public opposition to genetic technology research and production. Scores of Green groups around the country file lawsuits to stop biotechnology work, and elected officials have put up local barriers to biotech companies. The more militant environmentalists have trampled genetically engineered vegetables on experimental plots and burst into laboratories where genetic engineering research is conducted. The most vociferous opposition is aimed at genetically engineered plants and animals.
"The public pretty much thinks genetically engineered medication is O.K." said Manfred Ritz, an official of the Federation of Chemical Industries. "But they're worried about food. That will take more time."
There are no more than 5 experimental plots in Germany where scientists can grow genetically altered vegetables, compared with 30 in Belgium, 30 in France and more than 1,000 in the United States, said Peter Buckel, director of genetic engineering at Boehringer Mannheim G.m.b.H. outside Munich.
Boehringer Mannheim, a conspicuous exception to the dearth of biotech facilities in Germany, functions partly because the company is based in the conservative state of Bavaria, where the Green Party has relatively little influence.
German suspicions about biotechnology have given rise to European centers of biotechnology emerging beyond Germany's borders. The Alsace region of France, for example, has attracted Swiss and German companies. Hoechst recently built a plant north of Paris to make Hirudin, an anti-coagulant medication found naturally in leeches.
When Germany's legislature passed the Genetic Engineering Act last May to encourage biotechnology at home, Hoechst applied to make Hirudin out of baker's yeast, but ran into a logjam from local politicians.
"The decision was made to shift the plant to near Paris and we received authorization in six weeks from the French Government," said Dieter Brauer, head of Hoechst's biotech research and development. Within months the company had invested more than $10 million in the French plant.
But Germany's problems with biotechnology also have to do with what critics call the penchant among German businessmen for caution, inflexibility and reluctance to make corporate decisions without broad consensus.
In the United States, biotech development has often come from small entrepreneurs backed by venture capital from investors who accept high risk because the payoffs, when they come, can be big. As a result, there are 1,200 biotech companies in the United States and only 17 in Germany.
"We need to do research to find the adventure gene," said Mr. Buckel at Boehringer Mannheim. "American are so much more willing to take risks. We've been sleeping in Germany. We need to wake up."

HEADLINE: For Dancers and Stage Managers With Ballet Theater, a New Voice

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
The American Guild of Musical Artists first took dancers under its wing in 1939. Today, 1,000 of its 5,500 members are dancers and the union represents 24 ballet and modern-dance companies. But the guild lost a major constituent when the 75 dancers and stage managers of American Ballet Theater broke away in June and then voted this month to ratify a contract negotiated by a new union, the Independent Artists of America, which represents only Ballet Theater.
Behind the break, which is the talk of the dance world and performing-arts unions, are problems that threaten the survival of ballet and modern-dance troupes around the country. Those problems demand a new spirit of cooperation with management, the Ballet Theater members say. 
 Government, corporate and private financing for the arts is down. Touring no longer helps to pay for expensive but crucial New York seasons. Ballet and modern-dance companies are now having to produce themselves on the road more frequently, taking greater financial risks, as local producing money has dried up. And so there are fewer tours. To survive, it seems, the largest ballet troupes must increasingly give up the performing that is their raison d'etre because it drives them into debt. Ballet Theater's break with the guild is in part an attempt to address the problems more directly.
In a recent interview at Ballet Theater's Manhattan headquarters, the leaders of Independent Artists spoke of the gains they had made in the new three-year contract, particularly in health benefits and in salary increases, that range from 10 to 13 percent.
They also spoke of working more closely with management to help the company survive in economically desperate times when Ballet Theater and some other major companies are cutting performing weeks and canceling seasons.
The idea of a partnership with management would seem to be antithetical to the philosophy of trade unionism. But the Ballet Theater dancers are not alone in their decision to work more closely with management, said Paul Mishler, an assistant professor of labor studies at the Van Arsdale School of Labor Studies at Empire State College in Manhattan. "Every worker feels that," he said. "Auto workers in Detroit are concerned with that. All of us have been put under the gun because of corporate restructuring. It's not about art. It's about everyone employed by institutions. Don't take survival for granted any more."
Alexander Dube, the dance administrator for the guild, said that this union, too, has encouraged the idea of partnership. It agreed in recent years with Joffrey Ballet dancers' deferring two weeks' pay and with Ballet Theater dancers' giving up contractually guaranteed workweeks.
"What we don't encourage is the idea of unilateral erosion of a collective-bargaining agreement," Mr. Dube said. "A partnership means that the two sides consult on budgets and make decisions about expenditures. Will the dancers be given the right to determine expenditures and cutbacks?"
Ultimately, however, the leaders of the new union said the break had occurred because of a longtime dissatisfaction with the guild, going back to the mid-1970's. "Our dancers now know they're in a union," said Lori Rosecrans, a principal stage manager who is the vice president of Independent Artists.
Representatives of the two unions disagree on a number of bread-and-butter issues in their respective contracts as well as the guild's degree of involvement in representing the Ballet Theater dancers. If there is strength and safety in numbers, however, the guild clearly has the edge. And it has been developing national and local forums for exchanges of information among members throughout the country, a move praised by Independent Artists officers.
The guild also recently elected two dancers -- Gerald Otte, formerly of the Nikolais Dance Theater, and Michael Byars, a soloist with the New York City Ballet -- to its national board. Still, Independent Artists officers say, dancers are a minority in the guild, which failed to take the Ballet Theater contingent seriously enough. Until recently, Ms. Rosecrans and Griff Braun, a corps dancer at Ballet Theater and treasurer of Independent Artists, were members of the guild board.
"We tried to work for change from within," said Michael Owen, a principal dancer and president of Independent Artists. "But all of it fell on deaf ears."
Louise Gilmore, the guild's new national executive secretary, says Ballet Theater's break with mainstream trade unionism may heighten what she calls the "isolation and extreme insularity" common in the profession.
"Dancers are out of touch with what their company's obligations are to them," Ms. Gilmore said. "It is extremely important, for their own protection, for them to hear from other dancers. We know that employers speak with one another and compare notes. It seems a shame to us that dancers don't have the same advantage."
Rather than cut all ties, Independent Artists has suggested that Ballet Theater's dancers and stage managers keep their membership in the American Guild of Musical Artists to make it easier to work as guest performers with guild companies. The leaders of Independent Artists say they view their group as a national union open to anyone in the arts.
Ballet Theater's members say that they are responding to the turmoil the arts find themselves in today and that their jump to Independent Artists is but one attempt to take an active role in helping their company to survive.
Mr. Owen and Ms. Rosecrans said they supported Ballet Theater's recent decision to cancel "Nutcracker" performances at the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., where the company recently formed a partnership that would enable it to use the school's studios and theater for extra rehearsing and performing in return for teaching and doing other work with students. If such decisions had been made earlier, Mr. Owen said, Ballet Theater might not have accumulated a $6.7 million deficit, which has been reduced by $3.5 million.
Gary Dunning, the company's executive director, said the dancers' willingness to make concessions seemed to have less to do with the guild than with their desire to "take charge of their own destiny." "Our position about the union is that it was up to the dancers to choose whether they want A.G.M.A. or I.A.A.," he said of the guild and Independent Artists, adding that Independent Artists was not the only union to make concessions.
"The dancers led the way," he said. "But the musicians reduced their workweeks. Other unions took wage freezes, as did the staff. That kind of sacrifice over the last two years was widespread. It needed to be, but it was also important to form a united front in order to save the company and rebuild it. The others didn't form a new union, but they had the same energy and commitment."
Independent Artists leaders say they feel the issue of partnership can be explored more creatively than it was in the past. A provision in the new contract allows for 6 of the guaranteed 36 workweeks to be spent in special activities like teaching, choreographing or other artistic work. "But they can't just send the dancers out to bar mitzvahs," said Leonard Leibowitz, of the Manhattan labor law firm of Leibowitz, Belson, Perlman & Scuflita, who is counsel to Independent Artists and has represented the Ballet Theater dancers, independently of the guild, since 1979.
Ballet Theater dancers have had a long history of dealing directly with management, Ms. Rosecrans said. And the officers of Independent Artists speak of their belief in the leadership of Mr. Dunning and Kevin McKenzie, the former Ballet Theater principal who is now the artistic director of the company. Obviously, Mr. Owen added, a certain distance must be maintained.
Dancers, they say, must speak up. Some are doing just that. Mr. Byars and Ms. Rosecrans are completing degrees in labor studies. And the topics of unionism and survival are much more under discussion today in major ballet companies.
In the end, however, Independent Artists leaders said their major reason for forming their own union was simple. "This doesn't have to be a big feud with A.G.M.A.," Mr. Braun said. "If your plumber isn't doing the job right, you get another one. You don't hate the first plumber." They had already worked with the first plumber, Mr. Owen added, and "the drains are still clogged."

HEADLINE: In Dishes From Soup to Hash, the Sweet Potato Shows Off

BYLINE: By YANICK RICE LAMB 

 BODY:
SOME people are divided into two factions during the holidays: the sweet potato pie camp and the pumpkin pie camp. "I like sweet potatoes better than pumpkins any day," said Norma Jean Darden, an owner of Spoonbread Catering in Manhattan.
"Nobody likes pumpkin pie in my family," said Sadie Bell Herbin of Reidsville, N.C. But then again, pumpkin pies don't stand much of a chance in her state, which is the leading producer of sweet potatoes in this country. 
 While purists bake a basic but tasty sweet potato pie, others get a little more adventurous. Some throw in a little coconut; some add crushed pineapple. Ms. Darden whips up lemon sweet potato tartlets, a favorite of Bill Cosby's, one of her first catering clients, and Mrs. Herbin sometimes makes a sweet potato cobbler. "You haven't lived until you've tasted sweet potato cobbler," said her niece, Olivia Penn of Brooklyn. "Talk about slap-your-face good!"
Mike Cannon, a horticultural specialist at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in Baton Rouge and a member of the Sweet Potato Council of the United States, says that in the last five years, restaurants have increased their use of sweet potatoes.
Restaurants have served pies and candied yams for years. But as soon as the temperature begins to dip, many add comfort foods, and often sweet potatoes are the base. Michael Romano, the chef at the Union Square Cafe in Manhattan, created a sweet potato-brussels sprouts hash to accompany a spicy, seared salmon dish.
At nearby Chat 'n' Chew, Kris Yettra-Latham, the general manager and chef, offers a hearty sweet potato soup. There is sweet potato cheesecake at Kwanzaa in SoHo and sweet potato muffins at the Shark Bar on the Upper West Side.
Ms. Darden comes from a long line of sweet potato lovers. Many of her family's recipes are included in "Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine" (Doubleday), a cookbook that she wrote with her sister, Carole Darden Lloyd, who is also her partner in Spoonbread. It was published in 1978 and reissued this year.
But the record for sweet potato recipes probably belongs to Hollie West of Beaumont, Tex. The 94-year-old retired home economist included 700 recipes in "The Exotic Yam," a cookbook that she published with her nephew in 1983.
Although the terms "yam" and "sweet potato" are used interchangeably, they refer to two different foods. Sweet potatoes, which have yellow or orange-colored flesh, are members of the Ipomoea family, while yams are white-fleshed, hairy members of the Dioscorea family, explained Jessica B. Harris, a food historian and author of "The Welcome Table: African-American Heritage Cooking," to be published by Simon & Schuster in February. Yams are not grown in this country but in Africa, the Caribbean and Central America.
What people here eat and often call yams are sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are about 2,000 years old, Miss West says, and were discovered during gold expeditions in Central America. She notes that there are 200 varieties.
Besides being versatile, she says, they are also nutritious. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group, ranks them first among vegetables on its nutrition scoreboard, said the center's executive director, Michael F. Jacobson, who often eats baked sweet potatoes for lunch.

HEADLINE: AT WORK WITH: Kristina Gunnill;
Madison Avenue Meets the Volga

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARATOV, Russia

 BODY:
IN this provincial city, once closed to foreigners because of its military plants, a Peace Corps volunteer named Kristina Gunnill has found both a cause and a second family.
Ms. Gunnill is a Peace Corps volunteer in a country taught to believe that the Peace Corps is a nest of spies. She is a Harvard M.B.A. and former advertising executive in a land where the customer is still regarded as the enemy, where, as the old proverb goes, "You can never sell anything without deceiving someone." 
 And she is a noisy, single, energetic woman in a country where women still think they must be married by 21 and have children immediately if they expect to have any kind of life.
"There's no such thing in America as being too ambitious," Ms. Gunnill says in her brisk, lilting way.
Vera Dmitriyeva -- a teacher who took Ms. Gunnill in, rented her a room and made her part of the family -- laughs in her usual, perpetual astonishment at what comes out of Kristina's mouth. "You can't be ambitious here, not if you're a woman," she says, then pauses. "Kristina brought a lot of optimism into this house."
Ms. Gunnill, 48, has a gift for selling the upside of capitalism and identifying young Russians who can benefit from her experience and enthusiasm. In return, she inspires devotion. And to the deep distress of her Russian disciples, who tend to hover around her as she works in the Saratov Center for Business Development, she has recently learned that she has multiple sclerosis.
She has also turned disease into an opportunity. She founded one of the first chapters of the Multiple Sclerosis Society in Russia.
For the Peace Corps, which tends to work in less developed countries with nurses, doctors and well-diggers, the focus on business is a departure. Russia is among the most difficult assignments for volunteers, with bad food, low salaries, local mistrust and no tropical beach at the end of the day.
In late 1992, after the first chaotic year of the transition to market prices, 99 American Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Russia for training as "shock workers for capitalism." Forty-eight, including Ms. Gunnill, were assigned to Western Russia, along the Volga, and 51 to the far east, centered in Vladivostok. The dropout rate has been high, especially in rough-and-tumble Vladivostok, where only 29 volunteers remain from the first group. Along the Volga, there are 34.
IT has been very difficult in Saratov, Ms. Gunnill freely admits, and some of the offshoots of "savage capitalism" -- crime and corruption, and there's even a local restaurant here named Omerta -- have fed a conservative backlash.
But for Ms. Gunnill, the past is prologue. "What you see are the death throes of the old economy," she says. "Those are always difficult and not very pretty to watch. I'm into birth."
Mrs. Dmitriyeva, who teaches English at Saratov State University, has been pushed by Ms. Gunnill into starting a "business English" course. She keeps lists of her comments and aphorisms. "People in Saratov will learn Kristina English," Mrs. Dmitriyeva says.
For example? "Well," Mrs. Dmitriyeva says, "I like this one: 'Happiness is a worked-out skill.' It's absolutely right."
Ms. Gunnill, listening, blushes a bit, a rare thing for her. "I'd like to phrase it a little better," she says.
"No, it's right," her friend says. "And it sums up a lot in her character."
Mrs. Dmitriyeva also chooses "It's the little things that count," and then explains why this cliche moves her. "For so many years we were told to live for tomorrow, for the bright shining future," she says, and here she rolls her eyes, "for our grandchildren to live in Socialism, or maybe even their grandchildren, and it wasn't supposed to matter how we lived, or how poor or wretched we were. It was all for the future.
"But you know, it's true. It is the little things that count, that count now. We want to be happy today."
Ms. Gunnill, not an easy crier, has wet eyes. She points to Vera Dmitriyeva's 20-year-old daughter, Katya, and says, "I'm sure for Katya's generation, they will have the most wonderful experience!" Katya, who attends college in the United States and is now home for a visit, isn't so sure. Ms. Gunnill waves it all away, saying: "Listen, I'm a trend spotter! This is my job!"
After nearly 20 years in advertising, including 13 years with Young & Rubicam in New York, where she became a vice president, Ms. Gunnill was captivated by the idea of bringing capitalism to Russia. She tried to get her agency to send her. She learned that the Peace Corps would start up here, and she applied.
"I felt I was living too well in New York, that my world was trivial," she says. "I didn't really need three closets full of clothes. There's an element of spiritual development to it all, no question." She had started as a secretary, later attended Harvard University, and then worked her way up.
"I didn't get all these credentials to serve no one but myself," she says. "And advertising is the leading edge of the capitalist economy."
Ms. Gunnill and the Peace Corps helped set up the Saratov Center for Business Development and found financing for it. The center opened in May and is run by a young Russian she discovered in the local bureaucracy. It already has 75 clients.
She has organized courses in business English, which she is helping turn into a profit center for Mrs. Dmitriyeva's university; trained local advertising agencies in market research and focus groups, and started a consulting group with 10 young economics graduates. She has also organized a women's business club; given advertising lectures up and down the Volga for thousands of people, and helped many Russians receive grants for visits and education in America. She is also coming to terms with her disease.
Three months after being sworn in for a two-year term, Ms. Gunnill was in Warsaw and began to lose her sight. "On the train back," she says, "I just got more and more blind."
In Saratov, they brought her to the head of the Ophthalmological Institute, who urged her to return to America. The Peace Corps immediately brought her to Washington, where her disease was diagnosed. The Peace Corps was reluctant to send her back to provincial Russia.
"It's a late onset, so it's a crap shoot," Ms. Gunnill says. "There's no treatment early on. I had to convince people that I could be not treated as well in Russia as in America."
The Peace Corps sent her back. "If there's trouble," she says, defiantly, "I can work with just one eye. I always said that."
When she returned, she found that Mrs. Dmitriyeva had done research on multiple sclerosis. She made sure Ms. Gunnill had a room of her own and tried to minimize the stress. Finally, in January, Ms. Gunnill took a small apartment nearby.
She threw herself into learning all about her disease. She uses the multiple sclerosis chapter to teach Russians about self-help organizations.
But multiple sclerosis is unforgiving. The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy says it is a chronic, slowly progressive disease of the central nervous system, cause unknown.
Fatigue and overwork, one of Ms. Gunnill's defining traits, should be avoided. Prognosis is not happy, with an average life expectancy of 10 to 15 years after diagnosis. But the course of the disease is variable, with remissions up to 25 years.
MS. GUNNILL knows all this. And she has had reminders. "One eye went out, but came back again," she says. "And my hands went out once. My hands turned into books. I had no sense of touch, and on the computer, the 'e's' would go across the screen. I couldn't turn pages very easily."
She stops, then typically breaks any hint of self-pity with an anecdote: "The Russians brought me to a neurologists' convention once, but they were disappointed in me -- I wasn't sick enough for them!"
Ms. Gunnill would much rather talk about her work with "the wonderful young Russians who will transform this country." In her lectures, she describes how business works in America, how marketing helps product development. To her embarrassment, Ms. Gunnill speaks poor Russian, but somehow she gets her points across.
SHE explains the success of Frank Perdue, who put his stamp on the lowly chicken by guaranteeing freshness and giving consumers what they want. "He even feeds his chickens special marigold petals to improve their color, because consumers said they prefer golden-colored chickens," she tells rapt Russians. "We all eat Frank Perdue chickens, and Frank Perdue is a very rich man."
These kinds of lectures stir debate among Russians, especially along the conservative Volga. "There are people who don't want us here, who don't want Americans here, or small businesses, or the market itself," Ms. Gunnill acknowledges.
Ms. Gunnill was born in Pittsburgh to a mother born in Bulgaria. She went to Northfield School, now the Northfield Mount Hermon School, and then Connecticut College, both on scholarships. "I graduated knowing at least I didn't want to be an executive wife," she says.
The Peace Corps in Russia "lets me be the sort of person I thought I was -- another step to the person I am," she says. She continues: "I could get a debilitating disease like multiple sclerosis, and I knew what Margaret Bourke-White would have done -- go back to Russia.""
Mrs. Dmitriyeva's daughter, Katya, now attends Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., not far from where Kristina's mother, who's over 80, lives. "There's a daughter swap going on here," Ms. Gunnill says. "My mother wasn't inclined to be too happy about me staying on in Russia. She remembers when I ran away with the balloon man."
With Vera and her clients, Ms. Gunnill has found both a family and a cause. Katya has joked: "She's Kristianizing us." But Kristina Gunnill has also been Russified a little, wrapped in the large, soft arms of provincial affection.
She and five other volunteers in Saratov have already signed up for a third year. "I was supposed to be out of here next February, but I just can't go," she says fervently. "I've got people I'm training; I've got an M.S. society formed here, and I just can't leave all that. Right now I'm playing everything by ear, but this feels like a lifelong commitment."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Owners Offer Players a Deal That Will Exclude a Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Slowly and surely, the National Hockey League dispute is nearing a possible conclusion. People with knowledge of last week's collective bargaining negotiations confirmed tonight that the team owners have offered the players a deal that doesn't include a payroll tax.
It is the tax, which the players call a salary cap in disguise, that has been the deal breaker thus far in keeping the players locked out and postponing the start of the season for 81 days, as of today. The league also has offered the Players Association a deal that includes a salary tax, but the player representatives from the 26 teams emphatically rejected that approach tonight when they met at a lakefront hotel. 
 "There won't be a deal with a tax in it," said Adam Graves of the Rangers, when he emerged from tonight's three-hour session. "I imagine that talks will continue, but not in a vein with a tax included. The basis of a deal is in place for the most part. We've moved in the middle ground to get something done. This is very, very complex."
Tonight's meeting set the stage for a general membership meeting here on Wednesday that is expected to draw at least 200 players. No one in the union would speak about details of the eventual compromise, but it is expected that the players will give further ground on arbitration procedures, which many owners have said is a primary cause of the salary inflation they are seeking to control.
No formal negotiations are scheduled, although they could resume soon. Full bargaining broke off Dec. 6 when Commissioner Gary Bettman re-introduced the concept of a payroll tax, which he called a "contribution." But last week, during subcommittee meetings attended by two persons from each side, both sides explored solutions that didn't include a tax.
The players already have agreed, tentatively, to major concessions on an entry-level salary cap and reductions in arbitration and free agency for young players. The owners have offered increased free-agency privileges for veterans.
Mark Messier, Graves's Ranger teammate, said "as long as there is a tax on the table, there won't be a season." Bob Goodenow, executive director of the union, said Bettman and the owners should accept the players' stance and bargain accordingly.
"The sooner they understand that, the better off the process will be," he said of the rejection of the tax.
During the lockout, Bettman has insisted that a tax is not a salary cap. One owner who doesn't buy his semantics is Mike Ilitch of the Detroit Red Wings.
"Why not just come right out and say 'cap' now?" Ilitch said. "I mean, it's a cap. That's what we're after here. They're using other fancy terms, but that's what it boils down to."
Ilitch, who owns one of the league's oldest, strongest and highest-valued franchises, made his comments earlier this week on a Detroit radio station after being asked if the owners had miscalculated the resolve of the union when they ordered the lockout on Oct. 1.
"I guess we did miscalculate from the standpoint of how serious the players were," Ilitch said. "And I think they misjudged how serious the owners were."
No formal deadline for cancellation of the season has been announced, although the Board of Governors last week gave Bettman power to cancel the season if it is impossible to play a 50-game schedule and a full slate of playoffs before July 1.
Dave Gagner, the player representative of the Dallas Stars, said the struggle was "in the final stages" and that the players were strong in their resolve because "the sport we play teaches us to be a little more durable than the average person."
Last week, Stephane Richer of the Devils said he thought most players would vote to go back to work if they took a secret ballot. Gagner and several players tonight disputed that and said a vote would be taken by the membership only if the bargaining committee decided to submit a proposal to the membership, through the chain of command that includes the player representatives.
On the management side, all owners haven't been solidly for Bettman's tax plan or for the lockout for several weeks. Ed Snider of Philadelphia has suggested frequently that further cutbacks in arbitration rights might achieve the desired "drag" on salaries. Bill Wirtz of Chicago said late last month that the league needed a deal by Dec. 1. Howard Baldwin of Pittsburgh said the games had to resume before the Christmas holidays. Joseph Cohen of Los Angeles said a tax was "the last thing we should be talking about."
But the hawks seem to dominate the agenda on both sides, going into the crucial crunch weeks. Should the season be canceled, many N.H.L. players would probably seek work in the International Hockey League, a high minor league operating in major cities across the United States.
Earlier this month, after a second N.H.L. player signed with an I.H.L. team, I.H.L. Commissioner Bob Ufer banned further signings. He said at the time that the ban was temporary, so that voting on the I.H.L.'s collective bargaining agreement wouldn't be jeopardized.
That agreement has been ratified by both sides, but the ban continues, on a day-to-day basis, despite dozens of job applicants from the N.H.L. Why?
"I'm not going to, willy-nilly, allow the job security of our players to be jeopardized," Ufer said. "I'm having a conference call with the Board of Governors tomorrow. We'll probably discuss that."
Ufer said the union representing I.H.L. players has told him that it appreciates his concerns for their jobs but that it also recognizes that players from anywhere have the right to compete for jobs in a free market.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
NO one ventures too far into wine lore before hearing someone say: "Of course it's good. It's a first growth." Or, "It's only a fifth growth, but it should be at least a second."
The references are to the Bordeaux Classification of 1855, a list rating what were then considered to be the best wine properties of that renowned viticultural region. "Growth" is an inadequate English translation of the French word "cru," which refers to a vineyard. 
 Serious social and economic movements often base their legitimacy and their purpose on some seminal document like the Bible, Magna Carta or the Declaration of Independence. The same, on a smaller stage, is true of the 1855 Classification.
Drawn up in haste almost 140 years ago, it continues to wield considerable influence over the international wine trade. In Tokyo, New York and London, when wine merchants or their clients talk of Bordeaux, they inevitably refer to the 1855 Classification.
Before there were World's Fairs, there were Universal Exhibitions, the first of which was held in London in 1851. Eager to assert his lofty title, the newly proclaimed Emperor of France, Napoleon III, announced that an even bigger exposition would be held in Paris in 1855.
The commissioners of the Paris show decided to include an exhibition of Bordeaux wines. They asked the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce to pick the best wines of the region. The chamber turned the job over to the courtiers, a group of brokers who, to this day, act as middlemen between the chateau owners and the shippers who buy the wine from the chateaus and sell it around the world.
The courtiers selected some 60 chateaus from Bordeaux's 3,000 or so red-wine producing properties. They divided them into five groups: first, second, third, fourth and fifth growths, with first considered the best. With only minor exceptions, the list has not changed since the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce sent it off to the exposition commissioners in Paris on April 18, 1855.
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, which had been bought by the Rothschild family in 1855, was known even then as a great vineyard, but the courtiers weren't sure how it would fare in the hands of the new owners. It finally got first-growth status in 1973, by Presidential decree.
There have been a few other changes as well. Chateau Dubignon, a third growth in 1855, went out of business and disappeared from the list. Chateau Desmirail disappeared in 1938 and was re-established in 1981. The single Chateau Leoville in 1855 became three: Leoville-Barton, Leoville-Las Cazes and Leoville-Poyferre.
The original list was based entirely on wines of the Medoc, an area north of the city of Bordeaux, with one exception: Chateau Haut-Brion, which is in Graves, west of the city. The famous areas to the east, St.-Emilion and Pomerol, home to chateaus like Cheval Blanc, Ausone and Petrus, were ignored.
There have been attempts to revise what is obviously an incomplete if not unfair list. In the 1950's, the owners of the classified chateaus established a committee to work on a revision. The committee proposed 19 demotions and the elevation of a dozen hitherto unclassified chateaus to classified rank.
The uproar was such that the project was abandoned. Another semi-official revision was proposed in 1970; it, too, came to naught. Alexis Lichine, the author, chateau owner and wine merchant, championed his own revision for more than 20 years with little effect. Hardly a wine writer or Bordeaux expert has been able to resist the temptation to produce his or her own version. In "Grands Vins," a book on Bordeaux to be published early next year, the English writer and onetime wine merchant Clive Coates offers some insights on the 1855 ranking and, inevitably, produces a version of his own.
It is wrong, Mr. Coates contends, to assume that the St.-Emilion and Pomerol properties were ignored. They simply were not considered to be up to classified growth standards, he believes.
Unfortunately, everyone took the list too seriously, Mr. Coates says. "There was certainly no intention that the 1855 Classification should be permanent," he writes in Wine & Spirits, a trade publication. Its framers, he says, probably had no idea "what a momentous object they had created." And since then, he goes on, "nobody, official or otherwise, has had the legal or political authority nor the will" to replace it.
There is another approach. Perhaps we could just forget the classification. At the top of the list are the five first growths, Haut-Brion, Latour, Margaux, Lafite-Rothschild and Mouton-Rothschild. It is no longer the case, but there have been times when at least three of them -- Haut-Brion, Margaux and Lafite -- produced wines unworthy of first-growth standing.
Ausone, Cheval-Blanc and Petrus, easily the peers of the top five, go their own ways, unlisted but revered by connoisseurs.
Then there are the chateaus lower down the list that consistently rival the first growths: Leoville-Las Cazes, Pichon-Lalande, La Mission-Haut-Brion, Figeac and Lynch-Bages among them. Lynch-Bages is a fifth growth.
Quality promotes demand, and demand increases prices. And none of them have much to do with any classification, be it from 1855 or 1994.
 
TASTINGS
Buena Vista Chardonnay, Carneros, Calif., 1992. About $10.
 
Buena Vista, the largest estate in the Carneros region of Napa and Sonoma counties of California, sells this chardonnay at a reasonable price. This wine has classic Carneros contours, rich and full with good acidity but eminently easy to drink, thanks to the second, or malolactic fermentation for some of the wine. Beginning with the 1992 vintage, Buena Vista put nearly 30 percent of this wine through the second fermentation and then aged the wine with its yeast for five months to achieve the extra concentration. And the wine fermented in the barrel increased from 10 percent in 1991 to 35 percent in this vintage. Oak lovers, who seem to comprise 90 percent of American wine drinkers, should be pleased.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Smaller May Be Better in Talks

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
More than two months ago, the Dodgers' Brett Butler proved to be a sound student of the history of baseball labor negotiations when he made the following observation: When negotiating teams are reduced to the smallest common denominators, deals are made.
It was an important lesson to review on this, the second-to-last day before baseball owners are scheduled to declare an impasse in the four-month-old strike and impose a salary cap. Because, in keeping with labor history, there does seem to be some downsizing of negotiating teams and a recalibration of the bargaining process. 
 Both could prove to be even more important than the substantive issues on the table or the owners' deadline, whose urgency seems to be lost in the eerily quiet atmosphere surrounding talks in the Capital Hilton and nearby offices of management lawyers and union economists.
Change for more than change's sake proved to be important in 1981. That's when Lee MacPhail, then president of the American League, stepped into a war zone, replacing Ray Grebey, the owners' hawkish chief negotiator, whom the players and union rigorously battled during most of the 50-day in-season strike.
MacPhail and Marvin Miller, the head of the union, were then able to sit down and work out a settlement. MacPhail was an integral factor in the agreement, as was the expiration of the owners' Lloyd's of London strike-insurance policy.
In 1985, another strike hit, and owners and even a commissioner, Peter Ueberroth, moved in and out of the negotiations. But in the end it was MacPhail who again wound up going one on one with a union chief, this time Don Fehr. And the two worked out an end to a three-day in-season strike, one of the least painful work stoppages in the history of the sport.
In 1990, another one on one was needed, this time during a spring- training lockout. Again, it produced results. Fehr and the deputy commissioner then, Steve Greenberg, locked themselves in a room to have a go at the logjam over salary arbitration eligibility. About 12 hours later they emerged, with a 17 percent solution involving the disputed class of players with two or more years of eligibility. And, oh, yes, they had with them the bridge to a new basic agreement as well.
Now, in 1994, all of baseball waits to see if history is somehow repeating itself, as one owner, Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, prepares to take the lead role for management.
Many of the old patterns have already played out. Richard Ravitch started out as the owners' lead negotiator, only to be moved aside and ultimately resign.
Ravitch was replaced by Boston's John Harrington at the beginning of the month. Now, according to Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, the Red Sox's chief operating officer has been left exhausted by the negotiating sessions that have meandered up and down the East Coast corridor since mid-October.
Harrington has yet to come here. McMorris arrived yesterday, and the significance has been lost on few as the belief grows that he is the man now empowered to do a deal. "Jerry's coming in," one union lawyer said. "We'll have to see what happens after that."
"There are solutions to these problems," McMorris said upon arriving at negotiations central at the Capital Hilton. "You have to take each piece in the context of the way it was presented. There will be compromises reached and there will be give and take on given parts. That's how I hope we're going to find a deal."
Now what remains to be seen is if McMorris's wishes can become his reality. Remember, the union doesn't give credence to deadlines, but the owners say they are there nonetheless. So their clock is ticking and adding what they say is urgency to negotiations that have had their share of fits and starts ever since the players struck on Aug. 12.
So, all that was truly certain yesterday was that the first full negotiations could resume with McMorris more involved than ever. What was not certain was just what his presence meant in terms of the owners' approach -- that is, whether it's old, new, altered or indifferent. Or how the union will respond to yet another management change at the point.
While all sides waited to see the effect of McMorris's presence, they busied themselves dissecting the process. And why not, when the talks one assumes both need to succeed could once again be derailed by miscommunications or a system failure.
Seeking the best possible process is worth the effort. That will go doubly if the process produces the right combination of bodies, whether it be 2, 4 or 40.
For what Butler said Sept. 9 still goes. "That's where the real negotiations are going to take place -- in a small room, not in a big room," the player said. "Things happen in small rooms."

How Not to Fix Public Broadcasting

BYLINE: By Leonard Garment; Leonard Garment, who was counsel to President Richard Nixon, is completing a memoir, which is scheduled for publication next year.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich, the next Speaker of the House, intends to change public broadcasting. This is good. There are things about it that need changing. Representative Gingrich has announced that he will do the job by eliminating Federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is getting $285.6 million in tax money in the current fiscal year and distributes 90 percent of it to about 1,000 public television and stations and groups.
I think he will eventually conclude that this is not the way to get the change he wants. 
 Two things about public broadcasting bother many Americans, not just conservatives. First, Government should not be in broadcasting unless it provides necessary services that the market does not deliver. Second, some public programming, especially from National Public Radio and a number of big-city stations, reveals instances of bias -- mostly, but not exclusively, a liberal bias in covering social problems. Usually these are such hot-button issues as crime, religion, race and abortion. Zeroing out the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would solve neither problem.
As for economics, most public broadcasting originates not in big cities but in smaller communities. Most stations are less like New York's or Chicago's than they are like WVMR, a radio station in Dunsmore, W.Va., that offers local programming that no commercial station would consider: lost-dog ads, funeral announcements, school closings, junior high sports broadcasts. Other stations feature high school equivalency and literacy programs and other educational courses, public-health services and computer networking.
The small stations depend more on the Federal stipends they receive than do the larger ones. The overall Federal contribution to stations' budgets ranges from 4 to 40 percent, but generally the smaller the station, the bigger the subsidy. Thus, small stations are the most likely to be killed by the disappearance of Federal financing.
Public broadcasting does what the market does not in another important way. It provides superior cultural and children's programs free. There is lots of talk about how commercial television can do these things, but it is mostly talk. In its feature-length morning and late-afternoon news programs, listeners to public radio get more diverse news, debate and commentary than they can get from the 10-second sound bites of commercial radio.
So far, commercial TV has proved less willing than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to take the risks entailed in developing ambitious programs, and it does not provide the depth of good children's TV that public broadcasting does.
The nation's well-being depends on a certain level of literacy and common culture in the population -- something Mr. Gingrich understands quite well. Both those "commodities" are in scarce supply. When the Government makes its small contribution to public broadcasting, these are the social benefits it provides; the cost is not irrational or disproportionate.
The second problem with public broadcasting is bias -- programming that does not disseminate a common culture but imposes a partisan attitude. This bias is not frequent and tends to occur in the programming of the bigger public broadcasting stations, which receive perhaps 5 percent of their budgets from the Government. These are the stations best able to survive and continue their activities even if their Federal contributions drop to zero.
Cutting off financing to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would not address the problem of bias. The opposite is true. Because big stations as well as small ones get public money, all are accountable to public authorities. This accountability makes a difference. In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring national public programming to be balanced and fair. There have been problems carrying out this bland generalization, but there has also been some improvement.
The money we give public broadcasting helps insure its accountability. Remove Federal funds and you remove officials' ability to influence the system. Such withdrawal would be irresponsible, and I do not think it is what Mr. Gingrich wants. There is an argument for transferring more responsibility from the big urban stations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to make programming more truly national and better able to serve its legitimate unifying purposes.
If Mr. Gingrich spares the corporation, he need not give up on changing public broadcasting. He can keep the budget tight. He can re-examine the way the money is distributed. He can yell bloody murder at what he finds offensive. In short, he can exercise continuous leadership, which in the end is the only thing to which public broadcasting -- or any other enterprise -- responds.

HEADLINE: Cubans Welcome Envoys of Capitalism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was happy to read "The U.S. and Cuba: Double Fantasy" (editorial, Dec. 14), but disappointed at how soft it was on United States policy. Yes, there is rhetorical posturing on both sides. But all the rhetoric in the world will not stop a needy people enticed by the possibility of economic growth from embracing capitalism if it is available to them. 
 I got back three days ago from Havana, where as a film director I visited the Latin American Film Festival. I went to Cuba with my father. He and the Association of American Publishers are planning a book show there next March. Bolstered by the State Department's encouragement of cultural trade between the countries, Americans too now have the chance to sell books there on the open market.
In meetings with Cuban publishers, I saw what "socialists" might be like in trade agreements with "imperialist" capitalists. These were people excited about free trade's possibilities. On one side, there were the Cubans with a chance to sell books to their own population, which is 90 percent literate; and on the other, the Americans with a chance to exploit a huge, previously closed market.
From their sales projections, it was clear that if the embargo were lifted and one could exchange dollars for pesos, no rhetoric would stop the dollar from igniting an economic fire for these people, who have exquisite minds and gentle humors, but suffer from having no economy to speak of. With no gasoline, no paper, little food, no soap, only free trade with a dollar market will help them.
If we are so sure of our economic system, why not risk hearing a little "socialist" rhetoric while allowing some "imperialism" to seep in?
Until we do, the saddest thing is that Cuba's malnourished children will continue to starve, its architecture will crumble, and our embargo will fuel Fidel Castro's rhetoric. Then we'll only have ourselves to blame.

HEADLINE: THE SUBWAY FIREBOMB: THE SUSPECT;
From Burns and Tatters, a Bombing Suspect

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
The man in the Clark Street subway station in Brooklyn was hurting.
His sneakers and the legs of his blue jeans were singed and shredded, his legs bloody below the knees, Police Officer Michael Ruiz remembered later. There were burns on his arm, some of the skin on his face was peeling away, and through the tatters of his gloves there were burn marks on his knuckles. 
 The two encountered each other about 10 minutes after 2 P.M. yesterday -- about a half-hour after a burst of flame in a crowded No. 4 train injured 41 people as the subway pulled into the Fulton Street station in the Manhattan financial district. Officer Ruiz and his partner in the 84th Precinct, Officer Anthony Roa, were answering a radio call for aid at the subway station in Brooklyn.
"I'm in pain," the man said, staggering near the token booth. They put him in an ambulance, although Officer Ruiz recalled that "it seemed a little odd how he got all the way into Brooklyn."
Then, as they sped toward the burn unit of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, a description came over their radios of a suspect in the subway firebombing. They looked at the man riding with them: a white man, around 200 pounds, between 40 and 50, burgundy sweater, dark blue three-quarter-length coat, blue jeans torn below the knees, burn marks.
The two officers looked at each other. "Wait a minute," Officer Ruiz said. "That sounds like the guy that we have."
Less than an hour after the explosion, the police said, the man, identified as Edward Leary, 49, an unemployed computer technician from Scotch Plains, N.J., was the target of the investigation not only of yesterday's explosion but also of a similar incident last week. In that first incident, a teen-age girl's backpack suddenly caught fire on a subway train in Harlem, injuring and badly burning a 13-year-old boy, whose clothes had caught fire.
The main link between the two cases, the police said, were similarities in the construction of the incendiary devices that started both subway fires: each consisted of a glass jar about the size of a mayonnaise jar, filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid. Both had two wires leading from the liquid to a battery and a crude timer.
The police's Chief of Department, John Timoney, said the remains of the firebomb were being scrutinized by the police bomb squad and would be examined by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which already has the remains of the first device. After questioning the two teen-agers burned in the Harlem case, the police said they concluded that the two had nothing to do with the device.
Mr. Leary, who was believed to have last worked for Merrill Lynch, lived at 63 Glenside Avenue in Scotch Plains and had co-op apartments at 10 Plaza Street in Brooklyn, a solid-looking brick building with a doorman facing Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park.
"We did have an Edward Leary who worked for us," said Bobbie Collins, a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman. "We don't know if it was the same person. He worked in our operations department. He was terminated." Ms. Collins said the man last worked there in January 1994.
At the two-story white frame house in Scotch Plains, decorated with strings of blinking white Christmas lights, a neighbor said Mr. Leary had moved there from Brooklyn about a year ago, with his wife, Marge, a nurse-practitioner, and their son, around 12 years old. The neighbor, who would not give her name, said it appeared that Mr. Leary had been unemployed for the last few months.
Detectives who were parked in the driveway had seen gasoline canisters in the garage and a search warrant was being sought last night, said a law-enforcement official who asked for anonymity.
At the co-op building where Mr. Leary had lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn, he had left more distinct impressions. He was once president of the co-op board, a period recalled by one resident as one of "incredibly nasty politics" over running the building.
"Ed was weird," said David Elrich, who served on the board with him and who now lives elsewhere. "He was always involved in computers. He's your classic computer person, great with machines, not so good with people."
At one point, Mr. Elrich recalled, the infighting over the question of spending money to decorate the co-op building grew very emotional. One day, a mysterious fire erupted outside the apartment of the leader of the pro-spending faction, who opposed Mr. Leary's efforts to keep down maintenance costs. Law-enforcement officials said that after hearing tenants recall that incident last night, they were investigating whether Mr. Leary might be connected to it.
After he moved to New Jersey, Mr. Leary still kept the three apartments he owned in the Brooklyn co-op, Mr. Elrich said. One woman who rented one of the co-ops, Jeannette Goldstein, said she was involved in a long-running dispute over repairs she said were needed to the apartment, and produced a sheaf of documents and letters that she had sent to city officials.
"This man is driving me crazy," she said. "I'm on the phone all day long. He would not fix the apartment."
Mr. Leary had advertised one of the apartments in The New York Times on Sunday for $164,000. Last night, no one answered the family's New Jersey's phone number, which was listed in the ad.

HEADLINE: Judge Approves Plan for Logging In Forests Where Rare Owls Live

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
A Federal judge today approved the Clinton Administration's much-disputed plan for logging in the Pacific Northwest forest that is home to the spotted owl and other imperiled species.
The policy, approved by Judge William L. Dwyer of the District Court in Seattle, would let the timber industry cut up to one billion feet of lumber each year in the ancient forests of Washington, Oregon and northern California -- less than one-fifth of the harvest during the 1980's. 
 In deciding one of the most hotly contested environmental issues in recent years, Judge Dwyer, the same judge who had first halted logging in 1991 to protect the endangered spotted owl, turned aside objections to the Administration's plans from both the timber industry and environmentalists.
He ruled three years ago that the Bush Administration was breaking Federal laws by allowing so much logging on public lands that the owl might become extinct and told the Government that it must come up with an environmental plan for the region before he would allow logging to resume.
Although either side might appeal today's ruling, Judge Dwyer's 70-page opinion, which addressed every substantive objection raised so far by environmentalists and the timber industry, left little room for legal challenge, legal experts say.
The Clinton Administration began to carry out its plan in June, starting some restoration work and selling some 60 million board feet of timber, but the influence on the region's economy has been modest so far. In the background, it was clear that the plan was subject to a rejection by the judge who had strictly controlled every step the Government had taken in the owl's habitat.
Judge Dwyer's ruling was seen as a victory for the Administration and its twin policies for handling disputes over natural resources: to seek a balance between development and conservation and to defend its decisions on the basis of scientific judgments about the workings of entire ecosystems, rather than on the state of individual species.
The Forest Service expects to allow the timber industry to cut about 300 million board feet of lumber from public lands within the owl's range next year, said Jim Lyons, the assistant Agriculture Secretary in charge of forestry. He added that it might take three years for logging to reach the level envisioned in the plan because of the time needed to do scientific studies, arrange timber auctions and hire loggers.
Administration officials said the plan also called for new projects like repairing damaged forests and streams, which would provide jobs without increasing logging, as well as other economic aid for the region.
The Administration said its plan would protect not just the old-growth trees and the spotted owl, but hundreds of other species, like salmon, whose endangered status could otherwise be used as easily as the owl's to stop the logging.
The Administration spent more than a year consulting with environmental groups, timber interests, state and local officials, economists and scientists. But the industry objected to the big cuts in its logging quota, and conservationists opposed it because they said it would not protect the last of the region's ancient forests.
Although Judge Dwyer approved the plan today, his ruling made plain that he had lingering doubts about whether it would work.
"The question is not whether the court would write the same plan, but whether the agencies have acted within the bounds of the law," he wrote.
Judge Dwyer said any more logging sales than the plan contemplates would probably violate environmental laws. And he said that the Government must carefully monitor owl populations in the future.
"New information may require that timber sales be ended or curtailed," he cautioned.
Both environmentalists and the timber industry said that they might appeal the decision, but the likelihood of overturning it that way seems remote.
No judge in the country is more familiar with the case than Judge Dwyer, whose past rulings on the issue have withstood appeals, and in the end, as judges often do, he gave the Administration the benefit of the doubt on the disputed scientific merits of the plan.
But that does not mean that the issue of logging in the region has been put to rest, or that the owl and other imperiled species that the Administration's plan tries to protect will survive.
For one thing, the ascendancy of Republicans in Congress strengthens the timber industry's hand in trying to rewrite the basic laws on which his decision rested.
"The only place that a fair balance can be struck is in Congress," said Mark Rey, vice president of the American Forest Products Association.
It remains unclear whether Congress will approve all the spending for restoration projects that the plan calls for, nor is there any accurate way of estimating how much money the timber sales will bring in.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the decision vindicated this Administration's efforts to comply with the law and was important new evidence that laws like the the Endangered Species Act could protect both ecosystems and the economy.
The Administration and environmental groups argued that the reductions in logging had not crushed the region's economy, as the timber industry and its Congressional allies had predicted.
"Unemployment for the entire region is at its lowest level in years, millions of dollars have been distributed to more than 100 communities for economic revitalization," said a written statement issued by the White House.
Since it first came to office, the Administration has cited its approach to the forest issue as a model for how it wanted to handle conflicts between development and conservation. President Clinton personally led a public summit meeting of the warring parties in 1991 in an attempt to resolve the differences.
But even though the Administration's plan for managing the forest went a long way toward protecting the owl's habitat, environmental groups have never been wholly satisfied with it.
They complained that the resumption in logging would continue to cut the kind of woods that provides suitable home for the owl into smaller and smaller fragments, and that the regrowth of forests over the next several decades would come too late to help the imperiled species re-establish itself.
They also said that many fish populations are likely to be eliminated as the logging resumes, because of the damage to streams that logging and road-building can cause. They called the plan's measures to protect fish experimental and unproven.
The union representing forest workers today excoriated Judge Dwyers's decision, calling the Administration's plan a "proven failure" because almost no timber was harvested in the 15 months since the plan was first announced. Even though the plan was subject to the judge's approval, the Administration was legally allowed to begin carrying out some provisions during the court's review.
Echoing the industry's view, the union called on Congress to write "a truly balanced, comprehensive forest management plan."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
For Banks, Time of Reckoning

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
High-rolling hedge fund managers like George Soros were the first to disclose that they lost money in the plunging bond market this year. Then came Piper Jaffray and some others that run mutual funds. More recently, several municipalities, most notably Orange County, Calif., confessed to substantial losses from risky interest rate bets gone bad.
Now it's the banks' turn to come clean. 
 Some big banks like the PNC Bank Corporation, Keycorp, and Banc One have already said that they will be hurt because of problems in their investment portfolios. But banking experts say there are many more that compiled similar losses but have not been as forthcoming. Yet.
Analysts find it difficult to say exactly which banks have been hardest hit. That's because banks provide only limited disclosure about the effects of changes in interest rates on their balance sheets. Indeed, the reason that banking losses are just starting to trickle out now -- rather than in the spring when the problems at mutual funds first emerged -- is not because the losses are newer. Instead, it is because accounting rules make it easier for banks to hide their mistakes.
For buyers of banking shares, the silver lining is that the expectation of this bad news has already depressed prices indiscriminately across the board. Analysts say there is an opportunity to buy undervalued banks that have not been hurt, or may even benefit, from rising interest rates.
Analysts expect many banks to face up to their losses by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. They would do so by selling losing investments to concentrate the pain in one quarterly reduction in earnings. Some likely candidates, analysts said, include the Fleet Financial Group of Providence, R.I., Boatmen's Bancshares of St. Louis and Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio.
Other banks -- including Shawmut National of Boston, Central Fidelity of Richmond and Integra Financial of Pittsburgh -- will probably not take big one-time write-offs. Instead, they may simply suffer through the next few years with depressed earnings because their bond investments pay interest rates that are below market.
And the problems could get worse before they get better.
"If we see another increase in rates, we will see some more banks start to hemorrhage," said Thomas Hanley, a bank stock analyst with CS First Boston.
The interest rate losses are mainly concentrated among regional and local banks, which turned to investments in bonds when the drop in loan demand in the late 1980's and early 1990's cut deeply into earnings. Many banks borrowed at low short-term rates to pour money into higher- yielding longer-term bonds that appeared to offer safe returns with little effort.
"It's like putting a bowl of candy in front of a child," said Frank DeSantis, a bank stock analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "It was there for the taking."
From September to November, bank stocks in the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods index fell 12 percent, mainly on interest rate fears. They are up 1 percent this month.
Among banks that analysts say may be undervalued is First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, which gains ground from interest rate increases because an unusually high percentage of its depositors' money is in checking accounts that do not pay interest. Thus, when market rates rise, its interest costs do not rise as fast as other banks'.
The big New York banks, such as Citibank and Chase Manhattan, also do not face sharp losses from higher interest rates, largely because their investments are more diversified.
Even with the sketchy information that has been disclosed so far, it's clear that many banks with paper profits on their bond investments at the end of last year now have positions that are deeply in the red.
A study by Morgan Stanley, which includes information not disclosed in bank statements, shows that as of Sept. 30, the value of the $217 billion of bonds in the portfolios of 24 big regional banks had declined $5.4 billion. But the banks have not yet reflected those losses in their earnings. Moreover, interest rates have risen considerably since then.
Among those banks, at least 20 also face another $3.5 billion in losses from dealings in derivatives. (The rest of the banks in the study did not report on the value of their derivatives.) Derivatives are contracts that have values linked to some underlying asset, most commonly interest rates. Banks use them both to hedge their risk from rate moves and as a more speculative form of investment.
These problems are coming at what is already expected to be harder times for banks. Profit growth in the last few years had been brisk. But that was largely because the industry was recovering from a bout with bad real estate loans that sharply depressed earnings and came close to toppling some banking titans. Banks face the prospect of lower earnings next year in a business with excess capacity and cutthroat competition.
No one expects any big banks to be pushed close to the brink of collapse. That's because the banking industry has more capital than it had in the past to cushion it from financial blows. Banks have been doing a better job of managing their balance sheets than a decade ago, when First Pennsylvania Bank of Philadelphia and First Bank System in Minneapolis were crippled by enormously wrong-headed bets on interest rates.
Still, the fact that the bank losses have taken so long to show up highlights the gamble individual investors take by investing in banks. At the root of the problem are the notoriously opaque financial statements issued by most banks.
For most of the last decade, investors struggled to determine which banks were vulnerable to losses on loans to oil drillers, third world countries, leveraged buyout artists and real estate tycoons. They got little or no help from the banks themselves. Instead, as these problems first emerged, bank executives said they knew what they were doing and had the situation under control.
Some of them were right. But others were wrong, and often lost their jobs. They certainly lost a lot of money for their shareholders.
Banks show most of their bond investments on their balance sheet at the prices they paid for them, not their current market value. They only report a gain or a loss if they sell the bond before it matures.
In recent years, accountants have tried to help investors by forcing banks to disclose the unrealized losses in footnotes to the financial statements. In some cases, they have been required to deduct the losses from book value. But for the ordinary investor, the limited disclosure has not made the picture much clearer.
Accounting for derivatives is even murkier, largely because the instruments are new and the rules have not caught up with the innovation. Derivative transactions do not show up on the companies' balance sheets at all. Banks have been putting more information on their derivatives holdings in footnotes, but disclosure is inconsistent.


GRAPHIC: Many banks have bond and derivative portfolios that have eroded significantly in value, thanks to rising interest rates. The banks face an unpalatable choice with most of the securities: Sell them at a loss now and take a charge against earnings, or hold on to them and put up with the the drag on earning from their low returns.

HEADLINE: Mexico Will Float Its Battered Currency

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Mexico's economy was thrown into crisis tonight as the Government abandoned its efforts to defend the peso and announced that it would allow the currency to float against the dollar.
At the least, the move was expected to bring a sharp, immediate further devaluation of the peso, plus a burst of new inflation and major losses for Mexican banks. 
 Stockbrokers and financial-market analysts predicted tonight that the currency could quickly fall by 30 percent or more of its value last week against the dollar, and they warned of a possible run on the banks by Mexicans desperate to change their money.
The Government said tonight that it had arranged to draw on $7 billion in emergency credits from the United States and Canada to try to bring the situation under control.
In a statement released late tonight after emergency meetings among Government, business and labor leaders, the Labor Secretariat announced that prices on goods and services would be frozen for 60 days. It also said that for at least that period, wages would rise no more than the 10 percent agreed upon in September.
The move came after a tumultuous day in which investors panicked at an effective devaluation of nearly 15 percent on Tuesday, driving down the values of Mexican stocks nearly 12 percent before a rally in the afternoon.
The central bank also raised interest rates sharply, but pressure on the peso continued, cutting its value to the bottom of the new exchange range, the level at which the Government had said it would intervene.
All these developments amounted to a debacle for President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon just three weeks after his inauguration, and it left new doubts among investors and economists about the viability of the Government's economic strategy.
"This is a major crisis of confidence in the Mexican Government," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, head of Latin American equity research at Bear, Stearns in New York.
This morning, Mexican officials had responded to investors' anger by backing more clearly away from both the exchange-rate policy pursued by former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the promises of greater public spending and lower interest rates with which Mr. Zedillo won election in August.
Like his predecessor, Mr. Zedillo had expressed confidence that the exchange rate could be sustained despite a projected current-account deficit of more than $30 billion next year, the broadest measure of trade. As recently as last week, the new Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, publicly insisted that a devaluation was not in the offing.
In briefings for investors, officials acknowledged more directly that the volatility in Mexico's financial markets this year have been at least partly the result of fundamental weaknesses in the economy. In addition to adjusting what many analysts had seen as an overvalued exchange-rate band, the officials promised to address the problem by cutting public spending, raising interest rates and scaling back loans to private companies for imports.
Appealing for continued "discipline" from Mexican workers who will now face higher inflation with only a 7 percent wage increase they won in September, Mr. Zedillo said the effective devaluation should favor exports and savings, ushering in "a new stage" of economic growth.
It became more evident that the Government's real mistake had not been so much in allowing the peso's value to drop as far as 15.3 percent, but in the way the devaluation was handled.
Mr. Zedillo, a Yale-trained economist who served as Mr. Salinas's Planning and Budget Minister, had been expected to have a comparatively easy time of managing the economy and reassuring the investors abroad who hold tens of billions of dollars in Mexican securities.
Despite somewhat sluggish growth, pressure for a more equitable distribution of wealth, and cries for help from small business, his greater challenges were expected to be domestic and political.
Yet many foreign investors today were seething that Mr. Serra had ignored them in announcing the peso devaluation to the Mexican news media on Tuesday morning. They also complained that Mr. Zedillo and Mr. Serra seemed to have only their domestic audience in mind when they tried to attribute the exchange-rate pressure primarily to rising tensions in the southern state of Chiapas, where rebels have threatened new fighting.
"You can argue that they needed a devaluation," said Luis R. Luis, an economist and expert on Mexico at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in Boston. "But they also needed a plan to support the devaluation and to convince investors that this was for the good of the economy in the long term. Now these guys are going to have a tough task of rebuilding confidence, and they don't have much time."
In Chiapas today, the embattled Governor, Eduardo Robledo Rincon, said all the roads blocked had now been cleared and his government was in control of all 38 towns the insurgents said they had infiltrated.
After months of losses, stock values on the Bolsa de Valores, the Mexican exchange, had initially rallied 1.9 percent on Tuesday. But this morning, with Wall Street awash in rumors that the Mexican Government might allow the peso to float freely against the dollar, foreign investors led a selloff that sent the market index down 266 points, or 11.7 percent, from yesterday's close of 2,274.17. The index climbed back up in heavy trading to close at 2,203.67, still a loss of 3.1 percent for the day.
Stocks dropped sharply in some other Latin American countries. In Brazil, the Bovespa index was off 6.33 percent, while the Argentine index fell 5.74 percent. Markets in Chile and Peru were off 1.5 percent and 1.35 percent, respectively.
Mexican interest rates took their biggest leap since April. At a weekly auction, yields on benchmark 28-day treasury bills jumped 225 basis points, to 16 percent. Even then, pressure on the peso eased only a bit.
Under the Tuesday devaluation, the band within which the currency is allowed to trade was widened by 15.3 percent; the Government said it would now buy pesos when the exchange rate reached 4.0016 to the dollar. The peso fell roughly 13 percent against the dollar here on Tuesday and about 2 percent further today, to 3.997 to the dollar, despite reports that the Government was already intervening to support it. In late New York trading, the rate was 3.9870 pesos.
Its limited public relations effort left some investors wondering what had become of the Mexican central bank's president, Miguel Mancera, who remained silent about the measure, and left others nostalgic for Pedro Aspe, Mr. Serra's predecessor as Finance Minister. Under President Salinas, Mr. Aspe won a wide reputation for skillfully anticipating the markets in his presentation of major economic policy decisions.

HEADLINE: Judge Voids Disputed Cuts Of Mayor and Council

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
A state judge yesterday tossed out both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed budget cuts and a competing set of reductions enacted by the City Council, while sidestepping any ruling on the Council's attempt to test its budgetary powers under the City Charter.
Mr. Giuliani promptly said he would now use his power of impoundment to achieve nearly the full $800 million in spending cuts that he originally proposed. And the Council, while claiming a victory, was left with little leverage to block him. 
 In reaching her decision in State Supreme Court, Justice Fern Fisher-Brandveen did not address the main issue raised by the Council: its contention that the City Charter allows it, in some cases, to modify midyear fiscal actions taken by the Mayor. Instead, she based her decision on a more technical question concerning the City Council's internal rules.
The Justice said her action left in effect the city's original $31.6 billion budget, in which a $1.1 billion budget gap has opened because of falling tax revenue and faulty spending assumptions. She expressed "trust that the City Council and the Mayor can work together to find a solution to the city's current budget dilemma, which is both economically acceptable and palatable to both sides."
But the Mayor said he would proceed on his own. "This gives me the flexibility that we need in order to make the cuts in the budget," Mr. Giuliani said. "I said I would do that in order to preserve a balanced budget, which I have the power to do under the Charter."
Sticking to the same negotiating position that drove the Council to court, he added that while he would consider some programs that the Council wants restored, he would not allow such items to exceed $40 million. "The same deal that was available a month ago is available today," Mr. Giuliani said. "No new deal, no additional money. I will not -- just to get a political result -- imperil a balanced budget."
In a move likely to rile the Council leadership further, Abraham M. Lackman, the Mayor's budget director, said the Mayor would even use his impoundment powers to cut the Council's own operating budget.
Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone criticized the Mayor's tack, saying that impoundment was an emergency power and not one to use as a main tool of governing.
"That's irresponsible, obviously, because you can govern by impounding, but that means you can't fund anything," Mr. Vallone said. "So somewhere along the line I assume the Office of Management and Budget is going to recognize that there are certain things that have to be done in this city as well as things that have to be cut in this city."
When told that the Mayor intended to cut $2.5 million from the Council as well, Mr. Vallone said such a move would violate the separation of powers. "It's kind of clear under the Charter that we do have the right to exist," he said.
While both the Mayor and the Council leadership both said they had achieved a victory in the court decision, it was clear that the Council was left in a weakened position, with little to persuade Mr. Giuliani to consider the Council's own spending priorities.
Aides to Mr. Vallone said their one bargaining chip was that Mr. Giuliani's budget plan not only made spending reductions, but had also shifted money between agencies and included new funds for overtime costs. The aides said that only the spending cuts, and none of the transfers of funds needed to run an orderly government, could be carried out through impoundment.
The dispute between the two branches of government began after Mr. Giuliani announced a $1.1 billion budget gap and submitted to the Council his own menu of budget reductions to close the gap. Traditionally, the Council has been held to have the power only to approve or reject such midyear budget changes unless new revenues are involved.
But unhappy with many of the Mayor's cuts in programs like education, youth programs and emergency food pantries, the Council said it had the right to alter some of his budget cuts because his proposal contained some new revenues. The Council then voted overwhelmingly to block $96.6 million of the Mayor's reductions and replaced them with $96.6 million in alternative cuts.
Mr. Giuliani and his aides called the Council's argument illegal and disingenuous, noting that while tax revenues had increased in some cases, the budget plan overall called for a net drop in revenue of $189 million. He vetoed the Council's budget plan and despite an override said he would not carry it out. For the first time since it was created in 1938, the City Council then took the Mayor to court.
But Justice Fisher-Brandveen did not make any ruling on whether the Council had exceeded its powers under the City Charter's definition of new revenues. Instead she based her ruling on a procedural battle that had occurred on the day the Council had first voted to alter the Mayor's budget plan.
Hours before the Council vote, the Mayor's office had tried to stop the vote by sending a letter to the City Council withdrawing the budget proposal and leaving the lawmakers nothing to vote on. But the Council, citing its own parliamentary rules, countered that the Mayor could not withdraw legislation without three days' notice and went ahead anyway.
But the Judge held yesterday that once the Mayor withdrew his plan, the Council should have refrained from voting. She said her conclusion was not based on an interpretation of City Council rules. "Rather, it is rooted in common sense," she said. She said both the Mayor's cuts and the Council's cuts were void.

HEADLINE: A Cease-Fire Called Winter Settles Over Bosnia

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Nenad Tadic, a Bosnian Serb soldier, looked up today at the snow falling heavily on the mountains surrounding Sarajevo and said, "The weather would achieve a four-month cease-fire, with or without the politicians."
He was right. With snow falling and the weather bitterly cold, the fighting season is largely over in Bosnia. The cease-fire announced by Jimmy Carter is therefore relatively insignificant unless it can be developed into a real disengagement of forces. 
 Such a disengagement, buffered by United Nations forces, took place earlier this year in central Bosnia, where there had been brutal fighting between Muslims and Croats. But in that instance, under strong American pressure, the rival armies and politicians had decided to end, or at least bury, their differences.
That is far from the case in the war between the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces and the Bosnian Serbs, who are based in Pale, outside Sarajevo. Announcing Mr. Carter's agreement, Sarajevo Radio said it was signed by the Government "and the war criminals in Pale." Conciliation is not yet in the air.
At least not among the politicians of Bosnia. Among the populations on either side there is, however, an immense fatigue that would, if it could ever find political expression, open the door to peace at least a crack. But politics in the Balkans does not seem to work this way.
"The war has destroyed us psychologically," said Milja Gluhovic, a Bosnian Serb in Pale who lost both her husband and brother last May to a single Bosnian shell that landed in their trench in the mountains above Sarajevo. "Everyone wants peace, everyone," she said. "But the prospects are dim."
In Sarajevo, an accountant named Amra who declined to give her last name said: "It is very sad when, after two and a half years, you see there is nothing left. I hate this place. I hate these people. If I can ever get away, I will never come back."
Such weariness, disillusionment and disgust with political maneuvering are now rampant throughout Bosnia. But the grim scheming that has already inflicted 32 months of war on Bosnia continues unabated, and the political posturing seems particularly outlandish because Bosnia is still a country to be invented.
Despite all the words on both sides, the fact remains that Bosnia and Herzegovina has no recent history as an independent state and Muslims, Croats and Serbs disagree totally as to what it is and what it should become. This is still the root of the conflict.
To bolster their cases, both sides cling increasingly to myth. Bosnia, for the Muslim-led Government, has become a "millennial state," despite the fact that since its conquest by the Turks in 1462, it has been governed by the Ottoman empire, the Austro-Hungarian empire, a royalist Yugoslav Government, a puppet pro-Nazi Croatian state, and Yugoslav Communists, but never by its own independent authority.
For the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, Bosnia has become part of a land that was always Serbian, despite the fact that Sarajevo has never been a Serbian city and, even at the height of the Serbian empire in the 14th century, only a small part of Bosnia fell under the rule of the Emperor Dusan. There have been Serbs west of the Drina River for centuries; but the Serbian state always lay to the east.
Beside the myths, there is the fact that Serbs and Muslims have lived alongside each other, often uneasily, for centuries on the piece of land now internationally recognized as Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are condemned to continue doing so. The question is how.
The Bosnian Government of President Alija Izetbegovic, outraged by the Serbs' campaign of terror against Muslims across much of Bosnia, wants to "liberate" the country from Dr. Karadzic and the many Serbs who follow him. If that remains the case, President Izetbegovic will try to use an eventual four-month respite from fighting to continue rearming and building an army that has made immense strides over the past two years.
Despite the successful Serbian onslaught on the western Muslim enclave of Bihac, which continued today with mortar and artillery rounds exploding in the suburbs of Bihac, the Bosnian Army continues to put the Serbs under new pressure elsewhere in other parts of the country.
Serbian losses near Trnovo, southeast of Sarajevo, have been heavy in recent weeks. The Bosnian Government has some reason to see a long-term military trend in its favor.
Dr. Karadzic, meanwhile, persists with a vision of an ethnically pure Serbian entity within Bosnia, including a second Sarajevo for the Serbs.
His recent promises on improving human rights and his statement that he has "nothing against Muslims, only a deep objection to Mr. Izetbegovic's fundamentalists" cannot mask the fact that, from Sanski Most in the northwest to Trebinje in the southeast, almost all Muslims in the territory held by the Serbs have been driven out or killed since 1992.
Both these political visions -- Mr. Izetbegovic's of some sort of liberation and Dr. Karadzic's of a big slice of Bosnia for Serbs only -- are probably impossible ones.
A Bosnian military victory over Dr. Karadzic would almost certainly take years; moreover, there would still be many Serbs left in Bosnia who would not want to live under a Muslim-led Government. And the toll of political and economic isolation that goes with Dr. Karadzic's ideas would ultimately prove crippling.
If the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, -- the countries that make up the so-called Contact Group that has drawn up a peace plan for Bosnia -- can convince the opposing sides of the futility of this essential stalemate, there may be some chance of a real cessation of hostilities that would outlast the effects of the winter.
There may also be some chance of a real political settlement that would allow the two sides to govern themselves in such close proximity that political, economic and emotional links would inevitably emerge over time and wounds begin to heal.
But, as the third winter of the war takes hold, all the signs are that the time is not yet ripe for the political courage that a settlement would demand.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Ties With Pope on Aid Groups

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 21

 BODY:
At a time of sharpening differences in Congress over the usefulness of United States foreign aid, President Clinton has written to Pope John Paul II proposing closer, formal cooperation between United States Government and Roman Catholic aid agencies to insure that aid reaches the people it is meant for, American and Vatican officials said today.
The idea is to tap into the wide network of Catholic relief and development services around the world -- both private organizations and those directly sponsored by the Vatican -- that often have the most up-to-date and detailed information on the needs of people in disaster areas, United States officials said. 
 The proposal represents a departure from previous practice. But it could also inspire misgivings among some American Catholics because of the Vatican's efforts, most recently in September at a major conference in Cairo on population issues, to stamp its views on abortion and contraception on development policies.
President Clinton's letter was presented to Angelo Cardinal Sodano, the Vatican's Secretary of State, on Dec. 5 by Raymond L. Flynn, the American Ambassador to the Holy See.
Vatican officials said that no formal response had yet been made.
The development coincides with reports that Republican leaders in Congress are planning cuts of 15 to 20 percent in Washington's foreign aid budget, which is set at $13.7 billion this year.
In his letter, which has not been made public, President Clinton praised the Catholic Church as a "cornerstone of efforts to lend assistance in times of need" and suggested "that by working together more closely and better coordinating our responses to humanitarian crises we could alleviate the suffering."
"We would like to share information, including field reports, on a more systematic basis," the letter said, according to American officials who spoke on conditions of anonymity. It also spoke of a new cooperation between the Vatican and the Clinton Administration "in the areas of crisis prevention and mediation" and proposed "the development of a system of information-sharing and a coordinated approach to our humanitarian response efforts."
The idea was under discussion within the Agency for International Development, the principle vehicle for United States foreign aid, before the Republican victory in Congress and was first raised with Vatican officials in May when Brian Atwood, the agency's director, stopped in Rome on the way back from a visit to disaster areas in Africa.
But Ambassador Flynn said in an interview, it had assumed a particular significance since the newest Republican suggestions to cut foreign aid.
"This will save money to the extent that it will insure that the process is effective and professional," he said. "It will insure that the American tax dollar is not being squandered but is going directly to the people in overwhelming need."

Canada Plans Tax on a U.S. Magazine

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Canada's efforts to protect its recording and magazine industries at the expense of powerful American companies are generating fresh tensions with the United States.
On Thursday, the Canadian Government is expected to announce measures to bolster the industries, including a punitive tax on Canadian issues of Sports Illustrated. The tax could provoke direct American retaliation, although such a tax is not specifically prohibited by the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Only two days ago, a Canadian court rejected an appeal by the Country Music Television channel in Nashville to overturn a ruling by Canada's Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that will ban the American channel in Canada and replace it with a Canadian-owned country music channel.
But despite their conflicts on the cultural front, the United States and Canadian Governments have come together on an agreement, also to be announced on Thursday, to expand air transportation between their countries.
Although the two countries enjoy the world's largest exchanges of goods and services, they lack even direct air links between the two capitals of Ottawa and Washington.
A so-called open skies accord, under which each country's airlines would eventually be able to fly back and forth from any city they want, could be ready for signing by the time President Clinton pays an expected visit to Ottawa this winter, American officials said.
Yet cultural tensions still overhang the relationship. Ottawa has come under increasing pressure from Canadian magazine publishers, who complain that Sports Illustrated attracts Canadian advertising that should go to their publications.
The argument that the economic health of Canadian publishing underpins a national cultural identity has high resonance here but wins little sympathy in the United States.
"We have made our feelings very clear to them at high levels," the United States Ambassador, James J. Blanchard, said in an interview. "There may well have to be retaliation or a separate, special 301. We are looking at all our options."
Section 301 of American trade law empowers President Clinton to strike at imports from countries that take unfair trade action against American exports.
The North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Mexico, exempts cultural industries from the dismantling of trade barriers. But while Canada would not violate the accord by taking discriminatory action against Time Warner, the publisher of Sports Illustrated, the United States would also not violate the agreement by retaliating.
"We have no problem if they want to subsidize these industries," Ambassador Blanchard said. "Where we object is when they act to penalize our industries, making us pay the cost."
Canada rippled cultural waters earlier this year when the Canadian radio and television commission ordered the Country Music Television from Nashville off the air by Jan. 1 to make way for New Country Music, a Canadian channel jointly owned by Rawlco Communications Inc. of Edmonton, Alberta, and Maclean Hunter Ltd. of Toronto.
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation of Pittsburgh and Gaylord Entertainment Inc. of Oklahoma City, owners of Country Music Television, unsuccessfully asked the federal Court of Appeal in Canada to set aside the ruling on the ground that they had been denied a fair hearing.
Time Warner publishes six Canadian issues a year of Sports Illustrated through a satellite printing operation in Montreal.
Under what is called a split-run, Time-Warner essentially takes the American magazine, adds a few pages of Canadian editorial content and turns it into a Canadian product that competes for advertising.
Through satellite printing, Time-Warner bypassed 20-year-old Canadian restrictions barring Canadian companies from writing off their advertising costs in American magazines for tax purposes. The restrictions originally covered magazines printed in the United States and trucked into Canada.
Canadian publishers have worried that if their Government does not challenge Sports Illustrated's split-run, foreign English-language magazines with significant circulation in Canada could follow suit.
Officials at Time Warner in New York were reluctant to comment today before the Canadian Government announcement. But privately one said, "We're quite upset."

HEADLINE: U.S. Easing Rules on Biotech Patents

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The Government will no longer require drug companies to conduct clinical trials on humans before granting patents for biotechnology products, Clinton Administration officials and drug industry executives said today.
The policy, which drug companies said would actually make it easier for them to conduct such clinical trials, is expected to speed development of treatments for cancer, AIDS and other diseases. It is to be announced on Thursday by Bruce A. Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. 
 In the last few years, drug companies say, the Government has often demanded that they do human clinical trials to show the effectiveness of new biotechnology drugs before they can get patent protection for their products. But the companies said they could not raise the money to pay for such testing if they did not have patents because there was no guarantee they would get exclusive rights to the drugs.
In remarks prepared for a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Lehman, who is also an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, says he has ordered a policy change to remedy what he describes as a Catch-22. Companies, he said, complained that they were "required by the Patent and Trademark Office to provide human clinical data" to show that new drugs were useful, but at the same time they were "unable to proceed with clinical trials for a promising new drug because their patent situation was unclear."
While drug makers will still have to show the potential usefulness of new biotechnology products, Mr. Lehman said, they can satisfy the requirement by submitting "any kind of evidence" to demonstrate that their claims are credible.
"Our examiners will no longer impose unrealistic and unattainable evidentiary requirements on patent applicants," he said.
Executives from the biotechnology industry hailed the change, embodied in guidelines for patent examiners, and they praised Mr. Lehman for responding to their concerns.
"This is a big step forward for the biotechnology industry," said Lisa J. Raines, a vice president of the Genzyme Corporation, in Cambridge, Mass. "Biotech companies will be able to get patents earlier in the process of drug development, and that will make it easier for companies to raise the money needed for clinical trials. When you have a patent, you can go to investors. You can't get investors for clinical trials without patents.
"Under the new policy, if you have a drug that could be useful in treating cancer and it stops cancer cells from multiplying in a test tube or in animals, you could get a patent. You wouldn't have to prove that it actually worked in humans."
The patent is needed to raise money for clinical trials, which in turn are essential for the next step in the process. Drugs must be tested in humans to show that they are safe and effective before they can be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sale to the public.
Robert P. Blackburn, vice president and chief patent counsel at the Chiron Corporation, in Emeryville, Calif., said today: "Consumers will benefit from the new guidelines. More drugs will be put into clinical trials. That increases the chances that new drugs will become available for diseases that now have no treatment."
The policy change has no monetary cost to the Government and may pay some political dividends for the Clinton Administration. Many biotechnology executives praised Mr. Clinton in 1992, when as a Presidential candidate he emphasized the economic importance of high technology industries. But they were dismayed by his effort to control drug prices as part of his ambitious plan to remake the nation's health care system. Drug stock prices fell in 1993, investors were unnerved and many biotechnology companies said they had difficulty raising money to pursue promising drugs.
Patents are valuable property rights, permitting companies to sell products without direct competition, but there is no way to quantify the value of the new policy to drug companies.
Industry executives laid out their concerns at a meeting with Mr. Lehman last spring and at a public hearing he held in San Diego in the summer.
Biotechnology companies complained, for example, that patent examiners often challenged the scientific judgments of experts, including Nobel Prize winners, who certified that new drugs met certain criteria for granting patents.
"We heard many people say that examiners routinely challenge the sound scientific conclusions of recognized experts in the field," Mr. Lehman said. "This practice will cease under the new guidelines."
He said examiners would be trained to make sure they understood the guidelines and correctly applied the relevant laws. Supervisors and "quality assurance experts" will have the authority to overrule the decisions of patent examiners if necessary, he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Lower income taxes stimulate the economy. The sequel.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the Laffer curve? That was the back-of-the napkin illustration by the economist Arthur Laffer of his idea that in some cases lower tax rates actually increase government revenues. It inspired the immense rate reductions of the early Ronald Reagan era -- and later, the I-told-you-so chuckles from mainstream economists who never believed the rosy revenue forecasts.
Well, nobody's laughing these days. The Laffer curve is alive and well, back at the heart of academic and political debates over the "dynamic scoring" proposed by some Republicans in computing how tax changes affect the budget. 
 Although Republican leaders in Congress now say they will pare the budget before they cut taxes, much still hangs on how tax cuts are scored. If the "supply siders" who dominate the House Republicans have their way, Congress will be able to deliver a host of tax breaks without touching the budget perks of the middle class.
Under the self-imposed rules of Congress, any bill that adds to the deficit must be offset by budget cuts or revenue "enhancements," otherwise known as tax increases. The estimates are made by the Congressional Budget Office, using formulas created by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The final arbiter is the White House's Office of Management and Budget. If O.M.B. decides that Congress has, in effect, cooked the books, the President is obliged to hold back a portion of the appropriated funds.
Everything turns on the assumptions used to project revenues. The most conservative stance is that tax rates do not affect the level of taxable transactions.
Assume, for example, that Americans spend $100 billion a year on new cars. A truly "static analysis" would count a special 50 percent tax on cars as a $50 billion gain in revenue.
This approach guarantees error: When you shoot at a flying duck, as the late Senator Russell Long once put it, you aim where the duck is heading, not where the duck is. In the case of the auto tax, people would presumably postpone purchases, buy cheaper vehicles or make payments under the table.
That is why the Joint Tax Committee, contrary to some ill-informed claims by outsiders like Rush Limbaugh, does include some behavioral responses to tax changes. In estimating the revenue impact of cutting the capital gains tax rate, for instance, Congressional tax experts assume that big gains would be "unlocked" in the early years as people chose to sell appreciated assets.
But dynamic scoring is a slippery slope. And the current debate focuses on just how dynamic the scorekeepers can be without sliding into never-never land. Most economists believe it is not legitimate to count the Keynesian "demand side" impact of a tax cut -- for example, the stimulus to taxable income that followed the Kennedy Administration's business-tax cuts in the early 1960's.
Why? Because, when the economy is operating near its full capacity, "the Federal Reserve just isn't going to let it happen," argues Martin Feldstein, the conservative president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Any such stimulus, he asserts, would be offset by tighter credit policies by the Fed to prevent higher inflation.
What is at stake is how tax changes alter incentives to work, save and invest -- and thus increase total productive capacity and taxable income in the long run. While virtually all experts agree there are effects, the Joint Tax Committee assumes they are too small to matter much in the five-year horizon of budget planning.
But supply-siders are partial to predictions that lower tax rates would stimulate a blizzard of new investment. Gary and Aldona Robbins, senior associates for Taxaction Analysis, a Texas-based research group, estimate that the House Republicans' capital gains cut would generate $167 billion in added revenue over seven years -- compared with the $17 billion cumulative loss estimated by the Joint Tax Committee.
Is there a middle ground here?
Maybe. Mr. Feldstein acknowledges that the short-term growth effects linked to increased investment and risk-taking are probably too modest to count in budget projections. But he argues that tax incentives can change hours worked relatively quickly. And he cites as evidence the doctoral thesis of one of his students at Harvard, Nada Eissa, who found that substantial numbers of upper-middle-income housewives joined the paid labor force after tax rates were cut in 1986.
But even that may be going too far. Stanley Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, points out how skewed it would be to score the dynamic side effects of tax policy while ignoring any dynamic effects of government spending. To take just one example, one might assume that subsidies to science add more to productive capacity than an equivalent amount spent on consumer goods. Or a dollar taken from drug rehabilitation might reduce taxable income if it raised the cost of crime.
In Mr. Collender's view, budgeting in the shadow of gigantic deficits ought to put the burden of proof on supply-siders. "You want to be surprised by a deficit that's smaller than expected," he suggests, "not larger."

Treasuries Mixed, but Auction Helps

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with prices helped by a well-received auction of two-year notes and by a stronger dollar.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 964/32 , for a yield 7.84 percent, unchanged from Tuesday. Shorter-maturity bills were mixed, with a three-month bill rate down four basis points, to 5.40 percent, and a one-year note up two basis points, to 6.59 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 The yield spread, or difference in yield, between a two-year and a 30-year maturity is about half of what it was a month ago. Analysts said that a narrowing of the spread was an indication that investors were confident that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to keep inflation subdued. That confidence is displayed in the willingness of investors to buy longer maturities.
The two-year note was particularly attractive yesterday as yields rose even before the Treasury auction. At the auction, the high yield for a new two-year note was 7.57 percent, up from 7.30 percent last month and its highest since Oct. 30, 1990, when it was 7.84 percent. A year ago at auction the yield was 4.28 percent.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said the Treasury's two-year note auction was impressive, noting the number of noncompetitive bids, which come from many individual investors.
"The noncompetitive number was $2.4 billion, massive as far as noncompetitive bidding goes," he said.
Today the Treasury will auction $11 billion of new five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the new five-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 7.75 percent, the same return as the current five-year note.
The dollar surged against most leading currencies yesterday, helping dollar-denominated assets like government securities appear more attractive to foreign investors. The dollar was helped in part by a move by some international investors to dump Mexican assets after the devaluation of the peso.
Municipal bonds were mixed as well yesterday, as some investors continued to sell bonds to realize year-end tax losses, traders said. The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues remained unchanged yesterday at 7.94 percent for the third consecutive day.
Bonds sold by California issuers continue to trade at significantly lower prices than comparable bonds issued by other states in the wake of the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif.
California general obligation bonds due in 10 years are yielding 6.25 percent, up a basis point since Nov. 30.
The following are the results of yesterday's two-year note auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 7.57%
Low Yield . . . 7.53%

But Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell acknowledges he will have been unable to do much about it before he leaves office on Dec. 31.
In a draft report wrapping up an eight-month investigation, Mr. Koppell describes a conspiracy involving the systematic siphoning of large blocs of tickets to illegal brokers through Ticketmaster outlets and by corrupt box-office employees and concert promoters, managers and agents, among others. Although there have been several arrests and small fines levied during the investigation, there have been no major indictments, and the report is sketchy on what major reforms should be made. 
 "I think we're reasonably close, but we don't have enough yet to be nearly at the bottom," Mr. Koppell said in a telephone interview yesterday. He said he had no idea if his Republican successor, Dennis Vacco, would continue the effort. If not, the investigation, which was announced with a flourish last spring, may be ending with little more than a recommendation from Mr. Koppell for tougher sanctions against ticket scalpers and higher allowable markups for licensed ticket brokers.
Mr. Vacco could not be reached yesterday through his transition office in Buffalo.
Although illegal hoarding of tickets for resale at steep markups is hardly new, it has become an increasingly sore point for theatergoers, concertgoers and sports fans. They inevitably find that box-office tickets to major entertainment and sporting events sell out fast, only to emerge from illegal brokers at much higher prices.
Perhaps the most blatant example recently was the Barbra Streisand concerts at Madison Square Garden in June. Tickets at the Garden box office and Ticketmaster, listed at $350, $250 and $100, were gone within minutes. Brokers were later advertising them for as much as $1,700 apiece, and some concertgoers told of paying up to $2,000 a ticket.
"This conspiracy has led not only to the unjust enrichment of certain brokers and persons who control the original source of tickets," the report says, "but to a dual system of distribution -- one for persons with wealth or access; the other for the rest of the population who camp out in front of the box office all night only to find out that the best seats to an event are gone before they get to the window."
Such inequities undermine New York City, Mr. Koppell said in the interview. "Broadway is one of the reasons people come to New York," he said, "and if they can only get to see a show by paying hundreds of dollars, it's going to dissuade them from coming here."
The report is due for release shortly, with the announcement of a pending civil settlement with a large corporation, state officials said. But Mr. Koppell said that a central part of the investigation remains unfinished: an analysis of documents obtained by searches of New Jersey brokers. He also said that despite evidence that box-office people were colluding in the diversion of tickets, for bribes known in the business as "ice," there was not yet enough proof to bring charges.
Mr. Koppell said he had spoken with Mr. Vacco only fleetingly since the election in November and not at all about the scalping investigation.
Thus far, three unlicensed brokers who were arrested have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and been fined $250, and a Manhattan hotel concierge has pleaded guilty to ticket speculation and paid a $150 fine. Ten civil proceedings have also been brought against other brokers for scalping Steisand tickets, and another broker has been fined for scalping tickets to the Big East Conference basketball tournament in Syracuse. In addition, cases are pending against four Connecticut brokers and a Pennsylvania broker.
In the face of weak legal remedies against scalping, Mr. Koppell is proposing to toughen the penalties to provide for maximum civil fines of $5,000 per violation and criminal fines of up to three times the profit from illegal sales, or $5,000 for three or more offenses.
He also proposed that the legal markup for licensed brokers be increased by an unspecified amount. At present, licensed brokers may charge only $5 or 10 percent of the listed ticket price as their service fee, an amount that many brokers say is far below their business cost. Many licensed brokers now charge over the legal maximum, contending that they come under the exception of acting as an "agent of venue" rather than serving as a broker. But their markups, usually 25 to 38 percent, pale beside those of the unlicensed brokers and other scalpers, which can be as much as 10 times a ticket's face price, the report said.
Mr. Koppell also urged a new disclosure rule requiring producers or theater owners to specify how many seats were being withheld from initial public sale. The opportunity for the New York Legislature to write such changes into state law will come by next June, when the current provisions expire.
The report traces various sources of supply for the scalping underground. In particular, it says, the Streisand concerts -- where nearly half the seats were withheld from public sale by promoters, the house and the star herself -- illustrated "the kind of black market economy that has come to dominate most popular events."
State investigators traced some of the scalped Streisand seats to Ticketmaster outlets, typically counters in record stores and malls where tickets are sold for cash by employees who don't work for Ticketmaster. In the case of one outlet on Long Island, the report said, 40 blocs of seats were sold although only 17 people were on line, according to later Ticketmaster printouts. The outlet was not identified.
"I think that Ticketmaster can't help but know," said Mr. Koppell. "They promised to clean up their act but we have yet to see."
Larry Solters, a Ticketmaster spokesman in Los Angeles, said the company's 2,500 outlets nationwide are bound by an ethics code proscribing diversions to scalpers and that violators are terminated. He said that he had no information about this particular case.
The investigation also traced abuses to "the highest ranks of American commerce," the report said. As laid out in a public hearing held by Mr. Koppell in August, American Express had been offering holders of its platinim card a "concierge" service that put callers in touch with brokers for hard-to-get seats, at more than $100 over the legal resale limit. American Express said at the time that it was suspending the service.
Hotel concierges also commonly tapped unlicensed brokers for access to prime seats at illegally high markups, the report says, citing undercover investigations at eight top hotels: the Four Seasons, Marriott Marquis, Parker Meridien, Park Lane, Peninsula, Plaza, Ritz Carlton and Waldorf-Astoria.
Mr. Koppell said that his office had been negotiating with the New York Hotel Association to end the practice but that the talks collapsed when the group said it could not bind its members.
In an effort to establish whether box-office employees at Broadway theaters were diverting tickets to unlicensed brokers, investigators interviewed industry figures and examined box-office records for hit shows, the report said. "In September," it said, "we obtained search warrants and seized the records of four illegal brokers in New York and New Jersey." The records, it said, "reflect extensive transactions with Broadway box offices."
Also seized were "large numbers of premium tickets to hit Broadway shows which are unavailable at the box office or from licensed brokers."
Licensed brokers also commonly exceeded the legal markup but by less than the illegal brokers and consequently often do not have access to prime seats, the report says. But licensed brokers also trafficked with their unlicensed counterparts, routinely faxing price lists back and forth, it says.
Nor, it says, were licensed brokers immune to the illicit services. "Their records indicate that even they purchase tickets from out-of-state scalpers," the report said.

Middle-Class War

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the White House, the catch-phrase must have seemed like a good idea: Marry F.D.R.'s "Economic Bill of Rights" with Bill Clinton's campaign promise of a "middle-class tax cut" to dress up a necessary placation of the overtaxed as a "Middle-Class Bill of Rights."
But the first thing we don't need is a new assertion of economic "rights," long the basis for budget-busting "entitlements." Mr. Clinton proposes that all taxpayers subsidize a large portion of what some taxpayers will spend on college for their youngsters. 
 Making tax-deductible what some spend on higher education has appeal. But by increasing demand, it pushes up the exorbitant costs of college and does nothing to encourage students to work while studying. The only free-market way to encourage prestige colleges to cut costs and become competitive is to reduce subsidies and tamp down demand.
Let's say the unsayable: Higher education is a privilege, not a right, best to be earned by high-school scholarship merit and willingness to work or borrow. The notion that equal opportunity can be guaranteed by sprinkling degrees on everyone is going out with the welfare state.
The second thing we don't need is the embrace of "class" as a way to categorize American society.
Here's the current state of class warfare. To be a member of the Lower Class is to be a helpless victim of an unfair system, or a lazy bum. To be a member of the Middle Class is to be a wonderful mainstreamer, justly resentful of being put upon by the leeches below and top-hatted bloodsuckers above. To be a member of the Upper Class is to be selfish and sinful.
What kind of a warped outlook is this to apply to a quarter-billion Americans? Why let politicians patronize the poor as pitiable Lowers, lionize those closest to median incomes as long-suffering Middles, and satanize the most successful and productive as greedy Uppers?
That applies political demography to outdated sociology. The divisive Marxist concept of class is social as well as economic, and Americans should never accept its confines. Class is not determined by income alone; richies can be low-class slobs and the genteel down-at-the-heels can be high-class povertarians.
Only because the vast majority of voters are near the non-poor, non-rich median do pols lump these diverse individuals together in a deliciously average economic/social "class," to be flattered and cosseted. But the people with the most voting power are not a class of any kind.
The "middle-class tax cut," which is at the heart of this rhetorical demeaning of our real Bill of Rights, is the newest way of saying "Let's keep on soaking the rich."
Since the poor, who pay little income tax anyway, are not much affected by Mr. Clinton's plan, the meaning of the M.C.T.C. is plain: Exclude those nasty richies from the relief we give the deserving middle. Republicans with their own M.C.T.C. labeling go along with the politics of populist resentment.
But the evokers of class warfare are out of step with the people they purport to speak for. Most of them see the problem with taxes not as "The rich are not paying their fair share," but "We're all paying too much, especially me."
People near the median would like to keep what they earn, make the savings work for them and thereby become "upper class." Such ambition is not to be apologized for; it used to be described as the American Dream.
Central to the Clintonite exclusionary sell is that the richies stole everybody else blind in the 80's. But from 1982 to 1989, as Reaganites cut tax rates, the income of those closest to the middle rose sharply.
Another Big Lie is that the Republicans caused the deficit explosion. Throughout the 80's, the primary pressure to spend came from Tip O'Neill's Democrats. As tax rates fell, tax receipts rose, as supply-siders predicted, but the spending binge -- insufficiently resisted by Ronald Reagan -- came from House Democrats who now pretend the G.O.P. was solely responsible for quadrupling the deficit.
In Clinton's coming Republican half-term, the healthiest and fairest tax relief will be across the board, flattening rates and closing loopholes for everyone -- all-class, no-class economic policy.

HEADLINE: We Couldn't Live With a Balanced Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Americans just don't get it: balancing the Federal budget is not the same as balancing a checkbook. While the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll suggests that more than 80 percent of the public supports a constitutional balanced-budget amendment (front page, Dec. 15), I fear that only a handful realize what this entails. 
 The Republican Contract With America, for example, argues that a balanced-budget amendment will restore "fiscal responsibility" to Congress and will require its members "to live under the same budget restraints as families and businesses." But almost none of us in the private sector balance our budgets -- and a constitutional balanced-budget requirement is irresponsible.
Consider what life would be like if households and companies operated under the same rules that some now want to impose on the Federal Government.
Individuals would need to pay cash not only for their cars and homes but also for a college education. Companies could not borrow when investing in equipment or constructing new plants, and the almost universal practice of capital budgeting (taught to all business students) would be abolished.
Few state, local and even national governments could live under this rule, for public-sector capital budgets are used widely at home and abroad.
Moreover, the amendment would be an economic and political toxin, not a tonic, when applied to our Federal Government. A balanced budget eliminates one of the few mechanisms to prevent mild downturns from developing into severe recessions. It also involves a fiscal straitjacket that can be stretched by a variety of well-known means, including the imposition of mandates on state and local governments and companies.
Passing a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution might make us feel good for a while. In the end, though, it will bring more citizen frustration and a further loss of confidence in our political institutions.

HEADLINE: Dean Rusk, Secretary of State In Vietnam War, Is Dead at 85

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Dean Rusk, who as Secretary of State for President Kennedy and President Johnson became a stubborn if much-criticized defender of the American involvement in the Vietnam War, died Tuesday at his home in Athens, Ga., with his family at his side. He was 85.
The cause of death was congestive heart failure, according to a spokesman for the University of Georgia. 
 Mr. Rusk, a former president of the Rockefeller Foundation, was Secretary of State all through the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, from 1961 to 1969. He returned to his native Georgia in 1970 and taught international law at the University of Georgia in Athens until he retired in 1984.
Other than Cordell Hull, who was Secretary of State for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930's and 40's, Mr. Rusk held the job longer than any predecessor -- a total of eight years. He felt driven to defend and justify the American involvement on the side of South Vietnam, when many in the public and in Congress turned against it in the later years of the Johnson Administration.
Some of the more memorable moments in Washington in the 1960's included Mr. Rusk's stout defense of the Vietnam policy in front of a Senate Foreign Relations Committee headed by J. W. Fulbright, who had broken with the policy.
As Secretary, Mr. Rusk played almost two different roles. Under President Kennedy, his position was much less defined, with the President often taking advice from other officials and not paying that much attention to Mr. Rusk. But Mr. Johnson, himself an outsider in the Kennedy Administration, relied increasingly on the advice of his fellow Southerner.
Mr. Rusk's belief, which he never tired of stating, was that the United States had a commitment to South Vietnam that it could not break without risking a larger war with China or Russia.
He declared again and again that "as far as the United States is concerned, we have a commitment to South Vietnam -- and we shall meet it."
Mr. Rusk was also deeply involved in the hot and cold American relations with the Soviet Union. He helped engineer the first arms control accords with Moscow. And he was President Kennedy's adviser when the Soviet Union, in Mr. Rusk's word, "blinked" during the Cuban missile crisis.
 
Praised by Johnson, Reviled by Protesters
 In the Johnson years, Mr. Rusk was praised by a grateful President, who said: "He's got courage. A Georgia cracker. When you're going in with the marines, he's the kind you want at your side."
But Mr. Rusk came to be reviled by anti-war protesters, who mobbed his appearances and shouted insults and slogans like "Murderer!" and "Stop the bombing!" By the end of his service, he rarely spoke to groups outside Washington for fear of provoking such protests.
Born in rural Cherokee County, Georgia, Mr. Rusk never lost his Southern accent, gracious demeanor and fondness for a good story.
During the increasingly bitter discussions about Vietnam in the mid-1960's, he was often asked by critics at public meetings why the United States was supporting a Government in South Vietnam that was not backed by its own peasants. To this he would answer: "I don't remember waking up in Cherokee County, pounding my chest, and saying, 'What has Woodrow Wilson done for me today.' " His anecdote usually led his audience to chuckle and won him time to continue his arguments for the need to persevere in Vietnam.
His background clearly had an impact on his days in Washington. In the 1930's, he was a Rhodes Scholar and used to recall the debates in Oxford over whether Britain should stop Hitler in his tracks when he was beginning to seize territory. The overwhelming sentiment, he remarked, was isolationist in Britain, and as a result only a few years later, Britain was forced to war to defends its island.
The moral he drew was that if America stopped the North Vietnamese now, it would not have to fight a larger war later.
Then and in later decades, his work as Secretary drew mixed reviews from historians, biographers and foreign-policy experts.
James Chace of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote in 1988, in The New York Times Book Review, that Mr. Rusk was "a good man -- loyal, intelligent and self-sacrificing -- who was marked by a fatal lack of imagination and who came to bear the onus for perhaps the most tragic failure of American foreign policy in this century, the waging of the Vietnam War."
 
Views on Vietnam Evolved to Firmness
 Mr. Rusk's views on Vietnam changed somewhat, but by the mid 1960's he believed firmly that that the United States had to be very forceful in confronting aggression by the army of Communist North Vietnam in South Vietnam, whose Government was pro-Western. Otherwise, he said, the United States would be perceived as weak and would invite further Communist aggression, which could touch off nuclear wars.
While Mr. Rusk was Secretary, the American role grew until almost 550,000 United States troops were in South Vietnam in 1969, allied with the shaky South Vietnamese Army against the North Vietnamese invaders and the Communist Vietcong insurgents. At the same time, United States bombers were pounding North Vietnam.
But he failed to foresee that the Vietnamese Communist forces would keep on fighting despite the vast United States intervention.
Eventually, the Nixon Administration progressively withdrew United States forces from South Vietnam. The last troops left in 1973, after more than 50,000 Americans had died in the war. The Communists then completed their takeover of the South, uniting it with the North.
The Vietnam War later was generally thought to be "the first war which the United States unequivocally lost," as the Yale historian Paul Kennedy wrote in his 1988 book "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers."
Yet Mr. Rusk did not admit any American errors when he was asked, "What went wrong in Vietnam?" at a news conference shortly before he left office with the end of the Johnson Administration in 1969. He quickly responded, "What went wrong was a persistent and determined attempt by the authorities in Hanoi to take over South Vietnam by force."
In interviews in later years and in his memoirs, however, he said he had made two mistakes about the Vietnam War: underestimating the tenacity of the North Vietnamese and overestimating the patience of the American people.
Mr. Rusk came to spend most of his time as Secretary dealing with Vietnam, and his role in some other notable foreign-policy spheres was less publicized and less crucial. He had only a minor hand in the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, early in the Kennedy Administration, by Cuban exiles trained and equipped by the Central Intelligence Agency. His role was partly passive during the Cuban missile crisis in late 1962.
In good times and bad, Mr. Rusk generally radiated self-confidence and solidity as Secretary. He stood 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 200 pounds, and even near the end of his time in office, he remained "dogged, durable, unfailingly courteous and considerate," as he was described then by the chief Washington correspondent of The New York Times, Max Frankel.
But Mr. Rusk's son Richard wrote, in a commentary included in Dean Rusk's memoirs, that his father began having chronic stomach pain in the months preceding the buildup in Vietnam in 1965. The son wrote that the pain was "never diagnosed and persisted into old age."
Before he became Secretary, Dean Rusk gained wide knowledge and experience in Asian matters and foreign affairs in general. He was a student at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in his early 20's and also studied in Germany.
Later he was an Army staff officer in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II and a senior State Department official during part of the Korean War. He took a particular interest in Asia as head of the Ford Foundation, which is based in New York, from 1952 to 1960.
In his memoirs, "As I Saw It" (Norton, 1990), Mr. Rusk said a major lesson he had learned from World War II "was that if aggression is allowed to gather momentum, it can continue to build and lead to general war."
Tracing what he saw as the evolution in Mr. Rusk's thinking on Vietnam, William Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1965, wrote later that by that summer, "Dean Rusk, skeptical in the fall of 1961 and uncertain in January of 1965 that South Vietnam had the political cohesion to be worth going all out for, had now concluded that to walk away from an American commitment, to temporize in our actions to meet it, to do anything short of all we possibly could, would pose the gravest possible danger to world peace."
 
'Widely Regarded As the Chief Hawk'
 As the war went on, opposition to the stepped-up American involvement grew more intense in the United States. In that period Thomas J. Schoenbaum, a colleague of Mr. Rusk's on the University of Georgia faculty, wrote in "Waging Peace and War: Dean Rusk in the Truman, Kennedy and Johnson Years" (Simon & Schuster, 1988), the Secretary "made himself the rock against which crashed the successive waves of dissent" and was "widely regarded as the chief hawk in the aerie of Vietnam advisers."
Critics also charged that Johnson Administration statements about the war could not be trusted, that there was "a credibility gap." Professor Schoenbaum wrote that in that era, in answering journalists' questions, Mr. Rusk "was often vague and evasive." "Although he denies having lied to the press," Professor Schoenbaum continued, "his half-truths and incomplete answers were frequently misleading."
Meanwhile, Mr. Rusk wrote in his book, the Johnson Administration made numerous "efforts to find a formula for peace with Hanoi" because "we wanted a negotiated end to the war." He wrote that he was told by Mr. Johnson soon after he became President, "Your mission is to bring about a peaceful settlement of this situation at the earliest possible moment."
But Mr. Rusk failed in that mission, despite halts in the United States bombing of North Vietnam that were meant to promote it.
More broadly, the Vietnam policies with which Mr. Rusk was so closely identified as Secretary came to be widely regarded as particularly dismal failures, and more than a few historians and other analysts came to hold critical views of his work on Vietnam.
Professor Warren I. Cohen, director of the Asian Studies Center at Michigan State University, wrote in his biography, "Dean Rusk" (Cooper Square Publishers, 1980), that Mr. Rusk had not grasped the extent to which "the 'aggression' of a national liberation movement is much more complicated morally and much harder to cope with politically or militarily" than the aggression of a great power.
The outcry against the war spread across America, spurred partly by the Communists' broad Tet offensive early in 1968, even though the attack was a military failure.
In March of that year Mr. Rusk, in another secret memorandum, argued against authorizing a further enlargement of the American ground force in Vietnam and advocated a cutback in the American bombing of North Vietnam. A shaken Mr. Johnson later that month decreed a sweeping cutback in the bombing. He also refrained from additional big troop buildups.
The partial bombing halt was followed by the inconclusive beginning of negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam in Paris, and Mr. Johnson later halted all bombing of the North.
 
Formula in Office: Endure and Survive
 In carrying out his manifold duties as Secretary, Mr. Rusk worked hard and persistently, traveling very widely. Despite grave East-West tensions, he succeeded in developing a fairly good working relationship with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko.
Nonetheless, others found fault with his overall performance as Secretary. Appraising it near its end, Mr. Frankel wrote in The New York Times: "His formula, under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, for self and country, was to endure and to survive, to keep playing a mediocre hand rather than risk all for a better one, and to stay around for greater achievement another day. He never stood for boldness or imaginative innovation."
President Kennedy originally chose Mr. Rusk as his Secretary of State, rather than some better-known figure, because as the historian and former Kennedy White House aide Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote in his book "A Thousand Days" (Houghton Mifflin, 1965), Mr. Kennedy "wanted to be his own Secretary of State."
He thought that Mr. Rusk, who had worked well in large organizations, was the right man to carry out Kennedy foreign policies. Mr. Schlesinger reported that the President came to be impressed by Mr. Rusk's "capacity to define" but depressed by his "reluctance to decide."
Mr. Rusk himself later concluded that he acted too deferentially when the fledgling Kennedy Administration was pondering plans for what became the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. In his book he wrote of his reaction when he heard about the plans: "Having been in the China-Burma-India theater in World War II, I knew that this thin brigade of Cuban exiles did not stand a snowball's chance in hell of success. I didn't relay this military judgment to President Kennedy because I was no longer in the military."
He reported that he privately expressed to Mr. Kennedy his opposition on non-military grounds.
But he wrote that in retrospect, "in replaying and rethinking everything, I wished that I had pushed my reticence aside and organized resistance to the invasion" in the Administration.
The invasion was quickly crushed by Fidel Castro's forces. Mr. Rusk wrote that out of loyalty to Mr. Kennedy, he did not let it be known at the time that he had privately opposed it.
 
A Reserved Role In Missile Crisis
 Mr. Rusk also chose to play a somewhat passive role at the outset of the Cuban missile crisis of late 1962, which was one of the tautest cold war standoffs between the United States and the Soviet Union. It arose after the Kennedy Administration learned from aerial photographs, taken on Oct. 14, that Soviet missile-launching installations were being constructed secretly in Cuba.
Mr. Rusk held back from the debate among the President's advisers. In his book, he wrote that "as Secretary of State, I felt that I should hold myself in reserve and hear all points of view before giving my recommendation to the President."
After five days of secret Administration deliberations, he wrote, he and Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara recommended to the President that he order a partial naval blockade of Cuba.
Mr. Kennedy did so, and also threatened to retaliate militarily against the Soviets if a missile were to be launched from Cuba. Not long afterward, the tension eased somewhat when, as Mr. Rusk recalled in his book, several Soviet ships that were suspected of carrying missiles for delivery in Cuba "stopped dead in the water, then turned around and headed back to the Black Sea."
He added, "When we heard this news, I said to my colleagues, 'We are eyeball to eyeball, and the other fellow just blinked.' "
The crisis ended on Oct. 28 when Nikita S. Khrushchev declared in Moscow that the missiles would be pulled out of Cuba under United Nations supervision.
Mr. Rusk went on to help bring into being the partial Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty that was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain in 1963. Other nations later adhered to it.
After Mr. Rusk stepped down as Secretary in 1969, it took a while for him to find a permanent job. Professor Schoenbaum wrote, "Not only did he have difficulty finding work, but many people, including many former friends, despised him."
Mr. Rusk went on to become Sibley Professor of International Law at the University of Georgia at Athens, in Clarke County, 45 miles southeast of his native Cherokee County.
 
A Native Georgian And Star Student
 David Dean Rusk was born in Cherokee County, Ga., on Feb. 9, 1909, the son of Robert Hugh Rusk, who had been obliged by a voice ailment to quit the Presbyterian ministry, and Elizabeth Clotfelter Rusk.
Robert Hugh Rusk went on to farm and teach school for some years in the county, and as a small boy there, his son ran around in underwear made from flour sacks. Then the family moved to Atlanta, where the father became a mail carrier, and young Dean became a star high school student. He went on to work his way through Davidson College, in Davidson, N.C., where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1931.
Going on to St. John's College of Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, he earned an M.A. degree in philosophy, politics and economics in 1934.
He then worked at Mills College in Oakland, Calif., from 1934 to 1940, teaching Government and International Relations and serving as dean of the faculty while also studying law at the University of California at Berkeley.
An Army Reserve officer, Mr. Rusk was called to active duty in 1940 and remained in uniform until 1946, rising to the rank of colonel. He saw service with the military intelligence branch of the Army General Staff, as a staff officer under Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell in the China-Burma-India theater and back in Washington, in the Operations Division of the War Department General Staff
He joined the State Department in 1946 as assistant chief of the division of international security affairs and went on to serve as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of War in 1946 and 1947 and as head of the State Department's United Nations desk from 1947 to 1949.
From that year until 1951, he was successively an Assistant Secretary of State, a Deputy Under Secretary and Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs.
As president of the Rockefeller Foundation, he wrote in his book, he felt that "the third world, where two-thirds of the world's population live, was a time bomb for the entire human race," adding, "We channeled more funding to the developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia."
Mr. Rusk was married to Virginia Foisie in 1937.
He is survived by his wife; two sons, David of Washington and Richard of Bishop, Ga.; a daughter, Peggy Smith of Stafford, Va., and six grandchildren.
A funeral service is planned at Athens First Presbyterian Church.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of former Secretary of State Dean Rusk misstated the position held by the late Richard M. Bissell Jr., a planner of the Bay of Pigs operation against Cuba. He was a special assistant and a Deputy Director for Plans at the C.I.A., but was never the Director of Central Intelligence.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MEXICO: THE OVERVIEW;
WITH PESO FREED, MEXICAN CURRENCY DROPS 20% MORE

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Mexico's economic crisis deepened, sending the peso plummeting nearly 20 percent further today, after the Government adopted an emergency plan late Wednesday night to allow the currency to trade freely against the American dollar.
The decision to float the peso was made under extreme pressure by the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who took office only three weeks ago, to calm financial markets after several days of intense speculation and plunging indexes. 
 The peso was previously controlled by a trading band that let it fall not much lower than 3.46 pesos to the dollar before the Government intervened.
This floor was dropped on Tuesday to just over 4 pesos to the dollar. But the resulting confusion, which battered Mexican stocks, led the Government Wednesday night to give up and allow the peso to trade freely. Today, the peso closed at 4.80 to the dollar -- down almost 30 percent for the week.
The casualties of the devaluation included United States banks, mutual funds and private investors who hold high-interest Mexican treasury notes that are now worth substantially less as a result of the cheaper peso.
Companies that have invested heavily in Mexico reacted with alarm to the peso's plunge. Manufacturers that export to Mexico face losses because those goods became more expensive on paper this week.
Several companies said the sudden devaluation had sorely tested their confidence in the Mexican Government, which had long pledged to defend the currency. Now, some fear that the economy is headed for a period of wage and price inflation, and even the risk of new recession. [Page D1.]
Critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement said the peso's steep drop, by making Mexican exports to the United States much more competitive with American goods, would make the United States regret its agreement to freer trade. [Page D4.]
Stockholders of Mexican companies were also hurt when values of their shares plunged on the Mexican stock exchange. The depreciation fell hardest on companies that are loaded down with debt that must be paid back in dollars.
The faltering of what had been considered Mexico's textbook economic restructuring, a model copied by other Latin American countries, amplified investor disillusion concerning the resolve and abilities of Mr. Zedillo's economic team and its economic policies.
The Mexican stock market today had one of the year's most erratic trading days, yet made up some of the heavy losses of the last few days with an increase of 4.7 percent at the close. But in New York, Mexican issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange plunged nearly 20 percent.
Many American investors said that they felt misled by President Zedillo's administration, which had tied its currency problems to reports of a renewed offensive by Indian rebels in Chiapas -- especially after it became known that the rebels had not made any substantial gains.
The abrupt devaluation also angered investors because the Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche and other officials had said only last week that the Government saw no need to devalue the peso.
The currency changes will have a profound effect, at least temporarily, on trade between Mexico and the United States. American exports overnight became more expensive, although the Government has ordered that domestic prices be frozen for at least 60 days. But Mexican exports to the United States are expected to enjoy a big boost because the sudden decline in the peso makes them cheaper.
There is usually an export advantage to a currency devaluation, but financial experts believe that Mexico's gains will be threatened as pressure builds to increase wages and the rate of inflation creeps back up.
To help Mexico defend its currency, the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve today gave it permission to exchange up to $6 billion worth of pesos for an equal sum in dollars, and the Canadian Government authorized an exchange up to $1 billion (Canadian).
Mexico can use the dollars to buy pesos in foreign-currency markets, bidding up the peso's value or at least restraining its fall.
Much of the criticism about the week's events has been directed at Mr. Serra, a Yale-educated economist familiar to many investors as Mexico's chief negotiator for the North American trade pact.
Mr. Serra flew to New York today and met with about 100 investment bankers and analysts to explain his actions and to try to rebuild confidence that was shattered when he announced on Mexican television early Tuesday morning that the peso-to-dollar exchange rate would be increased, still insisting that this was not a devaluation.
"I did not find it convincing," said John F. H. Purcell, managing director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers, who attended the meeting today. "I think it's going to take them a very long time, probably the whole of this administration, to regain the confidence of investors."
Mr. Purcell said the audience had expressed "a tremendous amount of hostility and a sense of betrayal."
The peso has been devalued so often over the past three decades that many Mexicans have come to expect it. Several devaluations have come before Christmas or Easter, prompting measured annual runs on the peso at these times. The devaluation in 1982 set off Mexico's debt crisis, which later spread to many Latin American countries.
The trading band for the peso was instituted in 1987 and maintained until it was abandoned yesterday. The band was intended to rebuff deeply rooted public fears by letting the peso slide by a minute daily amount in order to avoid the kind of shock that occurred today.
Some economic experts had insisted that Mexico's peso was overvalued. The peso stunted Mexican exports and added to a crushing trade deficit that could approach $30 billion next year.
Protecting the peso's value also forced the Mexican central bank to push up rates on treasury bonds, sometimes above 18 percent, which some economists believed stunted Mexican economic growth.
Over the last six weeks, such analysts expected the Government to accept the need for devaluation. But former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his Finance Minister, Pedro Aspe, refused to do so, leaving the problem for Mr. Zedillo.
When rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army threatened to resume hostilities in Chiapas beginning early this month, stock investors, uncertain of Mr. Zedillo's ability to handle the problem, began retreating and dumping their pesos for dollars. Mexican officials estimate that no less than $4 billion left the country over the last month.
On Monday, the Zapatista leader, known as Subcomandante Marcos, announced that rebels had occupied 38 municipalities in Chiapas -- a report that later was found to be untrue. The peso plummeted and the stock market had one of its worst trading days of the year.
After meeting late Monday night with Mexican business and labor leaders, the new finance minister Mr. Serra announced Tuesday morning on Mexican television that the peso would be technically devalued by 53 centavos. That only encouraged speculators.
"It was like defending a castle without bullets," said Eduardo Cepeda, managing director of J. P. Morgan in Mexico. "If you declare that you do not have the reserves to defend the peso, and then you declare a new trading floor, well basically you know that the enemy will storm the castle."
By last night, when Mr. Serra called other Cabinet ministers together for a damage-control meeting, the reserves of the Mexican central bank were reported to have dropped to as low as $6.5 billion, and the stand-by swap agreements with the United States and Canada for $7 billion were activated. About 11:15 P.M. the national television news program reported that the traditional trading band had been jettisoned in favor of a free-floating peso.
Kristin Lindow, a senior analyst with Moody's Investors Service in New York, said Mexican banks would be hard-pressed to handle a free-floating peso and that some would probably need help from the Government to withstand a run on the banks. She also said that some Mexican companies without export business might need to be bailed out, especially if they had taken on foreign debt.
Ms. Lindow said that any chance of Mexico's receiving an investment-grade rating on its Government debt in the near future had grown more distant. It now has a Moody's rating of Ba2, two notches below the lowest investment grade.
Mexican banks, already hit hard by lower profit and large portfolios of bad loans, tried to play down the latest disruptions.
Manuel Somoza, director general of Banco Mexicano, said the devaluation had not caused a panic because the Mexico of today is different from the Mexico that existed in 1982. Then, oil was practically the country's only export and its productive capacity was weak and business, uncompetitive.
"I'm quite calm," Mr. Somoza said. "I plan to have a great game of golf on Saturday and then a magnificent Christmas dinner with my family on Sunday."
But some commercial banks in Mexico City were selling dollars today for 5.50 pesos, compared with just over 4 pesos on Wednesday. And one exchange facility in the border town of Nuevo Laredo, where trading is usually volatile, offered as many as 6.50 pesos to the dollar.
Brokerage houses in the capital had a roller-coaster day. "I didn't sleep at all last night," said Daniel Somuano Spears, a trader with Valores Finamex. "It's as if we're in a different country and everything has changed in the last two days."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Cheaper Pesos: Some Fallout"
 
STOCKS -- Mexican companies that borrowed dollars will need more pesos to pay off those loans, and their profits may suffer.
 
IMPORTS -- From cars to cardboard, American goods sold in Mexico are expected to cost more, after a 60-day price freeze expires.
 
WAGES -- With reduced power to buy imported goods, Mexican workers are likely to push harder for higher wages, increasing Mexican inflation.
 
EXPORTS -- Goods produced wholly Mexico may well fall in price in the United States. But goods assembled in Mexico from U.S. parts and sold north of the border, which make up a large share of Mexican exports, are unlikely to be affected. (pg. A1)
 
Graph: "A Raging Bull Takes A Fall"
 Stock offerings in Mexico available to foreigners have generally enjoyed a bull market since Carlos Salinas de Gortari became President in 1988. But values plunged this week after Mr. Salinas's successor decided to devalue the peso and then let it float against the dollar. The index shown, the Financial Times-Actuaries world index for Mexico expressed in dollars, covers about 80 percent of the total value of stock available to foreign investors. Graph tracks weekly closes since the beginning of 1988. (Sources: Datastream; Goldman, Sachs & Company) (pg. D4)

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MEXICO: WASHINGTON;
Political Perils Showing In Free Trade Accord

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Ross Perot is not quite saying "I told you so," but he and other critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement are coming pretty close.
To the discomfiture of the White House, which has counted the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement as one of President Clinton's clearest triumphs, this week's financial turmoil in Mexico has revived the political perils involved in the agreement. And the peso's steep drop in currency markets, by making Mexico's exports to the United States much more competitive with American goods, can only make the President's job more difficult. 
 If more goods from Mexico start pouring into United States markets, how will the White House persuade the public that free trade enriches the country and does not destroy jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs?
Several Administration officials were quick to point out privately today that the peso's plunge might not have much effect on trade. Decisions to buy and sell goods across international boundaries are typically made many months in advance, and nobody knows how long the peso will stay at its current value, said the officials, who insisted on anonymity.
Economists typically estimate that it takes at least six months for a shift in exchange rates to show up in trade patterns, and then the changes generally are slow to happen. Still, none of that prevented Mr. Perot from enjoying the moment.
It is not clear who will benefit politically from the troubles in Mexico, other than Mr. Perot and perhaps any liberal Democratic challengers to Mr. Clinton's renomination for President. A broad coalition of moderate Democrats and Republicans were involved in the passage of the agreement and, earlier this month, a global free trade pact.
During his campaign against the North American agreement last year, Mr. Perot had warned that the Mexican Government would devalue the peso by 25 to 30 percent in 1994 and unleash a flood of low-priced goods on the American market once trade barriers were removed.
"I do not want to be vindicated, and I would like to be wrong," Mr. Perot said in a telephone interview today.
While most professional economists may disagree with what Mr. Perot says, other critics of the agreement, like Ralph Nader, were quick to join him today in denouncing the Administration's decision to make available a $6 billion line of credit to Mexico. "Nafta was supposed to be about two-way trade, not U.S. taxpayer welfare to prop up the Mexican peso and the Mexican oligarchs," said Mr. Nader, the consumer activist and critic of free trade.
The agreement took effect on Jan. 1 of this year, immediately eliminating three-fifths of the tariffs on trade among Canada, Mexico and the United States and gradually eliminating the rest over 15 years. The House and Senate approved it in November of last year after vigorous lobbying by the Clinton Administration.
Administration officials refused to discuss the free trade pact publicly today, as part of a general reluctance to offend Mexico or frighten financial markets already agitated by the peso's 28.1 percent fall.
Some Administration officials, though, pointed out today that by conventional economic theories, the total volume of trade matters much more than surpluses or deficits with one nation. Trade allows each country to specialize in producing whatever goods it can make most efficiently, while importing the rest. This specialization increases economic output around the globe.
That argument may score with economists, but politically, trade balances between nations take on great importance, notably in the case of Japan.
Through October, the United States surplus with Mexico rose to $1.71 billion from $1.32 billion in the first 10 months of last year, although in October the United States ran a rare deficit of $89 million. This, and the fact that relatively few jobs have been lost to low-wage Mexican competition, has helped the Administration to silence the critics from organized labor, environmental and consumer groups who fought the agreement last year.
The main reasons cited for the Mexican action this week -- two political assassinations, a guerrilla insurgency in southern Mexico and a change of government -- are not what Mr. Perot specifically mentioned. But the effects could be the same: the shrinkage or elimination of the United States' trade surplus with Mexico, as the falling peso makes American goods more expensive in Mexico and Mexican goods cheaper here.
At a hearing before a House panel on March 24, 1993, Mr. Perot warned that, "These guys are just playing poker with us, and they are going to have to devalue the peso."

HEADLINE: THE SUBWAY FIREBOMB: THE OVERVIEW;
Police Say Firebombing Suspect Planned Subway Extortion Plot

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
The unemployed computer expert accused of making the firebomb that literally exploded in his face on a crowded subway train on Wednesday was plotting to set off a series of firebombs in a bizarre extortion scheme to hold New York City's subways and their riders ransom, police officials said yesterday.
The critically burned suspect, Edward J. Leary, 49, was arrested in his hospital bed around 2 A.M., an hour after officers searching his house in Scotch Plains, N.J., found a half-dozen pages of angry handwritten notes referring to the extortion plan. They also discovered bomb-making instructions as well as glass jars, nine-volt batteries and kitchen timers identical to those the police believe were used to build the firebomb. 
 "There were passages that describe placing bombs on the subway and then contacting the authorities and the press with demands," said one official, who, like others involved in the case, spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
Other officials said the notes contained sketches of bombs, detonating devices, plans for placing bombs on trains and even drawings of lines of people being riddled with bullets.
Police officials believe that the firebomb that exploded on the southbound No. 4 train on Wednesday afternoon, injuring more than 40 people, was actually Mr. Leary's second bomb, coming less than a week after a similar device caused a fire on a subway train passing through Harlem. Officials say Mr. Leary was apparently on his way to plant the second firebomb when it ignited accidentally.
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said the materials found in Mr. Leary's home were "consistent with both devices."
The plan, the police theorize, was for Mr. Leary to carry the firebombs onto the subway looking like packages -- Wednesday's was in a paper shopping bag that, some riders said later, reeked of gasoline. He would then set the timer and get off the train, leaving the device to go off later, the police said.
Investigators added that the notes indicated the devices were intended to go off in a tunnel, rather than at a station, presumably to cause maximum fear and chaos for riders.
The investigation, said John Miller, the Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Information, "suggests there was a scheme to create an air of fear and use that fear at a later time to extort money."
Mr. Leary was charged with 45 counts of first-degree assault, one for each injured passenger. District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said the charges would insure that if convicted, the suspect would spend "the rest of his life in state prison." Other charges are possible, he said.
Mr. Leary, who suffered burns over about 40 percent of his body, was among 16 people who remained hospitalized yesterday because of the explosion. Mr. Leary was being treated at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and the police have only been able to have short interviews with him.
Most of the information the police have got from him came from disjointed conversations in the ambulance and one interview with a detective in the hospital, Mr. Miller said.
"He could die," Mr. Miller said.
In addition to Mr. Leary, two other people remained in critical condition, a 60-year-old man with deep burns over 65 percent of his body and a 40-year-old woman with burns over 35 percent of his body.
As investigators worked to understand the motives in the case, they also learned more yesterday about Mr. Leary's movements on Wednesday both before and after the explosion. They said he drove to Brooklyn on Wednesday morning after telling his wife he was going to look for work in the financial district. He later took a train to Manhattan and after the explosion he took a zigzagging subway trip back to Brooklyn.
Although investigators say it is clear that his motive was extortion, they do not know exactly who -- the Mayor, the Transit Authority or other officials -- was supposed to pay the extortion.
Nor was it clear what prompted the extortion campaign. Mr. Leary, who had been unemployed for a year, had taken out a $224,000 mortgage from Citibank when he bought his New Jersey house in 1993 and also owned three apartments in Brooklyn. He has been trying to sell two of the apartments. The third is occupied by a rent-controlled tenant who paid less than $250 a month for an apartment that would otherwise rent for about $900.
Police officers and Federal agents who searched Mr. Leary's 10-room frame house in Scotch Plains, which was decorated with strings of white Christmas lights and a large American flag, found a trove of bomb-making supplies spread around the floor of a den near the fireplace, law-enforcement officials said.
In addition to the mayonnaise jars, wires, timers and batteries, officials said, there were containers of gasoline, believed to have been used in the devices. And, officials said, there were instructions for making firebombs. Local authorities had been called several times in recent months to investigate mysterious fires in Mr. Leary's house.
The searchers found the half-dozen handwritten pages, which officials described as a kind of memorandum or outline of the plan to plant the firebombs on the subway and then demand a payoff to stop the bombings. Some of the notes, officials said, were extremely technical, while others were described as "rambling, with lots of anger." "Diversionary explosions" were mentioned, an official said, and there were drawings of bombs and remote-control devices.
In addition, the police found mention of making a videotaped set of instructions for building a bomb, along with a number of videotape cassettes. A search warrant is being sought to view the tapes.
Mr. Leary was remembered over the past day by those who knew him as a cantankerous, combative man, who quarreled with fellow members of his Brooklyn co-op board over the costs of redecorating the building and annoyed his suburban neighbors with his habit of constantly chopping wood.
When these people attempted to describe him, one word kept coming up: "weird." He had been dismissed from his last job, as a computer systems architect at Merrill Lynch, the company said, for "performance reasons" last January.
The police were not sure yesterday what caused the firebomb to go off prematurely, setting several passengers ablaze and sending hundreds scattering in terror, abandoning briefcases and Christmas presents.
From Mr. Leary's injuries -- his face burned, his hands scorched, the bottoms of his trousers shredded by flame, his legs burned and his sneakers virtually fused to his feet -- it appeared he was seated, holding the shopping bag between his legs. One possibility is that he was setting the timer and touched off the firebomb by mistake.
In the incident aboard the train in Harlem in which two teen-agers were burned last week, the police had originally suspected that a 13-year old girl had been carrying the device in her backpack. But police officials now say that they believe she was not involved and that further investigation suggested that the firebomb had actually gone off under the seat of the train.
Police officials would not say specifically how the firebomb worked. But Christopher Ronay, former head of the F.B.I. bomb laboratory, now at the Institute of Makers of Explosives in Washington, said the batteries had to have been connected to an igniter, like an electric match, a light bulb or a flash bulb.
He added: "Odds are the igniter would be inside the jar, but not in the liquid, and when it pops it breaks the jar, spewing out the fuel and ignites the fuel.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MEXICO: CORPORATE INVESTMENT;
U.S. Business Gets Mexican Shock

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

 BODY:
To protect its investment in plants in Mexico, the Chrysler Corporation has periodically considered hedging against fluctuations in the peso. But it has always decided that hedging was not worth it.
Then the peso dived 28.1 percent this week, falling from 29 American cents on Friday, to 20.83 cents yesterday. "I was shocked," said Bob Lippens, Chrysler's senior international economist. "The new Government had sworn up and down that the peso was essentially untouchable." 
 The effect of the change on the Chrysler is obvious, he said. "It reduces our profits; that's pretty clear, straight up," Mr. Lippens said.
Companies that have invested heavily in Mexico reacted with alarm yesterday to the peso's plunge. Several said the devaluation had sorely tested their confidence in the Mexican Government, eroding some of the good faith built up by the signing last year of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"They're just going to have to work hard in regaining investment confidence from the U.S.," Mr. Lippens said of the Mexican Government. "That doesn't come back overnight."
The devaluation underscored how intertwined the economies of Mexico and the United States already are. Executives at several companies said that, because they sell products with parts from both countries in both countries, the effect of the devaluation on their bottom lines and their business plans was unclear.
In general, American companies importing goods from Mexico that are made with Mexican components should benefit from the devaluation, since the goods will seem cheap to people paying in dollars.
But those selling products in Mexico whose components are mostly from the United States could see overall profits suffer, since the drop in the peso's value makes dollar-based goods more expensive there.
For example, the devaluation appeared to be a setback for America's Big Three auto makers who have been shipping more vehicles to Mexico as tariff barriers have declined. The Ford Motor Company says it will export about 25,000 cars and light trucks to Mexico this year, up from zero in 1992.
The companies selling goods in Mexico that are made in the United States cannot immediately pass their higher costs along to consumers there, they said, because the Mexican Government has asked them not to raise prices for 60 days.
No one, however, was talking about abandoning a market that all said holds great promise.
"We look at it as a cost of doing business internationally," said Jay J. Fitzsimmons, vice president of finance for Wal-Mart Stores. "We're in Mexico for the long term."
Mr. Fitzsimmons said that Wal-Mart's greatest concern was the impact of the devaluation on the Mexican economy. If inflation rises and the economy slips into recession, Wal-Mart might slow its expansion there. "The real impact going forward depends on how the Mexican consumer responds," he said.
Wal-Mart has moved aggressively into Mexico, opening 22 Sam's Clubs and 11 supercenters there in the last two and a half years; in the coming year, it had planned to open 13 more Sam's Clubs and 12 more supercenters. While Wal-Mart has bought almost all the land it needs for the stores, it may delay some construction, Mr. Fitzsimmons said.
Other companies, including Chrysler, said the peso's devaluation could actually accelerate their expansion in Mexico, by forcing them to switch more of their suppliers to Mexico from the United States. The weakness of the dollar against the Japanese yen has had exactly that effect on Japanese auto makers in the United States.
"We've been down this road before," said Fred Standish, a spokesman for Nissan Motor Company. On Monday, Nissan said that in the spring of 1995 it would begin exporting United States-made vehicles to Mexico for the first time. The devaluation should make those vehicles more expensive, but Mr. Standish said Nissan had no plans to change its strategy.
Some companies with large Mexican investments will suffer almost no impact from the peso's drop.
The General Motors Corporation's $25 billion parts-making operation, for example, has some 40 plants, employing about 40,000 people, just south of the United States border. But almost all the equipment in the plants, and all the materials used to produce wiring harnesses, steering wheels and other parts there, were bought in dollars in the United States to be sold in dollars.
"We really don't have much exposure down there," said Fred J. Bellar 3d, assistant finance director for G.M.'s Automotive Components Group Worldwide.
Similarly, the Ford Motor Company imports about 150,000 small cars -- Ford Escorts and Mercury Tracers -- from a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. But to comply with certain United States regulations, more than 75 percent of the parts in those vehicles are from the United States. As a result, on those vehicles, Ford should gain little from the peso's drop. Ford has also begun producing Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique compact sedans at another plant in Cuautitlan, but it was not clear what their Mexican content was.
In the short term, operations like G.M.'s and Ford's Hermosillo plant may have lower labor costs because of the cheaper peso. But Mr. Bellar, like other executives, said wages would undoubtedly rise in Mexico to match prices, erasing reduction in labor costs.
Indeed, without some increase in wages, one effect of the devaluation could be to further aggravate Mexican wage earners. "The immediate short-term effect of this is obviously going to be to cut purchasing power, which was already at perilous levels," said David M. Johnson, an international representative from the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers union who helps organize workers in Mexico.
The 60-day waiting period sought by the Mexican Government may sound Draconian, but it could actually have little effect on corporate books. For example, Mr. Fitzsimmons said Wal-Mart already stocked about 60 days' worth of dollar-denominated goods in Mexico. The cost of those goods has already been converted to pesos.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MEXICO: MARKET PLACE;
Investors Weigh a Market's Safety

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In large measure, Mexico's financial future rests with American investment firms. But the events of the last two days, the latest in a string of shocking surprises this year, have led some to wonder if Mexico is truly on its way to becoming a relatively safe place to invest.
"The assumption was that in 1995 Mexico would become investment grade," said Joyce Chang, a director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers in New York. "In the short term, that is not now likely to happen." 
 The stunning decision by Mexico to devalue the peso, and then allow its currency to float against the dollar, has shaken but not completely shattered Wall Street's confidence in Mexico's continued transition from a debt-ridden third world nation to a prosperous, free-market-oriented economy.
The damage suffered by Mexico's credibility can be measured in the way financial markets have treated the country's assets: In the space of two days, the value of peso-denominated assets like stocks and bonds have fallen by nearly 30 percent.
"We feel Mexico will recover," said Ed Cabrera, manager of Latin American strategy for Merrill Lynch & Company. "The question is how long that will take."
Yet even before the current crisis, money managers were starting to move substantial amounts of money out of Mexico. After heavy inflows from 1991 to 1993, it was a development that the members of the international financial community had anticipated.
"It is important that investors in these markets recognize the uncertainties, and it is probably most practical to take a medium-term perspective," said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute for International Finance in Washington, which represents commercial banks around the world.
Since the start of the year, most of the money that has flowed out of Mexico has come from its bond market, according to statistical estimates from the institute.
From a peak in February to Dec. 8, offshore holdings of peso-denominated bonds shrank by nearly two-thirds, to slightly more than $5 billion. That number is almost certainly smaller now.
The drop in equity holdings has not been nearly as severe.
At the end of November, the institute estimated, foreign holdings on the Mexican stock exchange and in Mexican stocks that traded in American depository receipts in the United States amounted to slightly more than $50 billion, down from a peak of more than $60 billion in January.
Those changes, along with the decision that many Mexicans have apparently made recently to get some of their own money out of the country, have driven down Mexico's foreign reserves to an estimated $8 billion, from about $30 billion at the start of the year.
"Two weeks ago," Ms. Chang of Salomon Brothers said, "people didn't think that Mexico would have lower foreign exchange reserves than Venezuela."
What had once been seen as only a slow seepage turned into a rapid outflow of funds this week.
On Monday, the day before the devaluation, the value of J. P. Morgan's emerging market bond index, a basket of 25 bonds, closed at 189.35. The index fell sharply on Wednesday, and was down by almost 3 percent yesterday, closing at 175.27. Since its peak in early January, the index has lost nearly 20 percent of its value.
There have been worse one-day declines. The biggest was on April 4, when the J. P. Morgan index fell by 4.2 percent. And on March 23, two days after the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated, the index lost 3.7 percent of its value.
Despite the carnage, some investors now see a chance to pick up bargains. "Investors are very angry about what has gone on, but a lot of people think it is too late to sell," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, head of Latin American equity research at Bear, Stearns & Company. "We have talked to a lot of clients who are looking for opportunities to buy."

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Was Split on Last Rate Increase

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's top policy-making committee was divided last month over how much to raise interest rates, according to the minutes of a meeting released today, as some members argued that too big an increase could damage the economy.
The final vote was unanimous in favor of the rate increase of three-quarters of a percentage point. But a minority of the members of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee initially favored a half-point increase, the minutes show. 
 These members argued that the five earlier interest rate increases this year, starting in February, had not had time to affect the economy. Therefore, they argued initially, an increase as large as the Fed ended up approving could hurt consumer and business confidence.
But these members eventually went along. They decided "they could accept the degree of restraint preferred by the majority because of the quite small difference in the effects of the alternative moves on the economy over time," the minutes said.
The disagreement is significant because it represents the first time this year that some members of the Fed have argued for a slower pace. Until now, the committee has been unusually unified, with only an occasional dissent in favor of an even faster pace of interest rate increases.
The committee consists of the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board, plus 5 of the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks.
But while the majority of the committee's members wanted to raise rates sharply on Nov. 15, there was much less enthusiasm for giving explicit discretion to Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, to raise rates even higher in the five weeks until the committee subsequently met last Tuesday. Over the objections of one member, the committee voted not to give the discretion, according to the minutes.
While the minutes do not identify the member, Alfred Broaddus Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has repeatedly led the push to raise rates further. He has voted twice this year against committee decisions to pursue a moderate pace of rate increases, arguing that a faster pace was needed.
The committee did not raise rates on Tuesday, but some analysts say they think its members did give Mr. Greenspan the explicit authority to act before the next meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. While Mr. Greenspan can raise rates without this explicit discretion, and has done so once this year, the Fed tradition has been that rate increases between meetings come with the committee's prior endorsement.
Committee members also acknowledged at the Nov. 15 meeting that they had underestimated earlier this year the strength of the economy and might have underestimated how long it would take for interest rates to show much effect.
In deciding to raise rates, according to the minutes, the committee members looked at signs of high economic growth that might feed inflation. These signs included low unemployment and high levels of factory output.

HEADLINE: Group to Widen Access To Federal Data Bases

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
A coalition of companies and universities plans to announce today an effort to make a variety of Government data bases available electronically at no cost to the public.
Begun with the Government's blessing as a technology demonstration project in January by the Internet Multicasting Service, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, the service is already providing via the Internet portions of the nation's Patent data base and many current corporate filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The project, which will be supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Sun Microsystems, the MCI Communications Corporation, R. R. Donnelley & Sons and Time Inc., will expand the data bases to include the text entries of the entire Patent data base, text and images from the Trademark data base and all current S.E.C. filings, as well as other Government data bases.
The public distribution of Government information has been controversial because some Government and industry officials have argued that free distribution of the data undercuts private companies that add "value" to such information and publish it electronically and on paper. Officials at the S.E.C. could not be reached for comment.
But the president of Internet Multicasting argued that there was room for both types of electronic services and that the information distributed over the Internet -- it is a global web of computer networks that let computer users send and receive electronic mail and exchange software and documents -- did not compete with more refined and immediate information now being sold through the commercial Lexis-Nexis on-line service.
"It is public policy that Government information should be publicly available on the information highway," said Carl Malamud, president of Internet Multicasting. "This is the basic fuel for the information economy."
While the Patent office is exploring ways to offer its data base to the project at low cost, Mr. Malamud said that he was paying $8,000 a month to purchase tapes from the Securities and Exchange Commission on a two-day delay basis and that the S.E.C. and its contractor, Lexis-Nexis, were planning to raise that to $11,000 beginning in January.
The project has the backing of the Clinton Administration.
The new House Republican majority also appears to be more friendly to the idea.
An appendix to the Republican Party's "Contract with America" contains the following statement: "We will change the rules of the House to require that all documents and all conference reports and all committee reports be filed electronically as well as in writing and that they cannot be filed until they are available to any citizen who wants to pull them up."
The Internet Multicasting Service is already supplying about 10,000 S.E.C. documents and 5,000 Patent Office documents via the Internet.
However, Mr. Malamud said he believed that number was artificially low and that as more commercial services like Prodigy and America Online began offering their customers full Internet access, the retrieval rates would rise.
As part of the new coalition, MCI has agreed to provide a high-speed data link between sites in Cambridge, Mass., and Washington, and M.I.T. will provide a second data site. By distributing the data bases over a private network, it will be possible to respond to requests more quickly.
An MCI executive said that Mr. Malamud's new kind of broadcasting service over computer networks was a valuable innovation.
"I think the rest of the world is listening to how valuable it is for a Government to provide information to its citizens," said Vint Cerf, an executive at MCI Data Services.
As part of the coalition, Sun Microsystems will contribute a computer work station, R. R. Donnelley will offer $100,000 in research internships at New York University and Time will include four ads in Fortune magazine publicizing the project.

HEADLINE: THE SUBWAY FIREBOMB: THE TRAIL;
Police Say Man Fled On Subway After Blast

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
The faded gray Dodge, its hubcaps missing, pulled into the spot on Smith Street, half a block south of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, shortly after noon Wednesday.
From his desk, the dispatcher at Atlantic Avenue Limo Ltd. watched through his storefront window as the man in the car with the New Jersey plates just sat for about five minutes. 
 "Then he got out and stood with the door open, one hand on the roof and one hand on the door," said the dispatcher, who identified himself only as Mack. "I figured he was looking to read the signs, the parking rules -- three, four minutes in the same position. That's when I thought there might be something unusual about him."
The police believe the man was Edward Leary, 49, the unemployed computer technician from Scotch Plains, N.J., who was charged yesterday morning with igniting a firebomb that wounded more than 40 passengers, including himself, aboard a southbound No. 4 train in Manhattan. The car, officials say, was registered to his wife, Marguerite.
Two hours after the car was parked, Mr. Leary emerged from the Clark Street Station in Brooklyn, bloodied and dazed from the explosion. Although officials initially believed that Mr. Leary ran through a subway tunnel to Brooklyn after the blast, investigators now believe he made a zigzagging journey on the subways, going north, south then north and south again, sometimes helped by passers-by.
One official said Mr. Leary told investigators that he left his home in Scotch Plains early Wednesday, telling his wife he was going to look for work on Wall Street. "The wife told detectives she was skeptical because of the way he was dressed," in sneakers and blue jeans under his green raincoat, the officials said.
After parking on Smith Street, Mr. Leary walked several blocks to board an IRT train, probably at Borough Hall, the officials said. They said he rode into Manhattan to 14th Street, then switched to the downtown No. 4. Minutes later, at 1:30 P.M., flames from a homemade firebomb engulfed one car of that train as it pulled into the Fulton Street station.
In the chaos after the explosion, detectives said, witnesses saw the man going up to the street and walking several blocks south to Wall Street. Several times along the way, the man was helped by passers-by who saw that he had been bloodied and burned.
At Wall Street, officials said, Mr. Leary apparently boarded a northbound No. 2 train to Chambers Street, but then got off and switched to a southbound train on the Seventh Avenue line. From there he rode to the Clark Street station in Brooklyn.
After riding an elevator to street level at the Clark Street station, officials said, Mr. Leary tapped James McNamara, a transit police officer, on the shoulder and said he wanted to be taken to a hospital. Responding to Officer McNamara's call minutes after 2 P.M., Officers Michael Ruiz and Anthony Roa of the 84th Precinct arrived in their patrol car.
"While we were waiting for E.M.S., we asked him a couple of questions," Officer Roa said. 'How did you get from Manhattan to here?' He replied, 'Through the tunnel.' I asked him again, 'Did you walk here, or did you take a train?' That's when he stopped answering questions; got kind of nervous."
As they escorted the ambulance across the river toward the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, they heard a description of the suspect broadcast over the radio.
"We realized it sounded very similar to the person being aided," Officer Ruiz said. At the hospital, Officers Roa and Ruiz told detectives of their suspicions.
At about the same time that Mr. Leary was asking for help at the Clark Street station, Officer Catherine Devine was taking a break from her assignment as a school crossing guard at Smith and Pacific Streets. "I noticed the car parked at an expired meter, so I issued a summons," she said. "I didn't think anything of it at the time."
But at 7 A.M. yesterday, during roll call at the 84th Precinct station house in Brooklyn Heights, the make and plates of Mrs. Leary's Dodge were read aloud. "I yelled, 'Bingo, this is it,' " Officer Devine said. "Everybody looked at me like I was joking. Then, after the sergeant repeated the number, I said, 'Yes, that's it.' "

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Zeneca to Extend Its Reach Into Cancer Care Services

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
In an unusual foray by a drug manufacturer into providing health care services directly to patients, the Zeneca Group P.L.C., a leading maker of cancer drugs, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy 50 percent of Salick Health Care, which operates cancer care centers.
The deal valued Salick at $440 million, according to Zeneca. 
 Although several big drug companies recently acquired companies that sell drugs by mail and through managed care health plans, industry experts said they could not recall another drug company that had bought a health care provider.
Shares of Salick, based in Los Angeles, jumped $5.375, to a 52-week high of $34.625, yesterday in Nasdaq trading. The American depository rights of Zeneca, based in London, declined 50 cents, to $41.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Salick's shareholders will receive $18.875 a share in cash from Zeneca plus 62.5 cents a share from Salick. They will exchange two shares of Salick for one new share in the company, with rights to sell it back to Salick in late 1997 for $42. Zeneca will finance that 1997 purchase. Salick has 8.5 million shares outstanding plus bonds convertible to 1.8 million shares and 583,000 unexercised share options.
David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, said the deal would take the company into "a complementary business area." Its Nolvadex for breast cancer and Zoladex for prostate cancer had combined worldwide sales last year of $775 million.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a University of Minnesota economist, said more drug companies would be acquiring related businesses, citing industry rumors that another drug maker was thinking of acquiring doctor groups and outpatient pharmacies. The Zeneca-Salick deal must still get regulatory approval.
Dr. Bernard Salick, chairman of Salick Health Care, said its 10 cancer care centers would not favor Zeneca products over competing drugs. "We never tell a doctor which drug to use," he said.
Salick, with sales of $131 million in the year ending last Aug. 31, operates cancer centers in California, Florida, Kansas and Pennsylvania.
Analysts gave the deal mixed reviews. Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Drug Research, said Zeneca was getting into a "completely unfamiliar" market and could have done better by increasing research spending.
But Robert Maines, a health care analyst with the First Albany Corporation, said Salick's growth could accelerate with the help of Zeneca's capital and worldwide contacts with cancer specialists.
Zeneca had 1993 sales of $6.57 billion, of which $2.77 billion were from pharmaceuticals.

HEADLINE: Economy Grew 4% in 3d Quarter; Inflation Is Up Slightly

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The economy is racing toward its strongest showing in a decade, with the Commerce Department reporting today that output grew at a robust 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter. So far this year, the economy has advanced at a 4.1 percent pace, the best since 1984.
The holiday cheer is tempered by worries that rising interest rates will check growth too abruptly after the Christmas shopping season. But no slowdown is showing up yet. 
 Private economists anticipate that growth in the final quarter of the year, now about to end, will be roughly 4 percent as well, putting the economy on target for its best annual performance since it surged 6.2 percent in 1984. Gross domestic product, measuring the total output of goods and services produced in the United States, increased 2.9 percent last year.
"We need consumers to be more cautious about spending in the future, to bring about the slowdown that we all anticipate," Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said. "The bottom line is, the economy is doing a bit too well."
With the exception of a moderating housing boom, higher interest rates have had limited impact. Rates on 30-year mortgages, which hit a three-year peak of 9.25 percent last week, slipped to 9.18 percent this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since February, hoping to slow spending and check inflation before it becomes unmanageable. Analysts, anticipating a seventh increase early next year, said it was only a matter of time before the credit squeeze took hold.
The latest data showed that inflation, though under control, was a bit higher in the quarter than previously estimated. An inflation gauge tied to the gross domestic product was revised upward to 3 percent from 2.8 percent, compared with 2.9 percent in the second quarter.
The Commerce Department also reported that after-tax profits of American corporations rose 2.5 percent in the third quarter, revised down from an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent, compared with 7.3 percent in the previous three months.

HEADLINE: A Last Briefing for Clinton Press Secretary

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
As Dee Dee Myers, the first woman to serve as White House press secretary, stepped down today, President Clinton dropped by her final briefing to bid her farewell and to say wryly that he was looking forward to "a very interesting year next year."
The informal moment in the White House briefing room captured some of the uncertainty prevalent in an Administration that will soon have a new spokesman and is trying to reshape its public face. 
 Aides to Mr. Clinton describe the President as dissatisfied with the quality of political advice he was given before last month's elections, including that from consultants to cast the contest as a referendum on Ronald Reagan's economic policies, a strategy that many believe was a mistake.
Ms. Myers, who is 33, resigned on her own accord and made clear today that she was looking forward to resuming life in the world beyond the White House. But her departure came only after Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, made clear this fall -- not long after his appointment -- that he would prefer to have someone else as Mr. Clinton's daily mouthpiece.
In the aftermath of what for him were disastrous elections in November, Mr. Clinton has begun to adopt a more centrist image. But his aides say he is still agonizing over whom to rely on for political advice as he prepares to do battle with the new Republican Congress and to fight for his own re-election.
Mr. Clinton was not ready today to announce whom he would install as the new Democratic Party chairman and who would fill several vacant White House posts. And his comments during his brief appearance at Ms. Myers's side suggested that he was not eager to talk about the road ahead.
"We don't have to talk anything serious today; this is Christmas season," said Mr. Clinton, whose eyes were baggy and face was puffy with what the White House said were seasonal allergies, but who nevertheless appeared in a good mood.
To laughter even from members of his staff, the President told reporters: "I hope you come back full of energy and bright-eyed and everything, because this is going to be a very interesting year next year. And I am really looking forward to it, more every day."
The President is now leaning toward choosing Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut as party chairman, regarding him as an effective spokesman who can help maintain ties to the Democrats' liberal base. But all that is certain about the rest of Mr. Clinton's political team, White House officials say, is that his current team of consultants -- including two strategists, James Carville and Paul Begala; his pollster, Stan Greenberg; and the media adviser, Mandy Grunwald -- will have diminished roles.
White House aides have said Mr. Clinton was particularly irritated by the role Mr. Greenberg played in polling both for him and for the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, which has at times been sharply critical of the President, who once headed the organization.
A post-election poll that Mr. Greenberg conducted for the leadership council identified the President's failed health care plan as having contributed to the Democrats' defeat at the polls by buttressing voters' impressions that the party was ineffectual. Mr. Greenberg was also reported to have irked other advisers when, after reviewing his dismal polling data at a White House meeting last month, he asked his colleagues, "O.K., what's the strategy?" -- the question they thought the party was lavishly paying him to answer.
Some associates of Ms. Grunwald have said they expected her firm to be dismissed from doing work for the White House and the Democratic National Committee, which has paid her firm more than $1 million since Mr. Clinton took office in January 1993.
But some White House aides say it is more likely that other consultants will be hired to take on some of her work, and they emphasize that she retains a close relationship with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
With the 1996 election campaign likely to move into high gear next year, Mr. Clinton plans to put a re-election team in place by early spring. But aides said it was far from clear who would head that operation, with the list of potential candidates including Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Harold M. Ickes, a deputy White House chief of staff.
Among the jobs vacant at the White House is that of political director, and Mr. Clinton has taken more than a month to decide who should fill it. While Doug Sosnick, a Congressional liaison, had been described as the leading candidate, White House officials said today that the most likely choice was now Debbie Wilhite, a Democratic strategist who spent the 1992 campaign as a top official at the Democratic National Committee.
Aides said that with Michael D. McCurry, the State Department spokesman, still expected to succeed Ms. Myers, Mr. Clinton was sensitive to the political danger that his inner circle might be seen as composed only of white men, a situation that the departing press secretary hinted at as she took her leave.
"I think it is always more difficult -- or often more difficult, not always -- for women to have the same authority and the same credibility that men have," Ms. Myers said. "I think that's changing. But I think there are still obstacles."

Dow Deal in Former East Germany

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Mich., Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company said today that it would buy three chemical plants in the former East Germany in a transaction worth about $2.5 billion, the largest investment by an American company in the former Communist-run nation.
The purchase is one of the largest in the former East Germany since the reunification in 1989, and is probably the last before the German agency selling the former state-run enterprises, Treuhandanstalt, closes down later this month. 
 The move expands the already-sizable European operations of Dow, based in Midland, Mich., which is the second-largest chemical maker in the United States.
"Dow's not assuming a lot of financial liability" and is gaining "a big site with access to Eastern Europe and the rest of the ex-Soviet Union," said John Roberts, chemicals analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Dow Chemical did not say how much it would pay to acquire the former state-run chemical plants in Leuna, Buna and Bohlen. The company and the Government will invest $2.5 billion in upgrading the plants, said John Lillich, corporate director of mergers and acquisitions at Dow Chemical, though the amount each will contribute has not been decided,
Not all of Dow's investment will be cash; it will include technology, technical and managerial expertise Mr. Lillich said.
Mr. Roberts said he expected that very little of Dow's investment would be in cash. And the money that Dow does contribute could be borrowed money backed by Government guarantees.
Dow Chemical's shares gained 87.5 cents to close at $68.375 on the Big Board today.
Before German reunification, the chemical plants were the heart of a thriving, although highly polluting, industry. By selling the plants to Dow Chemical, Germany hopes to revive former East Germany's flagging manufacturing economy, which collapsed after the fall of the Soviet trading bloc.
Dow agreed to preserve at least 2,700 jobs at or near the plants, which once employed more than 6,000.
"With this agreement an important milestone has been reached in preserving the significant German chemical industry," the Treuhandanstalt said.
Before reunification, the East German chemical industry employed 180,000 workers, who produced a range of products for the former Soviet Union and East bloc countries.
Today, about 40,000 people work in the industry, which worldwide has been hit by falling sales and the shift of production to growth regions like Southeast Asia.
The acquisition is not without its problems. The biggest is that the plants are landlocked and are not connected with pipelines that supply raw materials, said Dow's Mr. Lillich. That is one problem Dow will have to resolve with the government and suppliers, he said.
The poor condition of East German facilities and environmental problems have deterred other chemical companies from acquiring assets.

Bonds Fall as Demand Is Weak for New Notes

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday for the first time this week following weak demand at an auction of five-year notes.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 3/32 of a percentage point, to 95 31/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.85 percent from 7.84 percent on Wednesday. The new yields on the two-year note, which was auctioned on Wednesday, rose 14 basis points, to 7.71 percent. The spread between the long end and the short end is now just 14 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 The narrow spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bonds suggests increasing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again to keep inflation from accelerating as some investors accept less compensation for riskier longer-term securities. The spread was 36 basis points two weeks ago and 85 basis points a month ago.'
Traders said the auction of the five-year issue drew a high yield of 7.85 percent, or about three basis points more than had been expected. The higher yield served as a reminder that not everybody was willing buy longer maturities with the Fed seemingly poised to raise rates again in January.
The yield at auction was four basis points higher than last month and the highest since July 1991 when it was 7.89 percent.
Analysts noted that some of the market's weakness could be traced in part to the continuing turmoil in the Mexican market following the devaluation of the peso on Tuesday. There was speculation that the Mexican Government was actively selling some of its United States Treasury securities to raise cash to support the peso. Such a selloff, however, could be offset by foreign investors if enough swap their holdings of Mexican debt in favor of United States notes and bills, a more liquid investment.
James P. Fields, a vice president and portfolio manager at Wright Investors in Bridgeport, Conn., said bond yields had come down steadily since Nov. 7, when they reached a high of 8.16 percent. "More and more, it seems like people are getting more bullish on about bonds," he said.
He said that even if bond yields rose again because there were investors still concerned about inflation, the yields would still fall to about 7 percent by the end of next year. "There are going to be some rough seas during the next couple of months, but in the longer term the rates will come back down."
Asked about the market performance, Mr. Fields replied, "Today, it's not going in the direction we want." He said he thought the problem stemmed from people who still expected a bigger premium for taking a risk on inflation, something he believes has been overblown. And then, he noted, there are always the day-to-day worries over outside events or fundamentals. "But my guess is that the Fed will not move after its meeting next month."
Yesterday's only economic reports included the Government's estimate of third-quarter growth and weekly unemployment report for the week ended December 17. The Government nudged its estimate for the fourth quarter's gross domestic product up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent, in line with market expectations. The Labor Department reported unemployment up by 3,000, to 326,000. Economists had expected the number of claims to drop by 1,000.
In the municipal market, prices were little changed for the third consecutive day amid a drop in demand from mutual funds and selling buy investors to realize year-end tax losses.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues remained unchanged yesterday for a third day at 6.94 percent.
Traders in the corporate bond market said the decline in the Mexican currency made Mexico's Tepic Toll Road Trust an early casualty. The trust shelved a $300 million offering that was to fund construction of a key link in Mexico's highway system.
While the proposed issue of notes and cash flow securities were denominated in dollars, payments on the bonds were to have come from peso-denominated toll revenues. The deal has been shelved until January at least.
The following are the results of yesterday's five-year note auction:

HEADLINE: Out of 125th St., Vendors Are Welcome at Queens Market

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Barou Omar has had bundles of his colorful fabrics imported from West Africa seized in periodic police sweeps through 125th Street in Harlem, where he and thousands of other vendors tried to make a living.
The final blow came two months ago, when the city relocated the vendors to a lot on 116th Street. Business there was terribly slow, he said. 
 Now, he has pinned his hopes on Jamaica, Queens, after receiving a most unusual offer: he was invited to set up shop there.
Merchants and developers in Jamaica are gambling that the vendors who are unwelcome in many commercial zones throughout the city will help bolster business. They have even set aside valuable real estate, a section of the Jamaica Market, for the vendors. The sleek two-year-old Victorian-style market building is in the heart of downtown, at 159-15 Jamaica Avenue.
A food court is the building's centerpiece, with restaurateurs who serve food of all types, including ox tails, curried goat, smothered pork chops, chitterlings, collards and pizza.
Brian Williams, promotions manager for the market, which is operated by the Greater Jamaica Corporation, said restaurant owners have long complained that after the lunch rush ends, hardly any customers venture into the mall.
Instead of opening up space to chain stores to bring in more customers, the market solicited vendors from around the city, he said. A new post office branch is expected to bring in more customers.
"The vendors are individual operators, many of whom used to sell their products unlicensed on the street," Mr. Williams said. "By creating Market Square, we are giving them indoor locations so they can develop clientele, permitting them to operate year-round regardless of the weather, and converting their businesses from boards across two boxes into regular commercial operations."
Since November, 30 vendors have been selling merchandise from partitioned shops in a 3,500-square-foot area adjacent to the market's 160th Street entrance, between Jamaica and 90th Avenues. Vendors pay $350 a month for 200 square feet. Until a few months ago, the space was occupied by the farmer's market, which will be moved to the 160th Street sidewalk when it returns in April.
The market, open 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. Monday through Saturday, draws customers from several government-financed projects that have sprung in recent years, including the Federal building. On weekends, the market has drawn crowds with concerts, gospel singing and Kwanzaa festivals.
The new downtown buildings, including the market, have increased the economic viability of this commercial hub in southeastern Queens. Downtown Jamaica had deteriorated in recent years.
"The market is a great community resource that has been slow taking off," Mr. Williams said. "Opening he doors to the vendors is way of letting everyone know we're here."
Clothing, ceramics, vitamins, kinte cloth and other fabrics with streaks of gold, red and blue are laid out on tables in the vendors' area. During a recent lunch hour, a few customers wandered from booth to booth, but not as many as the vendors would have liked. The indoor setting did not have the fast pace of the street.
"I prefer to rent because I'm indoors," Mr. Barou, 30, who lives in Harlem, said as he snipped threads from a quilted coat he had sewed the night before. A native of Mali, he moved to New York City two years ago. "I'm not constantly being chased away by the police and my customers know where to find me. But it's slow. I'm going to see how long I can last here."
Hugh Rivers, 39, of Queens Village, used to make a living selling hats, coats, dresses, scarves and homemade greeting cards door to door at beauty salons, church fairs and street corners.
Now, he has a corner of his own at the market. He said it felt good to settle down and not have to worry about the police confiscating his merchandise.
"This is a good deal as far as being out of the cold weather," he said while seated in front of display case lined with greeting cards with African themes and clothes created by black designers. "I feel it's a good market. Most of the booths are black-owned and we need to do what we can to make it work.
"Did I make a sale today?" he said, checking his watch at 3 P.M. "Not since 11:30 A.M. If I was on the street I would have made a few sales by now."
While many of the merchants applaud the concept, some doubted that it would bring in customers.
"We're losing money," said Richard Lim, manager of Julia's Fish and Chips, who pays $1,250 a month for 343 square feet. "It's hard for us to pay the rent. I don't know if the vendors will bring in more people. We can only hope."
Steven Lowe, manager of Carolina's Kitchen, expressed similar sentiments.
"It's hard making ends meet," Mr. Lowe said during an afternoon lull recently. "We don't have the traffic flow we need. I welcome the vendors. We need something else to attract attention."
Karen Towns, 35, a social worker who works at 89th and 161st Street, said the vendors's market has been a good place to buy gifts.
"They've added real flavor to this food court," Ms. Towns said as she stood in line at Paradise Splash Caribbean Cuisine. "They all have quality merchandise, and you don't have to stand outside in the cold to look at what they have to sell. I look forward to coming here. Last week, the market hosted a Cuban jazz quartet. It was a pleasant surprise."

HEADLINE: County Plans Budget Cuts

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 22

 BODY:
Orange County supervisors today ordered $40.2 million in budget cuts over the next six months, giving department heads emergency authority to freeze salaries and lay off workers without usual constraints.
The reductions, which passed on a unanimous vote, represent about 17 percent of the county's discretionary spending through June 1995. 
 "Staff reductions are clearly expected to be significant," said Sheriff Brad Gates, who with the District Attorney, Michael Capizzi, and the health care director, Thomas Uram, had recommended the cuts.
Union leaders expressed dismay that they would not be consulted, saying they wished to work together with management during the county's financial crisis.
"This has all the aspects of a steamroller," said John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees Association, which represents 11,000 employees -- 70 percent of the county's work force.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off vs. Mark and Yen Despite Flight From Peso

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar, which had picked up strength from the financial turmoil in Mexico, ended lower against most leading currencies yesterday.
The dollar has benefited as investors fled Latin American stock and bond markets -- and their currencies -- since the Mexican Government devalued the peso by 15 percent on Tuesday and then decided to let it float. Dealers said investors sought the safety of dollar-denominated securities. 
 But in late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was weighed down by profit taking after reaching a four-month high against the German mark.
"There is the sense that the flight-to-quality sentiment will keep a firmer tone under the dollar," said Hillel Waxman, vice president at the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York.
In New York, the dollar fell from a high of 1.5835 marks to settle at 1.5745 marks, down from 1.5810 marks on Wednesday. It slipped to 100.15 Japanese yen from 100.48 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5475 from $1.5415.
Foreign-exchange markets felt little impact by a decision by the Bundesbank yesterday to leave German interest rates unchanged.
After the Mexican Government decided to let the peso float freely on world currency markets, the dollar strengthened further against the peso, rising to 4.8000 pesos, from 3.9870 pesos on Wednesday. The peso had been previously allowed to trade in a narrow band.
"Mexico, for a lot of us, was seen as the leading country in Latin America and these last couple of days call that into question," said Jay Pelosky, head of Latin America equity research at Morgan Stanley.
Following a meeting with Federal Reserve officials in New York yesterday, Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche of Mexico said in a statement that "the real exchange rate depreciation should lead to an expansion of exports and stimulate investment growth."
Elsewhere, investor worries over Canada's fiscal and political issues led the Canadian dollar to tumble to an eight-year low.
The weakness came despite heavy intervention from the Bank of Canada, which bought Canadian dollars to defend the currency.
In New York trading, the Canadian dollar fell to 71.44 United States cents from 71.73 cents on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
BASEBALL OWNERS IMPLEMENT A CAP ON PLAYERS' PAY

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Baseball's labor dispute, which prompted a mediation effort by the Clinton Administration in October and induced an offer of help from Jimmy Carter on Thursday, plunged to a new low early this morning when the owners rejected a new proposal from the players and implemented a salary cap, effective at one minute after midnight.
"There was no sense going further tonight and I recessed the negotiations," Bill Usery Jr. said 10 weeks after he began mediating the strike at the request of the Administration. "A deadline was set by owners and it was evident that we weren't going to reach an agreement by that time." 
 The collapse in the 133-day-old strike came hours after the players made a new payroll-tax proposal and former President Carter, who has in recent months held peace talks with North Korea, Haiti and Bosnia, contacted both sides offering his services if they thought he could be useful.
Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said he spoke with the former President briefly and would evaluate his offer, but Mr. Usery, when asked about Mr. Carter's offer, said, "The one thing I didn't think we needed at the moment was another mediator."
Mr. Carter's offer to serve as a mediator was made known Thursday afternoon to Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel who is monitoring the effort to resolve the baseball strike, White House officials said.
The officials expressed some surprise at the offer but said President Clinton did not plan to insert himself or the White House in any kind of intermediary role. It was the Clinton Administration that asked Usery to join the talks as the mediator in October.
In implementing the salary cap that was their first proposal June 14 and modified Nov. 17, the owners made baseball the third sport to have a salary cap. The National Basketball Association initiated it a decade ago, and the National Football League joined in this season.
The players union, however, will not accept this cap lightly. It plans to challenge the owners' declaration of impasse in negotiations before the National Labor Relations Board, charging that the owners did not negotiate in good faith, and very likely will attack baseball's longtime antitrust exemption in United States District Court.
"What we learned today was what we suspected all along," Mr. Fehr said at a news conference Thursday at the Capital Hilton Hotel. "When our proposal was summarily rejected -- this is the third or fourth time players have made sweeping proposals that were summarily rejected -- there was no discussion, no counterproposals. The owners measure every proposal against the salary cap. If it doesn't measure up, they don't want it."
Bargaining, the union chief added, "has consisted of them asking us to agree to a salary cap."
Mr. Usery, a 71-year-old private mediator, said he would report to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich this morning and subsequently to President Clinton himself. He said he was not withdrawing from the dispute but would re-evaluate his position. He said he was prepared to continue but added, "That may change after I report to the Secretary of Labor."
It was largely due to Mr. Usery's efforts that the players made their proposal Thursday. They had been reluctant to give in to the owners' demand for a proposal that would create a secondary tax on payrolls above a designated threshold, but they relented, one union lawyer said, under the mediator's "arm-twisting."
The players had been reluctant to consider an over-the-threshold tax because they thought it would prompt clubs to keep their payrolls at or below the trigger point and thus serve as a salary cap.
Their proposal called for three levels of secondary taxes: 5 percent on the part of payrolls over 20 percent but less than 130 percent of the average club payroll (about $31 million for next year based on this year's projections) 10 percent for the portion of payrolls over 130 percent of the average and 25 percent for the part over 160 percent of average.
Dave Montgomery of the Philadelphia Phillies, the figures filbert of the owners' negotiating committee, belittled the proposal as bringing "us no closer to the objectives we were talking about."
"Any new system must significantly restrain salaries," he said. "The payroll tax we have received simply does not create a significant or meaningful restraint."
After the negotiating committee rejected the proposal, the major league executive council, as it was empowered to do by a 25-3 owners vote Dec. 15, held a conference call and implemented the salary cap.
"Implementation is not forced upon them," Mr. Fehr said. "They do it because they choose to do it."
Announcing the council's action, John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox said: "Due to the continued existence of this deadlock and the need to prepare for the 1995 season, the executive council voted today to exercise Major League Baseball's right under Federal labor law to implement the clubs' final salary cap proposal, effective 12:01 A.M. EST Dec. 23, 1994."
The owners twice had postponed implementation. They canceled a Dec. 5 meeting at which they were going to take that action, then voted Dec. 15 in Chicago to delay impasse and implementation for a week.
Mr. Fehr, at the news conference, said he did not know precisely what the onwers were implementing but shortly before midnight he saw the message light on in his room and was told there was an envelope at the front desk for him.
Addressed to "Donald M. Fehr Esquire, Guest" the plain white envelope with no return address contained a five-page letter from Chuck O'Connor, the chief management lawyer, explaining why the owners were implementing the salary cap.
The parties, he wrote, "are plainly at an impasse" on the economic issues. Also included was a longer document with details of the new work rules.
In addition to the salary cap, the new system eliminates salary arbitration, establishes a salary scale for players in their first four years in the majors and creates restricted free agency for players who have four or more years of major league service but fewer than six years.
Unlike players with six or more years, those free agents will be restricted because their clubs can give them qualifying offers and reserve their right of first refusal, meaning they can match offers from other clubs and retain the players.
Mr. Fehr said the union had advised players and agents not to sign new contracts under the new system until the union has had a chance to study it and figure out possible implications.
The salary cap, which next year would force the Yankees, for example, to slash $4.1 million from what their 1994 payroll would have been if the season had been played in full, replaces the so-called free-market system the players prefer. The players long have vehemently rejected a salary cap, which the owners tried to get in 1985 and again in 1990.
Under the new system, the players will receive 50 percent of the industry revenue for salaries and all other player costs. A three-year transition period will precede the time the cap will take full effect. In 1994, 21 clubs were over what the cap would have been and seven were under it.
Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said some members of the players' negotiating subcommittee opposed making a proposal but other players favored it.
After the owners rejected the proposal, all of the players shared the view expressed by David Cone.
"It seems to me," the Kansas City Royals pitcher said, "anything short of total collapse by the players wouldn't have gotten a deal here. I was confused why we were not exchanging ideas. I took the idea that you try to take the higher ground and you try to find a deal. It seems legal posturing was more important to them."

Civilization And Its Price

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Not only Republican voters believe that governments in this country have become too expansive in their functions, too costly and too intrusive. Whoever wins elections, the years ahead are going to be a time of limits on what governments try to do.
But it is a different thing to believe, as some now seem to believe, that government is evil -- an unnecessary evil. To hear Newt Gingrich and his followers, the Federal Government should do little but maintain the national defense and pay out such middle-class entitlements as Social Security and Medicare. Everything else should be left to individual initiative. 
 In a world as complex as ours, and as interconnected, even the strongest individual necessarily relies on all kinds of government actions. There is a real danger that by enfeebling government we shall make the United States a less competitive country, and a less civilized one.
Adam Smith, the great advocate of market economies, nevertheless wrote that they needed government to educate the labor force, assure economic infrastructure and maintain public safety. Noting that view in the current issue of The Atlantic Monthly, Chalmers Johnson observes that our governments perform those functions less well than some of our competitors'.
Consider transportation, a crucial part of any society's infrastructure. Japan has bullet trains. Europe has trans-European expresses from the Mediterranean to the North Sea. We have struggling Amtrak, which is lopping off routes and services in anticipation of cutbacks in Federal funds.
The rationale for starving Amtrak is that subsidies are bad -- that passenger trains must make their competitive way in the market. But that is carrying theory over the edge. There is a national interest in train service. Other countries subsidize it for that reason -- as the United States, starting with President Eisenhower, has spent billions on the national highway network.
Or there is aviation safety. After a series of crashes of commuter planes, we learned that they did not have to meet the same Federal safety standards as larger aircraft. Do we want to let the marketplace determine how safe planes should be? President Clinton has proposed to have a quasi-public corporation take over the F.A.A.'s air traffic control function. Is that a wise gamble?
There is a safety question about medical drugs, too. Some voices on the right are calling for elimination or severe restriction of the Food and Drug Administration, arguing that new drugs would get on the market more quickly if they did not have to go through extensive trials and approval by the F.D.A. first.
That was the situation in Britain -- no effective constraints on new drugs -- when thalidomide went on the market as a tranquilizer in the 1960's. Pregnant women who used it gave birth to terribly deformed children, without arms and legs. Do we want to test drugs in the marketplace?
Safety and physical infrastructure are not the only necessary concerns of government in a market economy. Adam Smith listed education. Today he would surely add to that the encouragement of scientific research. Yet funds for university research are another target of budget-cutters.
There are other elements of a good society that individuals alone cannot provide -- that depend on "the power of a community." Sigmund Freud used that phrase 60 years ago. Trying to define what makes for civilization, he spoke of technological accomplishment, beauty, order and respect for ideas. But the decisive civilizing step, he wrote, was the replacement of individual force by the power of the community.
Some civilizing elements of life are under particular threat in this country today. One example is public libraries, a peculiarly American way to self-improvement, to enlargement of the mind and spirit.
Public television and radio will get no Federal funds if Mr. Gingrich has his way. At one stroke, he would endanger the only meaningful scientific programs and documentaries on American television and by far the most serious news on radio and television. So this large, rich country would have nothing like what modest Britain has in the BBC.
Rugged individualism is part of the American creed. But another part, vital since the beginning, has been the power of the community to improve our lives.

HEADLINE: That's a Strange Way to Finance a Tax Cut

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"President Insists His Tax Cuts Keep Deficit in Check" (front page, Dec. 17) contains reassuring reports from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, about not "cooking the books" and phasing spending cuts with tax relief over time so as not to increase the deficit.
Leaving aside the wisdom of cutting taxes now, what is disturbing is that part of the offset to tax reductions will come from sales to the public of Government-owned properties. Countries all over the world have been privatizing, motivated partly by the desire to increase their budgetary revenue. Such privatization has served useful purposes. 
 But it is a mistake to regard the proceeds of sales of Government enterprises as equivalent to tax revenue or to reductions in expenditures. These proceeds are the same as the proceeds from the sale of Government securities, which are a way of financing budget deficits.
The purchasers of the Government enterprises are either doing so out of funds they would have saved anyway or are substituting their purchases for capital investment they would otherwise have undertaken. Those are the objections to Federal deficits when the economy is operating near its full potential, as is true today. A deficit in those conditions either adds to aggregate demand, increasing the possibility of inflation, or it crowds out private investment if interest rates go up.
It is to be hoped that the Clinton economic team will reconsider this method of financing the proposed tax cuts whether or not they wish to divest Government enterprises.

HEADLINE: That's a Strange Way to Finance a Tax Cut;
Stimulate More Growth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Lean and Very Mean" by A. M. Rosenthal (column, Dec. 16) describes the central reason for today's political sourness thus: "Americans are beginning to understand that the unwritten contract between them and their society is being torn up. The understanding was that in bad times everybody would hurt but that if the boss was doing well so would the workers." 
 But Mr. Rosenthal omits the equally central reason for this broken understanding. It is the failure of fiscal and monetary authorities to stimulate economic growth at a rate that will cause bosses to hire workers into secure jobs at good wages.
From 1946 to 1973 the Government and the Federal Reserve Board used fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate growth while at the same time maintaining a prudent guard against accelerating inflation.
The oil shocks of the 1970's changed that throughout the Western world. The lack of any possible politically acceptable combinations of low unemployment and slow inflation defeated not only Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter but also James Callaghan in Britain, Valery Giscard d'Estaing in France, Helmut Schmidt in Germany and Pierre Elliott Trudeau in Canada.
Ronald Reagan was the beneficiary of the collapse of pricing by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the early 1980's, but he blew it with his immense increases in the Federal deficit.
Now cumulated deficit and the fear of any inflation at a rate above zero have mesmerized not only the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Fed, but also most Clinton Administration economists, who should know better.
They contend that even with very slow inflation, the unemployment rate of around 6 percent for 1994 is so low that it will accelerate inflation sometime in the future. Before 1973, 6 percent was a pretty bad recession. Perhaps the economy has changed, but as recently as 1988-90, unemployment was well below 6 percent without accelerating inflation.
Keeping unemployment near or above 6 percent has broken the unwritten contract and engendered the meanness of which Mr. Rosenthal writes. Some form of budgetary stimulus, for example, less grudging tax cuts than President Clinton proposes (and not compensated for by spending cuts), supplemented by decreases in Federal Reserve-controlled interest rates, could stimulate industry to hire, to pay well and to invest in order to increase productive capacity.
The Republicans seem to understand this. It is their clear intention to cut taxes and to compensate with only symbolic cuts in expenditures for welfare recipients and other unpopular people and with a balanced budget amendment that cannot be implemented. Disingenous, but maybe it will work.

HEADLINE: A Fading Industrial City Totters Toward Revival

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHELSEA, Mass., Dec. 22

 BODY:
At his City Hall office in this put-upon but spirited immigrant town across the Mystic River from Boston, Harry Spence was recently telling a delegation of Russian officials how he came to be the only reigning authorized dictator in America.
He said that Chelsea, trapped in corruption, gutter politics, mismanagement and poverty, was on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago. Things were so dire that the Mayor, John (Butchie) Brennan, begged the state to step in. And so it did, suspending democracy -- which meant that Mr. Brennan was out of a job -- and placing the city in receivership. As receiver, Mr. Spence was given the powers of mayor, aldermen and treasurer, to rule essentially by fiat. 
 As he was relating all this to the Russians, Mr. Spence said, a general in the delegation became excited. "He started pounding his fist on the table, saying: 'We need this! We need this!' " Mr. Spence said. "I kept saying, 'No, no, it's temporary.' He kept saying enthusiastically, 'No, this is what we need!' "
The dictatorship that the general saw as the ideal solution is an emergency measure that is entering its final months. Democracy is returning to Chelsea. How well it will work remains to be seen.
With two of the last four mayors in jail on corruption-related charges, a third -- Mr. Brennan -- under house arrest, and a fourth who took bribes but was given immunity, the citizens who painstakingly drew up the charter did away with the office of mayor as well as the old Board of Aldermen. The first City Council elections under the new charter were held this month.
The 11 new Council members, who include a convenience-store owner, a community organizer, a court officer, a hairdresser and a financial analyst, are now taking classes on how to run a municipal government, and will soon begin searching for someone to become Chelsea's first city manager. They say they want the best and are prepared to pay for it -- $80,000 a year, a hitherto unheard-of municipal salary here.
What is being tried in Chelsea is one of the nation's most ambitious efforts to revive a fading industrial city. (One tiny Texas town, Arcola, is also in receivership.) Chelsea's equally troubled school system, which ceded authority to Boston University in 1989, remains under the university's wing for four more years. But local government starts flying on its own as soon as the city manager starts, probably by June.
Nadine Mironchuk, who remembers being shocked by the epithets and feuding at the first Board of Aldermen's meeting she saw years ago, says she is worried.
"The question now is, Do the people get it?" said Ms. Mironchuk, who, as Chelsea's first public relations director, has what might be considered one of the tougher jobs in town. "Harry's doing the best he can to build up the political culture. That's going to take some time. There's every chance it could go either way."
Indeed, a lot about Chelsea (population 28,000) has not changed. It remains one of the state's poorest cities, its 1.8 square miles teeming with Hispanic and Asian immigrants who cannot find jobs.
The Tobin Bridge, which the state built in 1948 over vehement protests of Chelseans, still cuts an ugly swath through the city, and brings in not a dime of local revenue. "They owe us big time for that bridge," Guy Santagate, the long-suffering town assessor, said as he drove under it the other day. "They raped us."
But Chelsea struggled on, just as it did after two epic fires, in 1908 and 1973.
"People here are resilient," said Mr. Santagate, whose honesty made him a pariah at City Hall for decades. Horatio Alger, after all, was born in what used to be Chelsea but is now Revere.
The tax base remains woefully small. There is little open space. Many of the old wood-frame houses and brick apartment buildings are deteriorating.
"Chelsea has all the problems of a big city, except it's not a big city," said Thomas F. Birmingham, a native Chelsean who, as chairman of the State Senate Ways and Means Committee, fought for the receivership. "Turning around a city like Chelsea is more like turning around an ocean liner than a sports car. It's a slow, gradual process. Nothing is guaranteed."
Mr. Santagate, the son of a Sicilian immigrant, remembers how poisonous the political culture was when he started as an assessor in 1973.
"When I came in as assessor, the only thing missing was the quill pen; they were writing out 6,000 properties by hand," he said as he stopped for a corned beef sandwich at Pressman's Deli. "I brought in an outside computer company to automate the bills. That ruffled the treasurer's feathers. It may have had something to do with overtime. I always hoped something would change, but I never dreamed it would."
Shortly before the state stepped in, Joe Savage, an Assistant United States Attorney, began a corruption investigation with the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. "Democracy had ceased to exist 20 years ago," Mr. Savage said. "It had become government by auction."
By September 1991, when the state imposed receivership, the city was facing a $10.5 million deficit on a $40 million budget. The first receiver, James Carlin, and Mr. Spence, who had earlier had been successful in taking over the troubled Boston Housing Authority, were shocked at what they found.
"The chaos was unbelievable," Mr. Spence said. "We weren't sure the city could make it. It took us six months just to figure out what the financial situation was.
"There were, literally, old bills piling up in shoeboxes," he said. "There were department heads who hadn't spoken to each other in years because of long vendettas."
Mr. Carlin and Mr. Spence cut the municipal payroll by one-third, imposed trash fees, froze overtime for the Fire Department -- it was pulling down $1 million in overtime a year -- and brought in desperately needed businesses. Mr. Santagate was one of only three department heads, out of 17, who were kept on.
"Guy was heroic," Mr. Spence said.
Mr. Spence was given plenty of help -- millions of dollars in state aid, for starters, as well as the corruption investigators, who produced 13 indictments and six convictions.
Now, the budget has been balanced for the third straight year. The recent election was, by all accounts, clean. The city's bond rating has gone to triple A from worthless, and there are now three schools under construction -- the first in 80 years -- as well as parking garages and a state computer center.
Gone are the notorious topless bars and gambling joints -- places like Caruso's Celebrity Lounge, Jilly's, Grub 'n' Pub -- that were as much a part of the landscape as the huge gas tanks looming over the waterfront.
With six members of the Police Department convicted of such crimes as illegal gambling, bribery, pension fraud and tax evasion, there is a new police chief, Ed Flynn, from New Jersey, who has drawn national attention for his efforts in community policing.
Of course, remnants of the old political culture of rancor remain. Two former Aldermen have returned as City Council members. While Hispanic residents make up 40 percent of Chelsea's population, only one Hispanic candidate, Juan Vega, was elected.
But life is easier now for store owners like Sergio Jaramillo, who came here 15 years ago from Chile. Mr. Jaramillo, who runs a pawnshop on Broadway, used to have a deli and remembers feeling that he had to pay off health inspectors. "Nothing was written, but it was there," he said. "This was Chelsea."
Now, he said, "I have no troubles," adding, "I think the receivership is one of the better things that has ever happened to Chelsea."
Although the appointment of Mr. Spence, a Groton- and Harvard-educated Bostonian, had for a time stirred inevitable class resentments, he has been widely regarded as a benevolent dictator. Now, as Councilman Vega, said, "There's a lot of anxiety about what happens when Harry's gone."
The new City Council was sworn in Monday night. The first official meeting is scheduled for next month. There is only one item on the agenda: the search for the city manager.
"It's going to be messy," said Mr. Spence, talking the other day in his City Hall office, with his brass ship's clock, made at the still-in-business Chelsea Clock factory, proudly displayed on his desk.
"Chelsea succeeding doesn't mean Chelsea is going to be paradise; it's just going to be like any other place," he said. "It's kind of like that old line about successful therapy: it means you can be normally unhappy.
"Chelsea goes back to real life. It's going to be bumpy and difficult, as real life always is."

HEADLINE: A Nervous City Sees Bombs Everywhere

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Just before rush hour yesterday, a security guard spotted a briefcase sitting atop two cardboard boxes outside a luggage store at Five World Trade Center. Wary, the guard called 911 to report a suspicious leather bag, and the police summoned the bomb squad.
 As the squad raced to the scene, sirens carving a path through commuter traffic, an absent-minded businessman returned to the luggage store and retrieved his briefcase, which, it turned out, contained nothing more perilous than a Bible and a laptop computer. 
 That potential crisis had barely fizzled, however, when the police received another 911 call about a suspicious package, this one lodged between two turnstiles near the tracks of the PATH Station at Sixth Avenue and 32d Street.
 The PATH station was closed for half an hour, and again, nothing was found. Commuters remained calm, if eager to start the holiday weekend.
 But the nervous, impulsive calls spoke volumes about the jitters that have swept the city following Wednesday's firebombing of a subway car at Fulton Street. On Thursday, for instance, the police responded 46 times to calls about suspicious packages and the like, none of which were dangerous. The usual number of such calls is about 10 a day.
 "We're concerned about the increase in work caused by skittish people," said John Timoney, the Police Department's Chief of Department. "But we're also concerned about copycats. I'm afraid of the loser type looking for 15 minutes of fame."
 The police are encouraging people to be alert. But they are also concerned about nervous citizens summoning the 36-member bomb squad away from genuine emergencies.
 The squad has been forced to respond to hundreds of false alarms since a mail bomb killed an advertising executive in North Caldwell, N.J., two weeks ago. And calls have escalated since the fireball erupted on the southbound Manhattan No. 4 train, set off, police suspect, by Edward J. Leary, a disgruntled unemployed man who wanted to hold the city hostage.
 On the average day, amid all the reports of shootings, wife beatings and fender-benders that crackle over the 911 police emergency telephone, a report of a bomb threat or suspicious package comes almost every two hours. But the number increased to a daily average of 17 after the New Jersey explosion. And on the day of the subway firebombing, false alarms rose to 35, with 46 on Thursday and at least 20 more by early yesterday evening.
 Late Thursday, Transit Authority employees working on the G Line in Brooklyn got a scare when an anonymous man called a transit booth on Java Street saying he would blow up the subway if authorities did not release his brother. It turned out to be a crank call.
 "Everybody has been on their toes of late," said Joe Rosco, the security manager at 780 Third Avenue, where a security guard called the police after he found a briefcase outside a gourmet store at 7:50 A.M. yesterday. "We are all very careful."
 Not one of the hundreds of calls has been anything serious. But a few have been disruptive. No one was allowed to enter or leave the Third Avenue building for two hours yesterday until the bomb squad arrived, for example.
 And on Monday, after a suspicious-looking box was found in Port Richmond High School on Staten Island, the school was evacuated. The police found a harmless box wired to look like a bomb.
 In all, there were at least 10 bomb threats or reports of possible explosive devices around the city's subway system yesterday without any major disruptions in service. And in one case yesterday morning, a loud pop under the seat of an uptown subway car near Broadway and 168th Street in Washington Heights frightened passengers until transit repairmen declared it nothing more than a blown fuse.
 "You have to respond to everything," said Michael Amarosa, the Police Department Director of Communications, who oversees 911 service. "That's the only way to treat this."
 Police officials noted that the Christmas season has traditionally been a time when bomb threats proliferate. In 1982, bombs set by the Puerto Rican F.A.L.N. separatist group exploded on New Year's Eve outside four government buildings in New York City, including Police Headquarters.
 But security precautions this holiday season have still not reached the level that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait or the bombing at the World Trade Center, when the police bolstered the bomb squad by temporarily rehiring retired members.
 Anticipating possible copycat bombers or even another strike in the Unabom serial letter bombings, the Police Department last week assembled 300 business and university executives at Police Headquarters for a briefing from experts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
 Immediately after Wednesday's subway incident, the police stepped up security around scores of religious and government buildings around the city. But once the Police Department was satisfied that Mr. Leary, the 49-year-old Scotch Plains, N.J., man arrested for the subway firebombing, had operated alone, security details were decreased.
 Nevertheless, Police Chief Timoney yesterday expressed concern that all the false alarms would "drain our resources."

The Economy
 
For workers on the front lines of retailing, the holidays are a time of great pressure, when they are forced to juggle many customers at once while exhausted by hours of overtime. The $1,500 sale that provides a huge high is rare, and the housekeeping tasks are endless. For many, the season is make-or-break. [Page 1.] 

Moody's said six California counties had used the aggressive investment practices that drove Orange County, Calif., into bankruptcy. But none of the six -- Monterey, Placer, San Bernardino, San Diego, Solano and Sonoma -- are in danger of falling into bankruptcy, the credit-rating agency said. [41.]
Consumer spending rose briskly in November, increasing six-tenths of 1 percent despite a slight drop in personal income. Orders for durable goods surged 3.4 percent for the month, but the increase was concentrated in airplanes and cars. [41.]
 
International
 
Mexican markets and the peso steadied, after a turbulent slide this week set off by the Government's decision to devalue and then to let the peso trade freely. Investors seem to be reacting cautiously to attempts by Mexican officials to explain how they intended to manage the economy after devaluing the peso. [41.]
Handmade Christmas ornaments are a growing business in Poland and the Czech Republic, bolstered by demand in the United States for traditional tree trimmings. The old European art is back in fashion, pushed by stores and catalogues. [41.]
The flamboyant former chairman of Banesto was jailed on charges of fraud and embezzlement involving more than $53 million. Banesto had been Spain's third-largest bank.[43.]
Credit Lyonnais put up for sale a Brazilian banking unit. The unit, Banco Frances e Brasileiro, is Brazil's second-largest bank. [43.]
Time Warner is asking Japanese investors in its entertainment division -- Itochu and Toshiba -- to put up as much as $300 million apiece to help the company acquire more cable television systems, a Japanese financial newspaper reported. [43.]
Companies William Randolph Hearst 3d will quit as publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, the newspaper his grandfather used as the building block of the Hearst empire. Mr. Hearst will join Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a leading venture capital firm. [41.]
Ameritech won F.C.C. approval to offer video services in five states. The commission also gave a Sprint subsidiary approval to conduct market trials of the service in North Carolina. But the commission rejected four applications by U S West. [43.]
 
Markets
 
Blue-chip stocks advanced in light, pre-holiday trading. The Dow Jones industrials ended the week with a gain of 26.24 points. [42.]
Treasury prices were flat in a shortened session. [51.]
The dollar strengthened in thin trading. [52.]
Cotton prices climbed on signs of heavy demand. A wheat purchase by China lifted wheat and soybean prices. [52.]
 
Your Money
 
What do investors want? Well, among other things, an end to all taxes on investing would be nice, however unlikely. The approach of the new year is the time to make such wish lists. [39.]
In examining Mexican investments, buyers need to make distinctions. The plunge in the peso has dragged down the American despository receipts of many Mexican companies. But some companies, especially exporters, may stand to gain. [39.]
American Express plans to begin marketing mutual funds directly to its card holders in the coming year. [39.]

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Up Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
American consumers are on a late-year spending binge that may produce headaches in 1995, according to economic reports released today.
Despite a slight drop in personal income last month, consumer spending climbed briskly again in November, rising six-tenths of 1 percent and embracing a wide variety of goods and services, the Commerce Department reported. 
 Indeed, it is possible, economists say, that overextended households could cause the economy to slow more than policy makers at the Federal Reserve desire and stir fears of recession.
"What we have is strong spending and weak incomes," said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "Over time, that can't last."
Personal income fell one-tenth of a percent in November, after a big 1.4 percent advance in October that largely reflected bonus payments in the auto industry and one-time subsidy payments to farmers.
Despite this squeeze, which depressed the personal savings rate last month to 4.1 percent from a 4.8 percent rate in October, consumers actually became more confident with the approach of the gift-buying holidays. The University of Michigan's confidence index was put at 95.1 for December, subscribers to its service said today, up from 91.6 in November.
In still another report on the economy today, orders to the nation's factories for long-lived goods, from camcorders to artillery shells, surged 3.4 percent in November.
Although this was a bigger advance than generally expected, close scrutiny suggested that this sector of the economy might already be softening after buttressing the business expansion for the last two years. The increase was concentrated in airplanes and cars. Orders for durables -- goods intended to last at least three years -- were up only eight-tenths of 1 percent when transportation equipment was excluded. The transportation sector rebounded by a strong 12.5 percent after a 9.5 percent plunge in October.
Orders for primary metals eased 1.2 percent, the first decline since July, and orders for industrial machinery were unchanged. Moreover, said Laurence H. Meyer, a financial consultant in St. Louis, orders for capital goods other than aircraft and military items -- a closely watched indicator of investment in new factories -- fell 1.2 percent last month.
Still, the biggest threat to the business expansion -- the last economic downturn ended in March 1991 -- is the consumer, whose spending at retail counters and for such things as medical care and college tuition accounts for two-thirds of all business activity.
Personal savings, at scarcely 4 percent for 1993 and 1994, is at the lowest rate since records began being compiled in 1929, providing little extra cushion against post-holiday bills.
More confident about their own job prospects and less worried about the future, consumers have been running up big credit card bills to finance personal spending. But some analysts wonder how long Americans can maintain the pace at which they have been borrowing. Consumer installment credit, the Federal Reserve reported early this month, grew at a 15.8 percent annual rate in October as all three categories posted double-digit increases.
"There is a lot of borrowing -- but it will slow," said David Littmann, senior economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit.
By spring, Mr. Littman added, households may be pinched as higher interest rates start to bite. Still, many analysts say the Federal Reserve can succeed in its effort to slow the pace of the economy without producing a stall. The quarter that ends next week is expected to be the second straight in which domestic output will rise at an annual pace of 4 percent or more.
"The consumer can't keep up this rapid pace," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. But he said any pullback would not be too sharp as long as job growth remained solid.
Mr. Dederick largely dismissed today's report of lower personal income because of the special factors that had produced an exceptionally big gain for October. In addition to the subsidy payments to farmers and bonuses to auto workers, there was a sharp increase, reversed in November, in the length of the workweek.
Looking forward, the consumer sentiment index may also be pointing to troubles down the road. The University of Michigan's index, though 3.5 points higher for December as a whole, eased to 95.1 at the end of the month from its midmonth reading of 97.7. Consumers' assessment of current conditions, at 104.9, is more optimistic than the 88.8 for the months ahead.
The Commerce Department's report on orders for durable goods included a 7.7 percent decline for military hardware after a 16.8 percent October drop.
Shipments of durables rebounded 2.8 percent after two straight declines while unfilled orders climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, the third straight monthly increase.

HEADLINE: Suspect in Bombing Says He's Innocent, His Lawyer Asserts

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Handcuffed to his hospital bed, fading in and out of consciousness from the morphine dulling the pain of his burns, the man charged with firebombing a subway train proclaimed his innocence on Thursday, his newly hired lawyer, Stephen J. Murphy, said.
Edward J. Leary, the unemployed computer expert who the police say created and carried the firebomb that injured 48 subway riders in lower Manhattan on Wednesday, said he was just another victim of the explosion, Mr. Murphy said. 
 "He vehemently denies his guilt," said Mr. Murphy, an outspoken lawyer whose clients have included defendants in the Howard Beach and Bensonhurst racial violence cases. "He knows nothing more than anybody else does about it. And he's appalled by all these headlines and politicians and police calling him the mad bomber."
Many of those headlines have been based on evidence the police have said they removed from Mr. Leary's home in Scotch Plains, N.J., including scribbled notes in which investigators say he referred to himself as a "mad bomber." The notes laid out a plan to extort money from the Transit Authority by setting off similar firebombs across the city, the police said.
One investigator said a phrase from the notes that stuck in his mind, apparently intended to be used in an extortion message, was: "We have several more bombs and if you pay a ransom, we will make this bomb safe."
Law enforcement officials have also said they found a trove of bomb-making supplies in Mr. Leary's den, including mayonnaise jars, wires, timers, batteries and containers of gasoline, along with instructions for building a firebomb.
But Mr. Leary told his lawyer that he never made or carried the firebomb and knew nothing about an extortion letter or the other material said to have been removed from his house, Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Murphy charged that some of what appeared to be incriminating evidence had been "made up" by the police.
"He said he was on the train," Mr. Murphy said. "I asked him if he ever had a bomb in his possession. He said absolutely not. I asked him if he ever brought it on the train. He said absolutely not. I said, 'Are your fingerprints going to be on it?' He said no."
Lieut. Robert J. Valentino, a spokesman for the Transit Authority police department, the lead law enforcement agency in the case, said investigators and technicians were still going over the evidence collected from the burned subway car. He said he could not discuss whether any fingerprints have been collected or even whether it is possible to collect them from the fragments of the crude gasoline bomb.
Lieutenant Valentino denied Mr. Murphy's contention that evidence had been concocted, saying it had been removed from Mr. Leary's house and properly tagged by several cooperating law enforcement agencies.
"He can say whatever he likes," Lieutenant Valentino said. "We are just collecting evidence and preparing the case, and disseminating accurate and timely information."
Mr. Murphy said he was only able to speak to his client for about 30 minutes Thursday night at the Cornell Medical Center burn unit before doctors told him to leave. Mr. Leary was so groggy from the morphine running through tubes into his body that he was unable to answer questions in detail, his lawyer said.
Mr. Leary is in critical condition at the hospital with burns over 40 percent of his body. Mr. Murphy said the worst burns appear to be on his client's legs and buttocks, with other significant burns on his nose, lips and chin. Although police officials have said Mr. Leary may be near death, Mr. Murphy said he doubted the situation was that severe.
Because of his condition, however, Mr. Leary was unable to discuss with his lawyer many of the unanswered questions in the case, Mr. Murphy said, including where he was going on the subway that day, why he fled to Brooklyn after the blast, and why his burns appear to be consistent with his having held the firebomb on his lap when it exploded.
Mr. Leary, 49, was arrested in his hospital bed early Thursday after the police said they discovered the notes and equipment in his home. Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said he would probably be arraigned in the same bed next week, depending on his physical condition. She said the office had prepared a complaint charging him with nine counts of assault in the first degree, because nine of the victims have serious physical injuries. The complaint will also charge him with one count of criminal possession of a weapon, she said. Ms. Thompson said she was not certain when the complaints will be presented to a grand jury.
Law enforcement authorities said yesterday they had widened their investigation to look back at any other suspicious fires and explosions that have occurred in the city in recent years. Except for another subway fire last week that the police believe may have been linked to Mr. Leary, there is no evidence that he caused any other violence, they said.
"We're looking at it all," one investigator said. "Do we consider any of them likely? That's another question."
Police officials said they had received an anonymous tip that Mr. Leary had been a suspect in a fatal explosion in Utah. The officials said they were taking the report seriously and have contacted the Utah authorities asking them to investigate further.
Mr. Murphy said he was hired by Marguerite E. Shaller, Mr. Leary's wife, shortly after the arrest. She told him she had seen him on television and wanted a fighter, he said.
As if to demonstrate his contentiousness, Mr. Murphy immediately began excoriating police officials and politicians for trying to convict Mr. Leary while he lies in his hospital bed. He compared the case to that of O. J. Simpson, saying the authorities were leaking reams of material to make his client look bad even before a trial.
"I find it ridiculous, and completely unfair and unjustified, that the politicians and the police have already crucified a man in critical condition who cannot defend himself," Mr. Murphy said. "They've not only convicted him, they're already talking about whether they should execute him." Both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki said the case was an example of why the death penalty should be enacted in New York.
Mr. Murphy said the police even gave relatives a hard time when they came to the Scotch Plains house to pick up Christmas presents for Mr. Leary's nine-year-old son, who is with family members in Binghamton, N.Y.
"It's despicable what they're doing," he said. "Once they decide you're a monster, the truth doesn't matter anymore."
Investigators said they planned to return to the Scotch Plains home last night with Federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents to search for additional evidence.

HEADLINE: Risk Is Cited in 6 More California Counties

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
The aggressive investment practices that drove Orange County, Calif., into bankruptcy have also been used by at least six other county governments in California, according to a leading Wall Street credit-rating agency.
The agency, Moody's Investors Service Inc., reported late Thursday evening that the six counties -- Monterey, Placer, San Bernardino, San Diego, Solano and Sonoma -- had engaged in "significantly more aggressive" investment strategies than other California counties it surveyed. The strategies included investing with borrowed money, a practice called "using leverage," and investing in the complex interest-sensitive securities known as derivatives. 
 But Moody's emphasized that none of the six counties seemed in any danger of following Orange County into bankruptcy. Their use of these risky strategies was less extreme, and the local governments that invested in the funds were less likely to make sudden withdrawals.
As the Moody's report was made public, the Madera County, Calif., Office of Education warned yesterday that it might default on its public debts if the bankruptcy judge handling the Orange County case did not allow it to withdraw money it deposited in the ill-fated fund. Its request is still pending.
Alarm about Orange County prompted Moody's to survey all the pooled investment funds in California, and to screen a broad sample of about 1,400 such funds across the country. Of the 57 such funds in California, it said that 37 reported no use of leverage or derivatives.
Moody's national survey uncovered problems at only two government units, besides those whose losses had already been disclosed. Those two were Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Walworth County, Wis.
According to the Moody's survey of California, a total of 14 counties reported using leverage or derivatives to some degree. But the six were singled out for detailed discussion, the agency said, because they "reported a significantly more aggressive use of either leverage or derivatives, or both."
According to the rating agency, "the managers of each of these pools report that they have developed or are beginning to develop strategies to address the risks posed by the nature of their pools." Moody's added, however, that it intended to talk or meet further with each pool manager "to verify information which they have provided to us in order to better assess their strategies."
For example, the Placer County Treasurer, Jenine Windeshausen, said her fund, with a book value of $378 million, had approximately 42 percent of its assets invested in derivatives, with half to three-quarters of them becoming less valuable as interest rates rose. But Ms. Windeshausen, who said her fund had "a high level of liquidity," confirmed that Moody's analysts would be meeting with her early in the year.
Tom Ford, assistant tax collector for Sonoma County, disputed some of Moody's findings. He said the agency had understated the value of the fund, which he put at $735 million, not $565 million. They agree, however, that derivatives represent about $322 million of the fund.
"But we're about equally exposed to upward or downward movements in rates," Mr. Ford said. He confirmed that since November the fund had faced two margin calls totaling $1.6 million, but he insisted that he had ample cash to cover anticipated demands. While Moody's said it would continue to monitor the fund, Mr. Ford said the agency should "either make a decision or move on." "They've just been putting us through hoops," he added.
Monterey County faces paper losses of about $16 million on its $338 million portfolio. It has also borrowed about $237 million, secured by its securities. But Louis Solton, the county treasurer and tax collector, said yesterday that the fund had sufficient cash to meet all its anticipated needs.
Moody's found that Solano County's $427 million fund had borrowed about $182 million through reverse repurchase agreements, making "significant use of derivatives." There was no answer at the county offices at the county seat of Fairfield, Calif., yesterday.
Before the Moody's report, it had been widely known that San Bernardino County and San Diego County had made substantial use of derivatives. Moody's did not raise any new alarms with respect to these funds, but said it would monitor the funds closely.
All six counties face less risk because most of their money comes from "captive" investors, local government units that are required to use the fund and cannot pull their money. Thus, unlike Orange County, they need not sell at a loss. Orange County, with enormous paper losses in its investment portfolio, was unable to raise cash to meet investor demands. It was forced to file for bankruptcy on Dec. 6, sending shock waves through the tax-exempt securities market.

HEADLINE: Peso and Mexican Stocks Calmer

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 23

 BODY:
After diving almost 30 percent since the beginning of the week, the Mexican peso settled down today, closing at 4.7 to a dollar from 4.8 pesos the day before.
With the peso floating freely for the first time in seven years, the Mexican stock market also regained lost ground and the bolsa index closed at 2,339.58, a modest but encouraging gain of 1.44 percent. The Government devalued the peso from about 3.6 pesos to the dollar to 4, and then, when the move failed to calm markets, set it free. 
 Compared with the extreme volatility of financial markets earlier in the week, today's activity seemed to indicate a stabilization of the peso, at least temporarily. American depository receipts were basically flat, but serious doubts by American investors about prospects for the Mexican market lingered.
Mexico's hopes for a quick recovery from this week's financial near meltdown took a significant blow when Standard & Poor's lowered by one notch its ratings on long-term Mexican peso debt and warned that another downgrade could follow in the near future.
The rating agency also posted notice that Mexico's foreign currency debt -- the indicator that foreign investors watch most closely -- could lose its double-B rating soon. That dashes yearlong expectations that Standard & Poor's was ready to bump Mexico up one notch to the investment grade rating that would make it possible for many large United States pension funds to invest in Mexico.
"I would say now that an upgrade to investment grade is very unlikely to take place in the near term," said Lacey Gallagher, a Mexico analyst at S.& P. in New York. "The Government's management of the crisis will determine what Mexico's prospects are in the longer term."
The other major rating service, Moody's Investors Service, said it would not change its rating of Mexico, which is two notches below investment grade.
Financial analysts in Mexico and the United States said that investors seemed to be reacting cautiously to attempts by Mexican officials to explain how they intended to manage the economy after devaluing the peso.
"The difference between today and yesterday is that the Government finally came forth in New York with a more credible package of policies that will make the devaluation's success more likely," said Jorge O. Mariscal, manager of the Latin American Equity Group at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "What you saw in the markets today was an incipient but still very fragile stability."
The Mexican stock market endured another erratic session today. Companies with high foreign debt and limited exports were shunned while those companies without any foreign debt showed modest increases.
Barings Securities in Mexico was one of several brokerage houses to revise its stock recommendations because of the devaluation. Its analysts suggested avoiding consumer company stocks like Bimbo baked goods, Valle juices and department stores because they expect real wages, and the buying power of Mexican consumers, to drop.
Bank stocks are considered especially vulnerable, depending on the foreign currency loans and deposits a bank holds. Standard & Poor's today lowered its ratings on the peso-denominated notes of Banco Nacional de Mexico, Mexico's largest bank, and Banpais.
The devaluation is likely to spur travel to Mexico, according to travel agencies and wholesalers in the United States, although package tours will not drop by the same percentage as the devalued peso against the dollar.
Most American tour operators pay dollars to Mexican hotels, airlines and ground operators so those prices are unlikely to fall. But once visitors arrive in Mexico, they should find lower prices for everything from restaurant meals to discos to charter boats.
 "Travel this time of year is already bought and paid for, but next month it's going to go crazy" because of the lower prices, said Joe Tate, whose company, Mexico Wholesalers, in Houston sends 50,000 Americans a year to Mexico.
Mexico's financial crisis reached a culmination Wednesday night when the Government, unable to withstand a speculative run on the peso, was forced to free it from the trading band it had used since 1987 to control inflation and build investor confidence. The Government also turned to a standby swap line of $7 billion from the United States and Canada to help stabilize the financial market.
The new team picked by President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, which took office just three weeks ago, was dressed down by investment bankers in New York yesterday for devaluing the peso after giving an assurance that such a move was unnecessary.
The previous Mexican administration often sent representatives to New York to explain, in advance or on the same day, government actions that would affect the market. This week, American investors learned about the floating peso from news reports.
Financial analysts agree that such moves are likely to hurt Mexican workers and consumers at a time when Mexican society is already experiencing unrest. They rejected the notion that savings rates could be improved if the devaluation virtually doubled interest on credit cards, car loans and mortgages.
Mexicans expect higher rates for car loans and rising prices for tires, stereos and other imported products. Buy some analysts say the devaluation could consequently lead to a drop in imports, thus reducing the trade deficit and the foreign funds needed to finance it. Mexico's trade imbalance is considered one of the reasons the Government was forced to devaluate the peso.
Previous devaluations, especially the one that took place in 1982, caused ordinary Mexicans to panic. But today in Mexico City, most banks and money exchange firms operated normally. If prices for merchandise were raised in violation of the Government's call to freeze them, there was no public protest.
"If I had had money in the bank I would have been poorer and worse off today than I was last night before I went to sleep," said Antonio Hernandez, a 56-year-old taxi driver in Mexico City. "But I've got nothing in the bank because here we live day to day. What I earn today, I use to eat tonight."

HEADLINE: Stocks Up in Slow Day; Dow Gains 18.51 Points

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed yesterday with strong gains for the third consecutive session.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.51 points, to 3,833.43. It ended the week with a respectable gain of 26.24 points after a 116-point rally last week. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.16 point, to 459.83. The Nasdaq composite index gained 2.85 points, to 742.19, and the American Stock Exchange index gained 1.26 points, to 428.78. 
 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange slowed before the three-day holiday weekend, with 196.5 million shares traded, compared with Thursday's brisk volume of roughly 340 million. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones, 1,223 to 949. The market will be closed on Monday.
After battling rising interest rates and a fickle stock market throughout the year, many money managers were struggling to record gains for 1994.
"Everybody's scrounging for every little percentage they can get," said Brian Finnerty, senior vice president at Unterberg Harris.
The year-end "window dressing" -- with fund managers adding positions in winning stocks and dumping losers -- was the main force driving stocks, analysts said.
"This time of year you usually see people in a little more optimistic mood," Bob Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Bosworth, said.
Latin American shares rebounded from the beating they suffered after Mexico decided first to devalue the peso and then to let the currency trade freely against the dollar. American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico were unchanged at 40 5/8 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while A.D.R.'s of Grupo Televisa rose 1/2, to 32 7/8.
Other Latin American stocks also recovered. Telefonica de Argentina A.D.R.'s gained 1 3/8, to 51 1/8, and those of Compania de Telefonos de Chile rose 1 1/2, to 79 1/2.
Automobile stocks attracted bargain hunters for the second consecutive day, while airline stocks were also strong performers.
The General Motors Corporation gained 2 1/8, to 41 1/4, after Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette raised its fourth-quarter earnings estimate for the car maker. The Ford Motor Company advanced 1/4, to 27, and the Chrysler Corporation rose 3/4, to 48 7/8.
Airline stocks benefited from bargain hunting. Delta Air Lines surged 3 7/8, to 49 5/8. Salomon Brothers raised its rating on the stock to a "strong buy" after a Federal judge ruled that the carrier did not breach good faith in negotiating Pan Am's bankruptcy reogranization plan.
The AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, rose 2, to 53.
Genentech Inc.'s stock fell sharply on signs that Roche Holdings of Switzerland had apparently passed on its opportunity to buy the rest of the company by the end of the year. Roche already owns 65 percent of Genentech, whose stock fell 4 3/4, to 47 3/4.
Shares of the Immulogic Pharmaceutical Corporation rose sharply in Nasdaq trading amid speculation of a takeover by Marion Merrell Dow. Immulogic gained 1 1/2, to 8 1/2.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.24 point, to 250.95.
In Japan, financial markets were closed yesterday in observance of the Emperor's birthday.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Are Flat in Short Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed yesterday in a shortened trading session.
More signs of economic growth failed to quicken pre-holiday trading, which was thin and ended in New York at 2 P.M. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32 , to 968/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.83 percent, from 7.85 percent on Thursday. Traders were quick to note that yesterday was the ninth consecutive session in which the yield on the long bond traded in a range of 7.84 percent to 7.87 percent.
The yield on the two-year note was unchanged at 7.71 percent -- 12 basis points less than the long bond and the smallest yield spread between the two maturities since June 1990. Traders say such a narrowing of yields is a sign that the market expects the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again soon.
Among shorter and intermediate maturities, rates on bills and yields on notes continued to rise on signs that economic growth was continuing at a brisk pace and that the Fed would indeed act to keep inflation from accelerating.
Among the data released yesterday were durable goods orders for November and personal income and spending data for November.
The Commerce Department reported yesteday that orders for durable goods -- products ranging from washing machines to military aircraft -- increased 3.4 percent in November, the biggest advance since August.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government issues trading strategist for CS First Boston, said the durable goods gain seemed a bit strong, noting that forecasts had ranged from increases of 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent.
But orders for durable goods, he said, are "extremely volatile, if you note the 6.2 percent gain in August contrasted against the 3.9 percent drop the month before." He attributed much of the volatility to the transportation component; orders for aircraft and ships can swing widely from month to month.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said personal income fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November, while spending rose six-tenths of 1 percent.
Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, said Fed policy makers might have come to the realization at the last meeting that despite higher interest rates, financial conditions generally remained conducive to further business expansion. "The lending constraints that tended to slow down the expansion appeared to have given way to more accommodative lending policies by banks," he said.
As result, Mr. Sherman said, the Fed is likely to take more aggressive steps. "Clearly the economy is maintaining momentum," he said. "Friday's reports on new orders for durable goods and personal consumption expenditure in November reinforce that view."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Players' Next Step Is Legal Challenge

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Major league club owners made it through the first day of their imposed salary cap unscathed yesterday, but the players' onslaught against their impasse will begin immediately after the holiday weekend.
 The Players Association plans to begin its challenge to the salary cap Tuesday by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board's regional office in New York. That step will trigger a series of legal maneuvers that could extend to 1998, and that's not even including time for the case to reach the potential ultimate stage -- the United States Supreme Court. 
 Management lawyers either were not in their offices or did not return telephone calls yesterday to discuss the upcoming challenge to the owners' unilateral action in the continuing labor dispute. They also were not available to discuss some questionable parts of a 15-page news release outlining some of the elements of the new economic system but primarily offering management's view of why the system will be good for baseball.
 In four places in the package, the release purports to show how much better the new salary scale for players in their first four years in the major leagues will be than the old minimum salary. The new scale calls for minimum salaries of $115,000 in the first year, $175,000 in the second, $275,000 in the third and $500,000 or $750,000 in the fourth.
 In one chart, the release lists those figures next to the old minimum of $109,000 for each service level. In a later page, it states that the minimum a player could earn over that period would be $1,315,000 "as compared to $436,000 under the old system. This $879,000 increase represents a 202 percent improvement from the old system."
 But no player ever has played for the minimum salary in each of his first four years. Rarely does a player play for the minimum after he has one year of major league service. Jim Abbott, for one example, earned $2,415,500 in his first four years, and that was after starting when the minimum was $68,000. When compared with the new scale, Abbott's four-year salary is one of the reasons the union will take its case to the N.L.R.B.
 The time and effort that the labor board battle will require will reduce the likelihood of bargaining for a new agreement that would replace the salary cap. Whenever negotiations resume, it's not clear that Bill Usery Jr., who has spent the past 10 weeks mediating the dispute at the request of the Clinton Administration, will return to the table.
 Richard Conn, a spokesman for Usery, said the mediator spoke at length by telephone yesterday with Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and plans to speak to him again next week. Conn said he did not know anything about their conversation.
 Usery said Thursday night that he was prepared to continue as the mediator -- former President Jimmy Carter has also offered his services -- but he added that he didn't know if that would change after he spoke with Reich.
 "I don't think Bill had anything definite in mind," Conn said by telephone from Washington. "I think he feels he serves at the sufferance of the President and the Secretary." Conn added that Usery left for a Florida vacation yesterday and would return Jan. 5.
 While Usery took a break from the baseball dispute, the game's new economic system was given its first tryout, coincidentally on the 19th anniversary of the arbitration decision that created free agency.
 Clubs had to act immediately on two fronts: They had to tender contracts to all unsigned players, writing figures in paragraph 2 of the somewhat revised uniform player's contract that would fit under the payroll cap for each team, and they had to give qualifying offers to restricted free agents, players with at least four years of major league service but less than six.
 Thirty-eight players, including Jack McDowell of the Yankees, were given offers that reserved their clubs' right to retain the free agent by matching another club's offer. Twenty players, including Abbott, were not given offers.
 The Players Association could have filed its charge with the N.L.R.B. yesterday but decided to wait until Tuesday. The players will contend that the owners did not bargain in good faith and therefore did not legitimately reach impasse. If there was no impasse, the owners could not have implemented new work rules unilaterally.
 Once the charge is filed, the board's New York staff will investigate it, and Daniel Silverman, the regional director, will determine if there is cause to issue a complaint, which is the labor equivalent of a civil indictment. If a complaint is forthcoming, two steps could follow.
 In one, a hearing would be scheduled before an administrative law judge, who would determine if there was merit to the complaint. In the other, Silverman could decide to recommend to the board's general counsel, Fred Feinstein, that the board seek a temporary injunction in United States District Court blocking the salary cap.
 The five-member board would make the ultimate decision on whether or not to go to court. If the board took that action, it would have to convince a judge that the players would suffer irreparable damage if an injunction were not granted. If the judge granted the injunction, the system would revert to the collective bargaining agreement that expired a year ago, pending the outcome of the hearing before the administratrive law judge.
Based on the history of cases before the board, a rough timetable could look like this:
 Silverman could issue a complaint around the middle of February, a hearing could start at the beginning of March, the administrative law judge could rule at the start of 1996, the five-member board could decide an appeal by the losing side about a year after that and the United States Circuit Court of Appeals could rule on an appeal from the board's decision by the end of 1997 or early in 1998.
 Donald Fehr, the union leader, was not talking about the N.L.R.B. yesterday. He was at home and did not return a telephone call.
 Some hours earlier, at precisely the time the owners officially implemented the salary cap, Fehr was relating the story of how he had received the clubs' impasse letter and the document they were implementing.
 Seeing the message light on in his hotel room, he was told by the telephone operator that he had an envelope at the front desk. The envelope had no return address and nothing to indicate what was inside.
 "This is what you call high class," Fehr said. "They could've handed it to us, they could've sent it tomorrow, they could've left a note -- 'We left the implementation package at the desk.' But all I got was the message from the operator: 'You have an envelope at the front desk.' This is the way you proceed when you're very proud of what you're doing. It's the kind of thing where if you're going to be a mensch, you don't do it this way."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Congress May Deliver Biggest Hit to Owners

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
It's never wise to poke a bear in the nose with a stick. Major league baseball, not too wisely these days, has decided to hit a grizzly on the schnozz with a 34-ounce bat.
 That grizzly is the United States Government and it seems that at least one of its branches is stirring in anger and alarm over the disarray baseball continues to exhibit as standard operating procedure when it comes to labor disputes. 
 As the record-setting players' strike has grown hotter and meaner by the month, an all-out attack on baseball's antitrust exemption is threatening to break out in the halls of Congress as nonpartisan support builds for repealing the exemption.
 That Congressional tug-of-war is being played out even as unfair labor practices charges are being thrown at the National Labor Relations Board like so many Nolan Ryan fastballs. That's because baseball and its rebellious unions, representing players and umpires, continue to escalate warfare on multiple fronts.
 None of this activity is pretty. But baseball can't seem to stop drawing its own blood. So maybe it's time for Washington to act where the game no longer can.
 President Clinton tried, sending Bill Usery Jr., the noted mediator, into Dodge City two months ago. On Thursday night, though, Usery threw up his hands up in frustration, announcing a recess in talks, saying he did not know when negotiations would resume or if he'd be a part of them.
 With the executive branch on the bench, it's time for the legislative branch to take a swing.
 For seven decades, Congress has opted not to become involved in a thorough examination of baseball's antitrust status. And maybe there was no reason to act for much of that time. There is a reason in 1994, because the game has done the unthinkable.
 It has allowed a labor dispute to obliterate the post-season. And it has allowed the game to rocket toward destruction. What else do you call it when there's talk of replacement players, of picket lines, when there's a possibility one of the game's most valued franchises, the Toronto Blue Jays, may not be able to function under and the new system because it is illegal to use replacement workers during a strike in the province of Ontario.
 In addition, general managers have openly talked of not using the best players from the minors because of the stigma attached to strikebreakers.
 All this points to a game that is spinning out of control. And members of Congress have the right to investigate the exemption and change it if they determine it is fueling the dispute.
 Owners, of course, say it is not. "If you strip the antitrust exemption, it isn't going to lead to labor peace," Bud Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and the game's acting commissioner, said yesterday.
 Selig says the only place the game will ever come to a meaningful solution with players is at the bargaining table. The players, however, say that the bargaining table will never really be a fair field of battle as long as the owners have that exemption.
 Donald Fehr, the head of the Major League Baseball Players Association, can recite chapter and verse as to why baseball is not like professional football or basketball, sports that do not have exemptions. Yes, the last two sports have salary caps, Fehr says, and if the players in those sports did not want them, at least they had their day in court to challenge.
 Baseball players will never have such leeway in court as long as the exemption is there, Fehr contends. "What we have here is a cartel that is acting like a cartel," Fehr said. "There is a reason monopolies are generally outlawed: because they are not good for anyone but the monopolists. And we have another demonstration of that here."
 Selig, of course, vehemently disagrees. "I've had many economists tell me we don't fit the definition of cartel, classic or otherwise," Selig says. "No. 2, if we're a cartel, with the number of clubs losing money the way we have, then something is wrong.
 "The fact is, we have a significant economic problem. Don, for whatever reason, wants to find every excuse not to address that problem."
 Baseball should be made to address that problem. But Congress should address the exemption first. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and a Republican, are now pushing for action in the United States Senate on the exemption. No matter who ends up a winner or loser, at least players and owners will finally know where Congress stand.
 The antitrust dance will end and, with it, hopefully, will come an uncluttered path to a meaningful resolution to the game's tremendous problems.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Devaluation: Not So Scary

 BODY:
Mexico's decision to let the peso plummet about 30 percent this week roiled bond and stock markets and hurt Mexico's credibility with international investors. Critics of Nafta, the free-trade accord between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, chimed in with the proposition that the peso's fall would turn bilateral trade against the U.S., thereby vindicating their opposition to open trade.
Much of the criticism is unwarranted. President Ernesto Zedillo, who took office only three weeks ago, had little choice; as foreign reserves dwindled, he could no longer afford to spend billions propping up the value of the peso. And though his decision angered many foreigners, whose investments plummeted in value along with the peso, Mexican economic policy remains sound. 
 If Mr. Zedillo manages the economy well, this week's misfortunes need not impair long-term growth. Finally, there is no substance to the notion that the falling peso vitiates the benefits of Nafta.
Letting the peso float -- despite government promises to the contrary -- comes as no great surprise. Mexico has run trade deficits for years, which raised fears that the peso would eventually have to fall to balance the books. But government policy has kept the peso stable as a good way to fight inflation and reassure foreigners that their investments would be safe.
His strategy was to count on steady inflows of foreign investment to raise the productivity of domestic industry. Over time, exports would rise and eliminate the trade imbalance.
The strategy, though plausible, was cut short because Mexico ran out of reserves. Investors, fearful of devaluation, fled the peso. That left Mr. Zedillo a choice between defending it by raising interest rates, thereby throwing his economy into recession, or devaluing so that Mexico could close the trade deficit by exporting more and importing less. President Zedillo made the proper choice.
Still, for the medicine to work, the Zedillo administration will have to tighten its budget and postpone promised new social spending. That, along with the likelihood of temporarily slower growth rates, is worrisome at a time of continued political instability.
There are reasons that foreign investors will not be permanently disaffected. Mexican market reforms, for instance, are on track; they have already brought inflation from 160 percent to under 10 percent and balanced the federal budget. What investors will watch carefully is what Mr. Zedillo does from here on. If, for example, domestic businesses take advantage of the depreciated currency -- which makes foreign imports more expensive -- to raise wages and prices, then the benefit of depreciation will go for naught.
Nafta critics point to the fact that Mr. Zedillo is counting on a lower peso to price U.S. exports out of the Mexican market and lower the cost of Mexican goods to U.S. consumers. That, they say, will eliminate the U.S. bilateral trade surplus and eliminate U.S. jobs.
But the argument makes little sense. The purpose of trade is not to raise employment -- which the Federal Reserve now controls -- or rack up surpluses. Its purpose is to steer workers into high-productivity jobs: into computer and software production and out of textiles. The U.S. comes out ahead under Nafta no matter what happens to the bilateral trade balance.
The spectacle of a new government pledging one policy one week and doing something completely different the next is not pretty. And Mexican consumers will suffer from higher prices of foreign goods. But the alternative -- prolonged recession -- would have been worse. Mexico can survive this week's turmoil and prosper.

HEADLINE: Don't Let Wall Street Prey on County Funds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, whose principal city is Cleveland, recently experienced the same kind of investment fund losses as Orange County, California. While the magnitude of the losses is different ($2 billion and rising in Orange County and $135 million in Cuyahoga County), and while there were some derivative instruments in Orange County's portfolio (but, apparently, none in Cuyahoga County's), the statutory and oversight issues are the same. 
 Formal statutory oversight was not lacking in either case. In Ohio, an investment committee of two elected county commissioners met with the elected county treasurer monthly to review fund investments. In California, the elected county supervisors were authorized to oversee the elected county treasurer's investments. In both cases, as long as the treasurer seemed to be winning his bets, the designated overseers did not question his strategy or tactics.
Also, in both cases, Wall Street or regional investment firms clearly should be ashamed, even if not legally liable, for appearing to assist the treasurers in their reckless investment strategies. These were, essentially, borrowing short and investing long for initially higher yields, while failing to terminate this strategy as soon as short-term interest rates moved up.
Your Dec. 15 editorial ("Orange County's Fatal Error") is wrong to oppose prohibiting county funds from purchasing derivatives or borrowing to purchase securities. You accept the standard Wall Street line that it is possible to use derivatives or to borrow to reduce investment risk. Maybe so for firms investing private capital. But for the custodians of public funds?
What business does any political subdivision below the level of a state have running a commingled investment fund apart from that subdivision's own general fund? Don't safety and liquidity considerations preclude the use of many types of derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements?
Shouldn't investments of public funds be limited to near-term maturities not in excess of two years to preserve liquidity and minimize the risk of principal valuation changes due to changes in interest rates?
How do you propose to insure a proper degree of public oversight of investments by elected officials in the absence of periodic marking to market value of public investment portfolios and public disclosure of those values? Is not the absence of a general requirement that this be done an invitation to abuse by securities firms seeking to dispose of depreciating securities, an invitation that gullible county treasurers might be too eager to extend, even inadvertently?
Derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements have become important to the New York financial services community in the last decade or two. But you would have done that community a greater favor by reminding it that such products are appropriate only for the most sophisticated investors and generally are inappropriate for custodians of public funds.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Cars Hit the Road Every Day

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Star Fades for Natural Gas Autos" (news article, Dec. 16) cites advantages in natural gas vehicles, but does not support the headline's conclusion. 
 What has changed since the idea of using natural gas as a transportation fuel emerged in the 1970's? The benefits of cleaner air, safer fuel and environmental protection remain, and so do the economic advantages and strategic benefits of having an abundant, domestic fuel source. Natural gas vehicles can benefit this country's citizens, its economy, its environment and its national security now and in the future.
The Big Three auto makers have shown limited enthusiasm. So have the major oil companies. These industries enjoy mandates and heavy subsidies from Federal and state governments, yet they campaign effectively against similar incentives to kick start the natural gas vehicles industry. I believe you confuse market entry difficulties with lack of market success.
Natural gas vehicles grow as a viable choice despite heavy competition from the industry that owns and controls the supply of natural gas and from the industry that makes vehicles, and without real governmental support. Today, there are almost 1,200 fueling stations in operation (554 available to the public), with more than 200 new ones built every year.
Natural gas vehicles are used every day to deliver our mail, our children to school and numerous corporate products to market. Investment, from both internal and external sources, continues.
Natural gas vehicles look like stars in the market for vehicles with high fuel use.

HEADLINE: CHRISTMAS ON THE ROAD -- GERMANY: R. W. APPLE Jr.;
A Country Hotel in Swabia Takes Guests Into the Family

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.; R. W. APPLE Jr. is the Washington bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
If Christmas is a time for surprises, New York Times correspondents have had their share: along with the Japanese Santa and tree-trimming Muscovites there were the Serbian snipers, the bullets in Beirut, the tragic fire in Tennessee.
In writing of their most memorable Christmases away from home, 10 correspondents range around the world; some recall elegant feasts, in a Swabian castle or a Hong Kong hotel; others cannot forget the fruitcake they could not possibly eat in Somalia, the joy radiating from a Saigon cathedral, or the tearful Mass in Sarajevo. All remember how they counted their blessings. 
 In the last six weeks of 1984, my wife and I traveled across Europe -- from our base in London to France and Spain, to Scandinavia, to the Low Countries and finally to Germany. I was working on a series of pieces about the decline, then just becoming evident, in the economic and political influence of trade unions. As we headed south from Essen, in the Ruhr, Christmas was fast approaching; we had bought some small presents for each other in that city's wonderful open-air Christkindlmarkt, or Christ Child Market. My work was not quite finished, so we had decided not to head home, but instead to spend a three-day holiday at a hotel in Swabia I had spotted in the Michelin guide .
German friends had assured me that we were on the right track, but we were the slightest bit nervous as we turned off the autobahn near the little town of Ohringen, north of Stuttgart. Germany is a land of musical, architectural and scenic wonders, but was not at that time exactly world-famous for elegant country hotels or masterful cooking. Still, Christmas and Germany have always come in the same package for me. We sang German carols like "Silent Night" and "Away in a Manger" when I was growing up in Ohio, and my grandmother made pfeffernusse and other old-fashioned German cookies every December.
We need not have worried. The moment we arrived at the Forest-and-Castle-Hotel Friedrichsruhe, we were enchanted by the place. Lothar Eiermann, who runs it and presides in its kitchens, made us feel not like wandering Americans but like members-for-the-moment of the old princely Hohenlohe family that owns the hotel. On Christmas Eve there was a small cocktail party at which the Eiermanns' daughter, Alexa, shyly played Christmas songs on her violin and flute. There was a Lucullan buffet in the formal dining room, laden with oysters and lobsters, fresh foie gras and baby quails in aspic, to be enjoyed with one's choice from a spectacular list of more than 1,000 wines. We went to a charming church service in a Baroque church in the nearby, aptly named village of Schontal (beautiful valley). When we came home, a bottle of Champagne and a plate of Christmas cookies awaited us in our room.
That night, of course, it snowed. Just before dawn, the staff placed several dozen freshly cut, undecorated balsams against the front of the old hunting lodge that forms part of the hotel. We walked in the morning mist, transfixed. Then we settled into the forest-green stube, decorated with hunting trophies, ate our Christmas lunch (goose, of course, with two kinds of cabbage and a dumpling as light as a souffle) and walked some more.
My wife, Betsey, had found the perfect present, of course. It was an eight-inch Christmas tree, trimmed with tiny ornaments and mounted on a music box that plays carols. We still have it. It travels with us now, so it can be part of each Christmas, wherever we are, a reminder of Swabia in the snow.

HEADLINE: Will a Flying Doll . . . Fly?

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SELLA; Marshall Sella writes for New York, Outside and other magazines.

 BODY:
ON A GRAY AND GUSTY DAY IN JUNE, 35 GIRLS BETWEEN THE ages of 5 and 9 were gathered in a conference room near the San Francisco Airport, looking at prototypes of a toy they'd never seen before. Lewis Galoob Toys had convened a series of focus groups to watch real live kids interact with a doll being developed for 1995. The name of the doll was Sky Dancer.
Deborah Rivers, the research consultant who led the groups, would have preferred a less sterile environment to put the girls at their ease, but this windowless room would have to do. On one wall were pictures of military airplanes. Directly across was a one-way mirror, so that the precise reactions of the participants could be videotaped and analyzed later. 
 The grainy tapes show bunches of girls -- some scruffy, some bright-eyed, some with bows in their hair. Rivers begins by making a "pinkie promise" with each girl to insure that everything said between these walls will be the truth. The children are happy to swear on their honor. They have a good idea that, just around the bend, there will be a reward for their consultations. So they like everything, agree to everything.
"You know," Rivers says dubiously to the kids, "some people say that flying toys are only for boys. Is that true?" The response is immediate: "No!" The notion that anything could be "only for boys" is summarily rejected. Then Rivers's tone changes. She has the girls close their eyes and then reads a brief set piece from her clipboard: "I'd like to welcome you to the enchanted world of Sky Dancers! Each beautiful Sky Dancer unfolds her elegant wings and flies with the wind. . . ." She goes on to evoke ocean waves and shimmering moons -- cue words to let the Sky Dancer whammy take effect.
The girls open their eyes. By now Rivers has brought out a bevy of dolls -- winged ballerinas, from the look of them. They are garish and plastic, with pink-and-lavender nylon hair. The girls blink a few times at the dolls. Many love them at first sight; others praise faintly, hoping they won't blow their chance to get the money they've been promised. Two of the 35 girls react to the doll with open disdain. "Well," says a girl named Kate, who's missing a front tooth, "she's not the best thing in the world."
But Rivers isn't discouraged; this doll's got a gimmick. She picks up her prototype by its flowery base -- or, more accurately, its pistol-grip launcher -- and tugs at a string. The doll starts to twirl; its wings lift, by virtue of aerodynamic design, until all at once the Sky Dancer has risen free of its base and whizzed straight up in the air, winged arms whirring like a helicopter blade. The girls respond in a hushed chorus: "Cooool!"
Post-flight, Rivers elicits comments on the doll and asks the girls how they like it. One claims she wants a Sky Dancer "more than the whole universe." At a certain point, Rivers leaves the room. Behind the mirror are a few Galoob employees, including Scott Masline, the firm's vice president of marketing and a driving force in the doll's development. Rivers wants to check with Masline to see if he'd like any departures from the script. It's also an ideal chance to observe the girls at their most candid.
During one group, Rivers's exit is greeted with silence. Finally, Emily, a blond girl with a ponytail, speaks. "She's probably going to get the money," she says quietly.
"How much are you guys getting?" asks a waif from across the table.
"We're all getting $25," Emily replies.
Behind the glass, Scott Masline is ignoring the girls' discussion. He's pleased. It seems that girls don't need an elaborate story line to understand his product; "flying doll" is clear to them. Best of all, he has heard the elongated syllable "Cooool" uttered eight out of eight times.
 ONE YEAR FROM TODAY, you may know Sky Dancer's shape and features far more intimately than you'd wish. Perhaps you'll have seen the television ad -- even heard from your own child's lips what sets this doll apart from the rest of the plastic merchandise being hawked in toy stores, why the toy is a vital addition to your household, why it's necessary to own.
Sky Dancer's suggested retail price will be $9.99. It is made of polyvinyl chloride and impact-resistant styrene. Including its platform, it stands at 11 1/2 inches -- the precise height from which Barbie, the queen of all dolls, smiles out upon the world. If Galoob has done its work well -- and is blessed by the capricious gods who in the past have decreed that turtles must have Renaissance painters' names and that a cadre of teen-agers can transform themselves into the helmeted superheroes known as Power Rangers -- Sky Dancer will be all the rage, the sort of product that engenders black markets, toy-related bribes and giddy newspaper stories invoking the word "phenomenon."
The other end of the spectrum of possibilities is too awful for Galoob to contemplate. For the toy industry is like a child on a bad day: Darwinian in its selection of what to cherish and what to discard. As many as half of the 6,000 new toys introduced every February in New York at the American International Toy Fair (the convention at which new products are unveiled to retail buyers) do not survive to the holiday season. Even though two-thirds of all purchases are made between Thanksgiving and Christmas, retailers track their receipts through the summer and toys that do not sell quickly are shunned.
For all their goofy unpredictability, toys are big business -- really big. Retail sales in 1993, according to the Toy Manufacturers of America, were an estimated $17.5 billion, up nearly 25 percent from 1990. But with a wave of consolidation sweeping the industry (Hasbro, for instance, now owns Kenner, Playskool, Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers), it's getting harder for the major companies to take risks when it comes to offering unclassifiable new toys -- like, say, a flying doll.
"Think about it," says Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. "Mattel is going to make $3.1 billion in 1994. If they want to grow by 10 percent next year, taking into account the portions of their line that naturally fall away, they have to create the equivalent of the fourth largest toy company on the face of the earth, and they have to do that each year. They can't consider every $20 million invention floating around out there. They have to get in bed with Disney and McDonald's, to develop a level of predictability."
The odd toys are left to the smaller, hungrier companies to develop. Make no mistake: dolls do not spring full-grown from the heads of inventors. They evolve. Every square inch of what you see on toy store shelves has been mulled over, revamped, checked against safety standards, then mulled over some more. The shape of a doll's hand may well be the topic of costly research; its smile may be debated by trained experts.
The Sky Dancer line, for example, was developed not only by a marketing staff but by an aviation expert, an ex-nun and a key sculptor for the film "Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas." Between the day Sky Dancer was conceived to the day it first came off an assembly line in Shajing, China, 24 months passed. And not one of the people who fretted the doll into existence has the vaguest idea if it will be next year's white-hot item or an industry joke.
 ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN the fall of 1992, a toy inventor named John Gentile was standing on his front lawn in Montclair, N.J., watching his young daughters play with maple seedlings -- the elongated, wing-shaped kind that spiral when released from a modest height. As he stood observing his girls, who were 4 and 7, their game never varied: they would pick up a seedling, fling it in the air and watch it flutter back to earth.
A strange idea occurred to him. The girls, he realized, had been captivated by a toy that functioned beautifully at the lowest possible cost. They had shopped on the ground and had picked out a trinket they liked.
Within a half-hour, Gentile had dispatched his daughters on a little hunt to ferret out the lawn's finest examples of seedlings. Not wet, not buggy. Dad wanted specimens that would flutter to the ground and not wobble. With a pocketful of seedlings, Gentile drove to work and showed them to his brother Anthony.
"What we thought we had," John Gentile says, "was an idea for a girl's toy we hadn't seen before. We were familiar with flying toys for boys. I mean, we'd played with lots of them when we were kids. Whirlybirds, flight rings -- they still have a dozen names. You pull a string and the ring zips into the air. Some of them aren't even rings; they're just sticks with propellers on top that you flick between your fingers."
Three months passed. Since the Gentiles were already committed to other projects -- mainly, a screenplay based on G.I. Joe -- there was no question of dropping everything to explore the miracle of seedlings. No one leaped from his chair and cried, "By God, it's the hit we've been waiting for!" But as the brothers pondered the way the seedling flew, a sense of its delicacy gradually pervaded their minds. Just maybe, they thought, a traditionally male play pattern could be recast as a female one.
On this autumn afternoon two years later, John and Anthony Gentile are in a conference room in their West 54th Street offices, seated across from their business partner, Marty Abrams. The company is called Abrams/Gentile Entertainment, or AGE, and the division of labor is simple: Abrams has been in toy manufacturing for 30 years and the Gentiles -- whom he refers to collectively as Janthony -- are idea men. Janthony dreams up shapes and functions and stories to go with them; Abrams knows what the market will bear.
The three men formed AGE in 1986. Abrams had transformed his family company, Mego, from a third-rate toy importer into an industry force, producing dolls based on Superman and the Waltons. But after heavy losses in the early 80's, Mego filed for Chapter 11. Abrams managed to land on his feet and linked up with the Gentiles, who had had considerable success designing movie posters. "John would start painting at the upper right corner of a poster and Anthony would start at the lower left," Abrams says. "Then they'd meet perfectly in the middle."
John and Anthony Gentile are identical twins but decline to provide symmetry. They have not dressed alike since the age of 2. Anthony's sneakers are white; John's are black. Both men are slight -- economically built, as if Marty Abrams has constructed them from scratch, with an eye to cost.
Hovering protectively over his two geniuses, Marty Abrams is affable and loud. "We asked ourselves, How can we put a beautiful head on wings?" Abrams says. "How can we make something magical here, without making it crazy expensive?"
By early 1993, Janthony was tinkering with existing whirlybird designs. "We started bending the wings, to see if we could still achieve lift," Anthony Gentile says. "Since the thing would ultimately need to have a human form, we had to get the blades to look more like arms. We couldn't have a stiff-armed doll -- a Frankenstein monster look. We had to make it relaxed and graceful, like Tinkerbell."
The flying doll got its very first head, an oval nub of Styrofoam. Wings made of holographic material (which is translucent, not unlike an insect wing) were attached. It also got its first nickname. For ease of reference, John Gentile dubbed the dolls "Twirlies."
Incarnations of Twirlies proliferated. John and Anthony Gentile, who work side by side at computer-equipped drafting boards, drew color renditions of round-headed elves -- big-eyed, rosy-cheeked, with pointy ears and painted hair. The decision to make Twirlies elfin was not purely esthetic -- the Gentiles were convinced that adding hair would ruin the creature's chances of flight. "Putting wings on a doll is one thing," Anthony Gentile says, "but adding hair complicates the whole process. Hair is awfully heavy."
The Gentiles also banged out a bunch of possible names for the doll. There were 23 on the final list, which included Spinderellas, Fancy Flys and Pettifloats. Somewhere toward the middle of the column was a name they couldn't get enough of. And even though in-house diagrams would continue to bear the Twirlies logo, everyone started to call the doll Sky Dancer.
Months later, Galoob would generate 64 more potential names, but none would ever depose Sky Dancer. "If this doll is blessed to become a hit with girls," Anthony Gentile explains, "the Dancer name allows us to add any number of names in front of it." Expanding the line would be simple. A lighted version of the doll, for instance, might be called "Night Dancer." A glittery one, "Star Dancer."
Meanwhile, Janthony was churning out technical drawings, grappling with how to help Lift win out over Drag. When the twins decided that a hair style was viable, the pixie Sky Dancer was unceremoniously killed off. Its face morphed overnight into that of a 19-year-old girl, with blond hair tied straight up in a bow a la Barbie. She was anorexically thin, for the sake of aerodynamics, and decidedly flat-chested, also for the sake of aerodynamics. Her hands were folded across her heart, hugging flowers to her girlish chest. That, too, was aerodynamic.
As night falls on 54th Street, Anthony Gentile is still at work, buzzing down well-worn furrows in the blue carpet. His twin was born two minutes ahead of him and tonight it seems he intends to make up the difference. Returning to the conference table, he indicates the series of 3-D forms Sky Dancer took after the sketching was done. "At this stage," he says, pointing out a sticklike shape, "we had to add a smidge to the rump. Then we tossed it on a phonograph turntable to see if it would spin evenly. We're high-tech."
The body was first shaped in clay, then translated into styrene plastic. At last, AGE had a model it could reasonably show to toy manufacturers. The prototype was primitive. Its arms were green propeller blades torn off an old whirlybird. It had a yellow silk flower for a skirt, with a round head and a dab of blue paint for hair. It was, after all, only a prototype.
Over the summer of 1993, the Gentiles and Marty Abrams pitched Sky Dancer to a few of the big toy companies. Tyco liked it, Abrams said, but was nervous about safety; Hasbro, too, was all smiles but clung to the belief that being able to fly was primarily a male fantasy and rejected Sky Dancers on the spot.
In July, Gary Niles, Galoob's executive vice president of marketing and product acquisition, stopped into AGE. The trio showed him a few concepts he wasn't interested in, then gave him a glimpse of the flying doll. It took him two minutes to decide he wanted to buy it for Galoob. A deal was struck. AGE would receive around 6 percent of Galoob's net revenues on the doll, with an advance of $150,000.
 AS YOU ENTER THE MAZE OF Galoob's offices out near the San Francisco Airport, you see high-gloss framed photographs of the firm's greatest hits: a blond doll who seems to be struggling to keep afloat in crystal-blue water; a life-size four-wheel-drive vehicle with a Micro Machines logo crushing real Cadillacs in a field.
Gary Niles's desk sits beneath a Chagall and pictures of vampires. At 54, Niles dresses elegantly and has a pugilist's frame. "The first time I saw this doll," he says, tugging upward at the hair of a Sky Dancer, "she looked like a scene from the Crucifixion. She was stiff and ugly, but the concept was there. I said: 'A flying doll! Of course!' "
Niles is not a details man; he trusts others in his company to know that a doll's eyes are blue and that her hair, if it is not a "fantasy color" like glitter-pink or teal, is blond. "Blond!" he shouts, pounding his index finger on page after page of a Toys "R" Us catalogue. "Blond! Blond! Blond!"
After the snap decision at AGE, Niles sent the prototype back west to his marketing staff. "My instinct," he says, "is to know if a doll has a chance. A chance, O.K.? It's that simple. I gave the model to Scott Masline and said, 'Make this pretty.' "
Masline was hired by Galoob in October 1992, about the time John Gentile was pondering maple seedlings. Galoob needed to fortify its girls' sales, which was Masline's line of expertise. At Mattel, he'd been a director of marketing for fashion dolls and was therefore on intimate terms with Barbie.
When the Sky Dancer sketches arrived at Galoob, Masline was impressed but concerned. "I realized that a flying doll would have no direct competition," he says. "That wasn't all good, since it meant there was no data on which to judge the thing. But maybe there was a way we could nibble away at some of Barbie's business."
Like Masline, Barbie is 35, but she still holds sway over the doll world. In 1993, Barbie and her accessories earned $1.2 billion in sales for Mattel. She has no buzz -- people are not huddling outside Kmarts to find her -- but if Barbie were somehow separated out from Mattel, she would comprise the third largest toy company in the nation. "Any girl's toy, in a sense, goes up against Barbie," Masline says. "Our wildest dream is that a girl will be in the market for Barbies and, instead of buying seven of her, will decide to get six Barbies and one of ours."
In September 1993, Masline oversaw a market viability test -- a precursor to Deborah Rivers's focus group -- to see if Galoob's faith in Sky Dancers was misguided. Although the breadth of the survey was tiny by scientific standards -- it included only 50 children -- the degree of enthusiasm was enough to keep Galoob moving. Ninety percent of the sample kids picked Sky Dancer as either a first or second choice against the competing dolls they were shown, and one of those dolls was a Barbie.
"And so our doll was born," Masline says. "We simply didn't know what it was going to look like until it got older."
 "THIS COMPANY NEEDS FOCUS TO survive," says Mark Goldman, Galoob's chief executive officer. "Our revenue from last year, $134 million, is lower than Mattel's ad budget. Sky Dancer would be a minuscule product to them, but if it brings in $25 million in 1995, as I expect it will, that'll be a big percentage of our business."
As Christmas 1993 approached, however, Sky Dancer was still in limbo. Karyn Silfies, Galoob's preliminary-design chief, was scuffling with the guys in engineering about how to make the doll flightworthy.
"The trouble was not merely that the doll had to fly," Silfies says. "Boys' toys are accepted if they can merely stay airborne. This had to fly beautifully -- and that's close, in engineering terms, to being an intangible."
Silfies, like Gary Niles and Scott Masline, spent her formative years at Mattel. She is fortyish and has blond hair that flows to her waist; it is as perfectly straight and silky as a doll's. But she is an extraordinarily technical person. "Engineering was telling us that we'd have to use a paddle for a wing," she says. "That made the doll look like a moth. We kept having to remind everyone that this was a human form, not a thing with propellers."
Galoob engineers were initially convinced that the doll's arms would have to jut straight out from her shoulders -- the crucified sprite of Gary Niles's nightmares. Then in December, an aviation expert named Bill Kelley (formerly of Mattel) made a crucial suggestion: What if the doll's wings rose and fell not laterally from the shoulders but to the front and back? With the right wing rising forward and the left rising behind, Sky Dancer wouldn't look like she was being tortured. She would be dancing.
Kelley's prototype is still lying in Silfies' office, alongside the boxes of heads and torsos that trace the doll's early history. There is a black "#3" written in Magic Marker on one Styrofoam wing. Square white joints and metal pins clutter the shoulders. Most important, the wings fold to the front and back, and the thing does more than fly: it glides.
Silfies commissioned a graphic designer named Marlene Dantzer to sketch rough versions of Sky Dancer's face and body. Two days before last Christmas, Dantzer faxed a packet of line drawings of Sky Dancer in a variety of childlike poses, along with a letter explaining how she had interpreted Silfies's request for a realistic-looking Tinkerbell. "Well," Dantzer wrote, "Marilyn Monroe was the model for Tinkerbell, so she was a very sensual, sexy little imp, not unlike a subtler version of the Playboy bunny. So while I kept her more of an ingenue, I made her sensual, a little sexy."
The pictures show a girl only the toy industry could legally concoct. She might be 20 or she might be 9. She is on tiptoe, with legs that are far too long for her nubile body. In other words, she is the epitome of a marketable doll. She is only remarkably thin, instead of being anorexically, aerodynamically thin.
 SHELLEY DANIELS GOT HER START in sculpturing as a 7-year-old growing up in San Diego. Since the family ate dinner in the kitchen, she and her siblings started messing around with clay on the dining-room table. For the next 10 years, the table was known as Claytown. "I played with Barbie dolls," she says, "but eventually I just wanted to play with the town more."
There are pictures of Claytown left over from the 60's: overvivid Kodachromes that show turrets and castles as well as the giant children who built it all. In the photos, Shelley stands primly wearing a red scarf and an innocent smile. Her face, in fact, is not at all unlike that of the Sky Dancer she formed out of clay -- no surprise, since it is a longstanding theory of the industry that sculptors tend to create likenesses of themselves and their families.
Shelley Daniels is now at work on Disney's version of "James and the Giant Peach." When Karyn Silfies phoned her to see if she'd be interested in a little work between films, Silfies sounded desperate. "We need a head," she told Daniels. "How soon can you do it?"
This was a Friday. Daniels asked, "How's Monday?" Silfies did not provide Daniels with sketches. She simply said that the face should be sweet, innocent. Younger than Barbie. Daniels told Silfies she was happy to oblige.
Like any visual artist, Daniels has trouble describing how it is that her hands formed a head out of clay. This much she can tell you: she started by rolling it in her hands, then went to work on it with her favorite tool, a flat wooden knife. She pulls out a lump of clay and sets about making a head. Nothing fancy -- just something to show how she uses her array of blades and dental picks. The blade rises, stabs, pokes and smooths out features -- a mouth, a face.
She squints at a Sky Dancer head lying on the desk and points out a dozen imperfections visible only to her. There used to be a dimple in the right cheek -- just where Daniels has one -- but the reduction process made it look like a pit and it was filled in. "And one eye," she says ruefully, "is higher than the other. And there's a nick in the nose."
Monday rolled around. Daniels carried her head, in a box, to Galoob. Silfies told Daniels to try for a straighter smile; the rest was fine. Daniels went home with her tiny head and put it in her makeshift kiln.
"I popped it in the oven," she says. "Two hundred degrees, since it's such a tiny head. Ten minutes, tops. I didn't want to burn it." Daniels's head was transformed into a wax mold, from which plastic and steel molds and millions of other little heads could be fashioned. "It was several weeks before I saw the final model," she says. "The only thing that still troubles me is the ears. There was some sort of accident, and they had to change the ears. Mine were dainty, but these . . . I don't know. They're wormy.
"Still, when I look at her" -- inevitably, the pronoun has at some point become humanized -- "I'm so proud. I think it's nice she has a crooked little smile."
 THE PRE-PAINTED HEADS were bald and colorless -- babies' heads, with neither pupils nor teeth. Galoob was in crunch time. A showing in Hong Kong, where international buyers would meet the doll, was only two months away. This girl needed lips -- and hair. Silfies approached a celebrity hair stylist she'd worked with in the past, Nellie Muganda. Muganda's clients ranged from Paul McCartney to Pat Buchanan. By July, Muganda had created a gallery of Galoob-approved hair designs.
Now it was time to put features on the face. Silfies turned to Kathy Bleser, one of the world's premier doll-face painters. Bleser had spent a year in a convent before she realized that she was in the wrong line of work and took a job at Mattel. When Bleser left the company in 1970, she had painted the face of every Barbie in that year's catalogue.
Bleser's studio is in Long Beach, Calif., and overlooks the Queen Mary. Her hands are scuffed and nimble. There are permanent indentations, made by brushes, on the tip of her index finger and the inside edge of her middle one.
Since Bleser has herself worked as a freelance inventor, Karyn Silfies's initial call about Sky Dancer was vague. "That's the way we work," Bleser says. "She didn't say what the doll was. Everything's on a need-to-know basis." Bleser wasn't insulted by Silfies's secrecy; when Bleser's own daughter visits her, she drapes her desk. After all, her daughter is in the business.
There were 36 heads in the first shipment Bleser received, and she now recreates how she did the job: She stacks white towels seven inches high and lays a featureless baby head on top, pulling magnifier goggles over her eyes. Out comes a brush. The best instruments, Bleser says, are ones that have been used for months -- brushes that have only four or five bristles left on them. On the scale she works, a new brush is as useless as a broom. In a few minutes, the doll face is getting real; you can almost see the whites of its eyes.
"I've painted heads the size of a pea," she says. "I do not breathe."
Freehand, she creates a perfectly round iris in blue. Sky Dancer is gazing out, but you can't yet see where she is Continued on page 43
gazing. Eventually, pupils arrive. With two quick taps of white paint from a sharp point, Sky Dancer's eye gets highlights -- "sparkles," as Karyn Silfies likes to call them. Little twinkles to show the doll is alive, here with you now, full of hope. The doll's cheek is then dabbed with ground pastel chalk for blush; acrylic is stroked over her lips and eyes to give them extra shine. The entire process takes four hours.
In August, Galoob was getting ready to film its Sky Dancer television commercial; Bleser was enlisted to paint 36 more faces for the shoot. Her work would be used not only in "hero shots" -- close-ups of the doll's features -- but also for the medium shots, where Sky Dancers would be zooming around. A week before the shoot, Bleser broke her wrist in a self-defense class. Galoob shot the ad on schedule and was even able to use Bleser's faces for the hero shots. For three months, though, Bleser was unable to work. The hospital had braced her arm with a cast. These days, at least in California, you can get casts in different colors. Hers was in the precise shade the toy industry knows as Barbie pink.
 THERE ARE A THOUsand points at which a toy company can pull the plug on a product in which it has lost faith. One is early viability testing, which Sky Dancer had passed with flying colors, even if the flying-color prototype wobbled. If there is one Rubicon in the process, however, it is the day of cutting steel.
"Cutting steel" is toy-industry slang for creating the expensive molds that will eventually (and, with luck, for years and years) churn out dolls. Since Sky Dancer was a complicated piece, there was a lot of tooling to make -- $400,000 worth, in fact. On May 24, Galoob cut steel.
Tooling was not all Galoob had at stake. Research and development had also cost $400,000, which included not only the work of Shelley Daniels (at $50 an hour) and that of Kathy Bleser (at $150 a head) but also the myriad of unforeseeable costs that toy executives must foresee: wing designs that never panned out; trial and error on fabrics for Sky Dancer's tutu; abortive head-sculptures. "That R.& D. money paid for everything that happened from Square 1," says Scott Masline. "Everything that stunk and everything that didn't."
Of the $7.49 wholesale cost for one Sky Dancer, Galoob will take a narrow profit to begin with. (The $9.99 store price, conveniently under $10, is a magic "price point" in the industry.) Scott Masline won't specify exact figures, but he says it costs the company about $3.30 to make one of the doll and launcher sets. Beyond that, there are other costs the company has paid up front: package design, presentations, first samples (which can run up to $20,000 each) and TV-ad production.
"By the time we made our tooling," Scott Masline says, "we'd already sunk in excess of a million dollars into this doll. Granted, if we only sell a half-million of these, it's going to be very bad news. But this is what the toy industry is all about. If you have a multiyear success, you get past that narrow margin. You already have the molds. Suddenly, the toys are easy to make. The company's sliver of profit becomes a chunk."
In June, Masline took one minute of edited tape from the Deborah Rivers focus groups and left it grainy, just to underscore its realism. For the next three months, Galoob showed Sky Dancer, along with the video, to major retailers. This wasn't just to show off the doll's fabulous smile. Many chains plan precisely how they will stock their shelves several months in advance. Target stores have a rigid "planogram": by October, their strategists already know what toy will be sitting in the center of Aisle 7B, third shelf up, next spring. If Sky Dancer was to be under Christmas trees in 1995, it had to be on the shelves by May.
During the presentation season, Masline braced for resistance, but there was none. "What we were worried about," he explains, "was that the retailers would say, 'This is not a product for girls.' The reason they didn't is that we had tape of girls actively loving this doll." This was no small relief. "If Kmart and Wal-Mart tell you you haven't got a toy," he says, "then you haven't got a toy."
On Aug. 23, Toys "R" Us, which presides over the retail world with 21.5 percent of all toy sales, made its regal inspection of the flying doll. The company's buyers offered minor advice, mainly about packaging, most of which Galoob humbly accepted.
Toys "R" Us, like any cold war government agency, is bureaucratic and reticent about everything. I phoned one of its major buyers to ask how the doll had been received. The person to whom I spoke paused, then said I could not attribute what he was about to impart to me. Then, in the halting tones of a hostage, he whispered that Toys "R" Us had liked the doll, had found it "fresh."
 SKY DANCERS CAME INTO this world on Sept. 19, at a factory in the Pearl Delta region of China. Molten nylon metamorphosed into wings. Extra-hard plastic narrowed into extra-sleek bodies. One-and-one-half grams of hair was rooted in, at precisely the right number of strands per inch. Each coif got a lightning-fast styling and trim, using genuine Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray.
Lastly, as packaging was applied, each head was turned coquettishly outward, to insure eye contact with consumers. In the first run, this phase bedeviled Galoob. Heads were being bent at a 45-degree angle off center -- but a doll's gaze, as everybody knows, should be no more than 10 degrees off. When parents and tots wander down retail aisles, Sky Dancer must not be shy. She should look at her new moms, so they will recognize that she is their girl.
From China, a battalion of Sky Dancers was shipped to San Francisco. A small number, about 20,000, would be trucked to Cleveland, Houston and San Francisco, where test launches would be conducted this Christmas to gauge how many dolls should be manufactured for next Christmas.
 F.A.O. SCHWARZ, IN its San Francisco incarnation, sits across the street from Macy's in the Union Square shopping district. With the exception of Barbie, who has an area all her own on the first floor, dolls are consigned to the second floor and are separated into two sections. There are the "Fine Dolls," which stare out from acrylic boxes in bridal gowns and nighties and cost anywhere up to $1,500. The more affordable figures are known as "TV Dolls," since that's where children are first introduced to them.
Unlike fine dolls, TV dolls are built less for beauty than function, and at F.A.O. Schwarz, function is in rich supply. There are dolls that wet themselves, dolls that chat on the phone, dolls that tap-dance.
Sky Dancer is being test-marketed here, tagged at $15 -- double the wholesale cost. (When it comes to setting prices, F.A.O. Schwarz is a world unto itself.) Even so, she has been granted third-rate placement in the store, since she is a 1995 item and has no TV recognition. Besides, when the first case of the dolls arrived a week ago, F.A.O. employees were unimpressed.
"They looked stupid," says Jason Stewart, the spiky-haired floor manager. "I mean, fairyland-theme toys are a dime a dozen. Then, out of curiosity, some of us started trying them out." Hands-on demonstration turned the tide. As soon as employees started tinkering with the dolls -- fiddling with the pull-string to make a Sky Dancer twirl or playing catch with one during lulls in the afternoon -- the dolls started blowing off the shelf. Today, the Sky Dancer area is empty. There are only two left, and one of those is stranded up near the ceiling, the victim of an overly ambitious launch. Her blue head can still be seen jutting out from a ledge.
By 2 in the afternoon, 12 new cases of Sky Dancers have arrived and are ready to go. Employees are a bit relieved; they can again fool around with the doll without having to explain to customers why they have none to sell.
The first parent-child combination to wander past is a ponytailed man and a blond 4-year-old girl in a "Lion King" shirt. As they walk by, Jason Stewart launches a Sky Dancer off to the little girl's left. She has seen the doll in its static pose during her reconnaissance of the area a few minutes ago, but this fresh development stops her dead in her tracks. She stares, slack jawed, at the sprite's powerful launch, then its smooth descent. Stewart even succeeds in catching the doll by the swivel base, so that it continues to pirouette even after he has it in hand. He has the touch. The Sky Dancer comes gradually to rest and its wings fall modestly to its side.
The little girl is rapt. Her father, who has now strolled 10 feet ahead, feels his child radar kick in and turns to see where his daughter has gotten to. He catches sight of the expression on her face and knows it instinctively. It is the look that says his girl's thoughts have gone to another place. It is the look that says: Are fairies real? Can a little girl fly? Should I instruct my purchasing agent to acquire this article, as an important addition to my current collection?
Dad isn't ready to commit himself, so he pulls a deft maneuver. "Honey," he says, "do you see the lions?" For a crucial instant the child is diverted. She glances over at a pile of cuddly cubs: scores of identical Simbas, based on the Lion King character she has emblazoned on her chest. By now, it's all over. The Sky Dancer has passed from her field of vision.
"A flying Barbie, huh?" Dad says over his shoulder as the two stroll away. "That's something!"
Other parents are less equivocal. For a solid two hours, the response is uniform: A parent strides up to the register with an Aladdin doll or a Sanrio duck and, after witnessing a twirl or two, lobs a Sky Dancer onto the top of the pile, often without pausing to ask the price.
Others get a glimpse of Sky Dancer's wings and see only blades. "Yes, it does look like Tinkerbell," an Italian woman whispers to her daughter, "but it is actually a very dangerous ballerina!"
For every parent who doubts Sky Dancer's safety, though, there are 10 who feel the foam wings and take their softness as an assurance of safety. As the afternoon passes, sales in the doll section are suffering: Baby Walk 'n Roll is neither wiggling nor giggling. Cabbage Patch dolls are looking more forlorn than ever. Jennie Gymnast, who earlier was attracting even 12-year-old boys with her strange writhing motions on the floor, seems to be facing a long dry spell until the next Olympics. But for Sky Dancer, sales are brisk. There is every sign that, in this unrepresentative toy store, on this unrepresentative day, there's a run on the flying doll.
Still, as anyone in retail can tell you, there is no such thing in life as an unqualified hit. A cold rain starts blowing across Stockton Street and F.A.O. Schwarz falls quiet. The second floor feels especially bleak. Several girls give the doll a spin or two and, bored silly, drop it where they stand. A pudgy 8-year-old girl in a windbreaker stares at a demonstration without saying a word. Her face is blank. When the Sky Dancer hits the floor, her indifference turns to hostility. She glares at the doll as if it has stirred a terrible memory in her, then walks dejectedly off toward the video section.
But all is not lost. Just before closing, I drop by the main office to ask Gary Jockers, the store's general manager, what sort of business he thinks the flying doll will do next year. Though he has no way of knowing it yet, the 12 cases of dolls that just arrived will be gone in three days and F.A.O. Schwarz's buyer will say that "I now expect to sell thousands before Christmas, 10 times the number I'd planned for."
"The flyin' doll?" Jockers repeats. "It's blessed."
 SCOTT MASLINE PROJECTS THAT GALOOB WILL sell 1.5 million Sky Dancers in 1995. "Two million," he says, chortling, "wouldn't terribly upset us." Outside the three test cities, only a few people have seen the doll and issued their findings. "Sky Dancer has very strong appeal," says David Leibowitz, who follows the toy industry for Burnham Securities in Manhattan. "It has every sign of what the trade calls 'play value.' I can't define that quality, but I know it when I see it."
Sean McGowan, the toy analyst, predicts "it'll sell well for a year, but I don't see that girls are going to need more than one, and that's a problem. It won't be a hit three years down the road, I'm pretty sure of that."
For the moment, Sky Dancer's prospects for the year ahead are daunting enough. Some 300,000 Sky Dancers are now snaking their way through the distribution systems of various American retailers for next spring. The TV commercial makes its national debut in early February. Galoob has slated roughly $4 million in air time for the doll -- enough so that, by next Thanksgiving, children may be able to lip-sync with the little blond girl who shouts, "They really fly!"
 HOPE AND KATE KRAUSE ARE TWINS -- THOUGH, unlike the toy-inventing Gentiles, they are fraternal, not identical. A few days before Thanksgiving, I brought them a pair of Sky Dancers, to see two 6-year-old girls react to Sky Dancers outside a toy store and without the aid of one-way mirrors.
The Krauses live in New Canaan, Conn., in a spacious house surrounded by its share of maples.
As a Sky Dancer was snipped from the captivity of its window box, Hope grabbed up the doll, grinned and scampered out the back door. Her sister, who was under the weather with a slight fever, watched quietly from the window.
Hope seemed to know instinctively how to launch the doll. I now realize this is because she and her sister have an extensive collection of whirlybirds -- a whole drawer of them, in fact.
After a few practice pulls, Hope saw her doll sail into the absolute blue of the late-autumn sky. The miracle of flight seemed to please her. She did not, however, catch the doll as it returned to earth. The family dog, an Australian shepherd called Boomerang, got there before she did and for several minutes ran around chomping it, playing out its own Sky Dancer fantasy. This scene repeated itself a few times -- launch, race with dog, chomp, launch. Even after the doll had sustained massive injuries to both wings and its left buttock, it still flew. It didn't even wobble much. But these subtleties were lost on young Hope. For the moment, she'd had enough of the doll.
We walked back inside. Kate was pulling at her Sky Dancer's string and eyeing the doll suspiciously as it pirouetted. "So," I asked the girls, trying not to pressure them, "will you play with these things?"
"Oh, yes," Hope replied politely. Nothing was clear. There was no point in relating how much time and money Galoob had gambled on this cheap-looking sylph. Two well-schooled consumers, in the precise age range of the product's target group, had met the doll and currently had it under consideration. Time would tell.
Outside, millions of maple seedlings were being crushed underfoot. Some would take root and some would not.
 
NEW FOR '95
 
Surprise Hat Susie, Tyco's lead doll for spring, has a few unexpected treats under her bonnet. "Best of all," says Bruce Maguire, a spokesman for Tyco, "her hat doubles as a cool purse to carry her brush, ribbon curler and the rest of her stuff." Surprise Hat Susie is scheduled to reach toy store shelves next month and will retail at $20.
 
Tyco has high hopes for this one, the first radio-controlled motorcycle on the market. The 1995 catalogue describes it as "two wheels on bone-shakin' speed that can't be beat."
The miniature cycle performs a variety of stunts, including 360-degree "donut" spins and jumps,
all at the pull of a lever. The
little Harley debuts in March and will retail
at $75.
 
Mattel's 35-year-old, ultra-lucrative line of Barbie dolls shows no sign of slowing down; Dance Moves Barbie, arriving next spring, follows fast on the heels of Gymnast Barbie. It will retail for about $13.
 
Hasbro Inc. has put serious corporate muscle behind the action figures based on the TV show, "VR Troopers": the hunky Ryan Steele, the brainy J. B. Reese, the lovely Kaitlin Star, the villains Dark Heart and Tankotron. The smaller action figures will range in price from $4.99 to $7.99, while the tall "Ultimate Ryan Steele" will sell for $19.99. Vehicles -- a VR Turbo Cycle, a VR Pursuit Jet and a Skyborg Jet -- will cost between $9.99 and $27.99 M.S.

The Imperious Imperative

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
"GET OVER WHATEVER PERSONal hang-ups you got," said Marion Barry, re-elected Mayor of Washington, after having been brought low four years before on a cocaine charge. To those who did not vote for him, he repeated, "Get over it."
This imperious imperative caused a small furor in politics' hometown. The satirist Mark Russell hailed get over it as "the city's new motto," adding cruelly about Mayor Barry that "his will be the most watched nose since Cyrano de Bergerac's." 
 Curiously, only two months ago, the media-harassed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was reported to have told a group of black officials in his chambers: "I'm going to be here for 40 years. For those who don't like it, get over it."
Last month, a disk jockey on WMZQ, a country music station in the nation's capital, reported that a turkey rights group had suggested people eat tofu for Thanksgiving, and asked listeners for appropriate songs to respond. Among them were Travis Tritt's "Here's a Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares" (theme music for "How the Gingrinch Stole Christmas"); Pam Tillis's "Don't Tell Me What to Do," a favorite of libertarians, and -- here we go -- a tune recorded in the summer by the Eagles, reunited after 14 years, titled "Get Over It."
And where did the rock group pick up the phrase? A bumper sticker after the 1992 Presidential election read: "Bush Lost. Get Over It." Shortly after that, when the Buffalo Bills won their divisional championship and returned to the Super Bowl, their motto was "We're Back, America. Get Over It." (They lost again, and they still can't get over it in upstate New York.)
This phrase, first used in 1839 in "Thirty-Six Years of Seafaring Life," has evidently achieved its voguish pinnacle today. Without the it, the infinitive phrase to get over has century-old slang meanings of "to improve one's status" and "to seduce." In its modern vogue sense, get over it has shouldered aside let's move on, last year's triumphant brushoff, and is in one sense challenging the ever-popular imperative exclamation forget it!
As an exhortation, get over it means "surmount your self-created obstacle; cure your self-induced debilitation." A related sense, more of a put-down, is "it's your problem, not mine" (sung to the tune of "Here's a Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares"). It overlaps forget it in the narrow sense of "don't bother me with that nonsense."
Sidney Harman, of Harman International Industries of New York and Washington, writes: "On the way into the city this morning, I asked the cabbie to wait for me a few minutes at my house. He said it would be difficult to park there because 'this city is crazy with politics -- forget it!' What did he mean by forget it? Did he mean 'this city has gone to the dogs -- nothing works'?"
The meaning of forget it in this context is "don't ask," its root meaning "I am facing a situation of such stress that it will be impossible to cope." ("Ask me how I feel." "How do you feel?" "Don't ask.")
Do not confuse this with the more common meaning of the same phrase, "it will never happen," usually pronounced without the r and as a single word. (Asked if the Palestinians would make Jerusalem the capital of their state, Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, replied for the record, "Fuggeddit.")
Even as command economics is waning, command linguistics is waxing. Grouchoism: "There's a man outside waxing wroth." "Let Roth wax him for a while." Leo Rosten tells me that this old gag may have come from the playwright George S. Kaufman, who wrote "The Cocoanuts" for the Marx Brothers in the 1920's. Mr. Rosten's latest book, "Carnival of Wits," draws a fine line between a wisecrack (wordplay for a specific situation) and a witticism (true wit that's universal); he once received a backhanded compliment from Groucho: "From the moment I picked up your new book, I was convulsed with laughter. Someday I intend to read it."
"Lighten up!" say the kidders to the gloomers, which is what I am trying to do to this scholarly analysis with classic old gags. Do it now was the sign over the rolltop desk of George Merriam, a founder of Merriam-Webster. Just do it is the Nike slogan, and Just say no was the imperative promoted by Nancy Reagan.
 
Enclitic's Corner
 What a wonderful language; there's a word for everything.
The chancellor of Syracuse University, Kenneth (Buzz) Shaw, was expounding to trustees on plans for the school's 125th anniversary next year: "halfway between a centennial and a sesquicentennial." He looked to me for the right word for "125th"; I flunked.
In my wallet was an ad from Plain Old Pearson's liquor store in Washington pushing "Grand Marnier Centcinquantenaire," which is booze with that 150-year-old French flavor, de rigueur for a Latin-rooted sesquicentennial celebration every century and a half. But there is no bottle advertised for one and a quarter centuries.
Somebody must have had this problem before. Frank Abate, the dictionary and reference specialist in Old Saybrook, Conn., rooted around and came up with the answer in a 1993 O.E.D. update, with a citation from a 1962 New York Times Book Review.
Seems that back then the people of Delavan, a town in Tazwell County, Ill., wanted to hold a 125th-anniversary whoop-de-do for the town's founding. Delavan's celebratory group "went to the Funk & Wagnalls dictionary people," according to The Times. "From there it received the suggestion of 'Quasquicentennial,' meaning a hundred plus a fourth." Sure enough, in the next citation from a 1962 copy of The Bloomington (Ill.) Pantagraph, there was the coinage in use: "The Delavan Quasquicentennial Celebration doesn't officially begin until noon today."
"The combining form quasqui-," Abate says, "blends parts of Latin quadrans-, 'one-fourth,' and sesqui-, derived from a blending and modification of Latin semis, 'one-half,' plus -que, an enclitic meaning 'and.' " (An enclitic is an attachable word-element, like a suffix, from the Greek klit, "slope." Comparative etymology on this you won't get from me.)
While we're at it, if you're planning celebrations, there is a novennial (9 years), as well as duodecennial (12) and vigintennial (20); similarly, there is perennial (occurring year after year), along with plurennial (lasting for many years) and aeonial (everlasting).
So, Buzz, I'll see you on the quad for Syracuse's quasquicentennial. When we get to 175, we'll figure out a new word.

An Ordinary Suburban Tract House, Transformed

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, CONN.

 BODY:
IT BEGAN life as a box, an ordinary tract house in a subdivision off a winding country road here.
It took a year, but the 2,600-square foot house was ripped apart and put back together again with only two rooms left the same -- and 4,200 square feet added. 
 Besides more than doubling the size of the house, purchased in 1989 by Peter Wright for $845,000 a few weeks before he met his wife, Wendy, through the personals in New York magazine, the owners created an entirely different structure: The box was transformed into a rambling extravaganza inspired by grand turn-of-the-century shingle-style beach cottages.
"He'd just bought the house and he was so proud to have bought a house in Greenwich," said Mrs. Wright, a small, vivacious woman. "When I finally saw it I almost keeled over; he had told me it was a Dutch colonial and you can imagine what I thought when I saw it: I couldn't believe I'd fallen in love with a man who had bought this."
A small color photograph of the house in its original incarnation sits in the new three-story, skylighted front hall of the transformed house. It shows a four-square white box with an enormous mansard roof -- the kind seen so often on pizza parlors and dry cleaners along commercial strips.
"I couldn't understand why he didn't tear it down and start all over again," said Mrs. Wright -- a sentiment shared by the architect in charge of the renovation, Daniel Louis Goldner, who called the 1971 house an "esthetic nightmare."
"I felt that economically it was better to keep as much as we could," explained Mr. Wright, an independent financial consultant with offices here. With all the landscaping and materials, including the new kitchen cabinets, the price of the renovation still approached $1.5 million, Mr. Wright said, sticking to his opinion that he had saved money by renovating.
According to Mrs. Wright, the decision not to tear down also may have had something to do with the wall-to-wall pickled maple bookcase Mr. Wright had just installed in what was then the living room.
"He'd just had that bookcase built in and he wasn't about to tear it out," she said. The living room, done in the beiges and taupes popular several years ago, remains as a den at the front of the house, supplanted by the 20- by 28-foot family room with a 10-foot ceiling and a massive stone fireplace, added to the west side of the house during the renovation.
"Those beiges were popular then," Mrs. Wright said, "but I wanted a lot more color." The wall-to-wall carpet in the new family room, for instance, is a Turkish-inspired print with a deep red background.
THE Wrights had requested a big new house -- by the time they decided on the massive renovation, they had two children and were expecting a third -- but they had no idea what the house should look like. "That's not my field," Mr. Wright explained. "I said how I wanted the house to work -- the practical things -- and I left the design to Dan."
So Mr. Goldner drew up at least a dozen different houses: from LeCorbusier to Edward Durrell Stone to Lutyens. The pencil sketches were drawn on tracing paper, and he went through the pile, slowly lifting the corner of each drawing to show the one below. Gradually, the tracing paper drawings grew more detailed, as the many gables of the final design emerged.
"We settled on a shingle-style house that relies on a composition that is quirky and idiosyncratic," Mr. Goldner said, adding that the house took six months to design. "The process was intensive, the clients were very patient."
"We love the look of the house," Mr. Wright said. "It has a lot of character."
"There's a big boom in Greenwich now," Mrs. Wright continued, "and all of the houses are 10,000-square-foot brick Georgians, very formal. I can't see anybody with a family building them -- all my friends will hate me -- but this seems more like a home and not a palace."
One of the remarkable things about the house -- visible most clearly from the outside -- is the number of different window configurations used by the architect. In the rear, for instance, there are eight different types of windows -- small-paned double hung, bay, Palladian and small squares.
There is a white wooden arbor stretching along the mud room in the rear and a balustrade outside the master bedroom, overlooking the swimming pool. The wood-shingled roof dips and soars, creating what Mr. Wright calls "all the different bumps."
The house was added to symmetrically: the master bedroom atop the large family room on one side and the garage and more bedrooms on the other. On the second floor, only one small room -- Mr. Wright's study -- remains as it was, a small space with simple Formica-covered shelves, overlooking the new brick hexagonal driveway.
The driveway is just one of the most obvious changes to the landscape. Looking to the right of the front of the house from the driveway, the lawn suddenly turns into a tall grassy berm with scattered trees, a hillock that completely hides the four other houses in the subdivision.
BUT the hillock was not created to hide the house. Instead, it is the level of the side lawn that is artificial; the hillside originally sloped down to the house. When the house was extended for the family room side, bulldozers dug out for the side lawn.
In the back, trees were cleared to give a clean view to the three-acre fishing pond bordered by marsh grasses. An enormous field rock was made more prominent, creating a minimountain and built-in play area for Zachary, 3, Zara, 2, and Jake, 8 months old. Beyond the rock, its green netting only partly camouflaged, is the batting cage, with its mechanism that spits out balls to Mr. Wright and his friends. The other day a crew rolled up p the netting and stored it for the winter, an event Mr. Wright noted sadly.
Altogether, the Wrights own seven and a half acres at the end of a cul-de-sac. Stone walls that are several hundred years old stretch along the other side of the street, echoed by the new stone walls -- unmortared like the old ones -- that were built on each side of the Wright driveway. The huge house -- which seems larger than its 6,800 square feet -- nevertheless does not dwarf its surroundings.
"What possessed him to buy it?" Mrs. Wright asked rhetorically. "It was the land that possessed him."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Chain Drugstores;
Drugstore Chains Turn to Manhattan

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
FOR Manhattan drugstores, the lines of demarcation used to be clearly drawn. The local pharmacy, with its white-jacketed pharmacist who dispensed homilies along with high-priced pills, ruled the residential neighborhoods.
Commercial areas were largely the domain of the ubiquitous Duane Reade, home of the off-price health and beauty aids and just-the-facts-ma'am pharmacy: Present the prescription along with the insurance card, pick up the pills later. 
 But what is this? Duane Reade on upper Broadway and on the upper East Side, in the heart of residential-land? Rite-Aid taking over more than a dozen supermarkets from the Red Apple Group? Woolworth with 13 Rx Place Drug Marts either open or planned in Manhattan alone? Even Walgreen, one of the most formidable competitors among the drug store chains, is looking for Manhattan sites.
"The drugstore chains are coming en masse, it's like a fever," said Samuel J. Jemal, who just put CVS into an 8,800-square-foot store in 270 Eighth Avenue, his building on 24th Street.
Brokers have caught the bug, too. "Any broker worth his salt is cultivating drugstores to fill vacant sites," said Michael N. Hirschfeld, head of his own brokerage.
Drugstore chains are snapping up former supermarkets, bank branches, clothing stores, almost any decent-sized spaces. Chains like CVS, Genovese and Rite-Aid that once barely looked at Manhattan are pouring in. Manhattan companies like McKay Drugs, for decades content with one or two stores, now have at least half a dozen, and more on the mental drawing boards.
Manhattan's lure is understandable. According to Chain Drug Review, New York City as a whole represents a $2.7 billion market for drugstores; Manhattan has the densest shopping population in New York.
Duane Reade accounts for 14 percent of the New York sales, leaving lots of room for other chains to grow.
"Competitors will go to the Duane Reades, take a thousand notes, and pick off as much as they can," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company brokerage.
Manhattan is not an ideal place to operate. Shrinkage -- retail parlance for theft -- is high. So is traffic congestion, making deliveries problematic. And the 12,000-square-feet stores that dot suburbia do not fit in cramped Manhattan storefronts.
But with new mall construction at a virtual standstill, chains that want to grow must go to urban areas. When they do, they find the sheer volume of shoppers an ample payback for the problems.
"Our Manhattan store has the same volume as suburban stores twice its size," said Herbert J. Kett, vice chairman of Genovese Drug Stores, which opened its first Manhattan store, on East 68th Street, in November 1993 and will soon open another in an old Bolton's store on 8th Street, between University and Fifth Avenues.
Woolworth's is a new convert, too. The chain has turned eight money-losing five-and-dimes in Manhattan to Rx Place Drug Marts, and five more conversions are planned next year.
"The demand for health and beauty aids has outgrown the demand for general merchandise," said Frances E. Trachter, a Woolworth's spokeswoman.
The soft real-estate market of the last few years has heightened Manhattan's appeal. A lot of space has become available at the $55- to $60-a-foot annual rents that chain drugstores can afford. Duane Reade has taken over a number of former Chemical Bank branches. Rite-Aid is said by John A. Catsimatidis, Red Apple's chairman, to be eager to assume the leases on many of his supermarkets. Rite-Aid itself did not return a reporter's calls.
"Rite-Aid is a public company that needed a major presence in the city where Wall Street is," Mr. Catsimatidis said.
Landlords, loath to carve big spaces into lots of little storefronts, are often quite happy to let the drugstores in. "A lot of co-ops, particularly, don't want to play slice-and-dice with retail space," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty.
And if the space is not perfect, drugstores can make do.
"A DRUGSTORE can make a bowling alley work," said Faith H. Consolo, a managing director of the retail brokerage Garrick-Aug. "They put the pharmacy in back, the beauty stuff up front, fill in with supermarket products, and draw the customers in."
The chains are plunging, not wading, into Manhattan's waters. They are banking that by opening a lot of stores at once they will build name recognition, brand loyalty for house brands, and get a lot more bang for their advertising and distribution bucks. Duane Reade, for example, delivers to its 51 stores daily from a central warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, while Genovese has a warehouse in Bohemia, L.I.
Increased computerization has also made rapid expansion more economic. Several chains affix price stickers and bar codes to items at the warehouse, and the codes are scanned at the cash register. That cuts down on the amount of skilled labor needed at the stores, and enables the chain to keep track of what needs to be restocked.
"New York has always been the home of inefficient, high-priced retailers, but computerized big chains are changing all that," said Allan G. Mottus, a New York health and beauty aids consultant.
The drugstore trade associations are desperately seeking ways to level the playing field for smaller stores. Next month Chain Drug Marketing Associates, in Northbrook, Ill., will begin buying some 360 vitamins, analgesics and other products in bulk, and resell them at cost to small stores that can then sell them at private label prices. It will offer 200 more items April 1.
"This is the only way that small stores can get the economies that the Walgreens of the world have," said James Devine, the association's president.
The changing dynamics of health care threaten small stores more than juggernaut competition. According to the Alexandria, Va.-based National Association of Chain Drug Stores, prescription drugs account for 36 percent of chain drugstore sales, and over-the-counter medications for 14 percent or so. Until recently, the huge profit margins on such items made them the fulcrum on which a drugstore's earnings turned. .
But now, many consumers have insurance plans that cover all but, say, $5 of the cost of a prescription. Then insurance companies pay the participating drugstores a fraction of what they could charge the patients. Nonprescription drug sales are hurting, too, as patients learn that a $5 prescription pain killer is cheaper for them than most branded analgesics. "The margins on pharmacies have gone from about 40 percent to the teens," Mr. Devine said.
Still, since pharmacies do draw shoppers in, drugstores are signing up for as many health plans as they can. And many small stores are getting locked out, because insurance companies do not want to do the paperwork for 50 stores when they can sign one master contract with a 50-store chain.
Some owners of small stores profess not to care. Block Pharmacy, on Third Avenue and 74th Street -- across from a Duane Reade -- does not take insurance plans, stocks high-priced beauty items, and keeps customer data on 3-by-5 cards.
"We were scared when Duane Reade came in, but our business hasn't dropped," said Madeline J. Tartell, Block's owner. "We're keeping customers who want advice from pharmacists and cosmeticians who know them and the products."
Bruce Weitz, Duane Reade's chief executive, concedes that they are. "The independents can't compete on price and assortment," he said. "Their game is service."
Mr. Weitz is finally ready to play that game. Duane Reade has gone to 24-hour operations at its 57th Street and Seventh Avenue store, and plans round-the-clock hours at three other stores soon. It is offering free delivery from some stores in residential areas. And, although he refuses to say what, Mr. Weitz says he is doing something about the difficulties that customers have in getting help from Duane Reade's many non-English-speaking salespeople.
All of the drugstores try to present themselves as vital amenities. But they admit that not all landlords buy the argument.
"WE don't spend thousands on mirrors and steel and glass to sell toothpaste," said Ely Tawil, president of McKay. "So yes, we've been rejected by people who want a more upscale use."
Landlords readily concede that preference. Manhattan House, the huge rental building that stretches from 65th to 66th Streets and from Second to Third Avenue, has 15,000 square feet -- 6,000 feet at street level, about 8,500 feet below ground -- of retail space available on Third Avenue. "Every major supermarket and drugstore has expressed interest," said Bruce A. Spiegel, a senior vice president at Rose Associates who handles the building's retail leasing. He wants to hold out for a high end apparel or furniture store.
"On Second Avenue, we'd rent to a drugstore, because there are a lot of service tenants there already," he said. "But this space is surrounded by high-profile stores."
Mr. Spiegel is rejecting drugstores for a different reason at 25 University Place, the 8th Street residential building that has a supermarket whose lease expires next year. "With Genovese opening around the corner, it's not the best use for the space," he said.
It was a potential supermarket glut that got Genovese its first store. Just about the time that Genovese wanted to come into Manhattan, a Food Emporium opened on Third Avenue and 68th Street. Rudin Management, which owns the retail space at 215 East 68th Street, was happy to replace an existing supermarket whose lease was expiring with a Genovese store.
"When another supermarket is opening down the block, putting a discount drugstore in a residential building is a no-brainer," said Louis Somoza, Rudin's vice president of commercial leasing.
Class A commercial buildings require more gray matter. Often, they insist that the stores agree to copious design rules. But when they do, commercial landlords, too, are happy to have them.
"We have standards for signage, graphics, anything on display," said Kate D. Coburn, vice president for retail leasing at Rockefeller Center, which has two Value Drug stores. "These are good-looking stores, and a great amenity for tenants."
Drugstores are also becoming a great bulwark for recession-battered landlords. Ms. Consolo, who handles leasing at 222 Broadway, at Fulton Street, persuaded the building's owner to combine two small stores into one and rent it to a drugstore. "Discounted health and beauty aids are recession-proof," Ms. Consolo said.
All of the drugstores are marching into each other's geographical and product-mix territory in attempts to increase market share. They are staying open later, offering free delivery, and changing their product mixes -- say, carrying more housewares and baby products in residential areas, more stationery in commercial ones -- to adapt to areas that were once alien to them.
"The drugstores have all covered their own A markets, and must look at other neighborhoods to expand," said Mr. Seligman, the Gordon broker.
The local chains scoff at the newcomers' chances. "The national chains don't understand how to operate without wide aisles and 10 checkouts," said Mr. Tawil, McKay's president. "They don't know what to do when the clock is ticking at $50, $60 or $70 a square foot instead of $12."
Nor does Mr. Tawil seem afraid of Duane Reade. Mr. Fox, the New Spectrum broker, warned Mr. Tawil that Duane Reade was opening in an old Lamston store across the street from the store that McKay wanted to open on 75th Street and Third Avenue. "Ely's reaction was simply, 'Oh, that's O.K.,' " Mr. Fox recalled.
Mr. Tawil insists that his wider range of products will win out. Other chain executives just feel the market can accommodate more players. "Manhattan has a tremendous population that is not being serviced properly," said an executive with CVS.
Although they will not allow themselves to be quoted, several of the rival executives also said that Duane Reade is a less formidable competitor since Bain Capital, a Boston-based investment company, bought the chain from the Cohen family in 1992. Brokers say they hear that comment a lot, too.
"People are not as afraid of an investment company as they are of an entrepreneurial family," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Retail Services.
Retorted Duane Reade's Mr. Weitz, who noted that Bain has opened 15 new stores: "We've had record sales and profits since we took them over."
ACTUALLY, the Cohens are not out of the picture. Ronnie and Leon Cohen, sons of Ely Cohen, one of the three founding brothers, recently opened a Price Depot on Broadway and Fulton Street. The family signed a five year noncompete agreement that prohibits it from running pharmacies and that restricts the percentage of sales that can come from health and beauty aids. So for now, the store is heavy on household goods, books, foods and similar sundries.
When reached, both Ely and Leon Cohen declined to be interviewed. But brokers say they definitely plan to expand.
So does Duane Reade. Mr. Weitz says his chain will "expand substantially through new stores and acquisitions" over the next few years. But he concedes it may not be easy. "Spaces are getting harder to find and rents are going up," he said.
Indeed, it may be real estate scarcities rather than lethal competition, that applies the brakes to drug store growth.
"A mind-boggling amount of space has been gobbled up by Daffy's, by HMV, by the Gap, by other nondrug chains," said Newmark's Mr. Friedman. "You get enough of these tenants, and there won't be any space available for anyone."

New Life Over the Store

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
THE streets of New York City's neighborhoods are lined with older two- to four-story buildings with a store on the ground floor and an apartment or two above.
Most were built around the turn of the century to house immigrant families pouring in from Europe. Such people were accustomed to living in the same building as their small-business enterprises. And for a while they could not afford to do otherwise. 
 Eventually, all that changed. The idea of living above the store lost favor and the upstairs was rented to transient tenants. The neighborhoods declined. The store itself may even have been boarded up for a while. If a buyer did come along it was frequently an absentee investor who had no emotional ties to the area and little interest in holding on when times got tough.
Thus anyone interested in buying or refinancing one of these small mixed-use buildings had a hard time finding anyone willing to provide a mortgage. "These properties fell through the cracks," said Patrick Niland, managing partner with the First Funding Group of Rochester, mortgage brokers who deal primarily in New York City properties.
Aside from other drawbacks, he said, the buildings were considered too small to make them worth the paperwork involved in initiating a conventional commercial loan, which was how they were classified.
The problem became even more severe in the late 80's and early 90's when commercial lending in general dried up in the wake of the sharp declines in the larger commercial property market.
Now, however, there is new hope for anyone who favors this sort of housing. Lenders are rethinking their posture as immigrants pour into the neighborhoods and revitalize the streets with thriving restaurants, ethnic food stores and other businesses.
These people once again favor the idea of living above their stores. They include Russian Jews in Brighton Beach, Haitians in East Flatbush and Asians in Sunset Park, among others.
Other reasons enticing the mainstream lending community back into these buildings is the need to find new business after the end of the refinancing boom. Also, they discovered that ethnic banks were doing very well in this market niche. Further, they could still get away with charging a slightly higher interest rate than that in the more competitive climate governing the residential mortgage market.
Anyone looking for a mortgage on one of these properties should therefore no longer feel compelled to take the first loan opportunity that falls into his or her lap.
Cross County Savings of Middle Village in Queens, for example, began mixed-use lending three months ago. The Atlantic Bank of New York is making its first commitment this month.
Others already in the market include the Green Point Savings Bank, Astoria Federal Savings, Independent Savings, Maspeth Federal Savings and Cross County Federal Savings.
But these mixed-use mortgages will still be slightly more costly and restrictive than the average home loan. Typically borrowers will have to pay two or three points as an origination fee and about one or two percentage points extra in interest charges.
They will also have to come up with at least 25 percent of the purchase price. Very few lenders can be tempted to finance more than 70 percent because of the continued perception of added risk and the inability to resell these loans on the secondary investor market.
Lenders also expect the borrower to have a sizable personal stake in the premises "because this way they will be less likely to walk," said Thomas Nixon, a vice president at the Independent Savings Bank.
"You also worry more about their ability to keep paying each month if business tails off and the store fails," said Kenneth Rudzwick, executive vice president at Maspeth Federal Savings.
That's one reason why most of these mixed-use loan commitments are being based more heavily on the inherent value of the property than the wherewithal of the borrower -- an approach known as equity lending.
Green Point, for example, is not even bothering with the normal financial verifications connected with the borrower except for a thorough credit check. "We would rather base the loan on property value," said Dale Ng, its vice president and senior underwriter.
A few banks, however, will allow part of the borrower's 30 percent down to come from other sources. For instance, at Green Point, someone else (typically the seller) is allowed to provide up to 10 percent of that 30 percent.
Borrowers should also expect the term of the loan to be capped at 10 or 15 years instead of the residential norm of 25 to 30 years. However, it can now be structured as a self-liquidating loan, meaning that the principal can be paid off by the end of the term.
In the past, a mixed-use borrower -- if he were lucky enough to get the loan at all -- usually had to suffer with a three- or five-year balloon, which required continual refinancing with little principal reduction.
This was the struggle that faced George Louis, longtime owner of a 4,000-square-foot mixed-use building at Lexington Avenue and East 75th Street. It houses his Skyline Greek Restaurant on the first floor and basement level and has a duplex apartment above where he lives with his family.
This month, Mr. Louis became the first property owner to gain a commitment under the Atlantic Bank's new mixed-use policy. He was approved for a $500,000 loan. The building, which he has owned since 1973, carries a current market value of $1.9 million.
Most lenders will also require a personal guarantee and expect the cash flow from the store plus any income from the apartments above to readily cover mortgage payments. And they will look more favorably upon the borrower who has maintained accounts at the bank or intends to become an owner-occupier.
Finally, don't be alarmed if the approval process drags on for two months or more. Despite a generally more hospitable climate, lenders are still treading warily.

HEADLINE: Headed South: Why One Couple Is Leaving the State

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
THIS month, David O. Thorp packed his car and a small trailer and drove out of Connecticut, heading south to join his wife, Elizabeth, in Macon, Ga., where they have bought a home. The Thorps have left the state because both lost their jobs and saw little hope of getting others. In doing so, they became two more statistics for Connecticut as a state that is losing population.
A major difference between the departure of David Thorp and the other emigrants of 1994 is that for close to a decade and a half he has helped run the state he is leaving. For seven consecutive two-year terms, he has been a member of the General Assembly, the representative from District 89 that included his home town of Cheshire and also the towns of Prospect and Bethany. The reason he remained in Connecticut until December was to complete his last term. His wife has been in Georgia for several months. 
 Mr. Thorp, who is 62 and easy to recognize as the character who putted around Cheshire once in a while in a 1923 Model T Ford, was an early victim of the state's economic woes. Six years ago, he was laid off from Pratt & Whitney after 16 years teaching computer science. He and several others who were also laid off have filed a suit, charging age discrimination, that is currently wending its way through Federal court.
The loss of a full-time job really hurt him, he said. "I was part of the Puritan work ethic. I thought staying out of work was sinful." Eventually, he found some work in a little company in the town of Plymouth where he had been employed 30 years before, but that only lasted for several months. Since then, he and wife have depended on his legislative pay, less than $20,000 a year, and her salary as an underwriter with Kemper Insurance.
In 1993, however, the Thorps' economic base really unraveled. Mrs. Thorp, who is 57, lost her job on her 19th anniversary with the company when Kemper drastically cut the work force at its Connecticut office in Wallingford. And David Thorp lost a bid to become Cheshire's town clerk. He said he was refused the Republican nomination after he was told he was too old. So he ran as an independent and was badly beaten by the Republican candidate in a three-way race. He and Elizabeth decided it was time to leave Connecticut.
They chose Macon because they knew the area. One of their two grown children, both of whom had left Connecticut earlier for economically greener pastures, had settled there. Before he departed a state where he has lived most of his life and where he was educated -- he graduated from Yale in 1954 -- Mr. Thorp offered many opinions on how Connecticut got into its present woeful economic state. In doing so, he also admitted that he could have been a better member of the General Assembly. "I was hard-nosed and I tried to do the right thing," he said. "But now I might wish I had caught on to how to make deals and swap favors. I might have been more effective."
In any case, he said the great catalyst for the state's downfall was the educational enhancement act of the late 1980's that resulted in Connecticut school teachers becoming the highest salaried in the country.
"It was a dreadful mistake. It was the peak of excesses in Connecticut," he said. Despite the money that continues to be allocated, the act has failed in its mission to better educate students and make them more capable of competing in today's complicated society, he said. "It hasn't done diddly," he concluded, judging from academic tests in comparison to other states.
Mr. Thorp also supplies some evidence to demonstrate that he is not just one more anti-education legislator looking for a scapegoat: His father was superintendent of schools in Cheshire from 1946 to 1967.
What the enhancement act really did, Mr. Thorp said, was not only to raise the salary range dramatically in the entire educational spectrum -- "the superintendents and principals had to get so much percentage more than teachers" -- but also to inspire raising other municipal salaries proportionally.
"Connecticut's gotten into trouble with humungous municipal wages. We've got 169 towns living extremely high off the hog and that's a reflection of the educational salaries," he said. The cost of town government is so high today, he added, that "we should have more regional type of governments. It's kind of quaint and kind of nice to have 169 towns, but I don't think it's affordable."
The precipitous rise in the cost of schools and governments led to the state income tax, Mr. Thorp said. "It's all so perverse."
By the time Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was elected Governor four years ago, Mr. Thorp added, an income tax was necessary. "We couldn't survive without it." But he voted against it on what he calls a technicality. "There was no spending limitation that went with it."
He is also opposed, he said, to millions of dollars in economic aid packages the Weicker Administration has given to keep certain businesses and industries in the state or to attract others from out of state.
"Connecticut is on the list of dumb states that give away the family store," he said. One of the best examples, he added, was the incentive package offered Swiss Bank to leave Manhattan for Fairfield County. "It is stupid to fragment the New York financial marketing industry."
And, Mr. Thorp said, if some old industries in Connecticut are unable to compete in today's world they should simply be allowed to die.
Regardless, he is now through with it all in Connecticut, just as a Republican administration is taking over after two decades. That doesn't bother him. He is off to the South where he does not expect to find a job but which he now feels has a much more dynamic culture than Connecticut and where the living is less expensive. He and his wife sold their two-bedroom house in Cheshire for $165,000 and bought a four-bedroom in Macon for $121,000. He thinks they will be happier there. Life in Connecticut has not been so hot the last few years.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Changing Landmark Windows
 
Q The windows in our condominium building are old and allow easy access for drafts, dirt and noise. We would like to install insulated, energy-efficient windows. However, our building is landmarked. We have heard windows cannot be replaced because doing so would change the exterior appearance. 
 What right does either a condominium board or unit owner have to replace windows? What if the replacement is similar in appearance? Is a variance from the landmark law necessary? Are energy conservation and occupant comfort grounds for a variance? . . . G. Gilbert, Manhattan.
 
A The windows can legally be replaced, with approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, said George Calderaro, a commission spokesman.
"The commission regulates, reviews and approves window replacements on a regular basis," Mr. Calderaro said. "The commission has window guidelines. If they are followed, a permit will be issued on the staff level. If a proposed window does not fit within the existing guidelines, an individual unit owner or a co-op or condominium board can come to the commission with an alternative proposal."
Mr. Calderaro said the writer should check with the condominium board to see whether a master plan for window replacement has already been approved by the commission. "If there is no plan, the commission does encourage boards to develop a replacement window for the entire building. The plan can be implemented over time. We don't recommend changing all the windows if doing so is not necessary."
Having a master plan approved is the recommended method, he said, although plans can also be approved for an individual unit. "With a multi-unit building it is probably easier to come in with a master plan," he said. "It assures the uniform appearance of the building. And it also makes doing the work more economical, because one contractor can do the work for the entire building."
 
When Co-op Board Rejects and Rejects
 
Q I own a unit in a large co-op. Can a co-op board reject potential buyers without reason, even when the couple is financially well off and is paying cash for the unit? Can a rejected party reapply a few months later? The board does not respond to letters I have sent asking about my options in the situation.
Is there no law that requires the board to make the owner aware of certain reasons for rejection to avoid constant payment to the board for each prospective buyer and be rejected over and over again?
If the transfer did not take place can any of the money given to the board for the interview be returned? . . . Lisa Jusko, Manhattan.
 
A There are no laws explicitly governing the procedures a co-op board must follow in passing upon a prospective buyer of an apartment, said Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
"In general, co-ops are free to reject any prospective purchaser for any reason other than those defined as discriminatory under the law," Mr. Weinstein said. "While there is much controversy among co-ops as to whether or not reasons for rejection should be given, I recommend to my cooperatives that the building attorney provide reasons for rejection to achieve four goals."
Those goals, he said, are "to satisfy the co-op's obligations to the selling shareholder, provide guidance for obtaining an acceptable purchaser, refute possible claims that the rejection was based on discrimination, and provide an opportunity to the rejected purchaser to give additional information that may satisfy the co-op."
If a claim of discrimination is raised, the co-op will be forced by the courts or administrative agencies to provide the reasons for rejection, he said. "Providing them at an early stage of the process may curtail expensive litigation or administrative procedures," he said.
Mr. Weinstein said the writer "may offer to the co-op a willingness to provide additional information about a rejected purchaser that could satisfy their reasonable objections." If no help is received from the co-op board, he said, "you may wish to examine whether there are any particular traits of your purchaser that may be protected by one of the antidiscrimination laws."
As to the fees, he said, "most co-ops argue that they cover the cost of processing each application and are earned by the co-op and therefore are not refundable."

HEADLINE: On Farmland Preservation

 BODY:
In the recent article about New Jersey's Farmland Preservation Program ("Farmland Preservation Is Lagging"), the number of acres preserved was compared with the number of acres developed since the program began. This is worse than comparing apples with oranges.
The Farmland Preservation Program is not trying to compete with real estate development. To do so would be absurd and a losing proposition. The program's goal is to save key farms in important agricultural areas, thus helping to stabilize farming by showing it has a future there. 
 Each farm saved also helps nearby farm-related businesses, like equipment dealers, and this in turn helps to preserve a micro-economy, which in turn demands little in government services, in perpetuity. The point is, while the number of farms saved may now be small, the impact is multiplied because of preservation's ultimate effect on the larger economy.
Development costs taxpayers untold millions in infrastructure and services, as shown in the study performed at Rutgers University when New Jersey was preparing its state plan. Preserving farmland is a good deal for taxpayers. The challenge is to tell citizens how many tax dollars are being spent every day as governments struggle to serve ever increasing numbers of homes in formerly rural areas.

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
NEWARK, Dec. 25, 2014 -- The executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey pledged yesterday that Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge tolls would hold the line for another year without any major price increases.
"The $150 toll is safe until 2016," Stanley Brezenoff 2d announced. But the director added that in 2016, tolls "will almost certainly rise," to cover an anticipated $400 billion budget shortfall. A source close to the agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the charge at the tollbooth was likely to rise to $200. 
 The bistate agency was said to be prepared for widespread revolt on the part of motorists. "Not since 1994, when my father announced a toll hike for 1996 in a time of low inflation, has there been such opposition to a toll increase," Mr. Brezenoff said. His father was authority director at the time.
Mr. Brezenoff said that in the previous century it was laughable that motorists had opposed an increase of only a dollar. He added that future generations would view the proposed 2016 fare increase as "something that was just as trivial as an extra dollar was in 1994."
The director assured the public that the authority would do all it could to help budget-conscious commuters. "Low-cost monthly tickets will now be available," he said at a midmorning press conference in the Newark Trump Tower, "and a frequent-driver mileage plan will be adopted."
Under questioning from reporters about the toll raise, Mr. Brezenoff argued that the proposed bridge and tunnel tolls for 2016 were "quite a bargain in comparison to the new $10 Garden State Parkway tolls."
Last month the parkway raised its tolls and added 100 more tollbooths, increasing the cost of traversing the entire 173-mile parkway to about $1,200. "I think you'll agree that our planned $200 bridge and tunnel toll gives quite good value in comparison to that," Mr. Brezenoff said.
Several questioners, however, pointed out that historically, Port Authority tolls have generally been the equivalent of three times the price of a New York City transit token. Thanks to the recent citywide fare increase, the new $30 subway token is well under that ratio. By that 3-to-1 calculation, authority tolls should be no higher than $100.
Mr. Brezenoff countered, however, that New York City had been unable to raise its transit fares much higher after the Metrocard debacle. He referred to the $2 billion worth of electronic turnstile equipment that had to be scrapped after fewer than 2 percent of New Yorkers bought the Metrocard.
"If the authority's future $200 tunnel and bridge toll is not adopted," Mr. Brezenoff said, "the only way to avert financial disaster would be to set up additional tollbooths at regular intervals within our Lincoln, Holland and Clinton Tunnels, the way the Garden State Parkway has done."
Mr. Brezenoff also announced that there had been little progress in the decades-old lawsuit with New York City that will "get our airports back," he said. The Port Authority has inhabited legal limbo ever since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made good his election pledge and raffled off La Guardia and John F. Kennedy Airports to private enterprise in 1995.
The Port Authority lawsuit, which has dragged on endlessly in the discovery process, has cost the agency $72 billion to date, "and the meter is still running," Mr. Brezenoff said.
Although private companies have managed to operate La Guardia and Kennedy at half the cost while improving service, Mr. Brezenoff said those airports "were denied the benefit of the Port Authority's interior designers and its monorail expertise."
He added: "Our studies have shown that many travelers are comforted by the drab decor of Newark Airport, and it enables them to feel relaxed. Many have felt so much at home there that they have conquered their fear of flying. In fact, our research shows that many fliers are intimidated by the cheerfulness and charming design of the new La Guardia and Kennedy airports."
As for the Newark Airport monorail, the authority announced another delay that will postpone its completion to "early 2017," Mr. Brezenoff said. Begun in 1992, the monorail has experienced a series of construction problems. Motorists have been inconvenienced for most of two decades thanks to the construction closing of parking lots at the airport.
The authority announced that new Newark Airport parking spaces have been made available for motorists miles to the north on Route 3 "because that highway is always a parking lot anyway," Mr. Brezenoff said.
The new parking spaces are "only a few minutes' travel" from the airport, he added. The monorail system itself may be extended to the Route 3 parking lot if construction is delayed long enough.
Mr. Brezenoff termed as "laughable" the report in New Jersey Newsday that the authority was planning to construct personal Hovercraft barriers at the Hudson River. The newspaper said the intention was to prevent the many Garden State owners of these vehicles from crossing to New York illegally, without paying tolls.
"We feel our Port Authority Immigration Police are perfectly capable of interdicting any illegal transport across state lines," he said.
In a more upbeat announcement, Mr. Brezenoff announced that the authority had purchased from the ill-fated Denver airport "its state-of-the-art baggage-shredding equipment," he said.
The equipment will be used at Newark Airport. "Until now, we've been able to give the average flier's bags a real pounding and stomping, but we've never had shredding capability before," he said.
In other news, the authority announced that planning is well under way for the agency's proposed vehicular bridge from the West Side of Manhattan to the Meadowlands. "It's essential that this bridge be completed to help all the New York fans who have to drive to the Meadowlands to see Yankees, Mets, Giants, Jets, Rangers, Knicks, Devils and Nets games," he said.
The bridge was deemed necessary by the State Legislature to avoid any razing of houses in those New Jersey communities located in the highway right-of-way between the Hudson River and the Meadowlands. The bridge has come under attack from environmentalists, who say its high profile may pose a danger to migrating birds.
Last year the authority dropped its lawsuit against New York City for managing to lose all New York sports teams to the Meadowlands sports complex. The authority had argued in court that the city had reduced the value of the Port of New York as a destination location.
In another announcement, Mr. Brezenoff said the authority would "strenuously oppose" the plan of the aging billionaire Donald Trump to build the world's tallest skyscraper hotel and casino in Bayonne. It would, of course, be visible from the authority's own World Trade Center.
"Even if Trump does build a bigger skyscraper, the World Trade Center does not anticipate losing any business," Mr. Brezenoff said. "We've got Windows on the World. All he has is Windows on the Kill van Kull."

Peso's Woes: A Very Familiar Diminuendo

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
IT has turned out to be a not-so-feliz Navidad for thousands of Americans who, wittingly or not, have invested in Mexico.
The value of their holdings plunged 30 percent in five short days last week purely because the Mexican Government could not or would not support the peso any longer. United States mutual funds that specialize in Latin American stocks dropped as much as 15 percent, as did some international bond funds. The Telefonos de Mexico shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange are now worth about half what some investors paid for them in February. 
 So many people rushed to sell shares of Mexico Fund, an investment pool that trades on the Big Board, that the stock could not open for almost an hour on Thursday morning, and Telmex had the same problem for two days running. Fund investors have been less skittish -- so far. In the week ended Wednesday, Latin American stock and bond funds did have net redemptions, but they were modest, according to AMG Data.
Though you couldn't tell it from the headlines -- or the heavy trading -- this debacle does not come as an incredible shock to anyone with a long memory or a more than passing acquaintance with international investing.
True, the Mexican Government had sworn up, down and sideways that it would support the peso. But as the British discovered in 1992, when George Soros got rich betting against the pound, such promises can be too expensive to keep. And wasn't it just a dozen years ago that Mexican officials said they would defend the peso "like a dog"? The prompt 30 percent devaluation led to a banking crisis here.
Though the Mexican stock market is down more than 40 percent so far this year in dollar terms, such losses barely raise eyebrows among money managers with experience investing overseas. "People don't realize that emerging markets normally correct 40 percent-50 percent," said Mark G. Holowesko, director of equity research for Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd.
Indeed, he points out that investors who put their money in Hong Kong 15 years ago have seen it increase tenfold -- but have suffered nine declines of more than 20 percent, including two of more than 50 percent.
Do investors have short memories -- or have they simply forgotten that Mexico is, in fact, an emerging market? Probably a little of both.
Most Americans investing south of the border were not doing so two years ago -- much less back in 1982. In 1992, just two stock mutual funds focused on Latin America, and they held less than $250 million, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Today, there are more than a dozen, and they contain more than $4 billion (or they did before last week).
Meanwhile, Telmex has become ubiquitous in the portfolios of individuals and institutions alike. More than 400 mutual funds own it, according to Morningstar Inc., and many of those funds look, on the outside at least, as American as microwave popcorn. As of Sept. 30, funds with big slugs included CGM Capital Development, 20th Century Growth, Berger 100 and Invesco Industrial Income. Because such funds are diversified, problems with a single holding or two won't kill their performance. But in a rotten year like this one, when these funds are already in the red, it sure doesn't help.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Italy Awaits Fallout of a Political Crisis

BYLINE: By John Tagliabue 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
IT was a week when Italians asked themselves whether they should be watching politics or the economy. This time, the two looked more inextricably linked than they had been in a while.
The ill-starred Government of the tycoon-turned-Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, was pulled down on Thursday by his squabbling coalition partners. And on the same day that Mr. Berlusconi handed President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro his resignation, the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Antonio Fazio, warned Mr. Scalfaro of a worsening financial situation, one marked by signs that inflation was rising again and that interest rates were pressing upward. 
 Yet, as Italians braced for a Christmas of uncertainties, the stock market in Milan posted five consecutive sessions of recovery and six of seven over all, after a slide that had seen equity prices slip more than 25 percent since May. The lira was holding steady, if not gaining, against leading currencies like the German mark and American dollar.
Indeed, signals were strong that foreign capital was flowing back into Italy, attracted by the high yields of Government bonds and the bargains found among Italian equities. The strength of the stock market was being fueled by indications from industry of a nascent but strong business recovery.
From 1992 to 1994, the two Governments before Mr. Berlusconi's had taken giant strides toward bringing public spending under a semblance of control. Scrapping a murderous system of wage indexing that pegged pay increases to the inflation rate, they brought the growth in Italy's cost of living index down to less than 4 percent, only slightly above the European average.
Indeed, Mr. Berlusconi's short-lived administration struggled to maintain the momentum, cutting $30 billion from the budget deficit in a 1995 budget bill.
So even as the Government was tumbling, some major investment brokerage firms were mildly bullish, betting that the departure of Mr. Berlusconi might break a political impasse, perhaps by means of fresh elections after a brief interim Government.
Yet this week, as the Italian Treasury set its bond schedule for the first quarter of 1995, nominal interest rates on bellwether Government bonds were set a percentage point higher than this year's.
Mr. Fazio, of the Italian central bank, reminded his countrymen that, given the size of the public debt, every 2.5 percent increase in interest rates raises by $22 billion to $25 billion the cost of servicing the Italian public debt, now a staggering $1.2 trillion.
Some analysts were concerned that the political crisis would undermine Rome's resolve in fighting inflation and reducing the budget deficit, thus widening the spread between yields on Italian and German Government bonds, the European benchmark.
"We're still skeptical," said Peter Sullivan, an investment strategist at Merrill Lynch in London. "If you had a stable Government with a coherent fiscal policy, say with a four-year plan, you could see bond yields go down 250 to 300 base points."
A base point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Yields on 10-year Italian bonds are now more than 450 base points higher than those on German bonds. This would favor financial service companies, like banks and insurers, and utilities; both of those sectors figure strongly on the Italian stock market.
"We're in an early phase of recovery in Europe and so capital goods are attractive, things like chemicals and oil shares," Mr. Sullivan said. "But financials and utilities are dominant in Italy, and that's not what you want."
Indeed, the week's stock market recovery, however feeble, was led by industrial shares like the auto maker, Fiat S.p.A., and Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., the financial holding company of the Montedison chemicals giant. They are leaders among companies that succeeded in boosting sales and cutting their debt load in 1994.
But there is another link between politics and numbers. Italy's economy was borne aloft in 1994 on the wings of its export industries whose textiles, automobiles and foodstuffs were priced very favorably because of the weak Italian lira, which drove the surplus in the balance of imports and exports in the first 11 months to $16 billion.
Umberto Bertele, a management professor at the Milan Polytechnic Institute, said that industry's ability to cash in on the currency bonus was caused in large part by product development and cost cutting achieved before 1992, when a heavily overpriced lira forced Italian companies to improve their competitiveness.
"My concern is that by maintaining over the long-term exchange rates such as we have at present, you're going to send signals to at least part of industry that this relative facility will continue," he said.
Now, though, a cheap lira means that Italian products virtually sell themselves.
"I fear that without an exchange rate stimulus," Professor Bertele added, "industry will suffer a fallback."

The Mexican Miracle, Apparently, Was Not What It Seemed
Ross Perot, trying to head off the North American Free Trade Agreement, warned that if the accord became reality, Mexico would devalue the peso, letting low-price goods flood northward. He may have been partly right. Mexico, it seems, tried mightily to prop up the peso, but last week that effort failed -- failed big. The peso, already weakening, plummeted when Mexico let it go into free-fall against the dollar. Some costs were quick: banks and other investors lost a bundle. And some will stick around: an abrupt loss of confidence in the new President, Ernesto Zedillo, and a fear of new economic chaos in a nation seemingly getting its footing. So how did the Mexican Miracle take such a nasty spill? Perhaps because that miracle was kept alive more on hope than on basics. The hope now: a new, solid beginning with the peso at a lower, more stable level.
 
Listen to the Children
Think of "hand-held electronic organizers" and you naturally think of sleek, solemn, hyped-up executives. At least American companies think that way; in Japan they had a better idea -- make them for children. And now they're a big hit with preteen-age girls (the boys are still hooked on Sega and the like), who use them for fortune-telling games, or to create computer-animated virtual pets, or perhaps to "whisper" messages across a room. Casio, heeding the lesson, has started selling kid-level organizers in the United States. There's probably a lesson here for Apple Computer and its Newton "personal digital assistant": The children know.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Carter Plays Softball
Talk about the sacred and the mundane! Jimmy Carter, hopping about the globe in a crusade for world peace, last week offered his services in a surprisingly humble dispute -- one in which, though feelings run high, no bloodshed seems likely. Yes, we're talking baseball, and Mr. Carter's gesture didn't seem to help. Players and owners have so far managed to erase a sizable business from the American map, and the owners just declared an impasse and decreed a salary cap -- when, that is, salaries are paid.
 
Of Owls and 'Welfare Cowboys'
On the environmental front, President Clinton just got his way in one battle and retreated from another. He put a lot of effort into resolving a dispute about logging in Northwest forests that house the fabled spotted owl, and the Administration came up with a plan allowing harvests at less than a fifth of 80's levels. And last week a Federal judge approved the plan. At the same time, Interior Secretary Babbitt backed down from a plan to increase grazing fees for public lands, leaving the issue to the Republicans. Environmentalists jumped hard on this one, with one lawyer predicting that Congress would "perpetuate subsidies for welfare cowboys."
 
Open Gift, Insert Foot
The Christmas gift to clients -- it's usually a cliche so tired it's snoring on arrival. A bottle of Scotch, perhaps -- or maybe a bottle of Scotch. But now, into this imaginative void, leaps Raoul Felder. After Mr. Felder, a Manhattan divorce lawyer, dropped a knife on his foot some years ago, he was flooded with slippers of sympathy -- 150 pairs, which he then had to give away. Aha! he said, and a furry idea was born. This year, when gift season descended, he sent out 200 pairs of slippers that have a marked likeness to Mr. Felder -- hardly surprising, since he'd sent off multiple photographs and sketches to a slipper importer, which in turn got a Chinese factory to do the deed. With stuff like this, who needs lawyer jokes?
 
Tax, Spend, Cut, Duck
Robert Byrd hit it on the head last week. Gazing at the jumble of tax cuts and spending cuts sprouting on both sides of the aisle, Senator Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, called it all "drag racing" that would end in a "demolition derby." No sooner had President Clinton leaped for the tax-cut wagon than the Republicans yanked it from under him, saying spending cuts would have to come first. Sure enough, the next day Mr. Clinton came up with $24 billion in spending cuts, nearly half of it from the Energy Department. Newt Gingrich had no comment; "we have our own plan," his press secretary said. All this commotion, and it isn't even Jan. 1 yet. Tax advice for '95: duck.
 
Prancer for Vice President?
Perhaps it's part of the migration back to traditional values, perhaps it's just a cyclical quirk, but Santa Claus was hot, hot, hot this time around. Hallmark reports that the image of the revered Mr. Claus -- whether on card or gift wrap -- was especially strong, and Coke has splashed a jolly Santa on bottles and cans. And he's managed to put a pudgy, fur-draped foot squarely in the land of the serious (an episode on A&E's "Biography," putting him in a league with F.D.R.) and the popular (a Better Homes and Gardens cover, in a league with Oprah and Di). Clearly, he'll be running for President in '96.
 
COMPANIES
 
A Pentium in Time . . .
It was fun while it lasted -- watching the computer types debate the difference between "perfect" and "99.989 percent perfect" (or was it 99.898?). But the great Pentium drama seems to be over: last week Intel blinked, saying it would gladly replace those flawed chips. Andrew Grove, Intel's president, said he regretted a policy that "seemed arrogant and uncaring," and the company ran large ads apologizing. The impact on Intel: of the five million Pentiums, perhaps a million will be replaced; at $100 a shot, that might cost Intel $100 million. Pretty minor, investors thought, as the stock shot up. The impact on you (if your computer has a Pentium): call (800) 628-8686 now, and you'll get a replacement, though it may take two months. Or wait a decade or two -- the offer's open-ended. But by then, of course, today's computers will seem like amusing antiques. . . . Did the Pentium, by the way, make Intel directors and executives nervous? Perhaps. In the last couple of months, as the crisis was unfolding, eight insiders sold more than 250,000 shares (roughly $15 million worth); in last year's fourth quarter, they sold none.
 
. . . Windows a Bit Late
Just half an hour after Intel threw in the chip, Microsoft said the release of its new operating system would be delayed yet again, possibly till August. It's the successor to Windows 3.1 -- the giant-killer among operating systems -- and when it appears, it could rake in $1 billion in sales in a year. But so far it's been called Windows 95 -- not, as it turns out, the greatest name. At last report, no delay is expected in the onset of the new year, so "we may have to rename it," a Microsoft executive said. But at least it seems determined to get it right before it goes public. Microsoft's shares took a fast dip.
 
A Matter of a Few Zeros
When Prudential Securities agreed last week to pay $550,000 for making illegal political donations, it was the largest civil settlement ever for the Federal Election Commission. But put it in perspective: Prudential has paid more than 1,000 times that -- $700 million -- to settle civil and criminal charges linked to the sale of limited partnerships.
 
'Liberal Books Don't Sell'
Newt Gingrich once accused House Speaker Jim Wright of fuzzy ethics concerning sales of a book Mr. Wright had written (and earned $55,000 from). Soon, farewell Mr. Wright; five years later, enter Mr. Gingrich. And last week came reports that Mr. Gingrich had signed a $4 million-plus book contract with HarperCollins, a Murdoch publishing house. Representative David Bonior labeled the deal a "$4 million Christmas gift" from an empire that includes the Fox network, which faces a regulatory battle. A spokesman for Mr. Gingrich called Mr. Bonior "an attack dog." As for Mr. Gingrich, he said, "Conservative books sell. I can't help it if liberal books don't sell."
 
Quick! Where's the Perfume?
Guess what, guys: the stores are on to you. It's a retailing axiom that merchants make half their annual sales during Macy's Gridlock Month (sometimes known as December, though it starts the second that Thanksgiving's over). But store executives know this bizarre season can be broken into more precise fragments. Last week, for instance, was the week of the panic shopper -- and "men," a Bloomingdale's manager said with assurance, "are panic shoppers." So if you dashed into a store and grabbed the first gifts you saw, you can be sure those gifts were deliberately placed in your line of sight -- and that just over the next rise of perfumes, clerks nodded knowingly.

HEADLINE: Getting to Know George

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
DAY after day, for two summers and three winters now, George Brown has found his way to a heating grate in the center of some of the city's richest, ritziest real estate. The grate, on the corner of 86th Street and Madison Avenue, is an outlet for pipes that heat vast, big-lobbied apartment buildings where cloaked and hatted doormen escort residents to taxis. Mr. Brown practically owns the rectangular metal grid.
Mr. Brown may be among the thousands of chronically homeless people living on the city's streets, exposed and vulnerable and, these days, categorically despised. But he has, at least, had the presence of mind to claim for himself a warm place on an affluent, rather safe and clean street. Having staked out the grate, he is carefully affable, never argumentative, eager to get along in -- or rather, outside of -- the swank surroundings. When the manager of the next-door apartment building asks him to move on, he nods and surrenders his scrounged cardboard -- only to return a few hours later. 
 There he dozes, mouth open, head against the wall of a Gap Kids store. He crouches on his grate, enfolded in cardboard. If he's up to it, he grins and waves and calls out "how-dos."
"That's his game, isn't it?" says a doorman across the street. "He sits and people kind of adopt him. Adopt him and give him a couple bucks here, a couple bucks there."
That is precisely what people on this prosperous block have done. After years of familiarity, local people have come to accept Mr. Brown, some with indifference, others with awkwardness and guilt, but nearly all without complaint. Some neighborhood residents and workers express fondness for him and say they worry about him and admire his friendly ways. They give him blankets and clothes, which he stuffs somewhere. They walk by him and call out, "George!," as they might any securely housed neighbor. A few shake his outstretched hand. Certainly many toss quarters, singles, fives. Mornings, at least one and often several people pass him a sack of coffee, regular, and a muffin. At lunchtime, they buy him hot dogs and sodas from the corner cart.
In a time and a city where people seem to be increasingly sick of the homeless and their intractable presence and their interminable pleas and the guilt, horror, resentment and pity they evoke, Mr. Brown and his neighborhood have quietly negotiated a truce. His armor is a courtly neighborliness, the courtesy of the South, of Orangeburg, S.C.,, where he was raised.
"My mother told me," he says, " 'Say good evening, good night, good morning.' That's the way of the world. People, they good, they good. I speak to them, give them the time of day. Sometimes, 'How you doing?' Sometimes the heart speak. Sometimes I can tell when a person has fear. I can tell when a person walks by with a good heart. People here, they got to know me. They real nice and good to me."
The talk is heartwarming; Mr. Brown sounds like a philosopher of the grate. He has no money, no home, no family, and yet he is cheerful and smiling. The reality is more complicated. In fact, Mr. Brown does have a small income and a family, in the South, who would give him shelter and who worry and wonder where he is. He has chosen this life as deliberately as he has chosen his grate.
On cold days, Mr. Brown sticks his legs straight out, tucking cardboard around them like a blanket. He wears one of several worn sweatshirts and dirt-covered pants and a not-bad gray wool jacket. His head, enswathed in a navy blue wool cap, lolls against the wall. Flopped down on the wide, clean street that sweeps into the leafy expanses of Central Park, he looks like a bony marionette.
His days at his home on the grate have a bit of routine: sift the trash for recyclable bottles to return for cash, walk, limping, the 17 blocks to Metropolitan Hospital for medicine for incontinence caused by the stroke he says made him homeless. Consume the paper cups of coffee and big pretzels people give him. On icy nights, make his way to the projects where acquaintances will take his money for a place on their floors. He has spent a few nights in the Bellevue and Wards Island homeless shelters and refuses to go back. The first, he said, is "a filthy place, freezing." At the second, he slept four nights on a plastic chair. Always, he returns to the grate.
"He's not blocking the sidewalk," said Officer Neil Ariano, whose beat includes the block. "He lives on the grate. I tried to get him to go to a shelter, but he doesn't want to go. He feels safer on the street. He minds his own business. I take it people don't mind because I haven't received one complaint."
Unlike some homeless men on the street, he does not frighten people. He does not thrust a cup in their faces or yell or beg for change or even lock eyes with passers-by.
"He's a sweet man," said Alice Thielen, a nurse at one of the block's many medical offices. "I've brought him breakfast and a few hundred hot dogs. When I saw he had holes in his shoes, I bought him new ones. He's not aggressive, that's what I like."
"We talk basketball," says 13-year-old Andrew Levine, who passes him every Tuesday evening on the way to his aunt's apartment. "He says the Knicks will go all the way, definitely. Then he says God bless me and stuff like that. I usually give him a dollar, partially out of sympathy. It's hard to pass somebody like that that seems so friendly."
Anybody who glances his way, Mr. Brown greets, and if they linger, he talks, his voice a mumble, as if continuing a conversation interrupted midstream. It's not the words but the affable tone that matter. The people who listen and give him money come away with the dual satisfactions of helping a homeless person and getting an inside glimpse of the city's underground.
"I'm always outside talking to him," said Nancy Rosario, who works in a doctor's office next door. "I talk to George about anything and everything. He's a nice person. Very friendly and kind-hearted."
"All the girls here like him," said another worker in the office, who gave her name only as Grace. "I speak to him every day. He gave me this," -- a small wall-hanging of a blue-gabled house -- "a nice gesture, since he has nothing."
Ms. Rosario's warmth does not extend to other homeless people she encounters. She is unmoved by the subway's nagging, nameless panhandlers. Like people all over the city, she and her neighbors have chosen Mr. Brown to be "their own" homeless man.
"Those people who beg for money on the train -- I have no feeling for them," she said. "It's frustrating to see that kind of people. There's nothing you can do if they won't go to shelters."
 
AT FIRST, SKEPTICISM
 For many people, the notion of getting used to Mr. Brown took some getting used to.
"My first reaction was: 'Take a look at this guy, call the police, we don't want him there.' " said Dr. Irwin Leventhal, Ms. Rosario's boss. "My partner gave me a look and said, 'You obviously don't live in New York City.' "
When Mr. Brown first showed up on the grate, Rose Smith, the next-door building manager, tried calling the police. They told her they couldn't make Mr. Brown move. Now, she calls him "my outdoor tenant" and says he helps with the sweeping and shoveling. "I don't have the heart to ask him to move," she said. "The man is trying."
Susan Zaife, who lives in the building next door, concurs.
"He seems like a nice guy," she said. "Very friendly. I give him food on occasion, money on occasion. I gave him a blanket once. There are so many homeless. It's so hard to know who to give to and who not to give to and whether to give at all."
Some people, after pausing to chat and giving money, clothes and food, are torn. Is Mr. Brown a friend? An equal? One wants, after all, to be democratic, to judge people by their hearts and behavior, rather than their housing or the lack of it. But still . . .
Shirley Gaisford, whose daughter, Kelly, lives in the building next door, says they carried him a complete Thanksgiving dinner: turkey, dressing, cranberry sauce, pie.
"He was very gracious," she said. "He said it was the best homemade food he'd ever had. One hesitates: Gee, should I ask him in to eat? He's a very nice man, a very gentle man. We have a nice rapport. When I see him, it's like I'm seeing my very best friend."
Other people, though, regard Mr. Brown with cynicism, preferring another, dirtier homeless man in the neighborhood who talks of being a C.I.A. conspiracy target and calls himself "Old 53-34-4600." This man, they say, is delusional and utterly without resources, and therefore more authentically homeless and in greater need. They suspect that Mr. Brown doesn't have to be a homeless beggar.
"I've never given anything to George," said Betsy Stapleton, who lives in the neighborhood. "I've talked to him, and I can't get my mind, my empathy, wrapped around him. I'm certain he has a place to go. His clothes are so clean. He looks like he's dressed by the Gap. I always acknowledge him, but I've never given him any money. I have a few other favorites I give to. I've been giving to my nameless friend, a truly anonymous man -- the very troubled homeless man -- I've seen for eight years. At first we would just look at each other. I couldn't pass him by without giving him something. He affects me very much. But I've become more callous. Well, callous may be the wrong word. I tune out a lot more than I used to."
 
A FAMILY'S PLEAS, UNHEEDED
 The subject of all this talk lounges each day on the grate, his wide grin splitting a face that is the color and shape of a wizened walnut with a rough beard. Today, Christmas Day, he says, is his birthday; he is 51. The purpose of this, the latter part of his life, has come down to getting enough spare change and hot dogs and blankets and cardboard without giving offense or being driven away.
"When people walk right by, they're not stuck up," he said. "It's not they don't want to talk to you. They got things on their mind. Rent to pay."
But some years ago, Mr. Brown had a life. He, too, had rent to pay and jobs that enabled him to. He used to be a janitor at Fordham University and Baruch College, he says. In South Carolina, he operated a crane and framed pictures. A few years ago, he says, he had a stroke that left him with a pronounced limp and incontinence, making him unemployable. He gets $800 from Social Security disability and $105 in food stamps a month, he says. The money spills from his fingers because he can't turn down the pleas of other homeless people.
Somehow, though, Mr. Brown has been able to remain impervious to the pleas of his family. For Mr. Brown not only has held jobs, he has had a wife and four children, now grown. He left his family for another woman 21 years ago, though he never divorced his wife.
"He loves his fast life," said Margaret Brown, his long-separated wife, who has lived on welfare and disability since she lost her sight. "He likes other women. When I met him I was 18. He was fine, free-going. He likes to laugh, be friendly. "
In those days, Mr. Brown's dress, like his mind, were smart. "He don't like to go around looking tacky," Ms. Brown said. "He's very bright. He could take an old house and design it so you wouldn't know it. Make those walls and ceilings look professional. He did some things I never got over. I'd never want him back. But it's too cold to be out there on the street. He comes back, I'd help him get a place to stay."
Mr. Brown's youngest daughter, Vanessa, who was a baby when he left her mother, is more eager. Her father lived for a while with another woman when she was growing up. Every few months he would come to the house to see his children and contribute money to augment his wife's earnings as a nurse's aide. But that was long ago. Vanessa hasn't seen or heard from him for six years. He even missed his father's funeral.
During those years, Vanessa became an all-America high school athlete and won a basketball scholarship to Voorhees College in Orangeburg. She is now a senior, 23 years old, majoring in sociology. Mr. Brown does not know, has no inkling, of how well she is doing.
"An all-around athlete, great in basketball," Cedric Baker, the Voorhees basketball coach, says of Vanessa. "She has the potential to be great in softball. She's a real sweet person, a very hard worker. She doesn't talk a lot, but actions speak louder than words."
"She loves her daddy," says her mother, sounding rueful. "She really loves her daddy."
"I got upset with him," Vanessa says, "because he took care of someone else's kids before us. But you tell him to come on home. Somebody will take care of him."
Homeless Mr. Brown may be, but he is not apparently psychotic or broke or without family. Why, then, does he live on a grate on the street?
Because of pride, he says. Because he refuses to be a burden on his children. They don't know where he is, he says. They certainly don't know he is homeless. That's how he wants it to remain.
"I'd die before I let them know I'm on the street," he said. "I raised them to be their own people. I don't want to pull them down. They go their own way. That how I want it."
Mr. Brown, too, goes his own way, the way of a homeless albeit very, very friendly New Yorker, shielding himself from rain with scraps of cardboard, eating, like a begging Zen monk, whatever he is given. Unlike many homeless people, Mr. Brown has a far better life within his reach. But living on a metal grate in one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in town has saved his pride, a pride that lets him live off the kindness of strangers but not of those who love him.

HEADLINE: An Industry in Need of Regulation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Stop the Subsidies to Europe's Airlines" (Viewpoints, Nov. 27), Lawrence Chimerine and Gregory Stanko recite one of the ancient economic beliefs that was used to justify airline deregulation. The argument was and is that economic regulation, including cash subsidies, perpetuates overcapacity (too many flights); in a free market, competition forces airlines to cut capacity. 
 Since deregulation in 1978, American carriers have lost lots of money, and excess capacity (too many empty seats) has led to ruinous fare wars. Obviously, deregulation has not reduced excess capacity.
The writers would reduce European airline flights to the United States to compel an end to subsidies. The Europeans doubtless would reduce American flights to Europe, an endless tit-for-tat that would become a comic opera. If, as they say, United States carriers do not get a fair share of trans-Atlantic business, only negotiations to regulate flight frequencies can work, along with agreements on quality of services.

U.S. Stays Aloof From Russia's War Within

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
RUSSIA'S pro-democracy movement was outraged as Moscow's troops tightened their grip around Grozny last week. But the Clinton Administration, which says it shares the goals of the democracy advocates, all but blessed President Boris N. Yeltsin's efforts to bring the breakaway Chechen republic to heel.
 The Russian military campaign there barely rated a mention when Defense Secretary William J. Perry met in Moscow on Dec. 16 with Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov, the chief of Russian general staff, to talk about Bosnia and NATO issues. And after his trip, Mr. Perry repeated the Administration's line, that Russia's handling of Chechnya was an internal affair, though one Washington hoped would involve a minimal amount of bloodshed. 
 "Provided it is not destabilizing beyond the scope of that activity," Mr. Perry added, "I do not see it as affecting our desire to have a pragmatic partnership with Russia."
 To be sure, there are serious threats to American security and the fate of the Chechen republic is not one of them. But while Chechnya may be a Russian matter in legal terms, there is no such thing as a purely internal matter in an age of satellite broadcasts. Television has carried pictures of Russia's almost random air strikes against civilians in Grozny to Moscow and beyond.

 
 
Letting It Ride
 By the end of the week, the Clinton Administration's detachment was beginning to look like indifference. And it found itself in the odd position of tacitly supporting a military action opposed by a majority of Russians, including pro-democracy supporters, Parliament, Russian human rights supporters -- even many in the military.
 Just as the Bush Administration initially put its bets on one man -- President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union -- the Clinton Administration seemed to be casting its lot with President Yeltsin come what may.
 Defending their hands-off approach, Administration officials say the Chechnya crisis, while a compelling humanitarian story, is only a smaller part of a larger puzzle.
 The United States, they said, is concerned first and foremost with the security of the nuclear stockpile in the former Soviet Union and with encouraging continued political and economic reforms there.
 Both objectives hinge on Russia's ability to avoid civil strife and on Washington's ability to maintain a good working relationship with the Russian Government.
 To that end, the White House has gone out of its way to try to ease Russian suspicions about the West, favoring a go-slow approach on expanding NATO. Meanwhile, the Pentagon has sought to strengthen ties with Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, the Russian Defense Minister and the architect of the military campaign against Chechnya, and other members of the Russian high command.
 For Washington, the Chechnya crisis has been seen as a threat to the relationship the Administration is trying to build with the Yeltsin Government.
 But while the Administration may view Chechnya as a distraction from the main event, it has proven to be too large to be ignored.
 Dimitri Simes, the head of the Nixon Instititute on Peace and Freedom, said the Administration should have handled the Chechnya affair differently.
 It should have told the Russians that while Chechnya was indeed an internal affair, there are political realities in the West as well, Mr. Simes argued. A more conservative Congress -- one less sympathetic to Russia -- is about to take power in Washington. And images of Russia bombers and tanks blasting civilians will be long remembered when the Administration seeks the support of lawmakers for aid to Russia and new joint American-Russian projects. That sort of argument would have allowed the Clinton Administration to respect Russian sovereignty while encouraging military restraint, Mr. Simes said.

 
 
Shift in Tone
 But the Administration's response to the crisis appears instead to be reactive and aimed in part at public opinion at home. Only when the Russian military stepped up its air strikes, and charges of human rights abuses were leveled by Russian officials, did the Clinton Administration begin to shift the tone of its comments, and even then its response was tepid.
 On Friday, the State Department took note of complaints by Sergei Kovalev, head of the Russian President's commission on human rights.
 "We will be following this up with the Russian Government in order to evaluate the facts," said a State Department spokesman, David Johnson. "Respect for fundamental human rights has been and will continue to be a basic precept of U.S. policy toward Russia."

HEADLINE: Never Mind;
Reform Taxes? Give Us a Break!

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT this time 10 years ago, politicians and lobbyists throughout the capital were digging their trenches for the forthcoming battle over rewriting the United States tax code. What followed over the next two years was one of the fiercest legislative fights in this century.
 In the end, against heavy odds because the stakes were so high, a tax system that was universally seen as hideously complicated and inequitable was completely overhauled. The principle behind the new law, one that academic authorities had advocated for years, was to keep rates as low as possible and to allow relatively few deductions, exemptions and other exceptions. 
 Tax rates were cut almost in half. Tax shelters were virtually eliminated. Industries with large disparities in their tax treatment were put on a more equal footing with one another. Many familiar deductions like those for credit-card interest, retirement savings and union dues were abolished.
 But despite the extent of the change, the new system was quickly accepted in the towers of academe and the canyons of Wall Street, in liberal and conservative political circles, in accounting firms and law offices. And once ubiquitous tax lobbyists were mostly forced to find new lines of work.
 Now, it looks as if the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will be unraveled in the next Congress.
 President Clinton and Republicans and Democrats in Congress want to reinstitute a variety of new tax breaks -- not because they think this is good tax policy, but because they think it is good politics.

 
 
The Only Game in Town
 The budget rules are now so rigid and new Government spending is so out of fashion that the politicians had to look for a new way to pass out favors to people whose votes they seek.
 "It is the only thing available," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, a veteran of the tax war a decade ago who is now a senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. "You can't spend money. So you have to deal in tax preferences. You have to do it through the back door."
 Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, the philosophical godfather of the 1986 law, said: "People seem to think that if they spend through the tax code, it's not really spending; it's free. That's ludicrous."
 President Clinton wants to give families with incomes below $60,000 a year a $500 tax credit for each child younger than 13. He would allow families with incomes as high as $120,000 a deduction of up to $10,000 to help offset college tuition expenses or the cost of other education or training after high school. And he wants much more generous treatment of tax-favored savings accounts called individual retirement accounts.
 His proposals are modest compared with those of the Republicans who will be controlling Congress. In addition to a $500 tax credit per child (for families with incomes up to $200,000) and more generous I.R.A.'s, the "Contract with America" signed by most House Republicans calls for these tax breaks:
 *A lower tax rate for capital gains -- the profit from the sale of investments -- and an elimination of taxes on any part of profit due solely to inflation.
 *Tax credits for adoption expenses and the cost of caring for elderly dependents.
 *A reduction of the so-called marriage penalty, the additional tax some working couples owe simply because they file joint returns.
 *A repeal of last year's tax increase on middle- and upper-income Social Security beneficiaries.
 *New tax breaks for life insurance and for insurance covering the cost of nursing home care.
 *More favorable tax treatment of business investment in plants and equipment.
 *An increase in the size of estates not subject to Federal tax.
 Other politicians have also put forward what they call middle-class tax cuts. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who will be the House Democratic leader in the new Congress, has proposed a tax credit of $300 to $600 for each child in families with annual incomes up to $75,000. Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas, wants to double the exemption for dependent children, to $5,000 from $2,500, for families with incomes up to $124,000.
 Tax credits reduce dollar for dollar the amount of taxes owed. So a $300 tax credit saves the taxpayer $300. Exemptions and deductions are subtracted from income before taxes are calculated. This means they are more beneficial to affluent taxpayers in higher tax brackets.
 For instance, an extra $2,500 exemption, as proposed by Senator Gramm, would save someone in the 15 percent tax bracket $375 (15 percent of $2,500) and someone in the 31 percent tax bracket $775.
 This is one reason why some tax experts oppose the Clinton proposal that would provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for college tuition costs. "It is an upside down subsidy," said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research institute sponsored largely by labor unions. "You would be giving $2,800 to a family that makes $100,000 and sends the kid to Harvard, and only $600 to a family making $40,000 whose kid goes to State U."

 
 
Spare Change
 According to calculations by the professional staff at the Treasury Department, which are not seriously disputed by Republicans, the President's proposals over all would cost the Government $60 billion in lost revenue over the next five years. The tax reduction elements of the Republican contract would cost nearly $200 billion over that period.
 But as large as those sums sound, the money would be spread so thin that no one would get a windfall. For example, under the Clinton plan, a couple making $50,000 with two children younger than 13 would get a reduction of less than $20 a week.
 The biggest tax saving under the Clinton plan, according to the Treasury's estimates, would go to taxpayers with annual incomes between $50,000 and $100,000. Taxpayers at every level would fare better under the more generous Republican contract, but the largest saving would go to those with incomes above $100,000.
 All the politicians who support tax cuts insist that they will be offset by spending reductions, but they have not said exactly how they would accomplish that.
 Reducing the Federal deficit, the overriding political issue last year, has now become as passe a topic in the political debate as, say, the question of whether the United States should turn over the Panama Canal to Panama. Republicans want a constitutional amendment to force a balanced budget, and Democrats orate about fiscal responsibility. But all the emphasis is on how to offset tax cuts.
 The Clinton Administration denies that it wants to unravel the tax reform law. "I'm not saying we're not moving away from it," said Leslie B. Samuels, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, "but I don't think it's a sea change."

 
 
'Feel Like Crying'
 But those with the biggest political stake in the 1986 law feel differently. Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who was Finance Committee chairman in 1986 and who will regain the post in the next Congress, said, "I feel like crying."
 Once tax breaks are written into the code, Mr. Packwood said, "getting them out is like prying a rock out of the Rock of Gibraltar."
 Perhaps the most daunting prospect is that with a major tax bill on the docket, the tax lobbyists will come out of hibernation and begin peddling their wares. Before long, the tax system could look like the one that was done away with in the mid-1980's.
 "When you start moving a tax bill," said Lawrence F. O'Donnell, the departing chief of staff of the Finance Committee, "it becomes a lobbyists' beehive. Everyone has a tax provision to sweeten in one way or another."

HEADLINE: A Violent Battle of Wills Besieges Hartford

SERIES: When Trouble Starts Young: The Role of Gangs -- A periodic report:

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
The young men and women of Los Solidos filed into the rented banquet hall cursing and muttering complaints. Even on this solemn occasion, the anniversary of the day brother Pipe was killed by Latin Kings, the police would not let up.
They were watching, as usual. About 10 members of the Hartford Police Department stood outside as Solidos gathered in the squat building for a memorial dinner-dance. And as 350 Solidos marched by in their red and blue colors, officers with camcorders filmed them for future reference. 
 "Ask me if I care," snapped a thin teen-age boy, wearing a red and blue jersey with "L.S.N.," for Los Solidos Nation, printed in white on the chest.
"You will," shot back an officer standing watch.
It was a brief exchange in August, but a telling one. A battle of wills is raging between gangs that have staked a claim to Hartford and the authorities determined to deliver the state's capital from the drug dealing and violence that the gangs have bred.
The struggle for control has heightened as more and more gangs have taken to the streets of Hartford and spread to cities and suburbs throughout Connecticut. Los Solidos, the Latin Kings, 20 Love, Netas -- names unheard of here five years ago -- are household words. The police and prosecutors say the gangs are partly the reason for the city's record murder rate this year, record police overtime costs and a surge in drug dealing.
"The gangs are the Mafia of the 90's," said Christopher Morano, an assistant state's attorney in charge of a statewide gang prosecution unit. "They're highly organized and that's what makes them so dangerous."
Why here and now, Mr. Morano says, is hard to know. Hartford has a history of gangs dating to the 1970's. They dispersed during the 1980's, then began to regroup a few years ago with a fury never seen before.
In one sense, the gang problem here is no different than the gang problem in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. The gangs sprout in prisons or on the streets. They dig into impoverished neighborhoods, where their ranks grow with youths who have few choices. And they sell drugs.
But Hartford, with fewer than 140,000 people, is smaller than most cities plagued by gangs. Its citizens have no refuge. Downtown, bullets have broken windows in the Old State House and a gang member was shot in front of Superior Court.
This is how bad the gang problem has grown here: Since 1993, the National Guard has set up innovative boot-camp-style education programs in 15 states, aimed at helping high school dropouts earn diplomas. Only Connecticut's program, heavily populated by Hartford teen-agers, has been shut down -- because gang members taking part were involved in fights and drug use.
To Hartford's Police Chief, Joseph F. Croughwell Jr., the way people here talk, it's as if the city is the gang capital of the country. "Whenever anything happens now, people think of gangs first," he said.
For a while, things were quiet. Then in October, after an eight-month undercover investigation by a local, state and Federal task force, 17 Solidos were arrested on Federal racketeering charges. If convicted, some, including the gang's president, could face life in prison.
Los Solidos was broken. But within a week, more Netas and Latin Kings began surfacing on the streets, said Lieut. Daniel Stebbins, commanding officer of a state police crime-control task force. "It seems when one gang is down," he said, "others move in to fill in the void."
 
The Price
Neighborhoods Held Hostage
 The gangs know drug turf is precious. There are only so many corners and alleys. By absorbing, scaring and killing small-time dealers, gangs now control the city's drug trade -- Hartford's biggest crime problem, Chief Croughwell said. Turf wars, crimes of passion, drugs -- and the desperate robberies that they induce -- have given Hartford the distinction, over Bridgeport, of bearing the worst crime rate in the state.
This year, 53 people have been killed in Hartford as of Friday, breaking the city's previous murder record, 46 in 1980. Of this year's cases, the police department considers 17 gang-related. (In others, gang members might have been involved in murders not considered gang-related. In one case, a member of 20 Love shot his cousin to death over a parking spot.)
Just two years ago, Hartford had 13 murders. The Hartford metropolitan area had the lowest murder rate among the 75 largest metropolitan areas in the country, according to statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Then last year, the city's murder rate more than doubled, to 30, with half of the murders classified as gang-related.
Over the last two years, gangs have ravaged two neighborhoods. In the North End, 20 Love has expanded its drug dealing. In the South End, Los Solidos and the Latin Kings have swamped Frog Hollow.
People in the North End are dodging bullets.
[On Friday, a 14-year-old boy was shot and killed in the Stowe Village housing project.]
A fledgling gang, the Young Guns, wants to take on 20 Love to control popular drug spots; 20 Love appears up to the challenge. In November, a man was killed and two others wounded in a hit that police believe 20 Love organized to eliminate other dealers.
Los Solidos and 20 Love are also feuding. In the last 10 days, one member from each gang was killed in two separate shootings
Frog Hollow has long been a tough section. Young men with guns and drugs worked the corners even before the gangs pushed their way in. Yet people here say it was never this bad before the Latin Kings and Los Solidos shot the daylights out of Park Street. In the summer and fall of 1993, they had an all-out war that lasted months. Gang members fired at each other in midafternoon outside of churches and schools. Parents looking for protection from flying bullets put their children to bed in bathtubs.
Hartford's children know gang culture. They'll tell you that "O.F.O.," for Original Family Organization, is the youth chapter of Los Solidos, and that "Death Row" is the female chapter of 20 Love. They'll say Los Solidos prefer being called "The Solids" and warn you that it's dangerous to wear red and blue, Solidos's colors, or black and gold, the Latin Kings's colors, in the wrong neighborhood.
"I'm not afraid of the gangs," said Ismael Mercado, who lives on a block with gang members. "They do what they got to do, and I do what I got to do." This year, the Police Department assigned officers to permanent beats at each of the city's three high schools. The move has helped the schools, but not Hartford's battered image.
Bordering Frog Hollow, Little Italy boasts some of the city's most popular restaurants, but the owners complain that many customers have been scared off. And in a neighborhood where generation after generation once settled down, "For Sale" signs are pitched in front of houses on nearly every block.
As bad as it's been, it could have been worse. Two days before the October raid on Los Solidos, the joint gang task force learned that one Solidos faction planned to eliminate the other, in a fight to the death that was to extend into Connecticut's prisons. The task force pushed up its raid by 12 hours, pre-empting a possible bloodbath.
The police say the gangs are getting better at hitting their intended targets. But at least four innocent bystanders have been killed in the city this year. They included a 7-year-old girl sleeping in a car that a Solido apparently mistook for a Latin King's car.
Another victim simply wore the wrong clothes. In February, Vicente DeJesus Jr., 20, was shot several times at close range, the police say, because a Latin King mistook him for a Solido. The victim, who was in a car returning from a double date, happened to be wearing blue and red. Witnesses said he begged for his life.
Mr. DeJesus' parents, who moved from Hartford to nearby Manchester eight years ago to give their four sons a better education, put their house up for sale two weeks after his death. "It hurts too much to be here," Mrs. DeJesus said. They plan to move, whether or not the house is sold, after the January trial of their son's accused murderer.
"He not only killed one person, he destroyed the whole family," Mrs. DeJesus said. "My sons grew up with the gangs. They went to school with them. What is it with the gangs?"
 
Lost Lives
 When Drugs Run in the Family
 In the 70's, the Black Spades, Seven Brothers and Savage Nomads had chapters in the North and South ends of Hartford. They faded away. In the early 80's, bands of youths, or crews, gathered to sell drugs but the police stopped them and gang activity didn't stir again until the early 90's.
Most of Hartford's gang members come from minority neighborhoods. The gang 20 Love sprang from the Albany Avenue Crew, a loosely knit drug-dealing posse in the mostly black North End. Latin Kings and Los Solidos come from heavily Puerto Rican Frog Hollow.
The neighborhoods where the gangs sprout are the city's worst. At Charter Oak Terrace, a 950-unit housing project in the Southwest end, about 90 percent of the residents are unemployed. Frog Hollow may sound like something out of Mark Twain, but it is an island of despair. Boarded buildings and dying tenements dominate.
The Latin Kings began as a Hispanic fraternal organization in Chicago in the 1940's. The first Connecticut chapters were formed in Bridgeport and New Haven in 1989 by two inmates at the Somers State Prison. The gang branched into Hartford's South End about three years ago. Then, as it gained control of the drug dealing, officials say, dissident Latin Kings began Los Solidos.
Mr. Morano, who prosecuted more than 150 gang-related cases in Hartford from Sept. 1993 to August 1994, said the Latin Kings and Los Solidos seem to offer disaffected youth an escape.
Mr. Morano said: "20 Love is strictly a drug gang. And while Los Solidos are a criminal enterprise, there are members who joined because they didn't know what else to do in Frog Hollow."
Los Solidos, with anywhere from 500 and 2,000 members, according to police estimates, are the biggest Hartford gang. Its founder and "godfather" is Larry Beauvais, known as "L. B.," who is serving time in Federal prison in Florence, Colo.
Members talk about being a family that offers support and love and unity against the threats of a hostile world. "If you live where we come from, you see we offer the best," said Martin (Sharp) Delgado, a 22-year-old Solido with two children, 4 and 2. With the schools failing, the neighborhoods in tatters, "we have a moral code or creed we follow." He added: "We want to start a community. Los Solidos is no longer involved in any kind of violence."
It was a passionate vision offered on a sunny summer day. But both he and Solidos's president, Jorge (Pekino) Rivera, who at the time also talked at length about "the family," were arrested in the October raid by the joint gang task force. Both have been charged with conspiring to commit, and with committing, violent crimes in aid of racketeering -- kidnapping, assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury.
Authorities say the gang members knew months ago that they were in trouble. They had won the war with the Latin Kings. But the battle with the police was not going as well. By summer's end, Los Solidos were besieged by the law. Members were getting arrested on a daily basis. Their bail fund was rapidly diminishing. And there was too much heat on for them to do business, or make money.
Los Solidos members took their case to the press. They were eager to show the world they were misunderstood, that Los Solidos were a social empowerment organization that was blamed for things they didn't do.
In an interview at the Christ Lutheran Church gym in Frog Hollow, where he was playing basketball, Mr. Rivera, a rangy 23-year-old with dark, hollow cheeks, said Los Solidos flouted society's low expectations of them.
"We don't accept people in our group who go shooting at people," he said. "We're stricter than parents. Our younger members can't smoke. They have a curfew. They have mandatory school or a job."
But the police say that as president of the gang, Mr. Rivera ordered "hits" and "missions" -- killings and assaults that have plagued the city. He had a record of 59 arrests, most for "breach of peace" and license suspensions. He was not involved in drugs, he said.
Both he and Mr. Delgado wore gold crucifixes around their necks. Mr. Delgado, who said his parents sent him to Catholic school to avoid the Hartford public school system, said religion and spirituality played a large role in the gang.
"Not all of us sell drugs, not all of us do drugs," Mr. Delgado said. "We have people who go to school. People who have jobs. If you saw what we're really about, it's love."
It was Mr. Rivera who extended an invitation to a memorial for Felipe (Pipe) Santana, who was killed on Aug. 31, 1993.
"Pipe tried to talk and reason, and the Latin Kings killed him anyway," he said. "That's what started the war."
The memorial service, where all speeches began and ended with the words "Solid Love," offered a glimpse into the gang's society. No members were allowed at the table with reporters unless given permission. One member, Willie (Pepperoni) Mendez, 21, sent by the gang to chat, stayed until he was officially "relieved." The women made and served the dinner -- pork, chicken and rice and beans -- and cleared the red and blue paper plates. Everyone sang along to the rap song dedicated to the slain Solido's memory: "Life's a Bitch and Then You Die."
Officials say that as president of Los Solidos for more than a year, Mr. Rivera had run a tight ship. He organized the gang, expanded membership and consolidated power, inspiring fear and loyalty among the ranks.
"He's a very bright guy, very savvy," said Sgt. Christopher Lyons, who commands the Hartford department's intelligence unit. "It's just a shame he didn't direct his intelligence in a positive way."
Days before his October arrest, Mr. Rivera's power collapsed. He and Mr. Mendez, the vice president, were terminated from Los Solidos for stealing money, according to the police, and were beaten so severely that they spent several days in the hospital. The "beat down" was done by a gang faction that included Mr. Rivera's friend, Mr. Delgado.
"Los Solidos got hurt," said Sergeant Lyons. "Now 20 Love is going nuts. We're going to keep locking them up, but it's going to take a lot more to stop what's going on."

HEADLINE: Colleges Luring Students With Discounts in Tuition

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa.

 BODY:
It is not quite the "These-deals-are-INSA-A-ANE" world of late-night stereo and sleep-sofa ads, but increasingly discount merchandising is coming to academia.
At Lehigh University here, a new program allows top students to get a fifth year of undergraduate or graduate education free, and the university, for the first time, has offered scholarships not based on financial need as a way to attract top students. 
 Its business school has cut tuition 22 percent for its master's program. M.B.A. graduates get two-thirds off the regular tuition for any course they take after graduation.
The changes at Lehigh are just a glimpse of a revolution beginning to rock America's colleges and universities as more consumers make it clear that they cannot or will not pay the sticker price for college.
"We're not trying to be the discount kings here," said James Schmotter, dean of Lehigh's College of Business and Economics. "But I think we've sat here on campus and thought we're special and we're different from other kinds of marketplaces. Our customers no longer think we are that different; they see us more like other high-priced luxury goods.
"As time goes by, I think we're going to see increasingly more aggressive and creative and sometimes desperate pricing schemes."
The higher-education market has already changed significantly. In four years, the number of students paying full tuition at Lehigh, for example, has dropped to 49 percent from 63 percent, and nationally fewer than half of all college students pay full tuition.
Experts say discount schemes are proliferating. They include more financial aid awards based on need, new merit scholarships intended to attract more sought-after students and innovative pricing plans.
Robert Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research in Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said, "I think the whole price structure of higher education, particularly in the private sector, is collapsing, and there will be a lot of what might be called novel experiments in the years to come. The market is trying to, in a larger sense, clear, and find out the real price the public is willing to pay for higher education."
Experts say at least four factors have put higher education in its current bind. The first is that the cost of a college education has grown far faster than the Consumer Price Index and personal income. Second, the pool of applicants is declining or stagnant. Third, the public is increasingly skeptical and cost conscious as a result of the consumer movement and negative publicity about academic life. Fourth, the competition for top students is increasing.
Those factors have contributed to experiments like these price-cutting plans:
*In October, the University of Rochester announced that it would give a $5,000 grant to all New York State residents who enrolled as freshmen in 1995.
*The University of Detroit Mercy, Michigan's largest private university, took the opposite tack, offering out-of-state students a grant program of up to $1,950 to match what the state gives Michigan students.
*Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania and Clarkson University in upstate New York are among universities that have begun offering four-year degrees for the price of three, allowing students to cut $12,500 to $25,000 from the cost of their bachelor's degree.
*Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Clark University in Massachusetts offer what amount to 20 percent more education free: a no-tuition fifth-year.
*This month Michigan State University announced what it called a historic policy guaranteeing that tuition would not rise faster than the projected rate of inflation for the next three years.
According to the College Board, average tuition is now $11,709 at four-year private colleges and $2,686 at four-year public colleges, both up 6 percent over the previous year. When room, board, books, supplies and transportation are included, the total price comes to $18,784 for resident students at four-year private colleges and $8,990 at public ones. The average American student pays about half of the total college bill, experts say.
A study by Dr. Zemsky's institute last summer examined five representative colleges from 1987 to 1993 and found that all were increasingly likely over time to offer more financial aid. The study also suggested that the purpose of the aid was not just to assist needy students but to increase enrollment and maintain class sizes.
The emerging discounts are part of the same picture.
Not all campuses feel the pressures equally. But Mr. Zemsky says probably fewer than 35 universities in the country have a reputation or market niche so secure that they are largely immune from the pressure to discount tuition.
Lehigh, once known largely for its rigorous engineering curriculum and wrestling program, is now more broadly based. Of its 6,300 students, only 36 percent are majoring in engineering.
Like many colleges, Lehigh, where 72 percent of entering freshmen came from the top quarter of their high school class, finds it increasingly difficult to find students who will pay full tuition, now $18,700. In 1990, it provided $12 million in financial aid, and 37.4 percent of its freshmen received financial aid. This year, its financial aid budget is $23.1 million, and 50.9 percent of freshmen receive financial aid.
The pressures on colleges are affected by the increasing financial sophistication of prospective students. Chris Holler, an 18-year-old Lehigh freshman from Baltimore, hired a college selection firm to scout out the financial aid prospects at institutions he was considering. They included Lehigh, Bucknell, the University of Maryland, Villanova, Virginia Tech and the University of Delaware.
He said he was leaning toward Delaware, where many of his friends had gone, but chose Lehigh after it came up with the best financial aid offer, including a $15,000-a-year scholarship. He also took out two or three loans, he said.
"In the end, it worked out great, both in terms of the school and the financing," he said.
Mr. Holler's scholarship was based on need, but growing competition is forcing many universities to increase their pool of merit-based as well as need-based financial aid. Until this year, Lehigh was among the fewer than 15 percent of four-year colleges that gave out aid strictly on the basis of need. But the university found that it was increasingly losing more and more students to competitors like Emory, Carnegie-Mellon, Rochester, Richmond, Villanova and Johns Hopkins, all of which have moved aggressively to offer merit scholarships as recruiting tools.
In a survey of applicants who were accepted by Lehigh but chose to go elsewhere, 62 percent said they would have been interested in Lehigh if they had received a merit scholarship.
Partly in response, Lehigh this year announced President's Scholarships, in which students with a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 or higher or who graduate with high honors can attend another year free to get a master's degree or complete a second major. It also announced a small number of $5,000 to $7,000 Dean's Scholarships to superior applicants for the freshman class, and $2,500 music and theater scholarships not based on need.
Some at Lehigh have long advocated merit-based scholarships as a way to reward excellence and lure top scholars, said Lehigh's president, Peter Likins. But until this year, he remained committed to offering financial aid only to worthy students unable to afford a Lehigh education.
"Lehigh has stood with those elite institutions who said, 'I don't care what's happening to the world; I'm going to play by a certain set of principles,' " he said. "Now what's happening is that institutions of considerable historical reputation are moving across the line, and every time one does, it puts additional pressure on the rest of us. Finally, Lehigh succumbed."
At Lehigh and elsewhere, colleges are also using aid to further their academic aims and traditions. For example, Clark University in Massachusetts announced last year a fifth-year-free program like the one Lehigh later adopted. Clark officials say it fits well with the university's niche as a small research university with a strong graduate component.
Alan Jones, dean of graduate studies at Clark, said that along with the 115 merit scholarships it offered, the program allowed the university to provide financial incentives to a broad range of students in addition to those who get aid based on need. "We offer a price break on the front end to certain students and a price break later on to those who perform well here," he said.
Tuition inflation has been slowing for the last four years, according to the College Board. Still, this year's 6 percent increase was twice the rate of inflation.
Although universities have been fighting to control costs for years, their success has been limited by the need to repair or replace aging buildings, by the growing financial needs of students and because they have far less control over their payrolls than most other employers.
Still, as difficult as the task may be, Mr. Likins argues that colleges and universities cannot solve their problems by adjusting prices. The real challenge, he says, is to cut their operating costs.
"Price is becoming more or less a consuming preoccupation, but unless you control costs, you're on an impossible journey," he said. "The economics of higher education are really in jeopardy. If you're just fiddling around with price, you're playing a dangerous game in which no one wins."

And colleges, much like automobile dealers, are coming up with "more aggressive and creative and sometimes desperate pricing schemes," because many consumers are refusing to pay the sticker price.

HEADLINE: Russia's Army Seen as Failing Chechnya Test

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Demoralized and underpaid, the Russian Army is facing in the rebellious Chechnya region its stiffest test of professionalism and morale since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and it is failing the test, Western diplomats and Russian military analysts say.
Its officers are rebelling in the face of an increasingly vicious war against other Russians. Its soldiers are dispirited and disorganized, badly fed and cold, without any clear idea of why they should be fighting the Chechens. 
 The army's heavy armor has little strategic value in Chechnya, its movements have been sluggish against little resistance, and its jets are almost haphazardly bombing a city defended by only a few thousand poorly equipped troops.
One result is a public relations fiasco so bad that even President Boris N. Yeltsin's supporters in the West, who have regarded Chechnya from the start as an internal affair, have started to complain. The sense of confusion about Moscow's methods is shared by Russians, too.
"It's hard to call this a strategy," said Sergei Yushenkov, the chairman of Parliament's Defense Committee. "It is the barbaric destruction of the city of Grozny and its inhabitants."
Military officials keep saying the army has a plan to use laser-guided bombs and special forces to infiltrate Grozny, the Chechens' capital, and "decapitate" its leadership, including President Dzhokhar M. Dudayev.
There is already a growing and abiding new hatred for Russian power in the North Caucasus, which hoped that the post-Soviet world would be a different one. There is already, in the Russian press, criticism of the military and its leadership that is reminiscent of the American news media toward the end of the Vietnam War. And there is already, in the new Russian military, a sense of shame over Chechnya that will probably further poison attitudes toward Mr. Yeltsin, democratic and economic change, and all politicians generally.
No matter what happens in Chechnya now, whether Grozny is taken tonight or tomorrow or not taken at all, the Russian Army will face a severe period of rebuilding not unlike the United States Army's after the professional humiliation of Vietnam.
Then, American officers said, it was difficult to attract young people of sufficient quality, let alone feel much pride in a military career. The American military responded with much better recruitment and advertising techniques, and most important, with higher pay and better benefits.
But if there is one persistent fact of Russian political life today, it is the scarcity of money for any social need in a tight federal budget, and Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev has already warned of the political consequences of continuing to starve the army of funds for training, housing and modern equipment.
Speaking to Parliament last month, General Grachev said an impatient and impoverished Russian military was losing its ability to defend the Motherland. Young officers are leaving in large numbers, he said. Pilots are not flying because of budget cuts in fuel and maintenance, and ships are stuck in port. Nearly 200,000 officers and their families are without decent housing. Military units engage in trade and troops work as laborers to supplement their pay.
"We must frankly ask ourselves the question -- do we need an army?" General Grachev said. "If so, it is a sin to keep it in poverty and half-starved."
"Not a single other army in the world is in such a catastrophic state," he added. "I ask you to take this as a warning."
The military's performance in Chechnya is a testament to General Grachev's concerns. Despite his efforts to reorganize the army and give it a new mission in a post-cold-war world, there has not been the money to develop the mobile striking units the new military doctrine calls for, and which could have been effective in Chechnya.
But the rot was evident long before Chechnya. "If anyone still had any doubts," said Pavel Y. Felgengauer, the military analyst for the newspaper Sevodnya, "the war in Chechnya has certainly shown the low levels of military readiness and morale of the Russian Army."
Draft evasion remains rampant; there are too many generals running nearly empty units; patriotism is out of fashion; vicious hazing of recruits, especially of those from the Caucasus, frightens young men and their parents; high-ranking generals speak with contempt of President Yeltsin and General Grachev.
The vaunted military-industrial complex that supported the army, even if the quality of the science was overrated, has now largely turned as a matter of state policy toward making civilian products or selling its hardware overseas for dollars.
From the height of Soviet power, with five million men and women under arms (including border troops) and an almost unlimited budget, the Russian Army is now believed to be a hollow force of only 1.4 million or fewer, and without enough money to care for them properly.
It is an enormous fall for an institution that embodied the pride of the empire, first Russian and then Soviet. The officer corps was a pampered elite; the uniform brought respect; the institution had saved the nation from Napoleon and Hitler against all odds.
Then came Afghanistan -- which the Soviets invaded 15 years ago today -- and the first real humiliation; then the revelations of glasnost and a budding free press; then the collapse of the Soviet Union, a professional disaster for the army. And then the inevitable and coruscating pull into politics, despite all the efforts by military leaders to stay out of the maneuvering.
In August 1991 the army refused to carry out the putsch against Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- its first taste of popularly applauded insubordination. In October 1993 it made a pained and slow decision to support Mr. Yeltsin by firing tank shells at the old Russian Parliament. Even General Grachev, Defense Minister by dint of his loyalty to Mr. Yeltsin in 1991, hesitated then, and the country came within a few hours of being run by Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, a former air force general who was then Vice President and led the parliamentary revolt.
The army's support of Mr. Yeltsin suddenly seemed conditional on Mr. Yeltsin's keeping his promises of better support, promises the generals believe that he has not kept. And that conditional support also helps explain Mr. Yeltsin's more robust and nationalist foreign policy.
Then General Grachev became further tarnished. He has always been regarded by the army elite, the General Staff, as a jumped-up paratrooper who earned his position by political loyalty. Suddenly this autumn came a whole new cycle of corruption charges that nearly brought him down.
Sharp and shocking criticism came from inside the army, including criticism from young Turks like the popular Lieut. Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, commander of the 14th Army in Moldova. General Lebed, always outspoken, turned his popularity into a successful public defiance of General Grachev, refusing to be reassigned and appealing directly to Mr. Yeltsin. General Lebed also spoke contemptuously of Gen. Matvei P. Burlakov, who had commanded Russian troops in Germany and was accused of corruption.
Mr. Yeltsin was forced to dismiss General Burlakov last month "to preserve the honor of the army," he said, and General Grachev's position was felt to be hanging by a thread.
But the traditional respect for the army was gone, both in the press and the public, and a pattern of insubordination had taken hold. When Chechnya began to get hot, General Lebed opposed intervention publicly, as he continues to do without reprisal. Even Gen. Boris Gromov, a First Deputy Defense Minister, warned against the military action.
And during the slow, clanking advance toward Grozny itself, and now the round-the-clock bombing, generals and lesser officers have refused orders, expressed dissent and tried to resign. They have said that carrying out warfare against Russian citizens violates the Russian Constitution, and resent carrying out a police action on Russian territory.
The semi-official Itar-Tass news agency first reported that General Grachev had taken personal control of the attack and suspended or relieved six top commanders, including a Deputy Defense Minister, Gen. Georgi Kondratyev, who kept warning Moscow to negotiate and not attack, and Col. Gen. Eduard Vorobyov, the deputy commander of all land forces, the backbone of the army.
The report of the suspensions was then denied, but not the report that General Grachev was now in direct command, implying that the General Staff is belatedly trying to keep its distance from the disaster.
Some Russian critics of the Chechnya action think that attacking Chechnya was forced upon General Grachev as the price of keeping his job, so there would be a ready scapegoat. Some think that the army is using its poor performance now to be able to put pressure on Mr. Yeltsin for more support and more money. Some think that Chechnya means an army even more politicized then before.
"After a long sequence of defeats and humiliations, beginning in Afghanistan," Mr. Felgengauer said, "the Russian Army has reached a point where it might simply refuse to obey orders."
But the biggest problem for the institution was described by General Vorobyov, the most senior of the dissenting officers, confirming that he had tried to resign but that his resignation had been refused.
"I love the army very much," he told Izvestia in an interview. "I gave it 38 years of my life. And I don't want even the smallest stain on its uniform."

HEADLINE: Who Was Jesus? A Search for Clues Grows

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
On this day in particular, Christian churches proclaim the story of Jesus, a Savior conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin.
But ever since the Enlightenment in the 18th century, some people have hungered for more, a way to reach beyond the creeds to Jesus the man, a historical figure who can be known in human terms much like, say, Washington, Charlemagne or Julius Caesar. 
 The quest for the historical Jesus ebbed and flowed through German Protestant academies for generations, but little about its findings reached people in the pews.
These days, a new quest, mainly led by American scholars, is on, and this time it has found a public whose avidity for it has turned some heavily footnoted academic texts into strong sellers among general audiences.
"I'm just amazed at the appetite there is for this," said Marcus J. Borg, a professor of religion and culture at Oregon State University and a leading figure among the new generation of Jesus scholars. "I think, in common with a lot of commentators on our culture, there's a rebirth of religious interest."
Among academics, research into Jesus is being spurred by the enthusiasm of a new generation of scholars, drawing on information from archeological discoveries in and around Israel, including recent excavations of cities and villages in Galilee, where Jesus preached.
But the interest of the larger public is another matter. For two or three years in the United States, a nation where old denominational loyalties have faded, popular enthusiasm has been surging around ancient spiritual topics, lifting books on angels, prayer and life after death high onto the best-seller lists. In this climate, scholarly works on the historical Jesus have found an audience among those most inclined to probe issues of faith, even if it means tackling hundreds of pages of densely argued text.
Dr. Borg, who lectures frequently about the historical Jesus to adult groups, said he had encountered many people who were seriously wrestling with basic beliefs. "For them, their childhood understanding of Jesus and the Bible at some point stopped working, but their religious interest remains," he said. "Biblical scholarship, and Jesus scholarship in particular, provides a new way of seeing this material."
The portraits of Jesus that scholars like Dr. Borg are offering stand at some distance from the Christ of the creeds; Jesus is variously described as an enlightened person, like the Buddha, who was also a mystic and healer; a peasant who was a social revolutionary, or an apocalyptic prophet who saw himself in the mold of the Old Testament prophet Elijah.
And the scholars offering these divergent images are a far more diverse group than in previous quests: Catholics, Protestants and Jews, many working in secular institutions, and increasingly interested in archeologists' findings.
A few recent discoveries have seemed to come tantalizingly close to Jesus himself. Four years ago in Jerusalem, archeologists uncovered an ossuary, or box for bones, marked with the family name of Caiaphas, the high priest who in the Gospels questioned Jesus before the Roman authorities crucified him. Excavations at the ruins of Sepphoris, a city near Nazareth, and other sites in Galilee have provided insights into the social and economic life of Jewish communities there.
The new findings have indicated that the region around lower Galilee was becoming more urbanized in the first century than previously thought. How much that affected Jesus' activities is debated by scholars. But some have argued that his teachings responded to rising social tensions.
"We have new materials, we have new methods, and we have a new approach in that we want to go public, too," said John Dominic Crossan, a professor of biblical studies at DePaul University in Chicago who wrote "The Historical Jesus" (HarperCollins). Dr. Crossan said he had written the book with a narrow academic audience in mind. But it has sold more than 50,000 copies in hardback since it was published in 1991, he said.
David Lull, the executive director of the Society of Biblical Literature, an international association of biblical scholars, said, "The public is voting with their dollars for biblical scholarship."
Last winter, Dr. Crossan, Dr. Borg and another biblical scholar, Burton L. Mack of Claremont Graduate School in California, met for a "Jesus summit," a wide-ranging discussion, at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. The event's sponsors, HarperCollins and the Trinity Institute, an organization based in New York that runs education programs for members of the clergy, arranged a live broadcast via satellite to 74 colleges, churches and libraries across the country.
The Trinity Institute's director, Frederic Burnham, said that he did not know how many people had tuned in but that he had chanced upon one group of more than 150 people viewing the event on a television in a hotel ballroom. "I think it's just part of the tremendous revival in interest in spiritual matters in this country," he said.
Dr. Crossan said that on his desk he kept a stack of readers' letters. They are not the angry missives from biblical literalists he had expected. Rather, he has been hearing from people struggling with their beliefs. "I wasn't ready for the positive stuff at all," he said. "I wasn't ready for two- and three- and four-page letters, many with questions," theological questions about God and Jesus.
Among those who write to him, he said, are "centrist Christians," the sort of religious moderates who these days can sometimes feel sidelined during shrill religious disputes and uncertain of their place in a nation whose spiritual diversity seems to be in a period of rapid growth.
A significant number of those in search of the historical Jesus are people of the baby-boom generation who feel a "disharmony" between their secular and religious educations, said another scholar, the Rev. John P. Meier, a professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington. Many hold advanced degrees, but the knowledge they have of their own religious traditions ended in Sunday school, he said.
They "desire to do for themselves this religious education that they did not get," said Father Meier, the second volume of whose sweeping study of the historical Jesus, "A Marginal Jew" (Doubleday), was published last month. "It's in that struggling with the faith as an adult that the quest for the historical Jesus is so useful to these people."
Younger people, too, are entering on the quest, although the questions they begin with are sometimes more basic.
Speaking of his classes at Oregon State, Dr. Borg said: "For my students, the questions they bring to class are not related to Christian theology. It's: 'What was he like? What was he up to?' "
In a sense, such questions about Jesus echo the ones asked 2,000 years ago. The Gospels tell how, with each miraculous healing Jesus worked, the crowds around him grew. People swarmed after Jesus, but many found him utterly mysterious.
"Whom say the people that I am?" Jesus asked his disciples during a quiet moment (Luke 9:18). They responded that many thought he was John the Baptist, or the prophet Elijah, or another of "the old prophets." Jesus then asked the disciples who the disciples thought he was. "The Christ," answered Peter.
The historical Jesus, Father Meier said, is the "great perennial question" in Western religion, "the great perennial question which every generation thinks it's solved, but which comes back in the next generation."

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS PLAN SWEEPING BARRIERS TO NEW U.S. RULES

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
House Republicans are preparing to push quickly next year for legislation that would radically restrict the Government's ability to regulate everything from auto safety to wilderness protection.
Republicans in the House have pledged to push to a vote within the first 100 days of the new Congressional session legislation that would increase the ability of groups affected by regulations to challenge them before they take effect or are even formally proposed. For the first time, analyses of costs and benefits prepared in the initial phase of drafting regulations would be subject to review by outside experts, and these analyses could be challenged in court. 
 The Republican proposal would also drive down the overall burden on business and state and local governments by creating a regulatory "budget" -- a specific ceiling on the costs of complying with all Federal regulations. That ceiling would be steadily reduced, and Congress would agree not to pass laws whose costs would exceed the ceiling.
If adopted, the Republican proposals would fundamentally alter the workings of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and affect matters as diverse as the Transportation Department's pending decision about whether to require anti-lock brakes on passenger cars and the Forest Service's tentative proposal to regulate the use of permanent metal anchor bolts by rock climbers in wilderness areas.
The proposals, included in a draft bill called the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995, are the latest salvo in a decades-long struggle between Republicans and Democrats over the Federal Government's power to make rules. The obscure and often arcane rule-making process has grown into one of the Government's most formidable functions.
The new plan goes well beyond even the anti-regulatory agenda of President Ronald Reagan, involving ideas like the regulatory budget that have never been seriously considered before.
The bill's basic approach is to limit the scope of regulations by imposing detailed strictures on the rule makers themselves. It includes, for example, one paragraph that bars any rule from being published for public comment unless the Director of the Office of Management and Budget certifies that among other grammatical requirements it avoids double negatives and "contains only sentences that are as short as practical."
Public debate on the Republicans' proposal has just begun, as tax cuts, spending cuts and welfare reform have dominated the political agenda since the Republicans won sweeping victories in November. But interest groups on both sides of the issue are enlisting in the struggle by the hundreds, guaranteeing that it will be among the most bitterly contested items considered in the coming year and making the outcome impossible to predict. It is unclear, for example, to what extent Senate Republicans will join in the sweeping measures their colleagues in the House are proposing.
The Clinton Administration, alarmed at what it views as a comprehensive assault on the entire regulatory system, has already begun a campaign to defend current practices as founded on "common sense," a phrase that has appeared in almost every recent public pronouncement by Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator.
The same antagonists are also lining up on a separate but related set of Republican initiatives that would force the Government to reimburse property owners when regulations reduce the value of their holdings.
The proposed House legislation would result in significant changes in the balance of power among the Congressional committees, regulatory agencies and interest groups that battle daily over proposed new rules and the enforcement of those on the books.
The Republican National Committee disputes as a "myth" any assertion that the bill is "inherently anti regulation."
"The objective is not to cause a certain level of regulatory burden, but to make the regulatory burden a matter of conscious choice rather than of accident," the party's newly published tract on its legislative plan, "Contract with America" (Random House/Times Books), states.
The measure's opponents have a starkly different view. "If this bill passes, it will stop the issuance of new rules," said Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal group that monitors the regulatory activities of the Office of Management and Budget and has published an 18-page analysis of the regulatory bill, titled "Eye of the Newt."
"It will gut existing rules, and it will limit the ability of Congress to pass new laws," Mr. Bass said. "It will be impossible to enforce existing laws, and it will seriously harm the ability of the Government to protect individuals."
So far, the debate on the broad and complex proposal has been limited to a relatively small circle of experts and advocates inside and outside the Government. It has been packaged by Republicans as part of their pledge to reduce the capital gains tax.
 Other sections of the bill would erect far more substantial barriers to regulation, including some that have never been seriously contemplated before.
For example, the regulatory budget would attempt to measure the costs to private businesses and to state and local governments of complying with regulations, and would force Congress to shrink those costs much as the fiscal budget tries to shrink the Federal deficit.
It would also set up a detailed process for assessing the costs and benefits of every major regulation, for scientifically reviewing how the rules would affect health and safety risks, and for letting affected parties challenge the highly technical assessments in court.
Its critics say the legislation would tie the regulatory process into knots of scientific review, economic analysis, legal challenge and political gridlock.
But advocates say the bill would guarantee simplicity and common sense where now there is obfuscation and red tape.
"What this is all about is changing the fundamental process from a system where people are serving regulations, to one where the regulations are serving people," said Bruce Gates, a vice president of the National-American Wholesale Grocers Association who is running a coalition called Project Relief that is pressing for the bill's passage.
The measure would create significant new centers of power in the battles over regulation -- battles as important as the more familiar ones over legislation.
The regulatory budget, for example, would undermine the powers of most Congressional committees -- a feature of the bill that could weaken support for it in Congress.
Under the proposal, any committee that attempted to write a law that would impose regulatory costs beyond a specific level could be forced under budget rules either to withdraw those provisions or eliminate other regulations to compensate for the new costs.
The effect, as the law is written, would be to greatly increase the power of the House and Senate Budget Committees over regulatory matters that are now the domain of other committees, like those that control banking, the environment and labor issues.
Congress would be ordering, in effect, those specialized committees to rewrite existing laws to reduce the aggregate costs of regulations by 6.5 percent annually, until the costs borne by the private sector were not more than 5 percent of the economy's total output, and the costs on states and local governments no more than 3 percent of the whole economy.
The regulatory budget would also impose a ceiling on expected regulatory costs while the committees draft new legislation -- even though the costs of regulations are never really known when the laws are passed, since Congress rarely spells out details of how the laws are to be put into effect.
Once a committee reached its limit for imposing costs, it could no longer bring a bill to the floor without permission of three-fifths of the entire House or Senate.
Power would also shift from agencies to the groups they regulate.
In the regulatory agencies, the power would move to panels of technical experts who would provide "peer review" of the risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses required of every major rule. A major rule would be defined as one that affected 100 people or cost any person or corporation $1 million.
Thus, there would be a proliferation of assessments and reviews, along with public hearings in many cases, all subject to court appeals.
As the legislation is written, much of that technical and legal maneuvering would occur even before the proposed rule was published in preliminary form by the regulators.
The Republicans' bill also aims a direct blow at the very foundation of the Clinton Administration's regulatory approach, an executive order signed by Mr. Clinton on September 30, 1993.
The order limited White House interference in regulatory matters and made it harder for interest groups to lobby quietly for regulatory changes at the White House.
In effect, the Republican bill would countermand that executive order, which Mr. Gore called "the foundation of our efforts and our first regulatory reform success."
Instead, it would enact into law President Reagan's defunct Executive Order 12291, which he had used to control the actions of a bureaucracy that he said had run amok.
The biggest difference between the Reagan and Clinton executive orders was that the Reagan order put control of regulations firmly in the White House, instead of in the Federal agencies. In pressing to put the order back into force, the Congressional Republicans appear to be betting that a Republican will be President before long.

The House Republicans' New Voice On Foreign Policy: Very Soft-Spoken

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
When the Republicans won control of the House of Representatives last month, a few conservative lawmakers began quietly plotting to deny Benjamin A. Gilman the post he had long cherished: the chairmanship of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Their thinking was that Mr. Gilman, a New Yorker whom some conservatives brand "a Rockefeller Republican," was too old, too moderate, too soft-spoken and, truth be told, too nice. In short, not enough of a fire-breather. 
 Alarmed, some of his friends in Congress opened a countercampaign to warn the new Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, that it would be folly to deny the highly visible foreign affairs post to a cautious, worldly-wise lawmaker like Mr. Gilman.
"I called Gingrich's office and said: 'No way. You'll have to crawl over my dead body if Ben Gilman doesn't get the chairmanship,' " said Robert Dornan, a California Republican who is one of the House's staunchest conservatives. "Ben is not as conservative as I am on social and fiscal issues, but on foreign affairs, he's solid."
For the past two years, Mr. Gilman, 72, has been a consistent though quiet critic of President Clinton's foreign policy. He faults the President for not carrying through on his threats to bomb Bosnia's Serbs, for favoring Russia over other former Soviet republics, for moving too slowly to expand NATO and for paying little heed to Congress in sending American troops overseas.
Although Mr. Gilman flew 35 bombing runs over Japan during World War II, no one has ever described him as a street fighter. In stark contrast to his Senate counterpart -- Jesse Helms of North Carolina -- Mr. Gilman remains largely unknown outside his district, notwithstanding his 22 years in the House. He is not the type of Congressman who spends his free time crisscrossing the country to give high-octane ideological speeches.
Instead, almost every Saturday he can be found in a mobile trailer he has turned into an office, roaming a district that runs from close suburbs to farm communities 70 miles from Manhattan, including all of Rockland County and parts of Orange, Sullivan and Westchester counties. He is immensely popular in his district; he took more than 70 percent of the vote in his election victory last November.
Mr. Gilman is so low-key that it has been 16 years since he last vaulted onto front pages. That was when, using the code name "Uncle Ben," he secretly negotiated a prisoner exchange in which an Israeli pilot held in Mozambique and an American jailed in East Germany were swapped for an East German spy imprisoned in the United States.
Now, thanks to the new Republican ascendancy, Mr. Gilman has come out of the cold. He plans to use his new prominence to push his pet issues: human rights, drugs, Middle East peace and the need for the Administration to consult more with Congress. Egged on by Mr. Gingrich and Republican backbenchers, he is also putting more bite into his criticism of Mr. Clinton.
In a news conference after being confirmed as chairman of what has been renamed the House International Relations Committee, he tarred Mr. Clinton for flip-flops and indecisiveness in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. "Instead of a strong, steady signal on foreign policy coming from the nation's capital," he said, "regrettably the world has heard a series of wavering notes sounded by an uncertain trumpet, leaving our allies concerned and our adversaries confused."
Friends say that Mr. Gilman is a genial, patient man. But with a face that always seems slightly dour, he comes across as a compulsive worrier, as someone who, if not fretting about human rights in China, is losing sleep over whether Russia is allowing Jews to emigrate freely.
In a recent interview he focused on his biggest current worry: the way President Clinton often commits troops to overseas missions without consulting in depth with Congress beforehand.
He questioned whether 25,000 American troops were needed in Haiti after former President Jimmy Carter won the coup leaders' promise to cede power. He criticized President Clinton for promising to send up to 30,000 troops to Bosnia to help withdraw United Nations peacekeepers. And now he is concerned that the President has offered 3,000 marines to help United Nations peacekeepers pull out of Somalia.
"There are some areas where it's extremely important we take part in peacekeeping, but I think peacekeeping hasn't gone well when the Administration hasn't consulted enough," he said.
He backed President Bush and, later, President Clinton when they sent forces to the Persian Gulf to check Iraqi aggression. As for Somalia, he backed Mr. Bush's decision to send troops to help end the famine there in late 1992, but criticized Mr. Clinton for changing that mission to hunting down Somali warlords.
Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat whom Mr. Gilman will succeed as committee chairman, said: "Ben is very much in the mainstream of American foreign policy. He wants to be supportive of the President whenever he can. But he will insist on the prerogatives of the Congress, as he should."
Mr. Gilman's dissection of a subject is generally more biting than his oratory. Take Bosnia. "President Clinton met with a number of us, and we explored the options," he said. "It seemed there was a consensus that we would engage in selective bombing. Then the President reached out to some allies in Europe, and he didn't find any consensus. So that was put on a back burner.
"Then Congress urged an immediate lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia, and he seemed to go along. Then suddenly he was supporting a six-month delay in lifting the embargo instead. Bosnia, I say, is another instance of vacillation."
While Senator Helms comes across like a fire-breathing dragon, Mr. Gilman seems like a friendly bulldog. Most of the time he seems easy to get along with, but when angered he sinks his teeth in and does not soon let go.
The State Department discovered this a year ago when it sought to eliminate its counterterrorism office and merge it into the department's antinarcotics office. It was not long after the World Trade Center bombing, and Mr. Gilman was convinced that in substance and in message, abolishing the counterterrorism office was a silly idea. So he went to work lining up Republicans and Democrats and blocked the effort.
Despite their differing politics and styles, Mr. Gilman is confident that he will work smoothly with Senator Helms. Administration officials fear Mr. Helms because of his venomous remarks and his ability to embarrass them in oversight hearings. But the Administration fears Mr. Gilman for quite different reasons: His middle-of-the-road views carry a lot of weight on both sides of the aisle and he knows how to build a consensus to enact his agenda.
For President Clinton, Mr. Gilman's message is both reassuring and a warning. "I think we should emphasize that partisanship should stop at the water's edge," Mr. Gilman said. "And I think it's important for the Administration to build a consensus of both parties on any important initiative so that we face the world in a unified manner."
But Mr. Gilman is likely to feel pressure from other Republicans not to be too easy on the Administration. And when he discusses foreign policy, gaps quickly emerge between his positions and those of Republican conservatives. Senator Helms describes the United Nations as a "nemesis"; Mr. Gilman is a firm believer in the organization, although he wants more oversight of its finances. While many Republicans favor a slash-and-burn attitude toward foreign aid, Mr. Gilman appears poised to defend it.
That Mr. Gilman comes across as a moderate is not surprising, considering his roots. As a young lawyer he was inspired to join the Republican Party by some figures whom many modern-day Republicans would condemn as hopelessly liberal, including the late Governor and Vice President, Nelson Rockefeller, and the late New York Senator, Jacob Javits.
"If Ben has any big problems as chairman, I think it will come from his own party," said Peter Peyser, a Democrat who lost to Mr. Gilman in 1982 when redistricting threw them into the same district.

HEADLINE: Gap Between Rich and Poor in New York City Grows Wider

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Among the nation's counties, the income gap between rich and poor in Manhattan is surpassed only by a group of 70 households near a former leper colony in Hawaii. Now an analysis of Census results shows that the gap widened in Manhattan in the 1980's, a decade whose extremes of wealth and want inspired Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities."
While the income disparity has historically been large in Manhattan, it widened to a greater degree in the 1980's than in any other county with 50,000 or more people. That increase drove New York City from 11th in 1980 to fifth in 1990 among cities with the biggest income disparities, and New York State from fifth to third among the states. 
 Poor people in the New York metropolitan area are more concentrated in the city itself than in any other major metropolitan area except San Antonio. The disparity has potentially profound political ramifications for the recurring competition between New York and its suburbs -- especially with last month's election of the first governor without New York City roots since 1920.
By the end of the 1980's, the top fifth of Manhattan households made 32 times as much as the bottom fifth, an average of $174,486 compared with $5,435. Put another way, for every $1 made by households in the top fifth, households in the bottom fifth made 3 cents.
In comparison, average income of the top fifth of all the nation's households edged up relatively modestly, from about 11 times the average income of the bottom fifth in 1980 to 14 times in 1990, when it was $94,264 versus $6,810.
Experts disagree about just when a growing divergence in incomes becomes a drag on the economy. But some express concern that vast disparities further disconnect poor people from the economic mainstream and can place additional economic and social pressures on a struggling middle class.
The average family income among the 812 people counted in the city's poorest census tract, around Bradhurst Avenue and West 145th Street in West Harlem, was $6,019. Average family income among the 6,053 Manhattanites recorded in the richest tract, the 10 square blocks in Carnegie Hill east of Fifth Avenue and north of East 86th Street, was $301,209.
The five square blocks straddling Jackie Robinson Park in West Harlem's Bradhurst section are punctuated by the vacant lots and housing hulks that separate sturdy six-story apartment buildings. The prognosis there is improving, though, thanks to a renewal project engineered by the Consortium for Central Harlem Development.
"Most of the people who are here are the ones who couldn't afford to go anywhere else," said Richard Brown, who runs the One and Only Laundry on West 146th Street. "We've got people who live from day to day, people who come in and say, 'Mr. Brown, I don't have no money to do my clothes.' We're the last to get any kind of attention, but it's coming back, slowly but surely."
 
Longest Cab Ride On the Continent
 Bradhurst is only a $5.25 cab ride or six subway stops north of the Upper East Side tract, which abuts the proverbial boundary between haves and have-nots, East 96th Street.
"Three miles makes a lot of difference," Mr. Brown said. "It's enough space to stay away from the poor."
In Bradhurst, 3 of every 4 people live below the poverty level, but fewer than 1 in 100 in Carnegie Hill.
"Today, the disparity is worse because of the decline of the quality of civic life," said Stephen Berger, an investment banker and former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who lives with his wife and two children in Carnegie Hill -- a neighborhood characterized by chic shops, elegant town houses and converted mansions, museums, private schools and apartment buildings manned by white-gloved doormen.
"It's hurt the poor because the first step of the ladder is now 20 feet off the ground instead of two feet," Mr. Berger said. "It's hurt the middle class because they also find the public system has deteriorated, so they are forced to supplement it. And it's hurt the wealthy because they have priced themselves to the point where they need that income disparity in order to live well."
Patrick Gerschel, an art collector and private investor who lives in Carnegie Hill, recalled how the fortunes of neighborhoods shift over time and how, despite the potential for conflict, the city survives. Still, he said, "Obviously, if you live better than your neighbor, that is going to cause all sorts of problems."
 
Poor New Yorkers Are Losing Ground
 An analysis of Census results related to income was conducted for The New York Times by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, who directs the Program for Applied Research at Queens College of the City University of New York, and by Jeannie D'Amico, a research assistant. These are among the trends it found:
*While average income increased in the 1980's in every borough but the Bronx, poor New York City residents lost ground compared with others. Among the poorest fifth, 13 percent of New York City households and 16 percent of other households in the region were receiving public assistance in 1980. By 1990, 28 percent of the poorest New York City households, but only 14 percent of those elsewhere in the region, were on welfare.
*In all but one county in the 24-county region including New York City, the gap between rich and poor became more extreme. More residents of Suffolk and Putnam counties in New York, Sussex and Hunterdon counties in New Jersey and Middlesex County in Connecticut advanced into the nation's highest one-fifth in income than did residents of any other counties in the nation.
*In Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, and in Essex County, N.J., the proportion of people whose income qualified them for the region's middle fifth -- theoretically those most typical of average or middle income -- declined during the decade. While some of them may have graduated into higher income categories, one consequence of their success was to drive the top and bottom groups further apart.
*When the decade ended, the richest Manhattanites were younger (more than 2 in 3 were under 50), more likely to be American-born, slightly more likely to be in a household headed by a woman or a Hispanic person and less likely to have jobs -- or, presumably, need them -- than when the decade began. Among the poorest, far fewer were employed in 1990 than in 1980 -- about 3 in 10, or slightly more than the proportion who were on welfare. In 1980, 8 in 10 of the poorest were working.
While income disparities are common in virtually every society, demographic analysts said they were struck by the dimensions, both within the city and in comparison with the surrounding region. The gap in Manhattan is greater than that in Guatemala.
"It creates the well-founded impression among low-skilled workers that they don't have a shot at the economic mainstream and a decent standard of living," said Hugh B. Price, the new president of the National Urban League. "If you're living in the inner city, you look at the odds and say, 'Why bother?' "
 
Squeezing Out The Middle Class
 Extremes often exist in close proximity, as the wide disparity in Manhattan suggests.
"When I looked at those numbers, I said, 'Oops, there goes the middle class,' " said Gene Spruck, an analyst for the Port Authority. "Sure, there are some people from the middle who move up. But when you look at the polarization of income, the numbers fit into everything we intuitively know: that the middle class is being squeezed out of Manhattan."
In the New York region, including New York City, Long Island, the lower Hudson Valley, northern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut, average income for the middle one-fifth increased in every county by at least 20 percent -- ranging from a 22 percent increase in Union County, N.J., to 48 percent in Manhattan. But in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Essex County, N.J., the proportion of people whose income put them in the middle one-fifth of the region declined.
In most of the region's counties, the gap between rich and poor grew modestly, although it widened in every county except Putnam. But it expanded from a ratio of 21-to-1 in 1980 to 32-to-1 in Manhattan, from 14-to-1 to 20-to-1 in the Bronx and from 14-to-1 to 19-to-1 in Brooklyn.
In the Bronx, where income for the wealthiest rose by 34 percent, income among the bottom group declined by 3.4 percent -- the only county where the average income for any of the five groups declined.
The Times analysis divided households into five groups of equal size. For comparison, the gap was defined as the disparity between the average income of the lowest fifth and the average income of the highest fifth.
Dr. Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard, cautions that income in the lower fifth is often understated. But, she said, "the disparity is still going to be great."
Among other counties with 50,000 or more people and where the disparity came closest to Manhattan's, the rich made 29.9 times as much as the poor in Orleans Parish, La. ($83,389 compared with $2,793). In Manhattan, average incomes were higher, but so were living costs.
In Kalawao, Hawaii, where most of the people are either former residents of a leper colony and their descendants or the few wealthier people drawn there by Molokai Island's natural beauty, among other lures, the rich made 41 times as much as the poor.
 
Some Silver Linings In the Income Gap
 The Census results on which the Times analysis is based were released late in 1993; they do not include medical and other noncash benefits or illegal or unreported income. The results captured trends that appear to have continued during the 1990's.
A gap in incomes may reflect some conditions that are not necessarily unfavorable or that may have some beneficial consequences. The lower income groups in Manhattan, for instance, include artists and aspiring theater people working in restaurants and recent immigrants whose willingness to accept low wages may have sustained part of the garment industry in New York.
"Whereas we have lost the middle class, white and black native-born," said Regina B. Armstrong, an economist for the Regional Plan Association, "in a sense New York is the most economically integrated place because we're able to hold onto higher income people at the same time we've accepted poorer people, including immigrants."
William B. Shore, a senior fellow with the Regional Plan Association, agreed that "one reason New York has traditionally been able to redistribute income -- through rent control, low-tuition colleges and the like -- is because we have all these wealthy people who not only pay taxes but contributed to foundations and philanthropies."
But the trickle-down trend may have trickled out in the 1980's, Dr. Beveridge suggested. In the New York region, he said: "There was an incredible increase in people making lots of money and at the low end a minimal increase in income. You could argue that if lots of people got rich that would be fine, but there was not a lot of trickling down."

HEADLINE: Police Say New Evidence Links Suspect to Firebomb

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Authorities examining last week's subway train firebombing in lower Manhattan have located new witnesses who saw the badly burned suspect fleeing in the streets and aboard another train, and have found new evidence at his home in New Jersey, including a videotape on bomb making, investigators said yesterday.
The new witnesses and other evidence appeared to solidify an already strong case against Edward J. Leary, a 49-year-old unemployed computer expert, who is charged with attempted mass murder in a firebombing that injured scores of riders aboard a No. 4 train at the Fulton Street station on Wednesday. 
 Investigators have charged that Mr. Leary, who lost his job at Merrill Lynch last January and had large real estate debts, planned a terrifying campaign of subway bombings to extort money from the city. They said his first bomb burned two teen-agers in Harlem on Dec. 15, while the second exploded in his face as he tried to set a timing device so it would go off in an East River tunnel.
Mr. Leary, who suffered third-degree burns over 40 percent of his body, remained in critical condition yesterday at the burn unit of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Also in critical condition there were Reufield Edey, 60, who suffered deep burns over 65 percent of his body, and Brenda Dowdell, 40, with burns over 35 percent of her body.
The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said yesterday that the firebombing case would be presented to a grand jury on Tuesday and that Mr. Leary would be arraigned in the hospital as soon as his condition permitted a bedside proceeding.
Mr. Leary's lawyer, Stephen J. Murphy, visited his client yesterday and said afterward that his condition appeared to be improving. But he said Mr. Leary was heavily tranquilized with morphine for pain, sometimes faded in and out of consciousness and appeared to have impaired hearing.
"He was sleeping when I arrived," Mr. Murphy said. "He awoke to my presence and I talked with him. But it was difficult to ascertain whether he was really hearing and understanding what I was saying. He's drugged, so one minute he can answer and a few minutes later he seems off."
Mr. Murphy said much of Mr. Leary's lower face was burned, especially around the lips, and his legs and buttocks were severely burned. Ointment was spread around the facial burns, but his head was not swathed in bandages, he said. He noted that Mr. Leary's wife, Marguerite E. Shaller, had visited her husband on Friday and was being "very supportive."
Reiterating his client's assertion that he was just a victim of the bombing and had no role in making or setting it off, Mr. Murphy declined to comment on reports of new witnesses and evidence in the case. But he complained that the authorities were "leaking everything in sight" to news organizations in a "grossly unfair" campaign of "vigilante justice."
Investigators insisted, however, that the case against Mr. Leary had been strengthened by the discovery of new witnesses near the scene of the bombing and new evidence found at the suspect's home in Scotch Plains, N.J., where search warrants had been executed and dozens of boxes of materials had been carried away by the authorities.
Law-enforcement officials said that earlier witnesses had placed Mr. Leary in the subway car of the Lexington Avenue train where the firebomb exploded, and that the new ones -- found by returning to the scene at the same time as the explosion occurred and asking for anyone who might have seen the suspect -- clarified what he did afterward.
They said the severely burned suspect, his clothes in tatters, stumbled onto the platform of the station at Fulton Street and Broadway and ran out an exit at Dey Street.
He then walked five blocks up Broadway and entered the Park Place subway station of the Seventh Avenue line, where he boarded a southbound No. 2 express train, investigators said. The train, passing one block west of the scenes of chaos at Fulton Street, rumbled under the East River to the Clark Street station in Brooklyn, where he again ascended to the street.
There, he was found by two transit police officers, who called an ambulance for him. It was while he was en route to New York Hospital that the officers, hearing a description of the firebombing suspect, concluded that the man they were helping might be the bomber.
Investigators said that additional court-authorized searches at Mr. Leary's 10-room home in Scotch Plains had uncovered videotapes, including one with a label that showed it was on the manufacture of bombs, and numerous computer disks. The contents of the tapes and disks remained to be examined, they said.
Earlier searches at the home had found a trove of bomb-making supplies in Mr. Leary's den, including mayonnaise jars, wires, timing devices, batteries and containers of gasoline, according to authorities. They say they also found sketches of bomb devices and notes, apparently in Mr. Leary's hand, that referred to a "mad bomber."
Some of the notes also allegedly laid out plans to extort money from the Transit Authority with a campaign of firebombings across the city. "We have several more bombs and if you pay a ransom, we will make this bomb safe," police said one note said. Another, they said, warned, "I will keep doing this."
Mr. Leary, who had paid $280,000 for his home in Scotch Plains and also owned three apartments at a cooperative building in Brooklyn, apparently was desperate for money, investigators said, and had been unemployed since losing his job at Merrill Lynch. The company said he had been dismissed for poor performance.
A Merrill Lynch official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed a report in The Daily News yesterday that Mr. Leary, after having been told his performance was imperiling his job, had sabotaged computers at the brokerage.
After the tampering was discovered, this official said, a test was set up to determine who was responsible, and Mr. Leary was identified as the culprit. Mr. Leary, who joined Merrill Lynch in September, 1991, was dismissed on Jan. 28.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Autistic Teen-Ager's Days at Camp Provide Respite for Him and His Mother

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
For 17 years, she has preserved the routines that define her son's cloistered life: putting him on the school bus each morning, walking him home on an unchanging route, fixing his dinner with gentle music in the background. But a stretch of misfortune has left Dorothea Y. wondering if normalcy might soon be out of reach.
Mrs. Y.'s son, Jonathan, suffers from autism, a brain disorder that causes extreme introversion starting in infancy. He cannot maintain eye contact, talk normally or interact with others, and he depends on rigid routines for a sense of security. 
 Jonathan was 5 when his father walked out, leaving Mrs. Y. alone with a child who required unfailing attention. More often than not, she said, others found Jonathan's erratic behavior unacceptable. As an infant, he would cry inconsolably whenever she took him somewhere new. At 17, his moods are equally unpredictable, and he is prone to sudden, fierce rages.
"When Jonathan was younger, so many people made me feel like I was a bad mother and he was a bad child," Mrs. Y. said recently as her tall, shaggy-haired son hunched over their kitchen table with crayons and a coloring book. "There's an attitude that these kids have to adjust to our world, but in this case, that will never happen."
One place where Jonathan has met with acceptance is the Children's Aid Society's Wagon Road Camp, which he has attended since he was 10. The society is among seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, in its 83d year. The camp, in Chappaqua, N.Y., is a respite program for parents like Mrs. Y., allowing them to take a break from the stress of raising disabled children.
Jonathan goes to camp for a month in the summer and for several days during other school vacations. Tomorrow, he will leave for a week at Wagon Road, where he and other disabled children from poor families will celebrate Christmas with parties and field trips.
"The same kids go back every year, so I know my son is going to be with friends," said Mrs. Y., who is 47. "Respite is a godsend for me, but it has also been invaluable for Jonathan."
Helene Zarember, director of the Wagon Road Camp from 1988 through 1993, said the experience has eased Jonathan out of his isolation. "When he first came to camp, he kept to himself," she said. "Now he is more relaxed and sociable, and he has learned how to take care of himself."
As a customer service representative for a large company in New York City, Mrs. Y. earned enough to live comfortably through most of Jonathan's childhood in Park Slope, Brooklyn. But in the summer of 1992, while her son was at camp, she suffered two brain aneurysms and a mild stroke in the course of two weeks. Lying in a hospital bed, she could not stop wondering what Jonathan would do if she died.
"I told the doctors they had to get me through for his sake," she said. "He doesn't have anyone but me."
Mrs. Y.'s recovery has been achingly slow, and coupled with more bad luck. She was on disability for two years, receiving physical therapy and relearning simple things like how to step off a subway car. Shortly after the stroke, her former husband stopped paying child support and Mrs. Y. had to hire a lawyer. Between court fees and medical bills, she spent her entire savings of $13,000.
In October, just after Mrs. Y. returned to work, she was dismissed from her job of 10 years. She received her last paycheck a few weeks ago, and said she cannot look for a new job until she finishes her court battle for child support. She fears her lack of skills will keep her from finding work in a bleak economy.
"I don't have any education to speak of, so I'm scared," she said. "The odds are really stacked against me."
Jonathan's future is equally uncertain. When he turns 18, Mrs. Y. will petition for guardianship, since he will never be able to live independently. He will attend a special school in Brooklyn until he is 21, but Mrs. Y. does not know what he will do as an adult.
"Jonathan is like a small child, and he can never be left alone," she said. "I will always have to watch out for him."
Mrs. Y. is hesitant to apply for public assistance because she does not want to risk losing her small row house, which she has lived in since Jonathan's birth. Relocating could have devastating consequences for Jonathan, she said. She hopes eventually to turn their house into a home for autistic teen-agers or adults.
"If there is one thing I have learned, it's that autistic people don't need institutions," she said. "They need a place that is warm and comforting, where they can live like everyone else."
Mrs. Y. has worked hard to provide that kind of place for Jonathan, and her efforts have been worth it. Their home, decorated with colored Christmas lights and pictures of Jonathan, is his sanctuary. As darkness fell on a recent evening, mother and son sat close together on their couch, one buoyant and talkative, the other stiff and impenetrable. Though few words were exchanged, their closeness was obvious.
"Through all of this, Jonathan has been my one companion," Mrs. Y. said, turning to gaze at her son's impassive countenance. "I need him as much as he needs me."

HEADLINE: Tsongas, Soured on Clinton, Looks to Powell

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas, Bill Clinton's most formidable rival in the Democratic Presidential primaries in 1992, has so soured on the President that he is strongly encouraging the notion of a third-party candidacy in 1996. And he says that Gen. Colin L. Powell might make the best candidate.
After months of refraining from any harsh criticism of Mr. Clinton, Mr. Tsongas has embarked on a personal campaign in which he argues that the President not only lacks moral conviction but is also pursuing irresponsible policies, like promises of tax cuts for the middle class. 
 "The President's biggest problem is a lack of moral authority," Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, said in a telephone interview this week. "And if he had taken positions that were clearly principled and thusly could occupy the high ground against a Republican challenger, there would be a grudging respect that I think would serve him much better."
The 53-year-old Mr. Tsongas, who says he will not run for President in 1996, said the Democrats' lack of commitment to reducing the Federal deficit and the Republicans' embrace of a right-wing social agenda has left a political vacuum that cries out for a candidate of General Powell's character. He laid out arguments for a third party in a memorandum sent earlier this month to news organizations.
Mr. Tsongas said he had sent the memorandum to General Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but had not spoken to him.
General Powell, who has not stated his party affiliation, is generally assumed to be a Republican because he has worked for Republican Presidents. He has not said whether he is interested in running for President in 1996, but he has not discouraged the speculation that he may run. He is immensely popular and has kept visible through frequent speaking appearances.
In a speech in Cleveland last month, General Powell said he was "developing a political philosophy." Fueling speculation that he would run as a third-party candidate, he said: "I think there is a possibility of a third party in '96. I think it would be wonderful."
Mr. Tsongas, who emphasized deficit reduction in the '92 primary campaign, said he was "horrified" by an assortment of middle-class tax cuts that Mr. Clinton proposed in a speech last week.
"The President's speech last Thursday was pretty much the end of the road for me in terms of not only the middle-class tax cut revisited by the specific reference to Social Security," he said. "I now see Bill Clinton as a direct threat to my children's generation."
Some White House officials dismiss Mr. Tsongas's comments as sanctimonious and say he is bitter over his defeat in 1992. Some Democrats accuse him of being disloyal.
"The notion that he is questioning the President's moral authority is like getting lectures on weight loss from Rush Limbaugh," said Paul Begala, a Presidential political adviser, who asserted that Mr. Tsongas misled voters about the state of his cancer in the primary campaign.
He also criticized the Tsongas campaign's proposals to cut the capital gains tax and entitlement programs like Social Security, saying: "Senator Tsongas has consistently opposed a Democratic Party built around middle class opportunities. It's no wonder the party rejected him."
But among many Democrats, Mr. Tsongas remains a respected political figure, and his comments are certain to add weight to the speculation about General Powell or a third-party challenge.
Opinion polls show voters are increasingly receptive to the idea of a third-party Presidential candidate. but there are enormous obstacles to such a candidate, not the least of which is the difficulty of getting public financing for his campaign.
Mr. Tsongas said he believed that General Powell has the moral authority that the President lacks.
"More than anything else, this country yearns for conviction," Mr. Tsongas said. "I meet people in my travels who have heard Powell speak. To listen to white middle-aged males talk about having been brought to tears by his unabashed, old-fashioned commitment to standards and values was surprising."
Mr. Tsongas said he would be unlikely to support Mr. Clinton in 1996 unless he abandoned his tax-cut proposals. He did not commit himself to General Powell, either, and said he could even end up backing a Republican. "I'd have to take a deep breath first," he said.
Mr. Tsongas had kind words for a fellow Massachusetts resident, Gov. William F. Weld, but said Mr. Weld's moderate stands on social issues would make him unpalatable to some of his fellow Republicans.
Mr. Tsongas also said he felt more comfortable with Republicans since he and former Senator Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, formed the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group devoted to eliminating the Federal deficit.
While he said he expected Ross Perot to run again in 1996 as an independent for President, Mr. Tsongas said there was "a glass ceiling on his potential for influence" after his poor performance in debating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Tsongas said he would have qualms about the social views of another Presidential prospect, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the incoming majority leader. "A Bob Dole has the courage on the economic side," he said, "but I would find it difficult to endorse someone who's not committed to social inclusion."

Baseball Braces for a Brave New World of Replacements

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The idea struck the general manager as absolutely ludicrous.
He was talking about replacement players, with whom major league owners are expected to try to stock their strikebound teams next spring, and he was asked how much clubs would have to pay them. 
 "I guess you'd have to offer them at least the minimum salary," said the general manager, who, like some others, spoke about the subject as long as he would not be named. "I really haven't given it much thought."
Well, he was asked, what would happen if three clubs sought the same replacement player? Would they get into a bidding war for him?
He paused for a second, then said, sounding a bit incredulous, "I never thought there'd be a bidding war on a replacement player."
Say hello to the bizarre new world of baseball. It's not the proposed new United League, but good old Major League Baseball, the folks who are mired in the longest strike in sports history and whose lineups of lawyers are becoming better known than their lineups of players.
Companies won't be printing collectible cards any time soon of Chuck O'Connor and Rob Manfred and Gene Orza and Lauren Rich, but they and their colleagues have been and will continue to be on television more often than Frank Thomas, Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds.
The coming confrontations before the National Labor Relations Board, in United States District Court and in the cloakrooms of Congress will be the focal point of the baseball world in coming weeks and months, but other matters soon will begin demanding attention.
Spring training, for example. And all the ramifications of that usually bucolic time of the calendar year and the sports schedule.
Only 53 days to pitchers' and catchers' reporting!
Somehow that cry clangs with a more dissonant tone than in other winters. Exactly which pitchers and catchers will they be? Will they be strike-breaking pitchers and catchers? Minor league pitchers and catchers? Over-the-hill pitchers and catchers? Park rats and sandlot kings?
They won't be Latin, Australian and Japanese pitchers and catchers because they won't be able to obtain visas to work in this country as long as they would be replacing striking pitchers and catchers.
But not so fast. Before the bizarre new world of baseball reaches that stage of what would then be a six-month-old strike, its leaders must make some decisions.
"Obviously, the clubs have said we want to have spring training," said Bud Selig, the acting commissioner. "There's no question we want to have spring training. Are there any specific plans, any master plan? No, there isn't. What form will it take? There is no master plan at this point. Will there be a season? Same thing."
But surely the owners didn't implement a salary cap simply as a testimonial to milliners. If they don't open camps and prepare to play the season, or at least try to play it, their action last Thursday night would be meaningless.
And if they open camps, they will need players to populate them so what about those replacement players, some of whom could trigger bidding wars?
"That's a subject that hasn't been discussed all along," Selig said. "That's not on the agenda to discuss at this point in time. I'm sure there are differing views, but we've had no formal or informal discussions."
Those deliberations, though, are coming to an operations committee meeting soon.
"We have to look at the format of the next 60-plus days and begin to understand what we have to do, obviously in uncharted waters," Selig said. "What we need is a 60- to 90-day schedule with all the ramifications very well thought out. That's something I'm sure we'll begin to look at next week and clearly after the first of year. We'll have something definitive early to mid-January."
While the owners study the immediate future on the field, representatives of striking players will scrutinize the new economic system -- the salary cap -- and other implemented elements of the new structure to determine if players should even sign contracts.
Union officials have advised players and agents to place a unilateral moratorium on signings until they can study all of the ramifications of the new system. If players do begin signing and the labor board or a court ultimately decides the salary cap was imposed improperly, they could reap a windfall of monetary damages as a remedy to the clubs' action.
Meanwhile, when they open spring camps, just about the time the N.L.R.B. could be issuing a complaint against the clubs based on the unfair labor practice charge the union will file Tuesday, owners will look for massive defections from striking players. But what they will probably need is a massive collection of replacement players. The general managers hope not.
"No general managers like the idea," one general manager said. "Myself included."
All of the general managers who were asked said they had not dwelled on the prospect of needing replacement players.
"We haven't gotten into it at all," said Lee Thomas of Philadelphia. "If I had to, I don't know how I'd do it. I haven't talked to many of the others about it. We haven't discussed it a whole lot. I don't think too many people feel good about it at all."
Herk Robinson of Kansas City said he didn't know if the recruitment of replacements would be feasible. "It's certainly not anybody's first choice, nor was the implementation," he added. "But certainly we'll abide by the direction of Major League Baseball and how they plan to go."
Another general manager speculated that when the time comes to seek replacements, clubs will look at old free-agent lists, the list of six-year minor league free agents and the telephone list of players who retired a year or two ago, voluntarily or otherwise.
"There might be some veteran players who see it as their last chance," he said. "They'd probably say: 'I don't have to worry about guys throwing at me. As soon as there's an agreement, I'll be released.' On other hand, a player might figure, 'If I show enough, I might be able to help the team. I'll gut it through for a year.' "
The prospect is not one managers eagerly await.
"I sympathized with all the N.F.L. coaches who went through the same type of thing," said Don Baylor of Colorado, referring to the 1987 season when National Football League teams used replacement players for three games. "Out of the replacement players, how many players are playing from that group -- a handful maybe. Football seems to have put that behind them as quickly as they could. What I look at is going into spring training with replacement players, and it's going to be a very difficult situation for everybody."
Bob Boone is the Royals' rookie manager, not far removed from playing himself.
"I think it's difficult, to say the least," the former catcher said of the use of replacements. "I don't think any of the things we're facing now as an industry are going to be easy. I don't know what the answers are right now. For me, it's too great to figure out. It's too great an exercise when there are too many intangibles. I don't have any control over any of it. Besides, I'd rather not think about it."
Baylor and Boone both were active in the union and in negotiations when they played. Now they, like other managers as well as coaches and trainers, face a dilemma. Those groups exist in a collective bargaining twilight zone. They are considered management, but they pay union dues so they can receive money from the union's product-licensing program.
Do they have a choice when camps open? One general manager, after all, said he heard that if they go into camp, they'll probably lose the licensing money. It comes to about $80,000 a year, less than a manager earns but slightly more than the average coach's salary and perhaps double a trainer's income.
The general manager noted that the union for some time has considered dropping those groups from the licensing program and this development could give them a ready reason for doing it.
"We are bound to manage," said Baylor, who was as loyal a union member as the union ever has had. "I believe the union understands that, that the manager and coaches don't have a choice in the matter. We have no vote whatsoever. We didn't take a strike vote. We pay our dues, but we're on the management side of it. It's a difficult position to be in when you have no vote."
Boone said there may have to be some soul-searching but added, "There's a lot of time. You don't have to think about it until you know what's really happening. But I don't think the union dues or the licensing is really a factor. The owner pays your salary so what are you going to do?"
Cam Bonifay, the Pittsburgh Pirates' general manager, said that while he understood the managers' plight, he didn't see anyone staying home.
"I'm sure there will be some mixed feelings," he said, "but they know they're employees of the clubs and that speaks for itself."
Another general manager didn't want to discuss that situation or, frankly, any other. Capturing the tenor of the times, he said, "I don't want to talk because this is going to be in the courts."

A Firebomb Unnerves A City of Subway Riders

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
It is New York's worst nightmare: a mad bomber roaming the city's subways, where 3.5 million riders squeeze each day in democratic discomfort. Last week it happened. A sheet of flame erupted in a crowded No. 4 train at the Fulton Street station, and more than 40 people were injured in the fire and the frenzied rush to escape. Three were critically burned, including a man accused of being the bomber, Edward J. Leary. The police said the firebomb apparently went off as he was preparing to leave it on the train; escaping with his trouser legs shredded and burns on his legs, hands and face, he tapped a policeman on the shoulder at the Clark Street station in Brooklyn and politely asked for an ambulance.
 The life of this unemployed 49-year-old computer expert, who proclaimed his innocence, was littered with frustration. 
 Reporters interviewing the neighbors of suspects almost invariably are told about "such a quiet person." This time there were descriptions like "weird" and "berserk." In his suburban New Jersey home, law enforcement officials said, were mayonnaise jars, 9-volt batteries, kitchen timers and gasoline -- materials like those in last week's firebomb and a blaze in a subway car the week before that badly burned two teenagers. Rambling, angry, hand-scrawled notes with drawings of firebombs outlined a bizarre extortion scheme, the police said.
 Even with a suspect under arrest, the city remained nervous; calls to the bomb squad rose sharply. JOHN KIFNER

HEADLINE: How to Tell Health Care From Toothpaste

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "While Congress Remains Silent, Health Care Transforms Itself" (front page, Dec. 18) quotes Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a market analyst, who likens health care to products such as "hotel rooms and toothpaste and automobiles." Calling the growth of health maintenance organizations "the corporatization of health care," Mr. Abramowitz asks, "What's wrong with that?" As his own analogy suggests, a lot. 
 This corporatization is widely seen as a way to bring market efficiencies to health care. However, besides health care, there is no realm of the economy in which people buy products by paying an insurance premium. There is a good reason for this: an insurance company's primary interest -- profit -- is best served by minimizing payments to policyholders.
 No one would willingly cede the ability to rent the hotel room he or she wants or to buy the car or toothpaste he or she prefers to an insurance company or any third party. To the extent that health care is a product like any other, the interests of buyers are best served when they can make choices about what they buy and when. But health care is not a product like any other.
 Society expects a uniformly high standard of medical care to be available when it is needed. Doctors and hospitals may be criticized for failing to live up to this standard in every case, but their efforts to do so partly account for the high cost of health care today.
 The potential sacrifices of saving money on most products are not equivalent to those of saving on medical care. One may regret a sleepless night on a lumpy bed in a cheap hotel room, but it hardly compares with the risks of undergoing complicated surgery at the hands of a surgeon with no experience in the procedure.
 We must not accept glib analyses in the health care debate that ignore the highly specific challenges involved in providing first-rate medical care.

HEADLINE: Parallel Worlds Collide in Mt. Kisco

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: MOUNT KISCO

 BODY:
ON a recent morning, a well-dressed woman stood at the counter of Starbucks, an upscale coffee bar here, choosing beans from Latin American countries. After some deliberation and a steaming cup of cappuccino, she bought a pound of Guatemala Antigua coffee for $9.25.
Two blocks down the same street, a group of men who also represent various Latin American countries stood against a fence, waiting to be picked up by construction and gardening trucks, which passed by looking for day laborers. On that day, three men -- also from Guatemala -- were chosen to work, at a rate of $6 an hour for an eight-hour day. 
 The parallel but contrasting scenes are representative of this changing northern Westchester town, where national chains like the Gap and Starbucks have opened stores and picked up a sagging commercial strip and where a rising tide of immigrants support a less visible -- and sometimes illegal -- economy. Hispanic immigrants are washing dishes in restaurants, cutting lawns and minding children.
But the two constituencies are colliding, and tensions have risen so much recently that Mayor Richard T. Roth established a task force, the Committee on Community Relations, to address residents' fears.
At the first meeting of the task force, many residents expressed ambivalence about Mount Kisco's newest inhabitants. On one hand, several bemoaned the exploitation of the immigrants by unscrupulous employers and landlords. On the other hand, many of the same residents complained about what they considered a declining quality of life in the village, citing incidents of public drunkenness, vandalism and crime.
Missing for the most part from the discussion were the more recently arrived Hispanic residents themselves, separated in large part by language and fear from the task force designed, in part, to improve their adaptation to the community.
The issue is not new to Mount Kisco nor the county. Mamaroneck, Yonkers, White Plains and Tarrytown have all seen an influx of Hispanic immigrants, along with resultant tensions. About 12 percent of Mount Kisco's population is from Latin America, according to the most recent United States census, up from 5 percent in 1980. What brought the issue to the forefront here was a letter published recently in The Patent Trader, the local newspaper, written by two long-time residents.
The residents, Linda Skiba and Beth Vetare Civitello, wrote: "The influx of illegal aliens is astounding. The problem of loitering in and around the downtown area has generated a feeling of discomfort so strong amongst taxpaying citizens that local businesses are suffering.
"The overwhelming amount of incidents that involve intoxicated persons should be alerting us to a major problem. Check the police records concerning arrests made involving Hispanics (for lack of a better term); undocumented or legal, either driving while intoxicated or throwing beer bottles or tearing street signs out of the ground or knifing one and another."
In closing their letter, Ms. Skiba and Mrs. Civitello, who also said that as women they felt unsafe walking past groups of Hispanic men, wrote, "We want our town back!"
The letter seemed to strike a nerve among residents, and letters flooded the newspaper, some commending the women's courage for putting into writing what had long been whispered about town, while others were appalled at what was described as the letter's ignorance and racism.
Mrs. Civitello acknowledged that she risked being labeled prejudiced but said in an interview that her letter had been misinterpreted. "There are people who agreed with our letter that totally misunderstood our point," she said. "I welcome new people, new cultures and new situations in town. Mount Kisco's diversity is one of the reasons we choose to live here. But I just want to make sure that everyone recognizes that if you choose to live here, like I've chosen to, you need to abide by the laws."
Other residents interpreted the comments differently.
"I was shocked by some of the statements being made by a variety of educated people," said Pedro Laureano, an academic adviser at Marist College in Poughkeepsie. "A lot of it is based on people's fear and internalized feelings, not on evidence.
"No one seems to be frightened by a large number of Latinos congregating in the kitchens of diners, or when five or six Latinos come to their house to mow their lawn or paint their house. But now it's a problem when they become part of your daily life, when they want to have a cappuccino in the mall? As a Latino foremost, hearing some of this was frightening."
Although the purpose of the first meeting of the Mayor's task force was to agree on a mission statement, the 12 panel members and about 30 members of the audience soon became entangled in discussing illegal immigration. Several residents said they wanted to know whether the committee intended to take steps to deport illegal aliens. Some comments echoed the sentiments codified in California's Proposition 187, which requires teachers and clinic doctors to deny help to undocumented aliens and report them to the police.
"People must be legal," said Annie Harper, owner of a real estate company. "I am a taxpayer, and I resent educating and feeding people that have no legal right to be in this country. I resent that they get free medical care while we have to pay. This is a question that has to be solved."
The Mayor and the Police Chief, Robert Martini, said they had in the past contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service to little avail. They said immigration was a Federal, not a local, problem.
"If the borders aren't controllable in the United States, how am I suppose to control the borders of Mount Kisco?" Mr. Roth said.
What percentage of the population is illegal is not known. Betty Urrutia, president of Organizacion Hispana here, estimated that about half the Hispanic residents were legal. She said that 60 percent of the Hispanic residents are Guatemalan and most of them have work permits, having been granted political asylum. An additional 35 percent are Equadoreans, she said, and the remaining 5 percent are from a variety of Latin American countries.
Ms. Urrutia, a task-force member, spoke of hardships facing immigrants. She said she knew of several situations in which two-bedroom apartments were packed with 10 to 15 people, each charged rent of $200 a month. She also cited employers who hired immigrants without work permits, paid them for a week or two and then promised future wages. When the workers eventually asked for the back pay, Ms. Urrutia said, the employers demanded work permits and refused to make good on the wages.
"These people are very abused and they have to take it because they don't have a choice," Mrs. Urrutia said. "They come to this country because they need to support their families and feed their children. Many Americans feel very frustrated and very threatened, but they need to open their eyes with more compassion. We are just human beings."
The village of Mount Kisco has conducted housing raids in the past when they had reason to suspect overcrowding. One member of the audience asked why the Mayor could not conduct random sweeps of houses, to which Mr. Roth replied: "This is America. You need a search warrant."
Robert Knorr, a contractor and task-force member, described the group as a pre-disaster committee. "If we have seven or eight guys die in a fire, this committee would have a very different slant," he said.
The committee will continue to meet over the winter with subcommittees studying ordinances, housing, crime and economic and other issues.

HEADLINE: A Shelter When Feelings Halt Learning

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
A SECOND GRADER, three weeks into the school year, breaks down when confronted with a reading test. The next day he refuses to go to school. Even with the support of his teachers and the presence of his mother in an adjoining classroom, he breaks down.
A 14-year-old's disruptive behavior occurs so frequently that his teachers are forced to evict him from the classroom. Despite his high I.Q., he is attending school less and less and his learning is halted. 
 With the help of concerned parents and teachers, both youngsters were eventually enrolled in the special education program of the Putnam and Northern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services at the Learning Center at Walden in Yorktown Heights. Connie and James Keeler, parents of the second grader, said the move turned life around for their son, Kevin.
"After much testing, Kevin was diagnosed with an auditory processing problem, which meant that the traditional methods of teaching rendered him incapable of learning," Mrs. Keeler said. "It was extremely frustrating. When the Walden program was recommended to us, Kevin didn't want to even go on the bus. He had such a negative image of himself at school. However, once he started, he made the adjustment."
The whole environment at Walden, Mrs. Keeler said, "is so supportive and the academic demands on Kevin were reduced so that little by little, he began to react favorably."
The Board of Cooperative Educational Services is a pooling of resources that makes economic sense. It is a link between 18 school districts of northern Westchester and Putnam Counties that offers programs that would be too costly and fragmented for each district to handle alone. Individual districts take part on a cost-sharing basis. They are reimbursed by the state at 35 to 60 percent of what they spend for most services.
The Learning Center at Walden is a school for emotionally disabled children from kindergarten through 12th grade, said T. Mark Costello, the board's director of special education in northern Westchester and Putnam Counties. Currently, Walden's Learning Center has 130 students who get individual attention, counseling and support as they make academic progress.
"Our goal is to return our students at Walden to their home schools as soon as possible," Mr. Costello said. "It is in the regular, unsegregated environment that we believe youngsters learn the social skills that allow them to get along with other people in life."
Mr. Costello, who has been working in special education for 30 years, drew the blueprint for the concept of cooperative boards. In 1973, he wrote the law for special education in New York State.
"The law emphasizes that programs be designed to get kids back into the mainstream in the least restrictive environment as quickly as possible," he said. "And it is to that end that the efforts of the 275 people on the Walden staff are focused."
Classes at Walden are small: 8 to 10 students. "Instruction is given on a one-to-one basis," Mr. Costello said. "Each child has his or her own individual education plan that all the pupils, teachers and counselors and tutors work with. It's student needs that drive the program."
Mr. Keeler said: "The teachers at Walden are extraordinary. They were always available to us after school or on weekends. Whenever we had any sort of problem we could get counseling immediately."
As for Kevin's progress, Mrs. Keeler said: "It was a slow process. After Kevin was diagnosed, new methods were implemented to help him learn. Parallel techniques utilizing different parts of the brain in the thinking process helped him get eventually to the same place."
Kevin is now 10. "His one and a half years at Walden also improved his self-image to the point where now of his own accord he selected three after-school activities to participate in this semester," Mrs. Keeler said. "Spanish, junior naturalist and after-school sports. He was always good in math, but now his reading average is 2.5 on a 4-point scale, and what is so important is that he has a good opinion of himself. I can't praise the staff at Walden enough. We still go to the parent support meetings, and we're active at the school. We like to talk to parents who have had the same experiences as ours."
The capabilities of students at Walden vary, said David J. Zurhellen, supervisor of the program and principal of the Walden School. "Our students are emotionally disturbed, not mentally retarded," he said. "Their I.Q.'s range from low average to very high. But their disabilities make them incapable of benefiting from traditional teaching methods and the environment of the mainstream schools." Walden, he emphasized, is academically based. "Academics are very important here," he said. "The environment is always consistent so students know what to expect. Each has a counselor who works with him on his individual plan." The program, he said, is flexible, and changes are made according to need. When asked about the success rate, Mr. Zurhellen said: "It is high. On the average, only one student a year will fail to return to the home school."
As for cost, the estimate is that it costs $30,000 a student a year at Walden, compared with $12,000 at a mainstream school, said Mr. Zurhellen. He said that it is money well spent "if you look at the alternatives."
"Left alone, these are kids who would most likely drop out of school and become society's dependents for the rest of their lives," he added. "Walden is a turning-around point for them and helps them become productive members of society."
Jonathan Cummings, 17, now a senior at Lakeland High School, is looking forward to college next fall. But a few years back, when he was 14, he was so unhappy in school and his behavior was so disruptive, that he was constantly banned from the classroom.
"Jonathan didn't fit the mold," said his father, Ron Cummings. "He is very intelligent, outspoken and impatient. His behavior showed that there was obviously something wrong." In the ninth grade, Jonathan enrolled in the Walden program.
"I cannot speak highly enough about the school and the teachers," Mr. Cummings said. "They knew better than we did what Jonathan needed. His teacher, Jack Jones, was consistent, a disciplinarian and on duty 24 hours a day. Teachers at Walden don't stop when they leave school after class. Walden made the most tremendous difference in Jonathan's life."
As for Jonathan's reaction, he said: "I was very unhappy at my school. "I hated it. All I wanted to do was outsmart my teachers and act up. I didn't want to go to Walden either, but as it turned out, the experience I had there was the best 18 months of my life. My teacher, Jack Jones, turned me on to school. I look forward to it now and to college next year."

The Beard Is Real. The Joy Is Real. (Shhh: So Is He.)

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif.

 BODY:
IT's debated in every household. Various films grapple with the issue -- from "The Santa Clause" to "Miracle on 34th Street." It's clearly time to put this raging controversy to rest.
Yes, there is in fact a Santa Claus, though -- don't breathe a word! -- he sometimes goes by the name Brady White. (For simplicity's sake, and to avoid offending non-believers, we'll just call him Mr. White.) 
 Even without his Santa costume, Mr. White often has trouble passing for a civilian. Carolyn H. Cobb recalls seeing a boy spotting Mr. White at a Texas mall and saying, "Look, Mommy -- Santa's on vacation." Even in red shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, he was instantly recognizable.
"I don't think he's an impersonator," said Ms. Cobb, publicity manager for Neiman-Marcus, one of many stores that prize Mr. White's services. "I think he's Santa Claus. I send him my list every year."
He has, in his chosen field, all the right stuff -- the ruddy complexion, the 50-inch waistline, the chest-length ivory beard. On top of that, Mr. White has the sweet-tempered, comic disposition to somehow remain in character virtually every waking hour. Even in street clothes, he can hardly eat at a restaurant or walk through a hotel lobby without being interrupted, typically by an adult with a gift request.
All this has made him one of the nation's most sought-after Santas. Two weeks ago, the famed Beverly Hills Hotel made a last-minute request for a Christmas Eve appearance, but of course he was long since booked up. But he's busy the rest of the year, too: celebrity parties, gift shows in February, shooting catalogues in August, filming commercials any time.
So precious is his image that his beard is insured by Lloyd's of London -- for an amount in the six figures, which is as specific as he would get. "It's enough to take care of the reindeer," he said. Why insure it? Simple: "Going up and down all those chimneys, it could get singed."
Mr. White, once an unemployed actor from Rhode Island, now mixes with all manner of celebrities, from Pope John Paul II to Madonna. He has been photographed in the Swiss Alps and other North Pole-like locations in the company of beautiful models swathed in furs.
"I never, ever dreamed this would be my career," Mr. White said in an interview at the Bowers Museum here in Orange County, which is badly in need of Santa these days. His appearance here was one of the 18 he has made since Thanksgiving at charity events and client parties for his No. 1 client, the jeweler Cartier.
THIS Santa with a flair for promotion and a quick wit has a client list as long as a Christmas stocking.
His blue eyes twinkle in television ads for Cool Whip and the Postal Service. He gave life to "Santa Calls," a Christmas Eve adventure story by William Joyce put on at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York and broadcast to other stores. Clad in diving fins and red swimming trunks, he poised pool side at a Dallas hotel to introduce Neiman-Marcus's famed his-and-her Christmas gift.
But while glitz and glamour frame most of Mr. White's life, he says he is most gratified by bringing good cheer to the elderly, whom he finds to be particularly neglected during the holidays. He has first-hand experience. For three years, he spent a lot of time caring for his 82-year-old mother, who had Alzheimer's disease and died in September. He fits free visits to old-age homes and hospitals into his itinerary throughout the year, he said.
Clearly, Mr. White has found his calling. But "if this didn't happen to me," he said, "I don't know where I'd be."
Mr. White fits a classic entrepreneurial mold, said Jon P. Goodman, director of the University of Southern California's Entrepreneur Program -- the "wannabes who discover they can take a talent and turn it into money."
While there is little chance Santa will fall from popularity, Mr. White does face competitive risks and some unusual business pressures, Ms. Goodman said. But she did note that "he's got to spend a lot of effort maintaining his image and his connections."
With trappings like a red Mercedes with "SANTA" plates and a thick gold Cartier watch, Mr. White does generate some resentment, Ms. Goodman said. "Many of us are ambivalent about an economic system that rewards weirdos."
Like many entrepreneurs, Mr. White cashed in on serendipity. Twelve years ago, Mr. White was an out-of-work Los Angeles actor nine months behind on his rent. In desperation, he donned a red suit and phony beard for a Beverly Hills mall. He was discovered by The Herald Examiner, which polled children to find the best Santa in Los Angeles. The children chose him because, they said, he was unlike any other Santa because he was hip. He knew, for instance, the hot rock group of the day, Duran Duran.
A talent agent who came to the mall to see the top Santa in action suggested to Mr. White that he quit shaving. He did. By the next season, he was on his way to being the ultimate Santa, even starting to fill out his 34-inch waistline.
And taking home bigger paychecks. At the mall he got $4.50 an hour; it went to $5 after The Herald's page-1 story. Soon it took off into the heavens.
For his first big commercial job, for Neiman-Marcus's fur catalogue, he earned $4,000. It was shot in Munich's town square, where Mr. White, who is 6 foot 2, was mobbed by Japanese tourists and had to be rescued by a police car. It was Mr. White's first brush with celebrity, and he quickly got another when he was put up at the Hotel Kempinski and overheard Luciano Pavarotti practicing in a neighboring room.
He's showered with the perks of fame. "They make a deal, like I'm somebody," Mr. White said. "It's not Brady White. It's Santa who has all the free upgrades."
He can command $4,000 for an evening these days, but that once soared as high as $80,000 for six hours' work in a New York studio shooting a television commercial (he will not name the client). What kind of yearly pay does this add up to? He declined to say, except to remark, "It feeds the reindeer and the elves and keeps Santa in Cartier jewelry."
Mr. White is much in demand on the celebrity circuit, where he has earned the nickname "Santa to the Stars." During Pope John Paul's 1987 visit to Los Angeles, Mr. White was granted the security clearance to greet the Pontiff at a helicopter landing pad. "Santee, I like what you do for the children," the Pope told Mr. White. "He didn't sit on my lap." But then he added: "Madonna did. She asked to be a virgin. I told her Santa can't work miracles."
 Santa stays au courant. Mr. White does a holiday rap tune. He sings a "Jingle Bells" parody adored by children: "Jingle bells. Batman smells. Robin laid an egg. Batmobile lost a wheel, and Joker got away." He knows all about Power Rangers, Polly Pocket and American Girl dolls.
Not that he has to do research: he picks up news of the latest toy sensation from his lap. (City girls ask for Cartier diamonds; city boys ask for small-scale Ferraris.)
He has learned a few tricks of the trade. Mr. White, who declined to give his age but appears to be in his mid-40's, regularly gets a B-12 shot and flu vaccinations before Thanksgiving to head off the sneezing lot soon to be gazing up into his whiskered face. Also for health reasons, he wears white gloves on the job.
With children, as with Madonna, he is careful never to raise expectations. At the Bowers Museum, a pig-tailed girl in a red sweater asked him for a pet. Mr. White furrowed his white eyebrows and inclined his head while looking intently into her face. "A puppy might be kind of cold in the sleigh," he said. Crestfallen, her shoulders drooped. He leaned down and gave her a reassuring kiss on the cheek.
HE has 27 Santa suits -- made by Adele's of Hollywood and San Francisco's Bay Area Display -- acquired over the years to fit his clients' varied needs. There is motorcycle Santa, who wears custom-made Harley-Davidson boots. There is patriotic Santa, who looks a lot like Uncle Sam. There is Aloha Santa, in red flip-flops and a grass skirt.
During his visit here, Mr. White wore a traditional red velvet Santa suit embellished with a fancy Nordic twist. Besides rabbit fur trim, a braid of seed pearls and silver beads ran down the sleeves.
Mr. White, who is not married, grew up in Pawtucket, R.I. and briefly attended a seminary, Our Lady of Providence. After enrolling in a local junior college and a New York theater school, he headed West. He began making connections with celebrities while working at the Roxy, a Los Angeles night club. He did celebrity gossip on "AM Los Angeles," a local morning talk show.
Now, he said, about 25 percent of his time is spent pitching new clients or auditioning. Other clients have included gift shows, specialty Christmas boutiques and a mall developer that needed a Santa school for its malls.
It is easy to see why Mr. White is in demand. "If you book him at 9 he's ready to shoot at 9:10," said Guilio Ghiro, art director for the retailer Lord & Taylor, which featured Mr. White in its holiday "Tops" catalogue. "You don't even need makeup. He doesn't have to act. He personifies Santa."
"Other guys look the part but don't know what they are doing," said Elaine Rafferty, senior art director for the department store Macy's, which last year hired Mr. White for a print ad in which he held a camcorder. "He's like a professional model," she said, anticipating the pose and holding equipment so the brand name is revealed.
"There's no one I've ever seen that quite fits the part as he does," said Michael L. Campbell, promotions director for the mall owner New England Development Inc. of Boston. The company hired Mr. White to train St. Nicks for its malls in 1989.
In the classes, Mr. White revealed his own strategies for preserving Santa's image "that put children at ease and create magic for them," he said. For example, Santas never excuse themselves to go the restroom; breaks are needed to feed the reindeer. Santa always appears omniscient by learning a child's name beforehand through an assistant.
Mr. White plays favorites with early clients. His only mall appearance these days is in the Olde Mistick Village in Mystic, Conn., where he annually makes a two-day stop the day after Thanksgiving.
Nearly 300 children line up each day to see him. The wait can be 90 minutes. "He carries on a little conversation with each one," said Christine Robertson, the mall's office manager. "He winks at the moms," she said, and the children stroke his coat and beard.
After the last child has gone, Mr. White relaxes a bit, lighting a cigarette or name-dropping about his latest gig. "It's almost a letdown," Ms. Robertson said, chuckling at her own childlike impulse to believe in the holiday myth. "He's a very good actor."
But of course he isn't acting.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Termed Highly Unlikely For Westchester

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
A DAY after well-to-do Orange County in California filed for bankruptcy protection, Stephen V. Reitano, Westchester's Finance Commissioner, fired off a press release. From his offices in the county seat, Mr. Reitano said that what happened a continent away could never happen here.
 "Our investment policy has been and is purposefully conservative," Mr. Reitano said, adding that Westchester law allows only nonspeculative investments. 
By contrast, Orange County, which Mr. Reitano called "the Westchester of California" -- gambled public money on high-risk, rate-sensitive investments known as derivatives, and although it realized a higher rate of return for a time, in the end the county just south of Los Angeles County took a loss.
 The Dec. 6 announcement of bankruptcy marked the largest municipal failure of all time. It involved rated municipal bonds, which are generally considered one of the safest investments in the country.
 In Orange County officials borrowed for the short term at low interest rates in order to invest long term at higher rates. But when rates began rising sharply earlier this year, the county was forced to pay back the short-term debt at higher rates.
 Investments in derivatives -- whose value is based on or derived from an underlying asset, like a bond or a currency -- ultimately cost Orange County, the home of Disneyland and the California Angels, more than $2 billion on its $20 billion portfolio.
 By contrast, analysts in Manhattan say, Westchester's finances and its $336.8 million portfolio as of Nov. 30 come as close to being fail-safe as that of any municipality in the country. About $74.8 million is invested in fully collateralized certificates of deposit; $168.8 million is invested in repurchase agreements with primary dealers that are designated by the Federal Reserve, and $93.2 million is in Treasury bills and notes. Jim Lebenthal, chairman of Lebenthal & Company, a bond underwriter whose clients include Westchester, described the county as pristine.
 Once things began to go wrong in Orange County, some investment banks threatened to cut off its credit, and lenders demanded repayment of $1.2 billion in loans. Just before the county announced that it would file for bankruptcy, Robert L. Citron, the County Treasurer for 24 years, resigned. The bankruptcy has affected 187 school districts, cities and agencies that had millions of dollars invested in the county fund. They were caught short, unable to meet their bills because the county could no longer return principal or interest to the fund's participants. Some expenditures like highway construction may be placed on hold, and public schools and health clinics could run out of money for salaries.
 Orange County also defaulted on Series B pension-obligation bonds, although individual pensioners will not be affected, analysts said.
 It is unlikely that such a scenario could happen in Westchester, though. One reason is that separate municipalities do not contribute to Westchester's investment pool. In Orange County, the municipalities were required by law to do so. Also, the investment policy of Westchester, like other municipalities in the state, is governed by state law, which limits the types of investments that can be made and prohibits derivatives.
 Westchester is top rated AAA by major rating concerns, the only such rating in the state and one of fewer than a dozen nationwide. Nassau and Suffolk Counties, by comparison, are both rated by Moody's as Baa1, meaning they have medium-grade investments, neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
 AAA is "the best, with the smallest degree of investment risk," said Veronica L. Wheeler, manager of the public-rating desk of Moody's Investors Service. "It's gilt edged."
 Orange County was rated AA, but spokesmen for bond raters would not comment on why they failed to see that it was headed for trouble.
 "We were rating the quality of the bonds that the county issued, not its investment portfolio," said Karen Krop, an assistant vice president at Moody's. "We're not commenting on the financial management, and at this point, we're trying to avoid pointing fingers."
 Some officials who were interviewed blamed Mr. Citron, the Orange County Treasurer who advocated investments in derivatives.
 In Suffolk County, John C. Cochrane, the County Treasurer, said, "The bottom line is that we do not invest one penny in derivatives."
 Mr. Reitano said that Westchester's conservative approach notwithstanding, he remains vigilant -- especially in light of Orange County's failures. "You never know in this business," he said. "It is what Will Rogers used to say: 'It's not the return on my money that I worry about. It's the return of my money.' "
 He also said that while Orange County was probably realizing as much as 7 or 8 percent on its investments before short-term interest rates increased, Westchester earns only 4 or 5 percent.
 In a review of Westchester by Fitch Investors Service, the county was described as continuing "to possess the highest-quality credit. Financial performance remains strong, with good balances achieved to meet future needs and unexpected fluctuations in economically sensitive areas."
 Fitch said Westchester's strengths include its diverse and wealthy economic base, its modest debt levels and capital needs and its excellent financial management and planning procedures. Debt per capita is considered above average at $1,703, but the report said that was balanced by other factors -- namely a rapid rate of debt retirement.
 The report also says that despite the levels of poverty found in parts of Westchester, the county remains the second wealthiest per capita in the state --after New York County (Manhattan) -- and one of the richest in the country. At $34,843 in 1992, per capita personal income was 146 percent above the average for the state and 173 percent above the average for the United States.
 The county requires that its funds be placed in New York State-approved investments only, like United States treasury bills, bonds and notes, or in debt obligations of New York State or its municipalities.
 The county has issued $50,967,401.80 in bonds this year, which will pay 4.75 percent on a maturity date of Nov. 15, 1995, and 6.35 percent in 2009 for its general-obligation current-interest bonds. The issue is being used to finance several projects, including modernization of the terminal at the County Airport, equipment for the County Medical Center and reconstruction of parts of the Bronx River Parkway.
 Mr. Reitano said Westchester employs a pooled investment strategy, using various sources of county money to obtain an optimally high interest rate. "My job is making sure the money is in the right place at the right time," he said. "I don't want it sitting around idly."
 William R. Howell, a managing director at Prudential Securities, which markets bonds for the county, described Westchester as being in "the most conservative client" category.
 "Even if they were less conservative, they would still be safe," he said.

HEADLINE: At Soup Kitchens, Demand Rises, But Supplies and Funds Are Low

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY 

 BODY:
OFFICIALS at nonprofit organizations that care for the poor say they are having a hard time keeping pace with the demand for food this winter. A Federal emergency food program has been drastically cut, and holiday donations of food and money are somewhat down from last year. At the same time, requests for perishable and nonperishable food items are up substantially.
Several organizations say the new demand is coming from pockets of rural as well as urban poverty. Most of the increase, said Pattie Apgar, director of the Northwest Community Action Program in Phillipsburg, consists of "working people who either don't have a job or have one that pays them minimum wage -- people who never imagined they would need a service like ours." 
 Ms. Apgar, whose food bank is the major supplier for the poor in Warren, Hunterdon and Sussex Counties, added, "We have never had so little food available in our warehouse."
Kathleen Di Chiara, director of the Hillside-based Community Food Bank of New Jersey, which supplies 1,200 charitable organizations, said: "There are a lot of people in the state who have not been touched by the economic recovery yet. And there is less cash among groups fighting hunger and homelessness because corporate giving and government grants are down. The thing that we have been hearing from emergency food pantries is that they are afraid of having to turn people away."
In Bergen County, the pinch is being felt by the Inter-Religious Fellowship for the Homeless, which is made up of 240 congregations. "They are all hurting and have had to cut back on their budgets," said Kathleen J. Stanton, director of the fellowship, which, in conjunction with the Community Action Program of Hackensack, provides meals for hundreds of people each day at shelters and a soup kitchen in Hackensack.
An estimated total of 750,000 residents live below the poverty level, and meals are served at some 100 soup kitchens in the state. About 900 food pantries are operating in church and synagogue basements and at other sites, and many individual churches and small charities also regularly feed the poor.
The United States Department of Agriculture's Emergency Food Assistance Program has been a long-standing supplier of protein-rich foodstuffs like cheese, butter, peanut butter and canned meats.
But last September the program's national food-specific financing was reduced by Congress from $80 million to $25 million, and as a result New Jersey is receiving only 20 percent of the high-protein items it received last year, said Ms. Di Chiara of the Food Bank.
"This cutback has put a lot of pressure on private agencies such as ours to make up the difference," said Evelyn Benton, director of the Food Bank's office in Pleasantville, which serves Atlantic City. But donations to the food banks are down 11 percent from last year, she said.
Liz Thomases, director of volunteer services at Food Bank headquarters in Hillside, said that a special public plea for 4,000 turkeys last month fell short by 1,500.
The Community Food Bank of New Jersey is a branch of the Chicago-based Second Harvest, a private, nationwide nonprofit group. Last year, the New Jersey operation received $1 million from the sale of its food at 14 cents per pound. Another $1 million was raised through financial contributions.
A spokesman at the Salvation Army's state headquarters in Union, Spencer Scott, said that food supplies at the organization's 24 centers were adequate to meet the demands of Christmas but would be depleted this week because of increasing demand. "Need knows no season, and Christmas is just when we start to get busy," Mr. Scott said.
Despite the shortages, the work goes on. In Hackensack, for example, 5,000 soup kitchen and shelter volunteers are serving the city's 4,300 homeless. But as in much of the state, the homeless are not the majority of the soup kitchen population. Working poor and single parents with children have become regulars, officials in Hackensack said.
In Vineland, a city surrounded by rich farmlands, four soup kitchens have been opened since 1991 by Spirit and Truth Ministries, a multidenominational urban ministry that serves the poor. The kitchens operate at a different host church from Monday to Thursday, and the guests include migrant farm workers.
Rich McGlynn, the founder and director of the ministries, said contributions to his group had declined this year. As a result, plans for a fifth soup kitchen to better serve the city's large Spanish-speaking population have been held up since last spring.
Diane Carl, Spirit and Truth's soup kitchen administrator, said a 22 percent increase in attendance during the last fiscal year, ending Oct. 1, had put a strain on the ministry, which also experienced a decline of up to 50 percent in some of its larger private contributions.
"Only 37 percent of what it takes to run the four kitchens comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency," Ms. Carl said. In the last year, she added, "we served 12,850 meals, helped clothe hundreds of destitute people and transported others to shelters and places like drug and alcohol detox centers -- all for a grand total of $27,100."
In Newark, recovering destitute alcoholics from a Salvation Army rehabilitation center are riding at night with canteen truck volunteers to point out the remote hideouts of the homeless. Some 300 to 400 homeless people are being fed each night from the Army's mobile canteen.
"We have noticed that when the weather is cold, few of the homeless are on the streets," said Capt. Raphael Jackson, head of the Army's Newark district. "But when the canteen truck stops at the right place on the west side, or down by Penn Station, it is mobbed by people coming out of abandoned apartment buildings and factories."
Sometimes, Captain Jackson said, "the men on the truck, who are only one step away from homelessness themselves, can encourage their old friends to come out of the cold and get help."
In addition to several thousand dollars from an annual Federal Emergency Management grant and $50,000 from its own budget, the meals in Newark require donations, which Captain Jackson said "are requiring more legwork this year."
Brenda Beavers, director of social services for the Salvation Army's New Jersey operations, said that regular stationary feeding sites operated by the organization were in Elizabeth, Plainfield, Montclair, Passaic, Hackensack and Dover. A special feeding program for the elderly is sponsored by the Salvation Army in Camden, she said.
Many of the poor and homeless in Hackensack are being fed at a soup kitchen operated by the Inter-Religious Fellowship for the Homeless. Dorothy Marcus, the feeding program coordinator, said volunteers from various faiths take turns cooking dinner and breakfast at the individual churches, then deliver the meals to the feeding site at 214 State Street, operated by the local Community Action Program, a nonprofit group that exists on government funds and private donations.
Breakfast and dinner are served at the soup kitchen seven days a week to more than 200 people each day. Meals for an additional 100 homeless and transitional homeless in the Fellowship's shelters are also prepared daily. The fellowship's entire program is run with three paid staff members on a $200,000 annual budget, which does not include about $600,000 worth of food donations and volunteer hours.
 
'People Accepted Me'
IN a Spirit and Truth soup kitchen in Vineland recently, Glenn Mancini, 40, reminisced about his reliance on soup kitchens all over the state, and the changes they have made in his life.
Originally from Passaic County, Mr. Mancini said he had "done time" in county prisons in Passaic and Cumberland Counties for minor theft and fraud offenses stemming from a 15-year addiction to heroin and cocaine.
His life began to turn around a year ago, he said, when he was released from the Cumberland County jail and began frequenting the feeding programs. He also often volunteers to help at the soup kitchen.
"People there accepted me, prayed for me and called me brother," he said. "They helped me find a place to live and took me to doctor appointments and church. What made the difference was God and the love and nurturing I got."
Mr. Mancini said that he had been free of his addiction for about a year and that he has seen others come from jail and other tough circumstances receive the encouragement they needed at the soup kitchens.
He is now employed in the construction business and lives at a private halfway house.

The Economy
 
The many predictions of a strong holiday shopping season were apparently wishful thinking for many retailers, particularly in apparel. Early indications are that the season's sales, while better than last year's, have not been what the retailers hoped for. Many shoppers held off until just before Christmas, forcing merchants to cut prices. The extent of the markdowns implied a desperation not seen since the low points of the recent recession. [Page 1.]
 

Trying to reduce the temptation for employees to take bribes, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service has decided to stop issuing work cards in district offices, instead mailing them to immigrants from one or two central offices. Because the cards can be used to obtain driver's licenses, Social Security cards and other documents used to demonstrate citizenship, they can be valuable items on the black market. [12.]
 
International
 
After losing billions of dollars in Mexico last week, investors asked if the peso devaluation would set off a series of damaging devaluations throughout Latin America. The short-term answer appears to be no, even in Brazil and Argentina, which are thought to have overvalued currencies. [55.]
 
The steep decline in the value of the peso has resulted in a potential loss of roughly $8 to $10 billion for American investors in Mexican stocks and bonds, Wall Street experts estimated. American owners of Mexican stocks took the biggest hit, suffering both the devaluation's effect and from falling stock prices. [55.]
 
The collapse of China's bid to join the World Trade Organization suggests that the country's Communist Party leaders might not have given trade negotiators the authority to compromise. Some Western diplomats saw a strong resemblance between China's approach to the talks and its successful strategy last spring to persuade President Clinton to put trade with China ahead of U.S. concerns about the nation's human rights record. [55.]
 
Japan's electronics industry, creeping back from a long slump, has registered an increase in production in 1994 for the first time in three years. But the gain resulted mainly from strong shipments to the United States and Asia of computer parts, not a surge in demand for consumer electronics. Production of consumer-electronics equipment in Japan fell nearly 9.7 percent. [55.]
 
The Media Business
 
This holiday season, "A Christmas Carol," the newest challenger to the Radio City Music Hall's Christmas show, has been drawing big audiences to the Paramount auditorium at Madison Square Garden. But the production is expected to lose money unless it can win acceptance as a New York holiday perennial. [55.]
 
James Warren, The Chicago Tribune's new bureau chief in Washington, has won few fans among journalists working there. Small wonder: His columns rail about "the ethical cesspool of Washington journalism," describing what he believes to be the spoiled-brat nature of some star news professionals. [57.]

HEADLINE: Mexican Shock, but Latin Optimism

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
In 1982, Mexico failed to honor its foreign debt payments, setting off a traumatic series of Latin American defaults that caused the 1980's to be called the region's "lost decade."
Last week, investors asked if Mexico's peso devaluation, which exceeded 28 percent before the currency rebounded slightly on Friday, would lead to a damaging series of devaluations throughout Latin America, now the world's second-fastest-growing regional economy after Asia. 
 The short-term answer is no.
"This Mexican shock will not take the region with it as it did in 1992," said Miguel Angel Broda, an Argentine economist, on Friday. "This earthquake will be slowly overcome. Sophisticated investors are learning to see the differences between Argentina and Mexico."
The markets appeared to agree. Latin America's major stock exchanges, after faltering badly during the week, rebounded Friday -- led by a 3 percent jump at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, the region's largest. In New York, traders pushed up the prices of all Latin American debt, except for Mexico's. And of the 40 Latin stocks whose American depository receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 25 rose in value, 8 fell and 7 were unchanged.
"By now, financial experts have learned that there is significant diversity throughout Latin America," said Sebastian Edwards, the World Bank's chief economist for the region. "People have to avoid the herd instinct that was very damaging in 1982. There is not really a solid reason to sell off in one country because of what happens in another country."
But after losing billions of dollars in Mexico last week, investors are indeed looking with a more skeptical eye at two other Latin giants thought to have overvalued currencies -- Brazil and Argentina. In both countries, exporters are putting pressure on the governments to devalue their currencies to more internationally competitive levels.
The Mexican peso had been severely undermined by a record trade deficit for 1994 approaching $30 million. With imports flooding into the country, Mexico's foreign-currency reserves plummeted this year from $25 billion to $6.5 billion, barely enough to cover two months of imports. Brazil, by contrast, has $43 billion in reserves and a $11.5 billion trade surplus.
"Any parallel with the Brazilian situation would be completely groundless," Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's leading financial newspaper, wrote on Friday in an editorial titled, "The Mexican Lesson."
Argentina, more vulnerable, has $17 billion in reserves and a $6 billion trade deficit. Measured against the gross national product, Argentina's budget deficit is about one-third the size of Mexico's.
Two factors stand against an immediate devaluation of the Argentine peso, which is linked by law to the United States dollar. For President Carlos Saul Menem, who is campaigning for re-election in May, it would be political suicide to tinker with the exchange rate, a cornerstone of his inflation policy. In addition, the exchange rate can only be changed by a vote in Congress, a long and inevitably noisy process that would give foreign investors plenty of time to pull out of the Buenos Aires stock market.
On Thursday, Mr, Menem and his Economy Minister, Domingo Cavallo, held a televised news conference to underline their determination to stick to their foreign-exchange policy. "We are not Mexico and we will not devalue -- Argentina will not alter its course," vowed Mr. Menem, who had radically slashed Argentina's budget deficit after becoming President in 1989. "There will not a devaluation. Totally to the contrary -- we are going to deepen the adjustment measures."
In Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is to be inaugurated as President on Jan. 1, met with his economic team and said, "In Brazil, there is no hypothesis that calls for a currency devaluation."
Both leaders said they planned to use "Mexico's warning" as a club to demand legislative support next year for budget austerity.
For Brazil to reach Mr. Cardoso's 1995 goals of 5 percent growth and 25 percent inflation, down from about 50 percent now, he will need cooperation from Congress to slash state spending and encourage more investment from abroad. With imports surging into Brazil, the trade surplus is expected to drop in half next year, pushing the nation's current-account deficit, the broadest measure of trade, from $1 billion this year to $10 billion in 1995. In November, Brazil recorded its first monthly trade deficit in seven years.
"A yellow light has switched on, warning Brazil that it cannot go from mega-surpluses to mega-deficits in trade," said Carlos Langoni, a former president of the nation's central bank. "The great Mexican lesson is the importance of maintaining reasonably balanced trade over the next few years."
For foreign investors, the Mexican devaluation also offers a reminder of the risks of emerging markets and of the propensity of politicians to betray their promises. "Mexico's officials were perceived as the most credible in Latin America," Lars Schonander, Latin American economist for Baring Securities in New York, said. "Their word was good. Now their word is not good. Where does that leave Brazil, a country with an appalling record of economic plans going up in flames?"
Seeking lessons on Latin America from Mexico, analysts also look at issues of political stability.
In the last year, Mexico has undergone a guerrilla revolt in Chiapas state and the assassinations of the ruling party's president and presidential candidate. But of the region's other leading countries, political instability seems only to threaten Venezuela, a nation with a shrinking economy and jumping inflation.
In the next six months, voters in Peru and Argentina are expected to re-elect Presidents who have put their nation's economies on high-growth, low-inflation tracks. Earlier this year, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, a free-market politician, was inaugurated as President in Chile, a country that is turning last year's trade deficit into a surplus this year.
Mr. Cardoso is to take office as Brazil's first President in recent times with a Congressional majority and the support of virtually all major state governors.
Last week, some Latin America fund managers in the United States sold Brazil positions to cover Mexico losses, in order to record year-end profits. But even as Mexico's market slipped, many analysts in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, remained bullish about prospects there.
"Bad for Mexico -- Good for Brazil," was the headline on an article Friday in Gazeta Mercantil. The article listed foreign investment houses -- including Salomon Brothers, Smith Barney and CS First Boston -- that recommended that their clients increase Brazil portfolios and reduce their holdings in Mexico.
With Mr. Cardoso regarded as likely to accelerate the sale of state companies, stocks in Sao Paulo are expected to rebound in January.
"Brazil's fundamentals have not been changed by Mexico, so it's a good time to buy," said Wayne A. Perkins, director of equity investments for Chemical Bank's affiliate in Sao Paulo. "Everyone is closing their year-end books now. The inflow of foreign investment will start early in the first quarter."
