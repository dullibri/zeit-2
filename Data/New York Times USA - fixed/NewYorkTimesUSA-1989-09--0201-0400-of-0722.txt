HEADLINE: Cost of Farm Subsidies Cited as Trade Issue

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
In an effort to persuade West European countries to end farm subsidies, the Bush Administration has begun citing new estimates of the high costs of agricultural support, which is now put at $200 billion for both the United States and the European Community, nearly 10 times higher than was estimated earlier.
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said today that the revised numbers, put together recently by the staff of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, added urgency to the need to agree on an agriculture trade liberalization pact at the so-called Uruguay Round of trade talks currently being held in Geneva.
The new study takes into account the cost of farm subsidies in both the community and the United States and examines policies on rural development, processing, marketing, inspection services and the impact of price and income support. 
 
Level Down from 1987
The O.E.C.D. breakdown shows that in 1988 the cost of farm support was $119.4 billion in the community and $73.8 billion in the United States. Both calculations were down slightly from 1987, when the cost of support in Europe was put at $123.9 billion and in the United States at $86.1 billion.
National and international organizations have tried for years to establish reliable estimates of the cost of farm support. The O.E.C.D. study, which was completed by its agricultural trade committee last May, is believed to be the most comprehensive.
Previous estimates by both the European Community and the United States Agriculture Department had generally placed spending in the range of $25 to $35 billion a year. The new study seeks to incorporate all agricultural outlays whereas earlier numbers focused primarily on specific subsidies like price supports and loan programs.
''The cost is astronomically high,'' Mrs. Hills told reporters here today in preparation for a negotiating trip next week to Western Europe during which subsidies are expected to be a major issue.
 
Competition a Factor
She added that the costs were pushed even higher because of subsidized export competition.
''Even here, when we talk to members of the farm community about export enhancement,'' she said, referring to subsidies, ''it's always that the community provides subsidies for their sales and we have to meet the competition.''
The United States and the West Europeans last April concluded a framework agreement for the trade negotiations in which both sides said they would accept a ''progressive and substantial reduction'' of subsidies. But there has been little progress since.
The Uruguay Round, the eighth and most complex postwar effort to establish freer trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is being conducted by 108 nations and is scheduled to end next year.
Besides cutting farm subsidies, negotiators are trying to liberalize trade in services, like insurance and tourism, establish greater protection for copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property, and chart a course for eventual freer trade in textiles.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed in continued sluggish trading yesterday.
Note and bond prices were up by as much as a quarter-point early in the session, but the gains did not hold as dealers took profits later in the day.
The early gains came as market participants reacted positively to a continued strength in the dollar, which moved higher after the Bundesbank of West Germany, contrary to rumors that had circulated in recent trading sessions, chose not to raise certain primary short-term interest rates.
 
Dollar Is Restrained
Dollar selling by several European central banks and the Federal Reserve pushed the currency down from its peak levels of the day, the traders said. 
For the first time in several weeks, the dealers said that retail investors were buying securities.
''Every day the market holds at these levels helps because customers don't like volatility,'' said one government securities trader. ''And the dollar is also giving people some comfort. We have seen pretty good buying of intermediate-term issues by both foreign and domestic clients.''
Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc., said: ''The economic fundamentals underpinning the dollar are helping the credit market. But the Federal Reserve appears to have monetary policy on hold, and as a consequence, the market is moving sideways.
''The Fed is taking a bow, and the markets seem to be applauding them by not moving in one direction or another.''
 
Funds Rate Under 9%
Yesterday, the overnight Federal funds rate, the rate that is most closely controlled by the Fed, traded at or slightly under the 9 percent target level it has held for the last six weeks. The rate is what the Fed charges on overnight loans to banks.
''We see little rationale for any near-term change'' in Fed policy, analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company in Belmont, Calif., noted in their daily market commentary, ''so a 9 percent funds rate will likely persist through early October, until new data on the economy and prices becomes available.''
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds that mature in 2019 were offered at a price of 100 5/32, down by 3/32, to yield 8.11 percent.
Among the secondary Treasury note issues, intermediate-term securities dipped somewhat in price, while the short-term instruments inched higher.
In late trading, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 26/32, down by an eighth of a point, to yield 8.24 percent. And the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes dipped by 3/32, to a late-offered price of 100 6/32, to yield 8.19 percent. 2-Year Notes at 8.30% Among the shorter-term issues, the 8 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered late yesterday at 99 29/32, up by 2/32, to yield 8.30 percent.
Secondary Treasury bill rates edged lower.
Three-month bills were offered in late trading at a discount rate of 7.78 percent, down by 2 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Meanwhile, six-month bill rates dipped by a basis point, to a late-offered rate of 7.78 percent. And one-year bills were offered at a rate of 7.66 percent, also down by 2 basis points.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week that ended on Aug. 28. The report did not affect prices in the credit markets.
Activity in the secondary corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets was extremely light again yesterday, the dealers said.
The prices of most secondary corporate issues were unchanged to down by one-eighth of a point, the market participants said, while the prices of most secondary tax-exempt issues were unchanged to up by an eighth of a point.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits 3-Month High As Central Banks Intervene

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Traders carried the dollar to its highest levels in nearly three months yesterday, although selling by central banks knocked the currency off its peak of the day.
Central banks in West Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland confirmed that they had sold dollars to restrain the currency, and the traders said that the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve in the United States joined in the action.
The bankers are committed to keeping exchange rates stable to avoid damaging world trade. 
At its peak in late European trading, the dollar went above 1.99 West German marks, just shy of the important level of 2 marks to the dollar. It ended the trading day in New York at less than 1.98 marks.
Propelling the dollar upward have been attractive interest rates in the United States and confidence in the health of the American economy and financial markets. The dollar is near its levels of mid-June, when a rally moved it to two-year highs.
Yesterday's trading volume was not especially heavy, reflecting the traders' uncertainty about the strength of the current rally, said Keith Raphael, an assistant vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert Inc. in New York.
In the absence of heavy buying demand, the central banks could get some results from a relatively modest amount of dollar selling. But many of the traders still expected the market to keep testing the central banks' resolve.
''There's fundamentally no reason for the dollar to come off,'' said Bill Doyle, a trader at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation branch office in New York.
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 146.65 yen, below its levels of earlier in the day but above its close of 146.10 yen late on Wednesday. The pound traded at $1.5520, weaker against the dollar than $1.5525 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Wednesday, included: 1.9798 West German marks, up from 1.9753; 1.7075 Swiss francs, up from 1.7048; 1.1859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1802; 6.6685 French francs, up from 6.6560, and 1,419.30 Italian lire, up from 1,417.90.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell to $360.20 an ounce, from $361.60 on Wednesday. Silver for current delivery rose to $5.117 an ounce, from $5.103 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Joseph Kaskell, 97; Lawyer Helped Bonn

 BODY:
Joseph Kaskell, an international lawyer who was active in the effort to rebuild Germany after World War II, died Tuesday at his summer home in Madison, N.H. He was 97 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
Mr. Kaskell was an organizer of the American Council on Germany in 1950 and served as its legal counsel until he retired in 1980. Earlier he had been a founder of the Committee for a Democratic Germany, which opposed harsh measures by the Allies that would have restricted the postwar reconstruction of the German economy.
In 1968 the West German Government in Bonn awarded Mr. Kaskell its highest honor, the Bundesverdienstkreuz, for his efforts in furthering German-American ties.
Mr. Kaskell, who was born in Posen, Germany (now Poznan, Poland), came to the United States in 1939 after having practiced law in Berlin. After receiving a degree from the Columbia Law School, he resumed practice in New York.
He is survived by his wife, the former Liselotte Wachter; a son, Peter, of Manhattan; a daughter, Marinne Cohen of Chapel Hill, N.C.; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Report for U.S. Says Somali Army Killed 5,000 Unarmed Civilians

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 8

 BODY:
A report commissioned by the State Department says the Somali Army ''purposely murdered'' at least 5,000 unarmed civilians over 10 months ending in March.
In one instance, at least 500 men of the Isaak clan, whose members make up the major armed opposition to the Somali Government, were rounded up and killed by the army, most with their throats cut, and then buried in mass graves, says the report by a State Department consultant that documents wide-ranging human rights abuses.
The Somali Government denied today that the army had killed 5,000 people.
 
Recipient of U.S. Arms Aid
The Somali Army has received United States military aid as part of Washington's support of the military Government of President Mohammed Siad Barre over the last 12 years. 
The United States has an agreement with the Somali Government that allows it military use of the port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden, where the report said the 500 Isaaks were killed. There are no United States military personnel based at the port, a State Department official said.
As an expression of Washington's disapproval of the Goverment's human rights abuses, $2.5 million in military aid to Somalia has been recently suspended along with $21 million in economic aid, the State Department said.
 
'Disintegration' Seen
A decision on whether to still include Somalia in joint military exercises scheduled to take place in the fall with the United States and other countries in the region is under review, a department official said.
Somalia is in a state of ''disintegration,'' he said, adding that the Government had lost control of most of the country and that clan rivalry had taken the upper hand. ''It's a situation of everyone for themselves,'' he said.
But the official described the port of Berbera as ''still important to our interests,'' because of its strategic position as a staging post for sending troops to southwest Asia.
A thinly populated, mostly desert country on the eastern wing of the Horn of Africa, Somalia juts out into the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. President Siad Barre, believed to be in his 80's and ailing, took control in a coup 20 years ago. The findings in the report by Robert Gersony, a consultant to the State Department who did a similar investigation for the department last year on Mozambique, are based on more than 250 interviews with Somali refugees who have fled as well as with Somalis and foreigners in the country.
It covers the period from May 1988 - when fierce fighting broke out in the north between the Government and the Somali National Movement, based on the Isaak clan - to March 1989. #300,000 Go to Ethiopia As a result of that fighting, concentrated around the northern town of Hargeisa, more than 300,000 Somalis of the Isaak clan walked across the border to Ethiopia, where most remain in camps run by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The report states that none of the Isaak refugees interviewed were willing to return home under the current circumstances.
The report said the Somali National Movement had also killed unarmed civilians but asserted the number was much smaller than on the Government side. At least several hundred civilians were killed by the rebels during the first three months of their 1988 offensive, the report said.
In documenting what appeared to be ''widespread, systematic and extremely violent assault'' on the unarmed civilian Isaak population in northern Somalia, the report said the brutalities took place even though there was no danger to the Somali armed forces.
The army appeared to have made systematic attacks against Isaak villages, watering points and grazing areas while at the same time conducting ''roundups, summary executions and massacres of many hundreds, if not more, of unarmed civilian Isaaks.''
''The appearance that victims were selected for these killings principally because of their ethnic identity is unmistakable,'' the report said.
 
Torture Is Charged
Civilian detainees of the Government were subjected to ''severe beatings, stabbing, prolonged choking, use of metal clips and electric shock on flesh and testicles and immersion in excrement.'' it said. ''This ill treatment sometimes resulted in death.''
In July, after the period covered by the State Department account, renewed violence broke out when troops fired on demonstrators protesting the jailing of four Islamic leaders in the capital, Mogadishu. A human rights group, Africa Watch, estimated that 450 people were killed in the fighting. The Government said 23 had been killed and 59 wounded.
On July 16, Western embassies in the capital reported that the army had killed 46 men of Isaak origin on a beach outside the capital. With rare exceptions, journalists have been refused entry to Somalia in the last 18 months.
A Western aid worker with an international organization, who left Mogadishu 10 days ago after spending 10 years in Somalia, said a semblance of order returned to the capital in August, with businesses re-opened and a curfew cut back.
In the central and northern regions, there ''was a complete breakdown of law and order with widspread looting by bandits,'' he said. A major leader of the army in the north who was from the Ogadeni clan had defected, taking fellow Ogadeni soldiers with him, the aid worker said.
 
SOMALIA DENIES REPORT
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 (Special to The New York Tiems)- Commenting on the report, Abdi Awale Jama, charge d'affaires at the Somali Embassy, denied today that 5,000 people had been killed by the Somali Army.
''This is an old, rehashed story,'' Mr. Jama said. ''I can't say that it accurately reflects what happened.''
''The mission of the Somali Army is to defend Somali territory, not to kill Somali citizens,'' he said. ''But sometimes mistakes happen. The Somali Army was not the initiator of the violence. Elements opposed to the Somali Government came across the border from Ethiopia, armed to the teeth. Some innocent civilians were caught in the crossfire and were killed.''
Mr. Jama said he did not know the number of victims because he was ''not an eyewitness.''

HEADLINE: Parking in Fortress Los Angeles Bares the Angeleno Psyche

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your ''Los Angeles Journal'' of Aug. 16, ''Parking: Even an Angel Would Cry,'' mentions permit parking and its disastrous effects on nearby shops and would-be shoppers or strollers, but not the closing of whole residential streets to any parking at all.
Nor do you mention the growing trend to withdraw whole blocks of residential streets from public use, by turning them into gated communities closed to any drivers except residents. Permit parking is meant to discourage unruly outsiders. Gated communities hope to increase the security of their residents by keeping out drive-through criminals. They also hope to increase property values.
Los Angeles is engaged in an ominous escalation. Many streets are already closed to all parking and deny all drivers, including residents, facilities we used to consider normal. We all pay taxes, but not all of us are allowed to use the facilities our taxes buy. Like the process you describe, the setting up of gated communities is part of an inflation. We are all concerned with the security of our families and our homes. But Los Angeles drifts toward becoming a collection of semifortified enclosures, where those who can afford the costs of relative security take refuge, while their neighbors take pot luck.
Angelenos are trying to deny that our city has become a great metro-polis, with all the problems a metropolis faces. We run the risk of cutting off our nose to spite our face. Crime, disorder, congestion are serious issues that cannot be tackled in dispersed order. Sundering the city by creating private enclaves, and the legislation of private privilege, can only weaken the common interest we have in our common headaches.

HEADLINE: How Much to Fence In the Fed

 BODY:
The chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, Lee Hamilton, wants to tighten regulation of the Federal Reserve system. The legislation he has co-sponsored sounds innocent enough. It would strip away some of the secrecy the Fed now enjoys and make it more accountable to elected politicians. 
But lurking behind Representative Hamilton's bill is a troubling dilemma. An institution as powerful as the nation's central bank ought to be politically accountable. But if White House or Congress truly determined monetary policy, the economy would almost surely suffer.
The Hamilton bill strikes a careful balance between accountability and autonomy. If Congress ventures much beyond his modest provisions, it will risk serious economic damage.
The Fed controls what is arguably the most powerful economic lever in the world: the U.S. money supply. Not Congress, not the White House, not any foreign government exerts more short-term control over prices, output and jobs. The trick to setting correct monetary policy is to recognize the profound difference between the Fed's short-term impact and its long-term impotence.
In the short term, the Fed can drive down interest rates and thereby increase total spending, output and jobs (a ''loose'' money policy). But in the long run, such a policy drives up inflation, interest rates go back up and the employment and output gains evaporate. A Fed that sacrifices long-term price stability to dabble in short-term expediency creates havoc. The Congressional economic perspective can be frighteningly short-term. It tolerates immense budget deficits even though they threaten economic health. Congress routinely engages in budget trickery that lowers one year's deficit by worsening the deficit every year thereafter. The prospect of Congress forcing the Fed to drive down short-term interest rates to meet Gramm-Rudman budget targets is numbing. Fed autonomy is essential.
Mr. Hamilton's bill would place the Secretary of the Treasury on the Fed's primary policy-making body, allow a new President to appoint his own chairman and require publication of the Fed's budget. This amount of accountability is appropriate. Mr. Hamilton would also permit the Government Accounting Office to audit Fed procedures more closely. The precise purpose of this provision is murky and needs to be clarified.
The most controversial portion of the bill would require that the Fed disclose changes in monetary policy immediately rather than wait its customary six weeks. Most monetary experts agree with Alan Blinder of Princeton and William Poole of Brown University that Fed policy will work better with immediate disclosure. What is certain is that immediate disclosure will subject the Fed to more intense debate, which might weaken its economic resolve.
Mr. Hamilton's attempt to integrate monetary policy better into the political process is constructive and measured. If Congress does not reach beyond the current proposals, economic policy can be democratized in a manner that does no harm.

Divining the Motives Of Socialistic Ravens

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

Ravens in Winter
By Bernd Heinrich
Illustrations by the author. 379 pages. Summit Books. $19.95.
''Ravens in Winter'' isn't about politics; it's about birds. Yet in this fascinating book, Bernd Heinrich theorizes about the ''left-wing behavior'' of ravens. Ornithology and anthropomorphism are all part of this scientific investigation clothed in the form of a zoological detective story. 
Are ravens socialistic birds who believe in sharing the wealth beyond their immediate families? In search of the answer to that question, the author spent four years in the Maine woods watching them. Sometimes he was himself perched like a bird in a tree, freezing in winter, waiting for hours in darkness, luring the ravens with the bait of dead animals, hoping they would land nearby so he could spot them through his binoculars and observe their behavior.
Setting up his theory about ravens, the author, a professor of zoology at the University of Vermont who previously wrote ''Bumblebee Economics,'' draws the political analogy himself:
''In some of the same fields and woods where I had made the observations on bumblebees, I had often noticed a pair of ravens. I now saw the birds, which had always seemed to me solitary animals, doing something solitary animals are not 'supposed' to do: They were sharing valuable food - those who had, it seemed, were giving to those who needed. It was the most left-wing behavior I had ever heard of in a natural system.''
These initial observations about ravens - supposedly the most intelligent as well as the most garrulous in the bird kingdom - aroused Professor Heinrich's curiosity. As a biologist, he was always looking for some evolutionary, self-serving reason to explain why animals did certain things. He decided to turn his instinct into a scientific investigation. Could ravens possibly possess motives? As a teacher, he knew that an anthropomorphic approach (that is, ascribing human characteristics to nonhumans) could help students understand his ideas more clearly. In ''Ravens in Winter'' he uses the same analogies for readers.
Professor Heinrich started with a minimal knowledge of ravens when he first began studying them at the edge of Mount Blue State Park in western Maine. He found most of the literature anecdotal rather than factual and many of the conclusions about the birds, even those written by ornithologists, misleading. Ravens resemble crows but weigh about four times more; their wingspan can be up to four feet. The author observed hundreds of ravens and wrote down details of their behavior in carefully kept notebooks. He saw them as ''big, black and beautiful,'' with the ability to dive and roll ''like a black thunderbolt'' or to speed along ''with liquid, gliding strokes.''
He learned that ravens follow any animals that kill large game, picking over their remains. They associate with human beings by scavenging at garbage dumps. Their intelligence has been recognized in every culture for centuries. In ancient Ireland, future events were divined from the calls of the raven, and even now the Irish phrase ''raven's knowledge'' means to see and to know all. Several times he cites lines from Edgar Allan Poe's dispiriting 1845 poem, ''The Raven,'' for no particular purpose other than as literary decoration. But his close-up observations result in his own excellent drawings of ravens.
His study shows that most of the meat bait he set out was consumed by crowds of ravens - ranging from 15 to nearly 300 - even though the birds normally don't band together in such numbers. By contrast, species like blue jays defended bait vigorously against other birds instead of sharing. Ravens at the bait were very noisy, suggesting that this was a signal to other ravens to come and get it.
Why did the ravens recruit other ravens to share their food? ''Perhaps ravens sought a crowd to have 'more eyes' to be alert to danger,'' he writes. Another ''perhaps'' is offered: ''Perhaps a raven that shares is recognized by its peers and thereby gains 'friends' or a friend from whom it is able to choose a mate later.'' He surmises that recruitment of other ravens at feeding places could be related to sexual selection.
How does all this information add up? Fitting his data together, Professor Heinrich finds that young ravens leave home to wander. They are gregarious, joining other juveniles to roost and feast with, enabling them to choose an attractive mate. An unmated raven finding food invites eligible singles to join him (or her) at the feast, ''thereby not only gaining or maintaining access to the food, but possibly also increasing its status and demonstrating fitness as a future provider for rearing offspring.''
Professor Heinrich calls this motivated sharing ''an elegant, simple, and beautiful system. But it is clothed by intricate detail and subtlety. As far as I know, no other animal shows a similar system.'' His detective story doesn't really offer a solution, nor does it conclude that ravens are left-wingers or right-wingers, socialists or neoconservatives. Nevertheless, in ''Ravens in Winter'' he does challenge the reader to think about the meaning of altruistic behavior of ravens and humans. Gulf and Westernd(Summit Books)

HEADLINE: 2 New Fronts in Charles's Architecture War

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Contemporary British architecture has been debated fiercely here since May 30, 1984. That night Prince Charles attended the 150th anniversary dinner of the Royal Institute of British Architects and stunned its members by accusing them of having ''consistently ignored the feelings and wishes of the mass of ordinary people.''
This week the Prince did his best to see that the great British contemporary architecture debate rages on. On Thursday, Doubleday in Britain published the Prince's first book on the subject, ''A Vision of Britain, a Personal View of Architecture,'' which is to be published in the United States in November. Thursday night the Prince attended the opening of a companion exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, also entitled ''A Vision of Britain,'' of which he was a principal architect. 
In addition, the BBC broadcast a 90-minute television program written and narrated by Charles, in which he detailed his architectural likes and dislikes.
The program, which was seen by six million viewers when it was first broadcast in October, inspired both the book and the exhibition, as well as spirited architectural debate throughout the nation.
Among the things that most displease the heir to the British throne are concrete tower blocks, impersonal functional structures and buildings that do not fit with neighboring buildings.
This time the architects whose works and beliefs the Prince has criticized were prepared to defend themselves. Earlier in the week Architects Journal, a respected trade magazine, published a survey indicating that a majority of British architects think the Prince is wrong on fundamental issues.
Maxwell Hutchinson, the new president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, aimed a spirited salvo at the Prince in his inaugural lecture at the institute in July. He said, ''The intervention of the Prince of Wales has made honorable that which would have been considered cowardly half a century ago: the renunciation of the new in favor of the old.''
And Mr. Hutchinson has written a rebuttal to the Prince's book. ''The Prince of Wales: Right or Wrong? An Architect Replies'' will be published this month by Faber.
 
A List of Preferences
All this raises not only architectural and esthetic issues but also constitutional concerns over the Prince's beliefs and the influence he wields.
The latest round in the debate centers on the Prince's 10 principles or guidelines for good architectural design, which form the centerpiece of both book and exhibition. (At the Victoria and Albert, visitors can walk through a trim red wood-framed house in which the Prince's architectural views are displayed on poster-size panels.) In brief, the Prince says that new architecture should respect the landscape, that a building's size should reflect its public importance, that buildings ''must relate to human proportions,'' that buildings should be in harmony with surrounding structures and that buildings should create a sense of privacy and safety.
The Prince also thinks that buildings should be made from local materials, that new architecture should respect the landscape, that decoration on buildings helps ''to enrich our spirits,'' that art should accompany new structures, that signs and lights should be part of the architecture and that buildings should encourage a sense of community.
Among the new buildings and developments he admires are the aptly named Princes Square, a Glasgow shopping mall built in an old Victorian warehouse; the planned town of Seaside, Fla., which boasts pastel houses with porches, and the English architect Quinlan Terry's neo-18th-century development in London's Richmond district.
 
From Words Into Mortar
The Prince has also decided to put his principles into practice with the creation of four planned villages on 400 acres of his land in the Duchy of Cornwall. The plans, produced by the architect Leon Krier, reflect the Prince's concern for so-called balanced communities, with houses, shops, schools, factories and public buildings all within walking distance. The plan has been criticized by some residents who prefer more conventional zoning in which homes and work places are more widely separated.
In his speech, Mr. Hutchinson condemned the Prince's design principles, or Ten Commandments, as they have been called by the press. ''There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that this sort of proselytizing does anything to improve the overall quality of architectural design,'' he said.
In contrast, Colin Amery, the architecture critic of The Financial Times, wrote: ''The whole of the Prince's book is really a plea for us all to shake out of our esthetic idleness.'' Some prominent architects do agree with certain points the Prince makes, though many attribute unattractive public and private buildings to a lack of planning controls and greedy developers, not to architects. #20th-Century Constraints Richard Rogers, who designed the Lloyd's of London building - which is not one of the Prince's favorites -says that with notable exceptions there is a prevailing emphasis on cheapness and speed rather than quality in much contemporary British architecture.
Some architects have called the Prince unrealistic about the financial and design constraints placed on architects by the demands of 20th-century buildings and 20th-century budgets.
Prince Charles's frankness, unusual in Britain's usually noncommittal royal family, has sometimes had pronounced results. When he called a proposed addition to the National Gallery a ''monstrous carbuncle,'' the project was jettisoned, taking hundreds of jobs with it.
''No person so close to the throne in the past has ever taken a stand with such unbelieveably strong economic repercussions,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage, the 163-year-old directory of British aristocracy.
 
Support for the Prince
Yet Prince Charles's views have proved extremely popular with the so-called ordinary people he claims to represent when he criticizes postwar buildings like the National Theater at London's Southbank Center or London's Paternoster Square, next to St. Paul's Cathedral. In the introduction to his book, he writes that 99 percent of the 5,000 letters he received after his television program agreed with him.
''I'm very pro-Prince, and I share his architectural views,'' said Stanley Roth, a London taxicab driver who also gives tours of the city. ''People say he has no right to say what he does. But when the Prince declares that something is a carbuncle, people listen and he gets results. The average person may feel exactly as the Prince does, but no one is going to listen.''
Doubleday, which paid $480,000 for the rights to the book, is printing 200,000 copies in Britain alone; architectural books usually have a first printing of 3,000 here, according to a Doubleday spokeswoman. The book sells in Britain for about $27, and proceeds will go to the Prince of Wales's Charities.
Indeed, even Mr. Hutchinson agrees that the Prince's efforts have had at least one positive effect. ''Prince Charles has hit a vein in public opinion; there is no doubt about that,'' he said at the opening of the Victoria and Albert exhibition. ''He has started a debate, and that at least is an enormous benefit.''

HEADLINE: Yeltsin, Soviet Opposition Figure, Is Due Today for U.S. Tour

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin, the swashbuckling Soviet populist whose mass appeal made him the symbol of growing political pluralism in Moscow, arrives in New York on his first American visit Saturday to offer Americans an insight into Soviet politics and to take a crash course in American capitalism.
The former Politburo member's hectic schedule, now compressed to eight days from the two weeks originally planned, has him speaking in eight cities - at about $25,000 a lecture -meeting with leading economic and business figures including David Rockefeller, Lester C. Thurow and Peter J. Sprague, and soaking up as much information as possible about entrepreneurship.
The burly former Moscow party boss cemented his reputation for tenacity earlier this year, when he emerged from the obscurity of a construction ministry to win a seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies with 90 percent of the vote. 
Mr. Yeltsin has reportedly requested a meeting with President Bush, but it is not clear whether he will see him.
 
No Decision on Bush Meeting
''No decision has been made as to whether to meet with Yeltsin,'' a senior Administration official said Thursday, referring to the proposed meetings with Mr. Bush and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser.
He will, however, meet with Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who has developed a strong interest in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Yeltsin, who was banished from the ruling Politburo in 1987, is making the trip as a private individual, under the sponsorship of the California-based Esalen Institute, the onetime home base of the human potential movement and recently a promoter of Soviet-American exchanges and dialogues.
The arrangements for the trip have had a jury-rigged, perils-of-Pauline quality, an odd counterpoint to the obvious significance of this visit by the first nationwide political opposition leader to emerge from a tradition of rigid political conformity.
 
Late Visa and Tickets
As of Wednesday, when invitations to a lunch for Mr. Yeltsin by the Council on Foreign Relations were arriving at members' homes, Mr. Yeltsin had not received an exit visa from the Soviet Government. As of Thursday, when plans for similar meetings in Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Dallas, Minneapolis, Indianapolis and Chicago were being completed, Mr. Yeltsin did not have his plane tickets.
''We didn't know until 3 or 4 o'clock this morning that he was coming,'' Jim Garrison, Esalen's executive director, said Thursday. ''The Foreign Ministry didn't give him an exit visa until 9 o'clock Thursday night.''
Mr. Thurow, who is dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the visit: ''It's a revolution. He's really the leader of the political opposition in Moscow, and to think that the leadership would let him visit the United States - well, there would have been no way on God's green earth that could have happened 10 years ago.''

Safety Questions Raised About Generic Drugs

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
As questions are raised about the Government's system of approving generic drugs, some doctors are asking whether these drugs are as effective as they are said to be. The questions are troubling many consumers who use generics instead of more expensive brand-name drugs.
Generic drugs are now used to fill about a third of all prescriptions written in the United States. They cost about half as much as their brand-name counterparts because of price competition among makers once the patent on a brand-name product expires, usually after 17 years. Manufacturers claim that generics are just as effective as the name brands. 
In recent months, three employees of the Food and Drug Administration who reviewed applications from manufacturers seeking approval for new generic drugs have pleaded guilty to accepting money and favors from some manufacturers. One company, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Queens, has admitted substituting the patented drug for its own when making its application. A report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services has found weaknesses in the F.D.A.'s drug-review procedures.
 
Plant Inspections
 The F.D.A. is considering withdrawing its approval for two dozen or so generic drugs made by Vitarine and Par Phamaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y. The agency claims that false information was included in the companies' applications. And last month the F.D.A. started inspecting 20 major manufacturing plants, in an effort to assure consumers that that there is no danger in using generics.
Some insurance companies and government health programs require pharmacists to use a lower-cost generic if it is available. Any changes in these requirements would be up to state legislatures.
The American Academy of Family Physicians, a professional group, is to vote next week on a proposal that for certain patients, diseases and drugs, there should be no mandatory substitution of generics for name brands.
None of these developments are likely to inspire consumer confidence in generic drugs. But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group affiliated with Ralph Nader, said, ''At the present time, there is no reason why a physician should stop prescribing generic drugs or a patient should stop using generic drugs.''
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the Government had ''no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of generic drugs has been compromised.''
And spokesmen for the generic-drug industry, while condemning individual instances of wrongdoing, say there is no reason for consumers to lose confidence in generics.
''We've got an extraordinary 20-year record,'' said Dee Fensterer, president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association.
The American Association of Retired Persons, which has a large mail-order service for generic and brand-name drugs, has no plans to change its procedures. ''We still certainly believe that generic products have a very viable interest for our consumers,'' said Carl L. Jesina, executive vice president of the association's pharmacy service.
Nevertheless, some physicians and other health professionals are concerned whether certain generic drugs perform as well as the original brand-name products. Cost containment is a worthy goal, they say, but not if the drug has a lesser therapeutic effect.
''The main issue is whether the public is getting the product which, in fact, the F.D.A. approved,'' said Dr. Leroy L. Schwartz, president of Health Policy International, a nonprofit foundation in a Princeton, N.J., that studies health-policy issues from a scientific point of view. ''The F.D.A. has not assured the public that there will be the same therapeutic effect once substitution takes place. And the elderly and the poor are the ones most affected.''
Dr. Ralph E. Schlossman, a physician in family practice in Queens, said: ''I have had many instances where a generic medication was not working where it should have. When I switched to a brand, it did.''
Members of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents the major drug companies, make generic as well as brand-name products. Nevertheless, in a position paper on generics issued early this year, the association said generic drugs ''are being approved for marketing that are not in practice therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer products.'' The paper also said, ''Patients on maintenance regimens whose daily dosage must be individualized are especially at risk when drug products are changed.''
 
Formulations Vary
 The F.D.A. requires that a generic product contain the same active ingredient as the brand-name product and that the ingredient be absorbed by the body in the same way. Whether it does is determined by comparing the rate and extent of absorption of the brand-name drug and the generic. The F.D.A. allows new generic formulations to vary by up to 20 percent compared with the brand names, but the average difference since 1962 has been only 3.5 percent, according to an agency study.
A number of doctors are wary about substituting generics for particular medical conditions. Dr. Ray W. Gifford, a Cleveland internist and a trustee of the American Medical Association, said he would not recommend digoxin, a generic product used to treat heart conditions, instead of the brand-name product Lanoxin.
''This requires very precise dosing,'' he said. ''You can get toxicity or you can lose control of the patient if there are too many variations.''
Reina Davis, executive director of the Epilepsy Institute in New York, warns that generic anti-convulsant medications may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. She advises users to ask their doctors to choose a generic medication from a particular manufacturer, then to write the name of the maker on the prescription so the pharmacist knows not to fill it with any other product.
In general, experts say, consumers should make sure they know when they are taking generic drugs, and to talk to their doctors if they are concerned about continuing to do so.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 15, 1989, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Consumer's World page last Saturday about generic drugs misidentified the executive director of the Epilepsy Institute. She is Reina Berner. A chart accompanying the article misstated the generic equivalent of the drug Dyazide. It is hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Near June Peak In Generally Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar yesterday approached the peaks reached in its June rally, with its confidence in a thin market bolstered by a comment from a Swiss national banker. Gold edged down.
Jean Zwahlen, a member of the Swiss National Bank's governing board, was quoted as having said that the dollar was likely to rise in the immediate future because of a strong American economy. 
He said the central banks' ability to restrain the dollar's rise would depend upon the strength of market sentiment toward the currency.
Trading was light to moderate, so price movements were exaggerated, said Jack Adkins, an analyst at the Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago. ''It didn't take a whole lot to get things going,'' he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 146.62 yen, from 146.87 yen late on Thursday. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 146.45 yen. In New York, the currency moved up to 147.20 yen, from 146.65 on Thursday.
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5505 to buy a pound, more than $1.5460 late on Thursday. In New York, the dollar gained as the pound fell to $1.5380, from $1.5520.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Thursday, included: 1.9950 West German marks, up from 1.9798; 1.7245 Swiss francs, up from 1.7075; 1.1875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1859; 6.7195 French francs, up from 6.6680, and 1,493 Italian lire, up from 1,419.30.
In June, the dollar reached 148.53 yen and 2.02 marks, levels unseen in about two years.
In London, gold rose to a late bid of $360 an ounce, from $359.50 late on Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to $360 an ounce, compared with $359.75 late on Thursday.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell to $359.40 an ounce, from $360.20. The Republic National Bank of New York later reported that it had fallen to $358.75, from $359.70.
Also in London, silver rose to $5.12 an ounce, compared with $5.11 late on Thursday. On the Comex in New York, the metal for current delivery fell to $5.053 an ounce, from $5.117.

HEADLINE: DOW ENDS UP SLIGHTLY AFTER EARLY LOSSES

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Stock prices made slight advances yesterday, driven by takeover rumors and some positive economic data.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 2.66 points, to 2,709.54, as blue chips recovered from steep losses in early morning trading after an unexpected drop in July consumer credit figures was announced. Lower interest rates also gave the markets a lift. 
Volume on the Big Board stood at a weak 154.1 million shares, down from 160.2 million shares on Thursday, with advances outstripping declines by 746 to 685.
The week's decline for the Dow of 42.55 points, or 1.55 percent, was the first drop in 10 weeks. Not since 1922 had the Dow risen in every week between Independence Day and Labor Day. Institutional Caution Cited Analysts attributed the decline to a growing caution by institutional investors. ''A lot of money managers remember 1987 and 1988,'' said Michael Metz, chief market strategist for Oppenheimer & Company. ''The lesson is that you had a great second quarter, so don't press your luck; lock in your gains and walk away.''
The Dow transportation average had its worst week in more than a year, closing lower for three straight sessions as airline stocks continued their recent pullback after a dramatic rise this summer. The average was down 7.29 points yesterday, to 1,473.68.
For the week, the transport average was down 52.99 points, or 3.47 percent. That is the worst week for the average since it fell 3.96 percent, to 857.38, in the week ended July 22, 1988. In points, it was the worst week for the average since the index fell 67.43 in the week ended Dec. 4, 1987. Still, last week's drop did not erase the 58.33-point gain of the prior week.
''The transportation average has deteriorated to a speculative football as a lot of people bought the airline stocks for the wrong reasons, expecting everything to be taken over the next day,'' Mr. Metz said. ''When nothing developed, those who bought them for instant gratification sold and walked away.'' UAL, AMR and Delta Fall UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 1 1/2, to 280 1/4, on renewed rumors that Marvin Davis, the California investor who had made a bid for the company, had begun liquidating his position in UAL.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost 1 5/8, to 81. Delta fell 3/4, to 74 1/4.
The blue chips were mixed in weak trading as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing advanced 3/4, to 74 3/4; I.B.M. dropped 1/4, to 116; A.T.&T. rose 1/4, to 39 1/8, and General Motors moved down 1/8, to 49 7/8.
Woolworth rose 3, to 71 3/4, on speculation of a possible takeover bid, traders and analysts said. Woolworth declined to comment.
Broader market indexes also recorded small advances. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.17 point, to 193.95. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks inched up 0.41, to 348.76. The American Stock Exchange market-value index was up 0.91, to 384.10, showing a weekly gain of 0.14 point. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.63, to 471.31.
Allergan, the most active Big Board issue, was down 1/2, to 20 1/4. The company announced early in the week that it expected lower 1989 sales growth.
Heilig-Meyers moved up 3, to 24 3/4, in heavy trading after a Malaysian investor, Vincent Tan, said he would like to discuss with directors a negotiated acquisition of the company.

HEADLINE: Late Rally Pushes Bonds Higher

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late rally sent prices of Treasury securities soaring yesterday. Dealers attributed the rally to an unexpected drop in comsumer credit spending in July, which was reported by the Government shortly after 2 P.M. Until then, dealers said, prices were slightly higher in lackluster trading.
''With many of the heavy hitters still on vacation, the market was just marking time'' when the report came out, said Roberta D. Olson, manager of the fixed-income portfolio at Banc One Asset Management, in Columbus, Ohio. ''The news that consumer credit contracted by $280 million last month was enough to prompt short covering,'' she said. 
But Ms. Olson said there was little fresh buying ''because many participants in the fixed-income market are waiting to see what next week's flow of economic statistics will show.'' She added, ''Next Friday, for example, we expect to get the July trade deficit figures, August Producer Price Index, as well as last month's industrial output and factory capacity indexes.'' Because Wall Street has not been selling the market short, she said, ''we expect prices will back off their highs toward the close.''
 
Long-Term Bond at 8.07%
Ms. Olson was correct. Late in the session, the Treasury's benchmark long-term bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, eased a bit from their highs and were being offered at 100 18/32, up 13/32. This caused the yield to fall to 8.07 percent, from 8.11 percent Thursday and 8.12 percent a week ago.
In Chicago, the spot September Treasury bond futures contract, which expires on Sept. 20, closed up 13/32, to 97 20/32.
Among shorter-term Treasury issues traded in the cash secondary market, the 8 1/4 percent notes of 1991 rose 4/32, to 100, for a yield of 8.25 percent; the 8 1/4's of 1994 added 7/32, to 100 11/32, and now yield 8.15 percent; the long notes, the 8's of 1999, climbed 8/32, or a quarter-point, to 99 2/32, as the yield dipped to 8.14 percent, from 8.16 percent a week ago.
Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities, said the rush to buy back Treasury paper that had previously been sold short ''was caused as much by confusion over the unexpected contraction as by the size of the actual decline; the last time consumer credit shrunk was in January 1987, when it fell by $1.63 billion.''
 
Less Car Financing
One explanation, Mr. Ricchiuto continued, may be found in the $1.5 billion drop in car financing credit in July and the relatively small rise of $1.3 billion in bank and credit card revolving credit. The latter development has caused many banks to lower interest rates on their overdraft, or revolving credit, accounts.
''We think the increased use of home equity loans to finance car and other consumer purchases could be the major reason,'' he said. ''After all, interest on home equity loans is still tax deductible, while the deductions on other consumer loans are being phased out. But the rise in home equity loans in recent months is really not that great. In any event, this still does not explain why revolving credit grew by such a small amount last month.''
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve did not intervene in the credit market, although some analysts thought the central bank would drain part of the huge amount of dollars it sold earlier in the week to keep the dollar from rising further. In any case, the key Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary funds traded at 8 15/16 all day.
Good demand for Treasury bills caused the discount rate on the 90-day issue to slip three basis points, to 7.77 percent; the six-month bills dipped two basis points, to 7.78 percent, and the one-year bills fell six basis points, to 7.62 percent.

HEADLINE: Brazil Seeks Extension for Getting Money

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Brazilian negotiators asked commercial bankers yesterday to allow Brazil more time to qualify for a $600 million payment from the banks that was scheduled to be made this month, bankers said.
The Brazilian request comes as the country apparently heads toward missing a September deadline for a $1.6 billion interest payment on outstanding commercial loans. Brazil's total debt, the largest of the developing countries, is $110 billion. 
The request came during a meeting in New York with the banks' advisory committee, which is headed by Citibank.
Under the loan agreement with the banks, Brazil cannot get the $600 million until it is in compliance with the International Monetary Fund's guidelines for reorganizing the country's economy. One banker said that if the $600 million is not taken by the end of September, it would no longer be available. The banker said the banks would consider the request.
Because Brazil's budget deficit, now about 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product, exceeds the I.M.F. guideline, an agreement with the I.M.F. seems far off. The lack of an agreement with the I.M.F. not only jeopardizes the $600 million payment, but is also holding up more than $3 billion in loans from the I.M.F., Japan and other sources.
The Brazilians have said they do not want to declare a moratorium on interest payments. That would damage the prospects for negotiating debt reduction under the program started by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The timing of the start of the debt negotiations is also expected to depend on the progress the country is making on its economic program and the outcome of the coming presidential election.
The Brazilians, however, do not want to drain their foreign reserves, estimated at around $6 billion, just to make interest payments. They are still trying to work with the I.M.F. on an agreement that would free the loan money and give them enough to make the interest payments.
One banker said the interest payments were discussed in the meeting yesterday, but he said the Brazilians did not give a direct signal about what they are going to do. ''They didn't say they couldn't, and they didn't say they wouldn't,'' the banker said.

Running Diesel Engine With a Coal Slurry

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

 BODY:
An engineer at Defense Research Technologies Inc. of Rockville, Md., a research concern specializing in fluid control, has patented a device that makes it possible to power a diesel engine with a coal slurry.
The inventor, Allen B. Holmes, said the device could be an economical alternative to petroleum fuels for large engines like those used in ships and locomotives. 
The coal slurry consists of roughly equal parts of water and coal dust, and it must be sprayed into a combustion chamber as a fine mist in order to be burned. Mr. Holmes said the problem was that the slurry is a balky fluid that comes out of a nozzle as a mist only under very high pressure. The pressure of the streaming coal particles, however, wears out nozzles almost immediately.
Mr. Holmes's invention resolves that with a new nozzle that spews out liquid as a conical sheet, like a witch's hat. As the cone spreads out, the sheet becomes thinner and the particles separate into droplets. By applying comparatively small amounts of pressure, Mr. Holmes said, the liquid becomes a mist virtually as soon as it leaves the nozzle.
The device is being incorporated in an experimental engine being built by Adiabatics Inc. of Columbus, Ind.
Mr. Holmes received patent 4,862,837.

HEADLINE: Fall in Consumer Debt Is First in 2 1/2 Years

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Consumers repaid more debt than they took out during July, as installment debt outstanding fell for the first time in two and a half years, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday.
Economists warned, however, that the decline was probably not a sign of a spending collapse, even though it did show more reluctance to borrow.
''It could be a sign that consumers are getting more cautious and approaching the limits of how much debt they are comfortable with,'' said Paul Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company, Chicago. ''But we know that retail sales were strong in July and that car sales have strengthened the past few months.'' 
Many economists said future reports would probably show a resumption of increases in consumer indebtedness. July's decline of one-half of one percent followed monthly increases of 4.7 percent in June and 7.3 percent in May.
The drop in July, with loan repayments exceeding new borrowings by $280 million, resulted mostly from a $1.46 billion decline in car loans and a much smaller than normal increase of $1.27 billion in revolving loans, which are primarily from credit cards. In June, when consumer debt rose $2.72 billion, car loans fell $549 million, but revolving credit loans rose by $3.12 billion.
Some analysts were surprised by the July report because car sales in the month improved to an annual rate of 7.6 million units, up from about 7 million in June. Several economists said the Fed data on debt for July might be revised to show more borrowing for cars and an overall increase in consumer debt.
''There has been a general slowdown in consumer spending this year,'' said Ysabel Burns McAleer, an economist at the American Financial Services Association, a group representing consumer finance companies. ''But July's decline in consumer debt probably exagerrated the extent of any consumer retrenching.''
During the first half of this year, consumer spending grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate, down from 7.4 percent in 1988, Ms. McAleer noted.
Much of the spending slowdown came in automobiles, a sector that has revived in recent months as car producers have offered larger incentives in the form of rebates and low-interest financing. In August, sales continued to improve to an annual rate of 8.3 million units.
The Fed's consumer debt report does not include home equity loans, a rapidly growing form of second mortgage. Because mortgage interest payments are generally tax-deductible, while the deductibility of interest on personal debt has been sharply curtailed, some consumers have been trying to borrow against the value of their houses to make purchases that they would previously have financed by installment debt.
According to other Federal Reserve data published yesterday, home equity loans at large banks nationally totaled $23.4 billion in the week ended Aug. 30, up $154 million in the latest week and $5.2 billion in the last year.
Borrowing for mobile homes in July declined for the sixth consecutive month. Loans dropped $60 million, or by 3 percent on an annual basis. That followed drops of 13.4 percent in June, 2.1 percent in May, 2.8 percent in April, 8.2 percent in March and 2.9 percent in February.

 Bloomingdale's was placed on the auction block by the Campeau Corporation of Toronto, which acquired it last year. Marvin S.

[29.] The Comptroller of the Currency proposed a 3 percent minimum capital requirement for nationally chartered commercial banks, the same level set for savings units in the Government's rescue package. L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said it would substantially reduce bank capital requirements. The Comptroller, Robert L.

HEADLINE: Former Mayor of Danbury Is Indicted in Racketeering

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., Sept. 8

 BODY:
A former Mayor of Danbury was indicted today by a Federal grand jury on charges that he led a racketeering enterprise from the Mayor's office in the mid-1980's, using extortion to profit from the real estate and construction boom then sweeping western Connecticut.
Four other former city officials were charged with evading Federal income taxes on money earned from city projects in which, prosecutors said, the defendants had a hidden financial interest.
The former Mayor, James E. Dyer, who served two terms from 1979 to 1987, was charged with using the power of his office to extort $90,000 from a real estate developer and a bank over five years, including $1,000-a-month payments from the developer of the Danbury Fair Mall that went on for more than four years, the indictment said. 
Mr. Dyer denied the charges, calling them ''unsubstantiated.''
 
Investigated in 1987
Mr. Dyer, who is 42 years old, was also indicted in March on Federal charges that he extorted money from the Danbury Savings and Loan Association. The indictment today used those charges, along with the new allegations about payments from the mall developer, as the basis for the racketeering charge.
Mr. Dyer, a Democrat in a traditionally Democratic city, was under investigation by Federal prosecutors in 1987, when he ran for re-election and was defeated by a Republican, Joseph H. Sauer.
Mr. Sauer, running for re-election this fall, said he would not use the Dyer case against his opponent, Gene F. Eriquez, who served on the city's 21-member Common Council during the Dyer years. But Mr. Sauer said he had ordered a local police investigation into the bidding and contract-awarding processes in a $20 million downtown revitalization project that began in 1984. Mr. Dyer was accused in the indictment of ''agreeing to accept'' a $100,000 payment from the developer of the project.
Mr. Eriquez, who said he had no knowledge of any illegalities in city government during his years on the council, called the charges against the former Mayor ''shocking and, if proven, disgusting.''
The United States Attorney for Connecticut, Stanley A. Twardy Jr., said more indictments were expected in the case.
 
Possible 72-Year Sentence
Beginning in the early 1980's, millions were invested here in real estate, and prices appreciated rapidly. Mr. Dyer's possible role in that boom was an issue in the last mayoral election here, in 1987. The Democrats lost control of the Common Council, on which they had held all 21 seats through most of the decade.
If Mr. Dyer is convicted on all counts, he could get a combined maximum sentence of 72 years and $1.6 million in fines.
Reached at his home by telephone, Mr. Dyer said, ''I never extorted five cents from anyone in my entire life.''
Mr. Dyer is to be arraigned on the charges Tuesday and said he would enter his formal plea of not guilty then.
The other men charged today are all to be arraigned on Sept. 20. Two former Planning Commission members, Richard J. Ramey and Richard A. Durkin, are charged with tax evasion. Two other officials and two other men involved in separate land-development deals were charged with failing to file Federal tax returns. The officials are a former Zoning Commission member, Nicholas Falzone, and former State Representative Joseph Walkovich.
The other men charged are Charles J. Durkin, Richard Durkin's father, and Edward Simon Jr. Richard Durkin, Mr. Ramey and Mr. Simon were also charged with conspiracy to defraud the the Government.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 9 about a former mayor of Danbury, Conn., indicted on Federal racketeering charges misstated the number of terms he served. The former Mayor, James E. Dyer, served four two-year terms between 1979 and 1987.

HEADLINE: Party, Described as Cult, Seeks Role in Primary

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The New Alliance Party, a small left-wing organization whose 1988 Presidential candidate was on the ballot in all 50 states, is presenting itself this year as the alternative to the regular Democrats running for City Council president, comptroller and several other posts in the New York City Democratic primary Tuesday.
The party, founded 10 years ago in New York, describes itself as an organization led by black women and dedicated to the rights of black, Hispanic and gay people. Members claim it is the nation's fastest growing party.
But critics contend that the New Alliance Party is a fringe group with hazy politics and few concrete proposals. They say it is dominated by the teachings and personality of a white psychotherapist, Fred Newman, who helped found the group. 
 
Small, Cultlike Core
Some people, including a former member who was the party's Presidential candidate in 1984, say it has a small, cultlike core that rigorously follows Dr. Newman's psychological and political theories. Dr. Newman has also been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for statements it calls anti-Semitic.
Chip Berlet, a researcher with Political Research Associates, a nonprofit group in Boston that investigates authoritarian groups, called the party ''your garden variety totalitarian political cult.''
Dr. Newman said it was ''an absurd characterization'' to call the party a cult. He said the accusations come from people on the left who were ''being sectarian and refusing to recognize the extraordinary accomplishments'' of the party's leaders.
Those leaders maintain that their organization is not a cult and that they work to unify black, Jewish, Hispanic, and gay people and others.
''We've outdone every left force in the country, and that's why we're being challenged,'' said the party's chairwoman, Leonore B. Fulani, who was its 1988 Presidential candidate. ''The controversy is testament to the fact that we're stepping on the right toes.''
In New York's municipal elections, the party is employing a dual strategy, running members in the Democratic primary Tuesday while reserving its own line for the general election.
An exception is the party's support of Borough President David N. Dinkins of Manhattan in the Democratic mayoral race. Should Mr. Dinkins lose, Dr. Fulani will run on the New Alliance line in November. Dr. Fulani, a developmental psychologist, ran for mayor in 1985 and received 7,597 votes, or 0.6 percent of the 1,170,904 votes cast.
Dr. Fulani said she received about 250,000 votes nationally last year. She had 10,502 votes, or 0.5 percent, of the 2,126,418 cast in New York City.
Dr. Fulani and other party candidates talked passionately in a recent interview about the need to address unemployment, inadequate housing and health care and other problems in poor communities, but they offered no new programs or ideas of their own. They said instead that the prime issue is ''fair elections.''
Party leaders said their views have been ignored or misrepresented by the media and the established political parties. ''It's the big-money interests that control the political process,'' said the party's candidate for Council president, Rafael Mendez.
Party members have been demanding that Mr. Dinkins shift on several matters. The tone of their effort, which has included demonstrations and heckling of Mr. Dinkins at public appearances, has been far more harsh than any attacks made by his opponents.
''We're involved in a fight to save his soul,'' Dr. Fulani said of Mr. Dinkins.
Among the demands is that Mr. Dinkins withdraw a television commercial that highlights his rejection of Louis Farrakhan, the head of the Nation of Islam, for making anti-Semitic remarks. The party contends that Mr. Farrakhan's statements - along with those by Dr. Newman that have been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League - have been quoted out of context and were not anti-Semitic.
The party is demanding that Mr. Dinkins support Dr. Mendez, a Bronx psychologist running in the primary against the incumbent Council president, Andrew J. Stein. The party contends that only by endorsing Dr. Mendez can Mr. Dinkins demonstrate support for Hispanic New Yorkers.
Other party members running in the Democratic primary are Steve Rose, a nurse and a candidate for comptroller, and Barbara R. Taylor, who is challenging Councilwoman Ruth W. Messinger for the nomination as Manhattan borough president.
Ms. Taylor called Ms. Messinger, perhaps the most active liberal on the Council, ''the official liberal cover of the Democratic Party.''
Ms. Taylor, who runs a private elementary school in Harlem, said Ms. Messinger had no business trying to win support in Harlem without first acknowledging the New Alliance Party as a prime representative of black and Hispanic people.
''She's pretty stupid to have nerve enough to come into this community and not dialogue with Dr. Fulani and the New Alliance Party,'' Ms. Taylor said.
''In the very few encounters we've had,'' Ms. Messinger responded, ''I've not understood any of the attacks she's made on me.''
 
Attacks Progressives
Critics say the New Alliance Party often concentrates its attacks on progressive politicians and groups. Sue Hyde, an official with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said many local gay and lesbian groups complained last year that party members had tried to disrupt their meetings or take over their organizations.
Some people contend that the party is in essence a front for Dr. Newman. ''The people they put forward as leaders are black women, and their avowed politics sound terrific, but it's a con game,'' Mr. Berlet said. ''The ideological leader of the group is now, has been and will be forever Fred Newman.''
Mr. Berlet said that Dr. Newman had been allied with Lyndon LaRouche, the political extremist, during the 1970's, and then severed ties when Mr. LaRouche drifted into right-wing politics.
Party leaders said Dr. Newman has staunchly opposed Mr. LaRouche since then, and they argued that opponents were trying to discredit him by raising an old, brief alliance.
Mr. Berlet said members of the inner circle are required to be in therapy, applying Dr. Newman's psychological and political theories, which he called ''an amalgamation of Stalin, Freud and Lyndon LaRouche.''
Mr. Berlet estimated that the core includes about 100 people, with another 1,000 people active in the party's political efforts nationally. Dr. Fulani said that the party's membership stood at 20,000 in 1987 and had grown since, but that the exact number was not known. ''We're in the process of putting our membership files in order,'' she said.
Dennis Serrette, the party's Presidential candidate in 1984 who has since broken with the group, described it as dominated by Dr. Newman and ''very, very cultlike.''
He said Dr. Newman was ''as close to a guru as anybody could be.''
Dr. Fulani called Mr. Serrette's contentions ''a lie'' and ''cult baiting.''
''Serrette's attack was really a low-level, cowardly attack on the black female leadership of the party,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Revisiting Promises Koch Made in '85

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
While opponents speak in hopeful generalities, an incumbent mayor campaigning for re-election can - and Edward I. Koch does - hold forth the prospect of specific new housing and workplaces, pinpointing their locations and describing them appreciatively, almost as if they had already been built.
But what happens after the election is over?
A look at more than a dozen building and reconstruction projects that Mayor Koch announced in the weeks before the 1985 primary suggests that the tangible results of such announcements are slow to materialize - sometimes not even by the next election.
Delays have plagued large-scale commercial developments, which city officials ascribe in part to the stock market collapse of October 1987 and in part to lawsuits brought by the projects' opponents, things beyond a mayor's control. Smaller-scale housing projects seem to have fared better. 
Speaking yesterday of the projects announced in 1985, Mr. Koch said City Hall fulfilled its responsibility. ''In all these areas, maybe with some exceptions, the governmental process worked,'' he said.
 
Creating an 'Atmosphere'
About the announcements and press releases four years ago, he said: ''It is helpful to the city to create an atmosphere, an environment, of development and new jobs. The announcement is not an announcement to say in stone, 'It will be done exactly this way.' Now, the press always wants to know when will the ground be broken. So you make an estimate. It can never be a certainty.
''The important thing,'' he said, ''is that in all of these areas we have built more housing and more economic development than was expected at the time of that particular announcement. We've done much more - maybe not that particular project in exactly that way. And I don't have to defend that.''
Nor does he have to curtail it. One day last month, for example, he broke ground for the reconstruction of the Kings County Hospital Center, announced a new shelter for the homeless and other housing in Brooklyn and announced the renovation of four neighborhood shopping areas in the Bronx.
In 1985, Mayor Koch was challenged for the Democratic nomination by Carol Bellamy, the City Council President, and Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. of Manhattan.
These are the major housing and development announcments he made between July 1 of that year, when the fiscal year began and public attention started turning to the election, and the Sept. 10 primary. The current status is given for each project, largely based on information from city officials.
July 1 In Brooklyn, a 100-unit apartment building for the aged was to be ready by 1986, Mayor Koch said, and ''our commitment to provide Carroll Gardens with top-notch housing for low- and moderate-income senior citizens will be realized.''
The building, at 41 First Street, between Bond and Hoyt Streets, started receiving tenants in the spring of 1986. It is operated by Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn.
July 9 In the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, a 276-unit Housing Authority project was to be built. ''We said we would bring back this area and we have kept our word,'' Mr. Koch said.
The project, bounded by Knickerbocker, Gates and Wilson Avenues and Menahan Street, was completed in 1986 and is now home to about 910 people.
July 11 Boston Properties was to buy the city-owned site of the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle for $455 million and develop an enormous complex - shops, apartments, a hotel and the headquarters of the Phibro-Salomon financial concern. ''What a wonderful affirmation of New York City's primacy as the financial and real-estate capital of the world,'' Mayor Koch said. Demolition of the Coliseum has not begun. Salomon is no longer involved. The project has been redesigned and scaled down, following a successful legal challenge led by the Municipal Art Society. The price for the land has dropped to $337 million. A new lawsuit against the project by a coalition of elected officials and community groups was begun Tuesday.
July 18 A 12-story office building was to be built on Livingston Street in downtown Brooklyn by Cohen Brothers Realty and Starrett Housing, taking advantage of tax benefits and energy savings. It was to be finished in 1988.
Construction of Livingston Plaza is to begin next month, with completion in 1991. The New York City Transit Authority will be its tenant.
July 19 The Park Avenue Retail Market, or La Marqueta, under the elevated railroad tracks between 111th and 119th Streets was to be redeveloped, Mayor Koch said, and ''once again benefit East Harlem residents, business people and shoppers throughout the city.''
Developers were selected, but there were lengthy negotiations and the project was stalled by maintenance work by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Site preparation is to begin this month.
July 30 The Atlantic Terminal area in Brooklyn was to be redeveloped by Rose Associates into Atlantic Center, to include 1.8 million square feet of office space, with the Health and Hospitals Corporation as a major tenant, and 680 ''town house-style'' condominiums. The project ''is well under way and proceeding on schedule,'' Mr. Koch said in 1985, forming ''a key part of our plans to create new jobs in the revitalized heart of downtown Brooklyn.''
The first phase of the project, with the hospital offices, was to be finished in 1988, with overall completion in 1992. Nothing has been built. The hospital agency is out of the project. Four lawsuits are pending in state and Federal courts, concerned with economic and environmental impacts. Potential settlement offers include some reduction of density.
Aug. 1 The area around the Staten Island Ferry Terminal in lower Manhattan was to be completely redeveloped. ''With refurbished ferry facilities and new office, hotel and cultural space,'' Mayor Koch said, ''South Ferry Plaza will provide a new focus to the downtown area for visitors and residents.''
Construction was to begin in 1988. It now appears that the start is three years away. Reasons for the delay include the city's expansion of the developer selection process as well as the need for state legislation to permit changes in park land. Developers and cultural tenants have been chosen.
Aug. 6 A nine-story office and shopping center called Executive Plaza was to be built in Jamaica, Queens, by the Mack Company of New Jersey. Mayor Koch said it would ''further enhance the area's position as a prime office location, commercial shopping district and residential neighborhood.''
Construction was to begin by January 1986. Mack did not follow the timetable, city officials said, and after several extensions, was removed as developer, with a $175,000 penalty. The site on Jamaica Avenue is still being marketed.
Aug. 15 As many as 1,700 new homes were to be built in the East New York section of Brooklyn - 1,550 under the Nehemiah program of the East Brooklyn Churches coalition and another 150 by the New York City Partnership. ''It should provide the catalyst for the rejuvenation of the entire area,'' Mr. Koch said.
Today, 232 of the Nehemiah houses are finished and 372 are in construction. Land has been acquired for another 636. The Partnership homes were not built but 44 other units are being developed. Commissioner Abraham Biderman of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said the rebuilding of East New York was always envisioned as a ''long-term effort.''
Aug. 16 Winning bids were announced in the sale of 149 vacant, city-owned brownstones in Harlem. Mayor Koch said the houses, ''when rehabilitated, will be some of the best housing in Harlem.'' So far, 131 of the properties have been conveyed to new owners. Of these, 10 are complete. Another 23 are in construction, with 56 getting plans or financing. The rest have not been started.
Aug. 27 The former Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park was to be redeveloped as what Mayor Koch called ''a new first-rate, modern industrial center,'' with 1 million square feet renovated in the enormous Building B. This was supposed to create or keep some 1,500 jobs at the terminal and was to be ready in 1987.
Today, some 2,000 people work there, and the project was completed on time and under budget, said officials of the city's Public Development Corporation. Over 90 percent of the renovated space has been leased to 29 businesses, including printers, garment makers and other light manufacturers.
Sept. 3 The city and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York were to work together to create housing in Manhattan for people with AIDS who did not need acute-care hospitalization. This was, Mr. Koch said, ''a pressing concern.''
In December 1985, the Gift of Love home opened on Washington Street, between Christopher and West 10th Streets, run by the Missionaries of Charity. It has 15 beds for homeless people with AIDS. No city funds are involved.
Sept. 6 In the University Heights section of the Bronx, 117 homes were to be built ''for a vital segment of New York City's population - middle-income families,'' Mr. Koch said. ''I look forward to welcoming 117 new homeowners into the Aqueduct Homes.''
The project, Aqueduct Avenue New Homes, was to be completed in 1987. But the original builder defaulted. Another developer built nine homes and then defaulted. The balance of the project has been awarded to a third developer, who is to build 110 two-family homes beginning this fall.
Sept. 9 The Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza Hotel, operated by Hilton Hotels, was to be developed as part of a 29-story complex across from the State Supreme Court Building. The Mayor said Hilton's decision ''reaffirms Brooklyn's position as America's newest, most desirable business address.''
Construction was expected to begin in 1986. Nothing has happened yet. What is missing is an office tenant and the search for one was complicated by the market collapse. City development officials said there have been serious lease negotiations and that Hilton is still part of the project.
Sept. 9 In virtually his last formal statement before the primary, Mayor Koch announced ''another major coup'' for New York - that the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company would keep its headquarters in Manhattan, in a tower to be built by the developer George Klein at 60 Wall Street.
''If I wanted this to be nonpartisan, I would have announced this on Wednesday,'' the Mayor said. And, he added, ''I would have had to have my head examined.''
The tower is nearing completion.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV SAYS INTERNAL ENEMIES ENDANGER CHANGE

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 9

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said tonight that his program of change was endangered by internal enemies who have whipped up public alarm and disorder.
In his first appearance after a monthlong vacation during which the country has been rattled by ethnic unrest and economic anxiety, the Soviet leader condemned the protest strikes that have spread through several republics, and asserted that conservatives and radicals were trying to push the country to the brink of instability.
 
Warning to Nationalists
''In this multivoice choir, we can hear threats of approaching chaos and talk of a threatened coup, and even of civil war,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''It is a fact that some people would like to create in this society an atmosphere of alarm, a feeling that there is no way out, a feeling of uncertainty.'' 
''We should not fall for this,'' he said. ''We should not halt in our tracks, but continue along the road of planned change.'' [In Washington, officials said that in recent months, a feeling has spread through the upper reaches of the Bush Administration that Mr. Gorbachev's policies have an increasingly poor chance of success over the long term. Page 16.] A Somber Address Somber in tone, the televised 25-minute address was evidently intended as a warning to nationalist movements challenging the Communist Party's authority and to conservatives who hope for a reassertion of central authority.
Mr. Gorbachev appeared to have meant his comments in part as a rebuttal to the senior party conservatives Viktor M. Chebrikov and Yegor K. Ligachev, two Politburo members who have issued dire warnings in the last two weeks about the dangers of nationalist disorder.
In a speech published today in Pravda, the Communist Party daily, Mr. Ligachev said that if ethnic discord and strikes continue, ''the disintegration of the Union of Soviet Republics is inevitable.''
Mr. Gorbachev did not specifically mention the Baltic independence movements that have recently come under fierce Kremlin attack, but they were clearly on his mind.
In the month since Mr. Gorbachev left for his annual vacation in the Crimea, tensions have risen over the Baltic movements, which dispute the legitimacy of Soviet power in their republics and demand the right to decide whether they will remain within the Soviet federation.
The Communist Party has issued a scathing denunciation of the movements, and Mr. Gorbachev interrupted his holiday to telephone the Lithuanian Communist Party leader and say that talk of secession is intolerable.
Rumors circulated in the Baltics that the Kremlin might use military force to restore control. The Lithuanian Communist Party chief, Algirda Brazauskas, warned that the use of force could not be ruled out if the independence movement raced out of control.
 
No Tolerance for Strikes
Russian-speaking minorities angered by restrictive new laws on languages and voting rights have held protest strikes in Estonia and Moldavia, a non-Baltic republic. Strike committees have been organized in Lithuanian factories, with the support of local Communist Party officials.
In Azerbaijan, factories and railroads were idled by nationalists demanding political autonomy and a tougher line in the republic's territorial dispute with its neighbor, Armenia.
Mr. Gorbachev said the country ''cannot tolerate'' such disruptions of the economy.
''If we take this path for solving problems, it can have very dangerous consequences for this soviety,'' he said. ''These problems must be solved by other methods, in a timely way, so that they do not spread and take on a malignant character.''
 
Platform on Ethnic Issues
Mr. Gorbachev's remarks came as the Communist Party Central Committee was preparing for a special plenary meeting later this month to approve a party platform on ethnic issues, offering republics and local governments greater economic and political autonomy.
Popular-front groups in several republics have asserted that the party's proposal keeps too much power in Moscow's hands.
The Soviet leader conceded that measures aimed at reviving the economy had not yet produced results, and predicted that ''unpopular, tough and, to a certain extent, painful measures'' may be required to make the economy more productive.
He did not specify any new measures he had in mind.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees No Early Accord With Iran on Hostages

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has concluded that despite hints that Iran would like a deal for the release of American hostages, Teheran's new leadership has not decided to act, and Government officials say it could be a long time before it does.
Iran is heading in a more pragmatic direction since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on June 3, the officials say, but there is no indication that its new leaders have decided that helping to free the eight Americans held hostage in Lebanon would have political benefits. And the officials say domestic considerations will be decisive in Iran's handling of the hostage affair.
As a result, since Washington has no military option and since it is unwilling to bargain with Teheran, Administration officials have concluded that the White House can do little but wait for the Iranian leadership to be politically inclined and politically able to work for the hostages' release. 
Israeli officials say they understand that the best favor they can do the Administration - and United States-Israeli relations - is to prevent the issue from becoming contentious by saying as little as possible about the hostage situation or the fate of the captured Lebanese spiritual leader they are holding, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid.
Alluding to the appointment by Iran's President, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, of a new Government made up largely of American-trained technocrats and individuals committed more to economic development than spreading revolutionary gospel, an Administration policy maker said:
''Things in Iran are changing for the better, but more has to happen. Sometimes one has to be patient, which should not be confused with a lack of interest. Simply because we are not launching 100 high-profile initiatives every day does not mean that we are not involved or concerned. But tactically, one has to be patient and allow things to work themselves out.''
As Administration analysts see it, the core of the problem is that the taking of hostages was not simply an Iranian foreign policy decision, which could easily be reversed. Rather, it was part of the essential theology of Iran's revolution, which was to punish the United States for involvement in Iran.
''The hostages are part of the legacy of Khomeini,'' said Fouad Ajami, an expert on Iran at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''They were taken on his watch. The new Iranian regime has to decide what will be a decent interval between Khomeini's death and a deal for the hostages. It is Iran's call. The Bush Administration cannot speed up the course of Iranian history.''
Even movement toward greater pragmatism in Teheran will not automatically lead to a solution of the hostage crisis, State Department analysts say. For instance, President Rafsanjani may conclude that it will be an asset to hold onto the hostages to keep hard-liners at bay while he tries to revamp his economy with Western aid.
On Monday, Iranian press reports quoted Ali Mohammed Besharati, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister, as saying that as ''a sign of good will, the United States should denounce the interference in Iranian affairs by previous Administrations and release the Iranian assets with no conditions.''
''They keep requesting that we make the first move,'' a State Department official said. ''And that is just not going to happen.''
Even if Iran makes a strategic decision to work for the release of the American hostages, it would only be the beginning of the process, State Department experts say. The Lebanese families and political organizations holding the hostages derive certain benefits from their captives that will not be easy to compensate for.
For the pro-Iranian Lebanese militia known as the Party of God, its hostages are insurance against a large-scale Israeli strike on its bases in southern Lebanon, Israeli officials say.
For the smaller groups, the hostages are their ticket to political influence in Lebanon. For Syria, the presence of American hostages in areas of Lebanon they control means that Washington can never ignore Damascus when it comes to Middle East peacemaking.

HEADLINE: Birth Control Making Inroads in Populous Kenya

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KAMU THANGA, Kenya

 BODY:
Kenya's birth rate has dropped, the first sign that the rate of population growth, the highest in the world, may be slowing, a Government survey shows.
In the last five years, the average number of children per Kenyan woman of childbearing age has dropped from 7.7 to 6.7, according to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey of 1989.
''When we see this kind of result, we are very excited,'' said Prof. H. W. O. Okoth-Ogendo, director of the Population Studies Research Institute at Nairobi University, which alerted the nation to the severity of its population problem a decade ago.
 
Hoping for an African Trend
Some specialists heralded the result as good news not only for Kenya but for other African nations where births have been rising beyond the ability of already weak economies to keep pace. 
''This is the first significant decline in fertility in Africa ever. And it may be a precursor for other African countries with high population-growth rates,'' said Steven W. Sinding, director of the United States Agency for International Development's mission in Kenya. The agency financed the survey conducted by the Kenyan Government's Council for Population and Development.
Mr. Sinding said the results should help demonstrate that Africa is not the ''hopeless case'' many demographers suggest it is.
 
More Data Needed
It was hoped that the results of a national census taken last week would confirm that the total population-growth rate had fallen, Professor Okoth-Ogendo said. But it will not be possible to calculate growth until after full census results, due at the end of the year, because population growth involves the number of deaths as well as births.
One of the reasons for Kenya's population increase, specialists say, has been the combination of fewer infant deaths, the result of a better health-care system, with the higher number of births.
The World Bank estimates Kenya's annual population growth rate at 4.1 percent, based on data from the 1979 census. Kenya's Planning Ministry says the growth rate is 3.7 percent, a figure based on indirect measurements taken since the last census. By comparison, the population-growth rate in the United States is 0.7 percent a year, and in France, 0.4 percent.
There are 23.3 million people living in Kenya, according to 1988 official figures. Population experts said the decline in the number of children Kenyan women are having was attributable to several factors.
 
Will and Prosperity
These include the political will of President Daniel arap Moi's Government to promote family planning, a well-developed rural health system that can deliver contraceptive services, and the widening realization that families are financially better off with fewer chldren. Traditionally in Africa, large families have been viewed as a sign of economic well-being and as a way to better insure a secure old age.
''Economic performance has a lot to do with it,'' Professor Okoth-Ogendo said. ''We find women who are working are contracepting at a higher rate. The economy is a powerful stimulus to fertility decline.''
The survey showed that 27 percent of married women are using some method of birth control. Two-thirds were using ''modern methods'' - the pill, intrauterine devices, injections, sterilization or periodic abstinence.
The diaphragm is rarely used, and the condom has been very unpopular until the advent of AIDS, which has caused an increase in its use.
 
Some Things Never Change
Traditional methods of birth control range from prolonged breast-feeding, periodic abstinence due to taboos and herbal remedies.
In 1984, a survey on the prevalence of contraception found that just 18 percent of married women used some form of contraception.
As pleased as he said he was about the decline in births, Professor Ogoth-Okendo struck some warning notes.
''We are worried about the wide differentiation between contraceptive use on a regional level,'' he said.
In the eastern province, 40 percent of married women were using contraceptives. In other areas, contraceptive use was as low as 6 percent.
And the professor noted another disturbing sign. ''We are still dealing with the fact that 60 to 70 percent of the women are in their reproductive stages - aged 15 to 49,'' he said.
 
Bringing Pills to the People
The acceptability of contraceptives was evident at a clinic run by the Family Planning Association of Kenya here in the village of Kamu Thanga, 50 miles east of Nairobi.
Joyce Wambua, 36 years old and the mother of seven children, said she had been convinced four years ago by a family-planning field worker that she would be financially better off if she stopped having children. Noting the beginning of her oldest child's schooling, she recalled:
''Things are very expensive. Our first was in Form 1 at school, and by that stage, I had one child every year after that.'' Her husband was at first reluctant to limit the size of the family. ''He wanted to know how long I wanted to rest from having children. I said just three years. After three years, he told me he didn't want any more.''
There is optimism, as well, from the village leader, Dick Ndunda, 54, who arranged for the clinic to be established six years ago in the local mud-brick, tin-roofed community center. Mr. Ndunda said he was beginning to see clear signs of fewer births here. ''Every year they were admitting 200 girls and boys in the primary school,'' he said. ''Now there are only 80 admissions.''
His own family is also a startling example. ''I have given birth to so many children,'' he said, acknowledging after several questions that he had 12 children. But his 35-year-old son, he said, was different. ''He and his wife have three children, and will have no more,'' he said proudly.
Mr. Sinding, the Agency for International Development official, said he had noticed during visits to rural areas in the last three years that such a dramatic reduction in family size from the 40-to-50 age group to the 20-to-30 group was not unusual.

HEADLINE: U.S. Unease on Gorbachev: How Exposed Is He?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Sept. 9

 BODY:
In the last few months, a feeling has spread through the upper reaches of the Bush Administration that the policies of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, have an increasingly poor chance of success over the long term.
While President Bush has repeatedly declared that he wants to see Mr. Gorbachev succeed - and that remains the predominant view within the Government - Administration officials say that events of the last few months have brought into stark relief the extent of the problems unleashed by Mr. Gorbachev's moves to open up Soviet society. In particular, they point to the miners' strike, the sputtering, empty-shelf Soviet economy and nationalist unrest in the Baltic states.
For the first time, officials say, analysts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Intelligence Council and the Pentagon have begun looking seriously at the implications for the United States of increasing ethnic turmoil in the Soviet Union, caused by the desire openly expressed by non-Russian nationalities to have more self-rule. These campaigns range from a desire for more local autonomy to outright secession from the Soviet Union. 
 
Provocation and Harsh Reply
The situation in the Baltic republics - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all of which were independent between the two world wars - has been the most acute, and prompted an unusually harsh Central Committee warning last month. That warning has led to heightened concerns in the Baltics, where some spokesmen have talked about the possibility of Moscow's using force to quell their nationalism.
A major concern for Administration officials is that Baltic nationalists might ignore the Central Committee warning, to which Mr. Gorbachev subscribes, not to press their separatist demands too far, and thereby force the Soviet leader into a crackdown that would have the same political repercussions in the West as China's suppression of the democracy movement in June in Tiananmen Square.
''It would mean the end of perestroika, at least for a while,'' a Soviet specialist in the Administration said, referring to Mr. Gorbachev's program of economic and political restructuring. ''It would lead to a fight within the Western alliance as to how harshly we should react, and it would destroy whatever confidence that people were starting to have in Gorbachev. We would be back at Square 1. What we would like to say to the Balts, but can't, is, Remember, you got as far as you have today because of Gorbachev.''
 
Grip on Power Likely
Although acknowledging that no one can predict political events in the Soviet Union, most Administration officials believe that because Mr. Gorbachev has shown himself to be such an adroit politician - by the way he co-opted the striking miners, kept a tenuous lid on the Baltic nationalists, and winnowed out opponents from the army command and Communist Party while building an independent power base in the Supreme Soviet and the Presidency - he is likely to remain in power for the next few years, at least.
The effect of these somewhat conflicting perceptions of Mr. Gorbachev and his prospects has been to leave senior Bush Administration policymakers with a continued feeling that they can, and should, exploit the Soviet leader's need for arms-control deals that will better enable him to use resources and energy to address his domestic woes, but to do so in ways that will insure that the United States can reverse any arrangement as fast as the Soviet Union can - should Moscow be gripped by instability, or Mr. Gorbachev swept away.
To the extent that there is a ''vision'' animating the approach of the Bush Administration to the Soviet Union today, it is shaped by these sorts of practical, day-to-day analyses and caluculations, which are constantly being reviewed and changed in light of events. Officials concede that there is no overarching strategy guiding the Administration, and that the President's stated theme of going ''beyond'' a policy of containing the Soviet Union to one of integrating it into ''the community of nations'' is a nice public- relations goal but no road map for daily decisions.
''People are now much more conscious of his difficulties,'' a senior Administration official said of the Soviet leader. ''Gorbachev obviously has problems. He would like to concentrate on his domestic problems and that means that he would at least like stability, if not progress, with the United States. That gives us a real opportunity, and I think we ought to pursue that. But I think the kinds of agreements we make ought to be those made with an eye to the possibility that if the present situation is reversed, we can recover at least as fast as the Soviet Union.''
 
Withdraw, Then Destroy
Citing an example of such an approach, the senior official pointed to the Administration's handling of the conventional-arms negotiations in Vienna, where the United States has continued to insist that both it and the Soviet Union not only withdraw troops and hardware from Europe, but also demobilize the withdrawn soliders and destroy the equipment.
''If troop withdrawals mean just pulling U.S. and Soviet forces out of Europe - say behind the Urals and back to the United States - that's a bad deal,'' this official said. ''Why a bad deal? Because of the geographical and political asymmetry. They are 10 days away. While once we get troops out of Europe, they are not going back, absent some enormous crisis.
''Therefore, how do you make them more symmetrical? You do it by saying that any troops that are withdrawn have to be demobilized. Those are the kinds of things we need to look at as we go through arms control so that we are not left out there naked in the event of a turnaround. Within that framework, I think that we can still do a lot that is in our interest.''
Another Administration analyst said of European affairs said: ''This is no time for grand strategy. There are too many mixed signals and impressions coming from the Soviet Union. The only way is to move step by step and try to respond to a general trend there, and not any single event.''
 
Timing of a Summit
This explains, in large part, why President Bush has been wavering about whether to set a date for a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev -something that will be a topic for discussion between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, at their meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Sept. 22. A summit meeting, by its nature, would require the Administration to make up its mind more clearly how it perceives Mr. Gorbachev and how far it wants to go with him.
When a senior official was asked whether Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze would set a summit date, he said equivocally, ''I think we would rather let developments determine the time a summit was appropriate, especially a first summit for the Administration, rather than let a date drive the negotiations.''
Interviews with policy makers make it clear that they came into office with a cautious attitude toward Mr. Gorbachev fed largely by their lingering doubts as to whether he was ''for real'' as a reformer. They are still cautious about how to deal with him. But now their caution is being fed by the mounting awareness that he is indeed for real - in fact, as one official put it, ''too real'' - and that his far-reaching policies may have set in motion a centrifugalprocess that could unsettle the entire country.
''When I look at what has been happening in the Soviet Union,'' a top Administration official said, ''I have to say to myself: the reformability of its system is open to serious question. You have a multi-ethnic empire beginning to show that it is still a multi-ethnic empire and was never assimilated into a single state. I see an economy in which you can't reform one part without reforming another. It is like an onion that you keep peeling off one layer of problems and find another layer underneath.
''On top of it all,'' the official added, ''you have given people the right to complain, and plenty to complain about, at the same time. So I ask myself, what are the chances of his pulling this off, and the answer is not much. Any shred of optimism I have left rests on Gorbachev's own personal adroitness.''
 
Dealings Will Continue
This sense of his adroitness is both crucial and widespread within the Government. It explains in part why despite the mounting pessimism about Mr. Gorbachev's prospects for success, no one in the Administration is prepared to argue that there is no use doing any serious business with the Soviet leader in areas like arms control and resolving regional conflicts.
Many Administration officials believe that short of a major upheaval galvanizing broad opposition, Mr. Gorbachev will probably hold onto the reins of power, despite what is bound to be a very bumpy road in the next few years.
Even in the event that Mr. Gorbachev were toppled or forced to become a hard-liner himself to survive, a majority of top Administration officials -including the President, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft - are inclined to believe that the reformist trend he set in motion would eventually have to be continued by his successor because of domestic economic needs.
There is, though, a minority sentiment - represented by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Vice President Dan Quayle, in particular - who believe it is not impossible that instead of Mr. Gorbachev succeeding Mr. Gorbachev, ''Stalin would succeed Gorbachev,'' an Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Opposition Leader From Soviet Union Begins Visit to U.S.

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin, the Soviet populist opposition leader, arrived in the United States yesterday and said he had come to learn more about ''the American experience in democracy.''
''You have more than 200 years' experience in democratic government, although bourgeois democracy,'' Mr. Yeltsin said. ''We're just getting out of the egg.''
The silver-haired, former Politburo member was beaming as he arrived at Kennedy International Airport for an eight-day visit of lectures and economic and political contacts. On his blue suit, he proudly wore the red button of a member of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.
''I want to see the Washington Monument, museums, libraries and cultural treasures; I also want to see you,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, waving to the large crowd of journalists gathered at the airport. It was Mr. Yeltsin's first visit to this country and it was the first non-official visit by a leading Soviet politician, organizers said.
 
Gorbachev's Popularity
The Soviet opposition leader said that he also had come to talk about the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and ''how to make major improvements.'' Specifically, he said the Soviet Union wanted ''reduced armaments'' and ''much greater economic cooperation.''
In an exchange with journalists in the Pan Am terminal, Mr. Yeltsin spoke in Russian through an interpreter. He responded without hesitation to delicate questions like whether President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's popularity was slipping. ''It's been falling some lately,'' Mr. Yeltsin said.
When asked about the role of the opposition, Mr. Yeltsin said: ''Our leaders don't like this word; we call it pluralism. We do have a minority group in parliament.''
He declined to comment on the current unrest in the Balkans and in Armenia, saying that he preferred to address those issues at a press conference in the next couple of days.

HEADLINE: New Job for Aide Who Quit Bush Campaign

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Frederick V. Malek, who resigned a high-level post in George Bush's Presidential campaign last year while denying charges of anti-Semitism, will soon be appointed by Mr. Bush to a White House post, Administration officials said today.
The officials said Mr. Malek's job would be to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations, to be held in the spring in the United States, at a site to be selected. They said the appointment was awaiting only a security clearance and an examination of Mr. Malek's finances. One of the officials said Mr. Malek would not be paid in the part-time but significant post. 
 
Malek Denies a Bias Act
Mr. Malek resigned last Sept. 11 as a high-level campaign adviser to Mr. Bush and as a top deputy to the chairman of the Republican National Committee after acknowledging that in 1971, at the behest of President Richard M. Nixon, he drew up a list of important Jewish officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mr. Malek, who was a special assistant to Mr. Nixon, emphatically denied when he resigned from the Bush camaign that he had engaged in an anti-Semitic act.
Mr. Malek said he had prepared the list after Mr. Nixon complained that a ''Jewish cabal'' had tried to undercut his record on the economy. Two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to less visible jobs within the Labor Department. Mr. Malek said he had nothing to do with those personnel actions and would have refused to have become involved in the matter if he had been asked.
Since then, Mr. Malek has spoken privately to numerous Jewish groups and leaders in New York and Washington, asserting that he is not anti-Semitic and explaining that he provided the list under intense pressure from Mr. Nixon, who asked him five times.
White House officials said they were fairly convinced that Mr. Malek's appointment would not stir widespread opposition by Jewish groups.
Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said in a telephone interview: ''I don't think the American Jewish community will object to an appointment. Mr. Malek has in the last several months met members of the Jewish community and in conversations with them and in an article he's written for the Jewish press has apologized for his behavior many years ago and has put it behind him.'' Mr. Malek, who has known Mr. Bush since 1972 and is a member of his kitchen cabinet, is a wealthy businessman in Washington. Currently, the 52-year-old Mr. Malek is co-chairman of Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, co-chairman of Caterair International, the company formed to acquire the Marriott chain's airline catering business, and is on the board of directors of Northwest Airlines.
 
An Earlier Derailment
Adminisration officials said that Mr. Malek was slated to be appointed to a major job in the Administration, possibly even chief of staff, until the controversy broke over his role in the Nixon Administration. When Mr. Malek resigned from the Bush campaign he said it was ''because of my belief that nothing should interfere with the Vice President's victory in November.''
Within recent months Mr. Malek has met privately with the President on social occasions. Officials said that Mr. Malek has been offered at least one high-level job in the Administration, which would not have required Senate approval, but turned it down, partly because he did not want to revive the earlier controversy.
Officials indicated that the new post would involve coordinating with the White House and other Government agenices in arranging the economic summit of seven major indutrialized nations next year to be held in the United States. There has been some speculation that the summit will be held, at Mr. Bush's request, in Texas. This year's summit was held in Paris.

HEADLINE: 1,400 Hairstons Honor Kinship Born of Slavery

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C., Sept. 4

 BODY:
The Hairstons held their annual family reunion here this weekend, not far from two of the plantations where their forebears toiled as slaves or ruled as masters.
For Peter W. Hairston, who is white, and Collie Hairston, who is black, their common heritage in the world of the pre-Civil War plantations was not very far away. In the 124 years since the end of the Civil War, some descendants of the white owners retain their elite positions as well as ownership of much of the vast plantations that were the economic and social backbone of the Old South.
And many descendants of the slaves, in a generation-by-generation improvement, have moved into the professions, the clergy, the military, business and the arts. 
In a remarkable celebration by a clan that may be the most extensively documented group of descendants of slaves, 1,400 black Hairstons came from 14 states to their four-day reunion here. Their ancestors, like many slaves, adopted the name of their former masters when slavery ended because they had known no other surname.
 
Handful of Whites Welcomed
While the reunion was overwhelmingly a black affair, a handful of white Hairstons attended and were warmly welcomed, especially Peter Hairston, a 76-year-old retired Superior Court judge, who is the clan's historian.
With the ''Hairston Clan Reunion'' emblazoned on baseball caps, T-shirts and bumper stickers, they poured into the Radisson Hotel for four days of dances, dinners, a barbecue and meetings to promote scholarships and kinship among white and black Hairstons.
The local Hairstons have been meeting every third Sunday for 58 years. Since the early 1930's Jester J. Hairston, a composer, conductor, actor and 88-year-old patriarch, has called every Hairston he could in the telephone books of towns and cities he traveled through. Some were white and some black, and most were curious about the history of the family.
In 1936, he recounted, after he appeared on a radio show in Los Angeles, he received a call from a listener named Hairston who wondered if they were related. He recited the Scottish origins of the white Hairstons and the listener was convinced they were related. ''I told her we must be cousins, but I didn't tell her I was the grandson of a slave,'' he said.
 
Surprised at Dinner Meeting
He met the listener for dinner and her confused surprise at meeting a black Hairston turned to amusement and curiosity. That meeting 53 years ago with Clara Hairston was apparently the start of the black Hairstons' efforts to incorporate the whites into the family gatherings.
That effort continues, organizers of the reunion said, as the family plans to establish state chapters in Georgia and Michigan.
Judge Hairston is the sixth-generation owner of Cooleemee, one of the Hairston plantations 20 miles southwest of High Point along the Yadkin River. With 4,200 acres during its heyday in the early 1800's, Cooleemee retains 2,300 acres of farmland and woods along with a columned house listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
To the north, the judge's brother, Nelson George Hairston, the Philip Keenan Professor of Zoology at the University of North Carolina, is a family owner of Saura Town, with about 6,000 acres.
 
Stories of the Plantations
Judge Hairston noted that his brother was one of four Hairstons listed in an edition of Who's Who a few years ago. The others were black, including Maj. Gen. Guy Edward Hairston Jr. of the Air Force.
Memories of the plantation for many of the Hairston blacks are limited to stories from grandparents or great-grandparents. But others, like Collie Hairston, who lives outside Camden, N.J., have more immediate remembrances.
In a photo from 1922 in ''The Cooleemee Plantation and its People,'' an account written by Judge Hairston in 1986, a young Collie Hairston, another black Hairston youth and a young white Hairston are shown, their arms around each other, laughing in a scene of adolescent playfulness.
''I can't tell you what it means to come here, to have this family,'' Collie Hairston said at one of the many parties during the reunion. The sentiment was echoed by many at the reunion, the 16th held by the National Hairston Clan.
 
Hairstons Marrying Hairstons
''Seeing these people, knowing we have the same background, that we are a family that goes way back is very important to me,'' said Joseph Henry Hairston, a black 67-year-old retired lawyer from Washington. ''But believe me, it can get very complicated.''
The complications arise from the practice of Hairstons' marrying Hairstons, who presumably are not blood relations.
The retired lawyer noted that the maiden name of his wife's half brother is Hairston. And while their fathers were different men, both were named Hairston. The retired judge's great-great-uncle Robert married the mother-in-law of his younger brother, Sam. ''Her name was Hairston also,'' said Peter Hairston.
The founder of the Hairston clan was Peter Hairston, born about 1695 in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, who came to America in 1729 and died in 1780. By 1851, a publication called The Richmond Whig termed a descendant, Samuel H. Hairston, the largest slaveholder in the country. By the Civil War, the Hairston plantations were spread over Virginia, North Carolina and Mississippi. Much of the land is still retained by Hairstons and their relations.
The black and white Hairstons have retained one vocal distinction. The blacks pronounce the name HAIR-ston, while the whites retain a Scottish ring with HOS-tin.

HEADLINE: TOXIC SITE CLEANUP REPORTED LAGGING

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Sept. 9

 BODY:
Only 34 of the 1,175 worst toxic waste dumps in the United States were cleaned in the first eight years of a program intended to solve the problem, and polluters paid less than a tenth of the cost, the Rand Corporation said in a report made public Friday.
In a statement summarizing a study of the Superfund cleanup program, Rand, a nonprofit research organization, said: ''Superfund has been super slow at cleaning up toxic waste sites, spending available funds and recovering its outlays from those who did the polluting.''
The study, which was done by Rand's Institute for Civil Justice, covers the Environmental Protection Agency's accomplishments from 1980, when the program was created, to September 1988.
''The bottom line is that we passed legislation that could have permitted as much as $10 billion of Federal money to start cleaning up hazardous waste sites,'' said the author of the study, Jan Paul Acton. 
''Congress has appropriated only about half that amount, and E.P.A. has only spent a quarter of that amount,'' he added. ''What we've got is a gap between the rhetoric and the reality.''
 
Only 34 Sites Cleaned
Of the 1,175 toxic waste sites that the environmental agency has placed on its National Priority List for immediate attention, only 34 have been declared clean, the study found. As many as 30,000 dumps may have to be cleaned eventually.
The report also said the environmental agency spent only $2.6 billion of the $4.5 billion appropriated by Congress from 1980 to 1988 for cleanup projects. Of the $2.6 billion that was spent, the report said, only $1.6 billion went directly to cleanup work; the rest was spent on management and legal costs.
The agency recovered only $230 million of the $2.6 billion from polluters, who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work, the study found.
''We think improvements are possible, but substantial progress has been made,'' said Walter Kovalick Jr., deputy director of the agency's Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, which administers the cleanup program.
 
Progress at Other Sites
While only 34 dumps had been declared clean by September 1988, Mr. Kovalick said cleanup is under way on more than 170 others. Designs for waste isolation, treatment plants or other cleanup work are being done at 230 other dumps, he added, and studies of the extent of contamination and cleanup options are under way for more than 640 sites.
The $2.6 billion that has been spent does not include formal obligations by the environmental agency to pay for work under way, Mr. Kovalick said in a telephone interview from his office in Washington. He said only a fraction of the cleanup costs had been recovered from polluters because ''it's hard to recover the money until you've finished the project.''
After William K. Reilly was appointed by President Bush as administrator of the agency, an internal review ordered by Mr. Reilly criticized the cleanup program. The administrator pledged in June to toughen the enforcement of toxic waste cleanup laws.
The Rand study said the environmental agency's sluggishness in the Reagan Administration was partly to blame for the cleanup delays. It also attributed the delays to a high staff turnover, confused management and other inefficiencies at the agency.
 
Legal Delays Cited
The study also said the cleanup effort was lagging because of court battles stemming from the requirement that the agency make polluters perform or pay for cleanup work whenever possible. If companies responsible for pollution cannot be identified or no longer exist, the Government pays under the Superfund law.
Mr. Acton, the author of the study, said that when the law comes before Congress for renewal in 1991, lawmakers may want to ask whether the attempt to make polluters pay for the cleanup costs is worth the delay. He suggested that the nation clean up the dumps the way it builds highways, with taxpayers footing the bill.
That possibility was criticized by Linda Greer, technical director of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, which represents companies that do cleanup work.
''There is no inherent reason E.P.A. cannot go ahead and aggressively clean up these sites, then go back to the responsible parties and get the money,'' she said. ''There's no reason for the American taxpayer to pay for industrial dumping.''

HEADLINE: Yale and New Haven Become Tennis Partners

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Sept. 8

 BODY:
In an unusual marriage of town and gown, New Haven, Yale University and state representatives have cooperated to bring a major tennis tournament to New Haven.
Officials announced Wednesday that in 1990, the Volvo International, a male tournament that is a warm-up for the United States Open, will move from Stratton, Vt., to grounds near the Yale Bowl, more than a mile west of the university's campus.
The plan calls for building a 15,000-seat grandstand and a 3,000-seat stadium on Yale athletic fields, to be paid for with a $15 million state bond issue. Several new courts will be built, and Yale's existing courts will be resurfaced. 
 
City and Yale Will Share Profits
In a complicated revenue sharing plan, the city agreed to forego taxes and Yale agreed to forego ground rental charges. Instead, the city will receive 50 percent of all profits from the tournament, and the university will receive 40 percent. The remaining 10 percent will go to a nonprofit Tennis Foundation.
Hollis Young, New Haven's acting development administrator, said a key part of the city's interest in the project was a commitment of a $100,000 annual donation to the city's youth tennis program.
Over the next 20 years, officials said, the Volvo is expected to attract more than 2.3 million people to New Haven and to generate nearly $450 million.
Officials from city and state govenment and the university and local business leaders developed the proposal in meetings since February.
Steve Heintz, Connecticut Commissioner of Economic Development, said the tournament's move to New Haven showed improved relations between Yale and the city in the last 10 years. Because Yale owns so much property, New Haven's tax base is small, and the university and the city have often had conflicting interests.
Cooperation was ''unprecedented'' to draw the tennis tournament to the city, said Sheila Wellington, the Secretary of the university.
 
'Trust Level Is Growing'
''A group of people over time have kind of gotten used to working together and comfortable with each other,'' she said. ''The trust level is growing. When the city government views Yale as a potential for partnership rather than adversarially, there's a kind of synergy that makes things possible.''
In the last decade, the university has increased its involvement in New Haven's economy, most notably in developing Science Park, where major technological corporations have been drawn. More recently, under Yale's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the university has begun to invest in city development.
But Ms. Young and others who worked on the tennis tournament proposal, which involves Yale in a commercial development, said the university's participation was untraditional.
At Yale, where administrators are grappling with a long list of buildings needing renovation, the athletic department has had to become entrepreneurial, said Forrest Temple, associate director of finance and administration.
''We have a substantial number of assets which we only use very infrequently,'' he said. ''We're trying to do the best we can to better utilize them and realize funds that can be put back into renovation.'' Mr. Temple said Yale also hoped to attract a minor league baseball team to its stadium, which also needs refurbishing.
The tennis tournament's move from the mountains of Vermont to a crowded city will require a new marketing approach, said Jim Westhall, director of the tournament. ''We're trying to create an atmosphere on the campus of Yale that everyone will fall in love with,'' he said.
Mr. Westhall said Yale's prestige and cultural scene made it naturally attractive. ''I think that New Haven and the State of Connecticut, over a period of time, will sell well, as well.''

HEADLINE: MUSIC VIEW;
Notes From Between The Sheets?

BYLINE: By Donal Henahan

 BODY:
The speculation in this space recently about Schubert's underground sexual life, as explored in documentary detail by the musicologist Maynard Solomon, brought two typical, if opposed, reactions from readers.
One view - let us call it the Keatsian Imperative - was summed up in this way by an angry indicter of all such psychobiographical efforts: ''We know from his music that Schubert was a man with an exceptionally rich emotional life which reflects universal emotions of all mankind throughout their entire range. That is all we need to know.'' In other words, beauty is truth, truth beauty, end of discussion. 
An early biographer of Mozart, F. X. Niemetschek, argued similarly in 1808 when he excused himself for deleting from his book some of the composer's self-destructive personality flaws: ''A desire to be fair to a man of such merit demands that we try to wipe out such blemishes from the portraits of the great. If the same fairness is shown to Mozart, as one would wish shown to oneself, even then he could not serve as a model of economy and thrift. It is true, he should have been more careful with his money; but is a genius not allowed any weaknesses or failings?'' Here we see operating not only the Keatsian but the Kantian imperative: the Golden Rule.
Such a blinkered, hands-off approach to biography, although never out of fashion, does not satisfy everyone. Recalcitrant humanists persist in wondering if there may not be vital, discoverable connections between personality and art. They do not avert their eyes when historians speculate about the possible effects of Beethoven's deafness on his music, or of his pretense to nobility. A logical linkage between Schumann's madness and his weaker late works is not automatically rejected as defamation of the dead. ''In fact,'' writes one person of this skeptical persuasion, ''who is to say whether certain psychological 'aberrations' may not actually produce the very climate essential for genius to show itself?''
A different sort of idealism underlies that suggestion. In extreme cases, it takes the form of the mad-genius theory: great art, by definition a deviation from the norm, can only be produced by bohemians, garret inhabitants, the near-insane and other social sports or misfits. (New York City's famous Downtown Imperative follows naturally from this: Art is whatever is produced in lofts.) Implicitly, at least, most artists and estheticians believe that an artist's work, place in society and personality connect somehow, somewhere. Finding and explaining these points of convergence are what musical biography is largely about. It makes little sense to say that Wagner the man and Wagner's works, say, run parallel into infinity, never touching at any point.
In this respect, I have been especially fascinated by ''Mozart in Person: His Character and Health,'' an engrossing collection of articles by Peter J. Davies. Mr. Davies, whose exhaustive investigations of Mozartian fact and myth have been appearing piecemeal in British musical journals for several years, gathered his findings into an invaluable Greenwood Press volume earlier this year. Much of the documentation consists of rounding up and assessing nearly two centuries of medical opinions about Mozart's illnesses and death. I can especially recommend the book to the person who wrote me, regarding Mr. Solomon's attempt to probe into Schubert's medical history: '' . . . Solomon has some nerve attempting to diagnose a dead person he never saw. Not even M. D.'s do that!''
But, as all Mozart idolaters know, M. D.'s by the dozen have been busy at that for nearly two centuries. The Mozart literature overflows with treatises by doctors willing and eager to diagnose a dead composer they never saw. The following ailments have been deduced from what these experts read as the medical evidence: arsenic poisoning, miliary fever, brain tumor, rheumatic fever, neurosyphilis, pulmonary tuberculosis, typhus, grippe, streptococcal infection, infectious polyarthritis, extreme coprolalia (though probably not Tourette's syndrome), dropsy, bacterial endocarditis, hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease, uremic coma, complications from venesections, Schonlein-Henoch syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage and immune-complex disease.
Furthermore, Mr. Davies infers, Mozart suffered from cyclothymic disorder (hypomanic swings of euphoria and melancholy), chronic extradural hematoma (probably from a head injury) and recurrent blackouts (formerly thought, erroneously, to be caused by epilepsy). If all that were not enough to keep any man from productive work, Mozart also was afflicted by what we now recognize as the Pete Rose syndrome. He gambled so compulsively and self-destructively that some of his close friends, unlike the soft-hearted Niemetschek, could not excuse his excesses or the bad effect gambling had on his family and his health. They probably would have thought long about voting him into the Musical Hall of Fame.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Anthems and Troubadours That Stirred Crowds to Protest

BYLINE: By HEIDI WALESON; Heidi Waleson writes frequently about music.

 BODY:
On May Day 1934, in concert with laborers from around the country and the world, hundreds of workers and their supporters demonstrated in Union Square in New York. Their marching song was a tune just published in the left-wing weekly New Masses, ''Into the Streets May First'' - by Aaron Copland.
Mr. Copland was but one of several conservatory-trained composers who threw their talents into the movement for social change in the 1930's. Their efforts form part of a continuum of protest music that dates back to the earliest years of American history and encompasses folk, popular and art idioms. Merkin Concert Hall is about to celebrate this music with ''Voices of Change,'' a five-concert series that opens Monday evening and continues on Sept. 14, 20, 23 and 24. 
Numerous causes - battles on behalf of abolition, women's suffrage, unionism, civil rights and nuclear disarmament, and against war, poverty and hunger - have had their anthems and troubadours. ''Protest music builds a sense of solidarity, of togetherness, of 'I'm not alone - other people are dreaming these things,' '' says Eric Gordon, a consultant to the Merkin festival and the author of ''Mark the Music, '' a recent biography of Marc Blitzstein (St. Martin's Press). Neely Bruce, a professor at Wesleyan University and also a festival consultant, adds, ''Look at the effect of 'We Shall Overcome' on the civil-rights movement. Who was it who said, 'I don't care who writes a country's laws as long as I can write its songs' ?''
''Voices of Change'' will survey protest music historically and in terms of subject and musical genre. The first three concerts will be preceded by panel discussions on such subjects as ''Roots of Musical Activism'' and ''The Composer and Musician as Political Advocate.''
The opening concert, dubbed ''Free, Equal and Sober,'' presents paeans to abolition, suffrage, temperance and civil rights, and features the folk singer Odetta and the Hutchinson Family Singers, who re-create a 19th-century traveling musical group with period dress, staging and musical arrangements. Thursday's ''War and Peace,'' with the Western Wind Vocal Ensemble and the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble conducted by Rhonda Kess, documents musical responses to war, from the Revolution to recent decades. Included are patriotic songs like ''When Johnny Comes Marching Home'' and Ives's ''He Is There''; Ron Gold and Allen Ginsberg's antiwar ''Amerika,'' and a concert version of Kurt Weill's first American musical, ''Johnny Johnson.''
The semistaged ''Workers of the World'' on Sept. 20 focuses on 20th-century labor movements. Though mostly from the 30's, the music includes visions of those movements by the contemporary composers Frederic Rzewski and Christian Wolff. On Sept. 23, in a ''Folk Music Showcase,'' the Washington Sisters and Bright Morning Star perform traditional folk music as well as their own songs.
The festival concludes on Sept. 24 with ''An American Songfest,'' which will feature choral songs about labor and civil rights and conclude with Earl Robinson's patriotic cantata ''Ballad for Americans.''
The Hutchinson Family Singers, a Minnesota-based quintet that will present some of the earliest American protest music, take their name from a clan of rabble-rousing New Hampshire Yankees that flourished in the latter half of the 19th century. In various combinations that sometimes included outsiders, family members claimed to have given more than 12,000 performances around the country.
Jesse and Mary Hutchinson first presented their 13 children in concert in 1840. The family's musical activities came to center around a quartet of the children, John, Judson, Asa and Abby (baritone, tenor, bass and alto). Successive generations formed their own versions of the group, and one descendant who performed until 1896 is, at age 104, still living.
The Hutchinsons were fervent abolitionists, great favorites with political candidates and close friends of such activists as Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass. Their songs, many of which they wrote themselves, stirred up crowds. They performed abolitionist songs for General McClellan's troops on the Potomac during the Civil War and caused a riot, according to George Berglund, who leads the Minnesota Hutchinsons and has done extensive research on the family; thereafter they were banned from performing for soldiers. ''They narrowly escaped being killed by anti-abolitionists on several occasions,'' Neely Bruce adds. ''They were often run out of town.''
Mr. Berglund believes that the Hutchinsons had a profound effect on the political causes of their day - abolition, women's suffrage, sweatshops, even women's dress reform. ''They brought focus and public attention to the causes much faster,'' he says. ''Also, this was a period when national pride was really high. People were starting to turn away from European influences, and they went into ecstasies over this home-grown phenomenon.'' Mr. Bruce describes the Hutchinsons' music as ''light classical.'' ''They didn't do big hits,'' he explains. ''They considered themselves morally superior.''
The close harmony of the Hutchinsons gave way to the less complicated, more participatory songs of the labor movements early in this century. The activist Joe Hill (1879-1915) of the Industrial Workers of the World (the ''Wobblies'') was their troubadour, but his songs usually set new words to old tunes. Workers' choruses sprang up, many established along ethnic lines, which rehearsed regularly and rallied the workers. Some still endure: The Workmen's Circle Chorus, which performs in the final Merkin concert, celebrates its 75th anniversary this year.
Then came the Depression, and the heyday of the American Communist Party. Intellectuals - conservatory-trained composers among them - were caught up in the ideals of social reform. Composers such as Charles Seeger, Elie Siegmeister, Alex North, Marc Blitzstein and Aaron Copland, says Mr. Gordon, ''thought that it was criminal, given Depression conditions and the rise of Fascism, to devote their lives to art for art's sake, and turned to more proletarian-type audiences. But they went on using the avant-garde techniques they had learned - 12-tone music, Sprechstimme, advanced harmonies.
''They saw no reason to throw out modernism, but rather sought to retrain the ear of the mass audience. It was a reaction to the folk-type music of Joe Hill.''
The Composers' Collective of New York grew out of such sentiments, as did its 1934-35 ''Worker's Songbook,'' which includes such creations as ''The Scottsboro Boys Will Not Die'' by Elie Siegmeister and ''Song of the Builders'' by Charles Seeger, both of which will be performed in the ''Workers of the World'' concert by Marni Nixon and Mr. Bruce's American Music/Theater Group. Mr. Copland's ''Into the Streets May First'' was the outcome of a New Masses competition, in which Blitzstein also submitted a song.
''If you look at the texts of some of those ''Worker's Songbook'' songs now, they seem naive, even laughable,'' Mr. Gordon says, ''particularly the ones that celebrate Lenin and Stalin. But if you listen to the music, a lot of it sounds very fresh, and it was quite sophisticated. 'Into the Streets' was not an easy song - imagine hundreds of people today singing a contemporary work like that.''
The power of the left permeated high art in the 30's. Marc Blitzstein was teaching ''Social Aspects of Music'' and other courses at the Downtown Music School, intended to be a school for workers, and his scathing pro-labor work, ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' was closed down before its opening by the Works Progress Administration, which had paid for its development. Lan Adomian, whose songs appear in ''The Worker's Songbook,'' went off to fight in Spain. Plays and musicals depended on good notices in the Communist press for business.
Kurt Weill's 1936 ''Johnny Johnson'' excoriated the role of industry and the press in promoting World War I, a switch from the usual patriotic explanations. And in 1939, the socialist composer Earl Robinson played ''Ballad for Americans'' for CBS executives, who hired Paul Robeson for the solo part and broadcast the work across the country. Mr. Robinson recalls, ''I wanted to make the point that the United States had revolutionary traditions. No one objected to the revolutionary context; the only criticism was connected with Robeson, because he was black.'' ''Ballad for Americans'' became extremely popular, and had a healthy 20-year career among choirs throughout the country.
The 1930's saw the last great outpouring of socially conscious work by ''serious'' composers in the United States, and folk musicians took over as the voices of change. ''A lot of the artistic world moved in a more populist direction,'' Mr. Gordon says. ''World conditions were getting more serious, and people started to wonder, 'Can we afford the luxury of teaching the workers 12-tone music?' ''
Mr. Bruce points out that ''concert music has always been establishment music, and the patrons of that music are the church, the aristocracy and the rich, who are not the main proponents of social change. 'Serious' music composers tend not to get into these issues. Think of the Dreyfus affair: All of the French intellectuals - but none of the major French composers - signed the manifesto in support of him.'' Those who do tackle social issues are often ridiculed: Leonard Bernstein's ''Mass'' (1971), which - inspired by the protests of the 60's - dealt with rebellion against authority, was abused in some critical quarters as being sentimental and trendy.
A few living composers have continued to become socially involved, however. Christian Wolff, whose choral ''Wobbly Music,'' based on texts relating to Massachusetts mill strikes in 1912, will be presented in the ''Workers of the World'' program, calls political and social issues ''a major preoccupation'' in his work. ''I feel a responsibility to deal with these issues in my work, since I don't do it in other ways,'' he says. ''Music is the way I relate to large groups of people.''
Mr. Wolff started to bring politics into his music in the early 1970's. He based his ''Changing the System'' on a speech by the antiwar activist Tom Hayden, set songs to texts by Rosa Luxemburg and dedicated a trio to the memory of Emma Goldman. ''It's not direct agitprop,'' Mr. Wolfe says, ''but an occasion to remind people about political issues.''
Not all concert music uses a text, of course, and the extent to which instrumental music can be made overtly political is limited. Frederic Rzewski gets around this problem with melodic references to songs of protest. His ''North American Ballads,'' selections from which will be performed by Ursula Oppens in the ''Workers'' concert, are based on popular songs: ''The Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues'' is a labor song; ''Down by the Riverside'' is an antiwar gospel tune. Mr. Rzewski's piano work ''The People United Cannot Be Defeated'' comprises 36 variations on a song that was a well-known symbol of democratic resistance in Chile.
Like Mr. Wolff, Miss Oppens sees her performances of these works more as education than as a call to action. ''Memories are very short,'' she says. ''I hope that someday 'The People United' will be merely historical.''
The folk and popular musicians who dominated the social protest scene of the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam movements, however, like the Hutchinsons and the Communists and socialists of the 30's, saw their contributions as something more. Mr. Gordon thinks that today's gay and lesbian choruses, which go beyond civil rights and AIDS-related material to include other calls for social change, are the contemporary heirs of those writers and performers.
Then there is the 79-year-old Earl Robinson, who has written about everything from the founding of the United Nations and civil rights (his songs ''Black and White'' and ''Hurry Sundown'' were made famous by Three Dog Night and Peter, Paul and Mary, respectively), to a recent musical about a mythical continent destroyed by ''misuse of nuclear power.''
After musically chronicling a half-century of movements and upheavals and observing the apathy that confronts the wrenching problems of today, Mr. Robinson says he is still undiscouraged. ''I started off in the 30's writing for the strikers, and I'm still available. I believe we're on the edge of a new age of love.''
'ONCE I BUILT A TOWER TO THE SUN . . . '
So effectively did the song ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' capture its era that its title became one of the lasting symbols of the Great Depression. It will be sung by Marni Nixon in the concert ''Workers of the World'' on Sept. 24 at Merkin Hall. Here are the lyrics.
 
They used to tell me I was building a dream,
And so I followed the mob.
When there was earth to plough or guns to bear,
I was always there, right there on the job,
They used to tell me I was building a dream, with peace and glory ahead.
Why should I be standing in line just waiting for bread?
 
Once I built a railroad, made it run,
Made it race against time.
Once I built a railroad. Now it's done.
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Once I built a tower, to the sun,
Brick and rivet and lime.
Once I built a tower. Now it's done.
Brother, can you spare a dime?
 
Once in khaki suits, gee, we looked swell,
Full of that Yankee Doodle-de-dum.
Half a million boots went sloggin' thru Hell,
I was the kid with the drum.
Say, don't you remember, they called me Al.
It was Al all the time.
Say, don't you remember, I'm your pal!
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

''It's hard times city,'' Dwayne Wiggins said. ''You can't half-step here. Whatever you do, you have to be good at it.'' Mr. Wiggins is one of the three principals of Tony Toni Tone, an Oakland funk group whose debut album has emerged smartly on the national charts. He was speaking of this blue-collar city, which over the last five years has become a veritable mixing board for black American music, a studio whose sounds are thriving on at least three prominent fronts: funk, rhythm and blues, and music from the rap and hip-hop movements.
This mix of styles has made for a concerted assault on the Top 100 charts - and for a music scene as boisterous as a concert at the city's Coliseum, and as diverse as anything the region has experienced in years.
With by some estimates as many as 50 different performers recording either on independent labels or with major recording companies, Oakland - a city of 356,000 that has been viewed as a cultural second-string player beside San Francisco, its sister to the west - is emerging anew. In the parlance of the music, Oakland is ''in effect'' -meaning in vogue or just plain in. 
The re-emergence of Oakland as a musical force comes at a time when the city is suffering from urban ills that include a high crime rate, the presence of crack and cocaine in many neighborhoods, a static economy and a school system facing possible bankruptcy. But there is new construction near downtown. There are moves afoot to bring the Raiders football team back from Los Angeles. And some residents of ''Oaktown'' - as the city is affectionately called by its younger residents - see the new music as reflecting a change in civic attitude, an outlet of pride in again living large on the American stage.
In past decades, the Bay Area has produced some of rock's more celebrated performers. Fantasy Records, a Berkeley-based label, launched Creedence Clearwater Revival in the late 60's. Other groups, such as the Pointer Sisters, the Greg Kihn Band, Graham Central Station and Sly and the Family Stone have roots there. Tower of Power, a funk band whose music was a staple of dance clubs and discos in the early and mid-70's, originated in Oakland.
The city is now home base for a number of musicians; the singer Pebbles and the group Club Nouveau come from the Bay Area, as do Ace Juice and Oaktown's 3-5-7, a trio of female rappers whose new ''Wild and Loose'' album has been on the Billboard pop and black-album charts.
But three groups in particular demonstrate the diversity of the sounds originating in Oakland: M. C. Hammer, whose debut album ''Let's Get It Started'' (Capitol 90924) puts a bluesy West Coast spin on the swaggering, solipsistic style common to rap; Too Short, the rapper considered the godfather of Oakland raps, whose abrasive lyrics and bare-bones delivery have made his latest album a force on the Billboard charts; and Tony Toni Tone, a trio of singers who blend funk, R & B and soul.
Tony Toni Tone may be the most radio-ready of Oakland's young bands. The group - the brothers Dwayne and Raphael Wiggins and a cousin, Timothy Christian - gave its first performance at a wedding in Los Angeles, and continued with stints on tour with such performers as Lionel Richie and Tramaine Hawkins.
The group's 1988 debut album ''Who?'' (Wing/Polygram 835549), produced by Thomas McElroy and Denzil Foster - Oakland-based producers and two of the creative forces behind Club Nouveau - blends several musical influences, including gospel and blues, with a streetwise flavor that could perhaps have only come from Oakland. One of the album's singles, ''Little Walter,'' a cautionary tale of a drug dealer's demise, borrows its chorus from the gospel staple ''Wade in the Water.'' The record stayed on Billboard's black-music album charts for 65 weeks. The record recently went gold, and the group's second album is set for a January release. While the first album is characterized by lush, smooth, three-part harmonies and horn charts, Dwayne Wiggins said the new album will be ''more street,'' using elements of the rap sound.
Perhaps the steady rise of the rapper Too Short (whose real name is Todd Shaw) best illustrates the staying power both of rap music and of Oakland as a haven for the rap sound. The 23-year-old star's recent album ''Life Is . . . Too Short'' (Jive/RCA 1149) has sold more than 850,000 copies. Mr. Shaw started performing rap in 1980, writing his own raps - harsh, scatological ''freaky tales'' of life, real and imagined, in Oakland - and distributing them on homemade tapes he circulated through his neighborhood. After recording three albums on independent labels (one of them a label he started with friends), he caught the attention of Jive Records, which is distributed by RCA.
The newest Too Short record is a departure in style and substance from its predecessors. For one thing, most of the new release is suitable for radio airplay, a status his previous records did not enjoy. But the success of his early records is continuing. After six months, ''Life Is . . . Too Short'' remains on Billboard's chart of top black and pop albums.
If Too Short is the emeritus of Oakland's rap stars, M. C. Hammer may be the Oakland musician most likely to establish a true musical empire. Mr. Hammer parlayed his talents as a choreographer, producer and dancer into a long-term recording and production contract with Capitol Records. ''Let's Get It Started'' was certified platinum in early 1989. Since then, Mr. Hammer has been building a state-of-the-art 24-track recording studio, producing such artists as Marlon Jackson and Tracie Spencer, and - in the best tradition of Berry Gordy and Motown Records - grooming younger bands in matters of choreography, stagecraft and style.
The current creative chaos is seen as a strength, a benefit thought to be the result of the Bay Area's ethnic diversity. Even though Oakland's music scene is in many ways a free-for-all, some see it as a spectrum of flourishing musical possibilities, and evidence of a fierce civic pride.
''In the Bay Area, there's never been a central base, a central entity to set the standards,'' said David Cook, a disk jockey for KPFA in Oakland. ''People have brought their own ideas into the music. The Bay Area's always overshadowed by Los Angeles. It just hasn't been recognized for the talent it's put forth.''
''There's a real division, a schism, between San Francisco and Oakland,'' said Barry Weiss, the vice president for marketing operations for Jive Records. ''There's a real urban feel in Oakland that isn't in San Francisco. Maybe it's more affluent in San Francisco; maybe there's just more money. It's like a nationalistic pride. People in Oakland see the affluence across the bridge. They want a piece of that pie.''
To Dwayne Wiggins, his group - and the musical renaissance of which it is a part - are opportunities to give something back to the community. ''This has given a lot of people the chance to further their careers, and it's given a younger generation a sign that they can go out and make good money without doing bad things. We stand as something of a role model.''
There is already a second wave of talent emerging, regional bands that are one step from their own major followings. Digital Underground, a hip-hop group based in Berkeley, has recently signed with Tommy Boy Records, an urban dance-music label distributed by Warner Brothers Records. The group's single ''Doowutchyalike'' jumped on Billboard's top 100 singles chart in late August and has been climbing ever since. The rapper DJ Slice and Kool Rock J, a Fresno-based rap group, have signed with the Jive label and are completing their album.
The energy of the music sometimes spills over in unexpected ways. Repeated incidents of violence occurred at a July 29 concert at the Oakland Coliseum, a show starring LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Too Short, NWA and De La Soul. Five people were injured and 15 were arrested in what coliseum security officials described in news reports as ''petty skirmishes.''
Despite such rare incidents, the latest wave of music from Oakland suggests a happy blend of circumstances: a period of creativity in which both quality and quantity are abundant.
''There's a lot more going on than what you hear,'' Too Short said. ''There's rappers and singers all over. You got people who actually look up to us. They want to blame so many things on rap music. But today every other kid on every other block in the country is trying to be a rapper. When that happens, you're going to get good music.''

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Tim Robbins, Hanging Out With the Gang

BYLINE: By RICHARD B. WOODWARD; Richard B. Woodward writes frequently about the arts.

 BODY:
At about 6 feet 4, walking with a loose, shambling gait, his face dimpled and wrinkle-free, Tim Robbins looks like the overgrown kid he portrayed in the 1988 movie ''Bull Durham'' - the baby-faced pitcher with unknown potential.
In a lower Manhattan restaurant he is dressed in sweat pants and T-shirt as though he had just come from the gym. A pair of spectacles adds another touch: the bookish jock. But his speech, soft and earnest, and his determination to talk about theater, and not Hollywood business, dispels his popular image as a large, charming goofball. He may look like the pitcher Nuke LaLoosh, but he comes across more like the character he played in last year's ''Five Corners,'' the confident, committed, slightly naive idealist who wants to better the world.
''I try not to do exploitive films,'' he says.when forced to comment on movies. ''I try to avoid those that insult certain kinds of people or that feature roles with gratuitously stupid women. I want to say something positive.'' 
At the age of 31, Mr. Robbins may be on the verge of becoming a genuine movie star. In his new film ''Erik the Viking,'' a comedy directed by Terry Jones and scheduled for release next month, he co-stars with John Cleese, late of Monty Python. He has just finished work on ''Cadillac Man'' with Robin Williams, and this fall shooting will begin for ''Jacob's Ladder,'' a psychological drama about a Vietnam veteran overcome by personal demons, directed by Adrian Lyne . It will be the first film that Mr. Robbins will have to carry by himself without strong co-stars.
But he doesn't want to talk about any of this. For the occasion, he has asked that he be interviewed with Adam Simon, his colleague in the Actors' Gang, a Los Angeles-based theater troupe to which both devote a fair measure of their time. Together they have written three plays, the latest of which, ''Carnage: A Comedy,'' Mr. Robbins is directing for a run that opens next Sunday at the Public Theater; it is now in previews. The Gang is rehearsing a block away, and Mr. Robbins leaves briefly once to check on their progress.
''Taken in the context of L.A., the Gang was an extremely radical thing to do,'' says Mr. Simon, a Harvard graduate who has collaborated with Mr. Robbins since 1985. Founded in 1981 by a group of U.C.L.A. students who met through a softball game, the Actors' Gang was an unlikely venture: an avant-garde theater ensemble in a city not known at the time for either adjective. With the direction and support of Mr. Robbins, who finances the group with money earned from his movie roles, they have performed standard works from the European Dada and Expressionist tradition (Alfred Jarry's ''Ubu Roi'' and Ivan Goll's ''Methusalem: The Eternal Bourgeois'') and, since Mr. Robbins and Mr. Simon teamed up, original plays with a satirical, surreal, political slant.
''What Tim and I want to do is not so much apply European elements to American theater, but find those parts of our culture that are related to them,'' says Mr. Simon. Small, as fast-talking as Mr. Robbins is slow, and wise beyond his 27 years in the lore of pop culture, Mr. Simon functions as, in his words, ''team egghead,'' the partner responsible for hip, historical references. ''We found those elements not in the American avant-garde but in vaudeville, burlesque, the medicine show: forms that have always been mixed, dirty, chaotic. We wanted to ground ourselves in Dada and American popular culture.'' Their first play, ''Slick Slack Griff Graff,'' sponsored by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art in 1985, used the confidence game, as practiced by a grifter and his carny, to discuss contemporary life. The next year they wrote and performed ''Violence: The Misadventures of Spike Spangle Farmer'' and adopted material directly from the news: The Challenger shuttle disaster, the plight of Midwest farmers, American hostages in Lebanon and the news media's reporting of these events. The lead role was played by John Cusack, a Gang member and Mr. Robbins's co-star in last year's movie ''Tapeheads.''
In ''Carnage'' the authors have co-opted the language and attitudes of televangelism, where theater, economics, religion and politics intersect. The plot traces the descent into madness of a charismatic minister. The various subsidiary characters, as they seek redemption for themselves or their loved ones, take any number of deluded or dangerous paths.
The play is about the spirit unbound, corrupted, out of control. Written and first performed in 1987, before the PTL scandal, Jimmy Swaggart's confessions and Jerry Falwell's disbandment of the Moral Majority, the play also features para-military characters who sound like Oliver North, and a family of suburbanites obsessed by their credit cards and car phone. With much of this material already cycled through the light-satire mill by stand-up comics, the play may run the risk of seeming dated, even if it anticipated current events.
''We weren't writing about Jim and Tammy Bakker,'' Mr. Robbins insists. ''Both Adam and I had read this book ''Blessed Assurance'' by A. G. Mojtabai. ''She found that a high percentage of the people in charge of assembling nuclear weapons at a plant in Texas were rapturous about the end of the world. That really got under our skin. And then the statements that were coming out of the White House at the time: Reagan talking matter-of-factly about the prophecy of the Final Days. And Oliver North thanking God that people put money into bank accounts. We wanted to talk about the connections between right-wing politics and apocalyptic religion.''
Mr. Simon seems more concerned that liberal, urban theatergoers will sneer at the play's characters. ''It's way too easy to get a sophisticated audience to laugh at a bunch of yahoos,'' he says. ''That's not our point. We're saying that a zealot can be much more dangerous than a confidence man.''
Both authors have impeccable bohemian credentials as the offspring of left-wing parents, a background about which they are proud and slightly sheepish. Mr. Simon's parents were black-listed academics who ended up at the University of Chicago; Mr. Robbins grew up in Greenwich Village, son of the folk singer Gil Robbins.
''Yeah, we were a singing family,'' says Mr. Robbins. ''Car trips, after dinner, we were always singing. My first time on stage I joined Dad in a version of 'Ink Is Black but the Page Is White,' '' a standard of the civil rights movement. Before U.C.L.A. Mr. Robbins trained in New York as a teen-age member of Theater for the New City. ''I was in their street theater program for about seven years. We had a street vaudeville act during Watergate with Ehrlichman, Haldeman and Dean. I did a sort of song and dance as Haldeman. There was something very raw about that training that made me want to take chances in the theater.'' Further deepening his interest in an avant-garde, anti-realist tradition, he also studied in Paris with Georges Bigot and his Theatre de Soleil.
The plays by the team of Robbins and Simon develop out of a first draft that Mr. Robbins takes into a workshop where actors try it out. Improvisations are then incorporated into the script, with Mr. Simon hurriedly writing new scenes that are immediately subjected to a performance test. The rehearsals in New York have forced more rewriting. ''When we first started running through it, I was seeing the same play we had done before'' says Mr. Robbins. ''I said, 'No, no, you've got to rip it apart and get to the blank page. I don't want to re-create what we did in Los Angeles.' ''
Film and theater work have fed each other in both their careers. Mr. Simon, who has written and directed a forthcoming film for Roger Corman (to be callled either ''Paranoia'' or ''Brain Dead''), used as many members of the Gang as the production allowed. Mr. Robbins says he would find it harmful if he ceased work in the theater. ''When I started in L.A. on television shows, I would take four or five months off each year to work with the Gang,'' he says. ''Everyone said I was crazy, how was I going to build momentum, et cetera. As the notoriety increases, I long for this even more. I need this, not only to express certain things in the writing and directing, but to work with friends of mine who helped me. They've helped my acting.''
In his politics, loyalty to his friends and triple-threat career as actor-writer-director, Mr. Robbins resembles a younger John Sayles, another baseball fan who has figured out how to make Hollywood serve his personal needs. Mr. Robbins next wants to write a play about the American labor movement in the 1880's; and he is on his second rewrite of a film script, ''a fake documentary about a neofascist folk singer on the rise in America.''
The team of Robbins and Simon acknowledges the problem of writing populist plays that will be performed for a small, elitist audience in the theater. ''If there is a master plan,'' says Mr. Robbins, ''it's to do one more play and take them all on the road. I would love to play 'Carnage' in the Bible Belt.''
''Tent style,'' says Mr. Simon, excited. ''Set it up, tear it down.'' He enthusiastically describes a television project for a ''post-apocalyptic 'Gunsmoke.' '' He looks at Mr. Robbins, who winces. ''Tim and I have this fight whether or not it's politically correct to do post-apocalyptic stories,'' he says, smiling. ''I say 'yes,' he says 'no.' ''
Both Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, who won his heart in the script for ''Bull Durham'' and later off the set, feel strongly about women's issues. They marched together at the abortion rights rally in Washington in April, one month before she gave birth to their son. Mr. Robbins has moved east from Los Angeles and the couple have lived in New York for the last year and a half, inevitably weakening his daily ties to the Gang.
His recent film work with Robin Williams and John Cleese has allowed him to explore on film the anarchic impulses that find outlet in his work for the theater. In ''Erik the Viking'' he plays a Norseman disillusioned with a style of life that emphasizes raping and pillaging. ''He's a Viking seeking a better way,'' says Mr. Robbins. The Monty Python troupe decisively shaped the style of the Actors' Gang. ''Those guys were major influences on my work,'' he says, an opinion seconded by Mr. Simon, who adds, ''If you went back in a time machine and subtracted Monty Python and Mad magazine from history, the sensibility of our generation would be crippled.''
At the rehearsal loft, a guitarist is leading the 11 members of the Actors' Gang in a folk sing-along from the play. Mr. Robbins sits down with his metal briefcase and goes over notes from a previous run-through. Most of his instructions are the usual directorial maxims: ''Go further with your anger there,'' he tells one actor; ''try to inspire as well as admonish in that speech,'' he says to another. But a few phrases sound somewhat unusual. ''Don't dance with the television until the second chorus,'' he says casually to a young actor, who notates her script as if this were normal stage direction.
''Dare to be stupid'' is the motto of the Actors' Gang. As wholesome as he may appear, Tim Robbins is really more of an All-American Radical. What he is attempting to do in his life and work can't be called, by the standards of film or theater, either very normal or too stupid.

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
Classics Thrive on Screen Tests

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

 BODY:
You've watched the video, now see the movie.
''Tom Jones'' is back, or almost. The uproarious 1963 adaptation of the Henry Fielding novel opens Friday at the Paris Theater in a new print, its soundtrack adapted for Dolby, its original 131-minute running time pruned slightly to 124 minutes by Tony Richardson, its director.
''The Wizard of Oz,'' which has been available on television for longer than most readers have been alive, is now showing at two Manhattan theaters to mark the 1939 film's 50th anniversary.
Last month's ''French Currents: The New Wave, Then and Now'' turned out to be the most successful retrospective ever sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Though all but several films in the program could be found in any videocassette rental shop, four (Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless,'' Francois Truffaut's ''Jules and Jim'' and ''Day for Night'' and the anthology film ''Six in Paris'') were sellouts at the 1,100-seat Alice Tully Hall. 
Fifty years after its original release, William Wyler's ''Wuthering Heights'' is in movie theaters once more. ''Intolerance,'' D. W. Griffith's 1916 classic (prompted, at least in part, by charges that his ''Birth of a Nation'' glorified racism), has been restored yet again and will be screened Oct. 2 at the New York Film Festival.
Both ''Gone With the Wind'' (1939) and Abel Gance's ''Napoleon'' (1926) have had successful public showings this year at Radio City Music Hall, while David Lean's ''Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962), re-edited to include 20 minutes of footage not in the film as it was originally released, has become one of the year's surprise box-office hits, both in this country and abroad.
As movie trends go, this one doesn't mean much in terms of dollars and cents, not when the producers of a ''Batman'' can earn in several weeks what it took David Selznick, the producer of ''Gone With the Wind,'' a lifetime to achieve.
Yet it does suggest that there exists a small but increasingly literate film audience. These are people who are not going to sit by while theatrical movies are shrunk to the dimensions of present television screens (which seem always to be getting hazier as they get bigger) and while television entertainment is inflated to fill movie theater screens (which seem always to be getting smaller).
These audiences recognize and cherish the differences between the experience of watching something at home, at one's own convenience, the lights on, the picture definition not great, and being in a theater where, in theory anyway, one's attention is commanded by the clarity of a larger-than-life image that dominates the enviroment.
The development of the videocassette recorder has been the greatest boon to theatrical films since the refinement of sound - I now find it difficult to imagine ordinary life without it. The videocassette has reclaimed audiences that had stopped going to movie theaters. It creates additional revenues that, in turn, insure further production.
It also provides students, aficionados and critics with virtually instant access to the entire heritage of movies. Until recently, film study and even random browsing were activities limited to the college student, the buff who had his own 16-millimeter projector and those persistent nuts who made it a point to keep up with the screening schedules at museums and at Manhattan's old Regency and other repertory theaters.
Today almost anybody anywhere can have a mini-festival devoted to the work of Greta Garbo, Abbott and Costello, Fritz Lang, John Hughes, Ingmar Bergman or Billy Wilder. There once was a time when movies, having been seen in a theater, could be stored only as memories, often distorted ones.
Today's audiences can rerun movies indefinitely. Anyone with the desire can figure out how a movie has been put together. Movies can be carried around in coat pockets and evening bags and left on the seats of Broadway buses.
We are, however, paying a price that, like some taxes, remains hidden. When we look at a movie on the television screen, even via a videocassette of the first quality, we are seeing only a fraction of what was originally on the theater screen. Sometimes literally. Favorite scenes can be looked at without having to sit through all the guff that connects them. Movies-as-coffeetable-books leave a lot to be desired.
This is made dramatically evident when one goes back to a theater to see an epic on the scale of ''Napoleon'' or ''Gone With the Wind'' or ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' One has to be aggressively dim not to be aware of what's missing when triptychs, huge battle scenes and magnificent wide-angle landscapes are squeezed onto a 21-inch telly screen. In some ways, watching ''Napoleon'' or ''Lawrence'' on the small screen is a little like listening to radio or reading. Either the imagination fills in the details not actually seen, or it tunes out.
Not as apparent are the ways in which the small screen also affects the way in which we respond to less visually spectacular films.
According to my own erratic survey, no more than three people collected around a television set, watching a cassette of, say, ''Grand Hotel,'' will attend the film with anything approximating the same attention that would be given in a theater.
If there are four or more people, at least one is bound to get itchy and start to talk. The surroundings give permission. The screen is small, and the set itself is just one more piece of furniture to be used or ignored at will. Movies at home are disposable.
When I say we don't ''see'' many details on a television screen that we would see in a theater, I don't mean simply visual details but also all of the other information that one absorbs from a movie in a theater without being aware of it. It may be anything from the rhythm of the editing to obvious contortions of plot or just a subliminal sense of esthetic disorder. In the half light of a movie theater, we are sponges.
This is one of the reasons that audiences tend to be more critical in a theater than they are at home, and why (as has happened to all of us) we sometimes upgrade an opinion of a film seen on television after watching it in a theater. It's not that we were overly cranky the first time, but that a lot of the things that worked against the film in the theater are automatically blacked out. The context does it.
When film students today say they have ''seen'' Orson Welles's ''Citizen Kane'' or Howard Hawks's ''Twentieth Century,'' they mean, nine times out of 10, that they have looked at something shown on a television monitor or, with luck, at a 16-millimeter print, which was probably well worn.
As much as ''Lawrence of Arabia'' or ''Napoleon,'' the Welles work is the kind of film whose magnificence can only be guessed at when it is looked at in anything except a 35-millimeter print, preferably unscratched and with a soundtrack in sync. Among other things, there is no other way in which one can appreciate the remarkable gradations between black and white in Gregg Toland's camera work, as well as the equally spectacular deep-focus scenes.
Deep focus, in which characters and objects in the background are seen as clearly as those in the foreground, is apparently one of the prices paid for color photography. Deep focus requires so much light that, I'm told, it either washes out the color or makes it blaze.
Considering the economics of the motion picture business, it is unlikely that many nonspectacular old films are going to receive the sort of re-release treatment afforded ''Lawrence of Arabia'' or ''Gone With the Wind.'' It is too expensive. It is encouraging, though, that ''Jules and Jim'' could sell out at Alice Tully Hall. Its audience, I assume, was composed of the 1,100 New Yorkers who either never had seen it before or never had seen it in 35 millimeter, in the full glory of its original anamorphic wide-screen ratio.
It should also be encouraging, I suppose, that ''The Wizard of Oz,'' after so many years of special television showings and its more recent availability on videocassette, should be back in two theaters. In fact, however, the print I saw at the Festival Theater was not one to astonish any child who had grown up watching it on the small screen.
The colors in the print were not washed out but, instead, sort of fuzzy and inexact, not much different from what they would be on a good cassette.
Still unseen at this writing is ''Tom Jones'' as reconstituted by Mr. Richardson, who received the 1963 Academy Award for his direction of the film. Even without looking at it, purists will object to his re-editing of it to meet the tastes of 1989 audiences.
The distributor quotes Mr. Richardson as saying that the changes were ''necessary and helpful.''
''The humor works as well today as it did in 1963,'' he says, ''but audiences today are so much more sophisticated than they were 26 years ago. They like humor quick and punchy. I think the cuts substantially improve the film and enhance the actors' work.''
That's all very well and good, but, in another 26 years, how would he feel if someone else came along and edited the film again for the audiences of 2015? Mr. Richardson cites the differing directorial approaches to Shakespeare as being analogous. Yet tinkering with a finished movie is not the same thing. In the case of a play, the original text continues to exist. Caretakers of commercial films have a way of tossing out anything not of immediate use.
Most of us probably won't have any idea where Mr. Richardson has made the cuts in ''Tom Jones,'' but we'll see.

Loudspeakers usually come in pairs and are normally delivered as identical twins. Lately, however, there has been a surprising incidence of triplets.
Listeners living in small apartments where space is limited might frown on this development. They think two speakers are enough and three are too many. But paradoxically, space economy is the main purpose of the three-speaker setups. These triplets take up less room than a conventional pair, sound just as good and typically cost less. 
The savings in space and cost result from the fact that the three-piece speaker systems use only a single woofer instead of the usual two; and woofers, being fairly massive, are the bulkiest and most expensive part of a speaker. In addition to its single woofer, which handles the lower notes of both left and right channels, the triple system consists of two small satellite units that separately handle the midrange and treble for the left and right stereo channels.
The pooling of the bass between the two stereo channels in a single woofer is done on the theory that low notes are nondirectional. The listener cannot tell where they come from, and therefore it doesn't matter if the left and right channels are combined at the bass end of the audible spectrum. As far as the top is concerned, normal stereo separation is maintained by the two small satellite units.
From a home decorator's viewpoint, there are several advantages to this approach. The satellite units are small enough to nestle discreetly among the books on a shelf, while the single woofer keeps a low profile that lets it serve as a coffee table or a pedestal for a plant. And since the sound emitted by the woofer is nondirectional, it may be placed anywhere in the room or conveniently stashed out of sight.
This cannot be done with conventional loudspeakers containing woofers and upper-range units in a single enclosure, because they have to be in direct line of sight from the listening area for the best acoustic results. The triplets, on the other hand, can be visually unobtrusive.
As for cost, consider that good woofers are inherently expensive. They require a heavy cast-metal frame, a massive magnet and a strong and firmly braced cabinet to reach to the tonal bottom. By pooling the bass of both channels and dispensing with the second woofer, this major cost factor is cut in half.
The saving could be passed on to the buyer; it could be added to the manufacturer's profit, or a bit of both. In some cases, the manufacturer applies the saving to the product, providing a heftier woofer than could otherwise be furnished for the price. As a result, some triplet systems boast better bass than conventional speakers in the same price range.
A notably fine-sounding triplet comes from a California company with the imperative name of Now Hear This - more commonly known by its initials as N.H.T. Called the SubZero system, it consists of two small units measuring 9 x 5 1/2 x 5 inches. The enclosures are black and made of polished fiberboard laminated with a polymer that makes them inherently nonresonant. This nonresonance prevents false timbres arising from undue cabinet vibration. These diminutive units contain the midrange and treble speakers, and their frequency response extends from 85 to 21,000 Hertz.
The third member of the trio is a woofer, measuring 19 x 8 x 12 inches, which extends bass response down to 45 Hertz. This won't impress perfectionists, but it is quite remarkable for so small a unit and sufficient for most kinds of music.
The overall sound is musically pleasing; clarity at the top never veers into shrillness, and the lower range generates an appropriate sense of sonic weight in orchestral passages. Moreover, the smallness of the upper-range speakers contributes to an even sound, spread over wide areas of the listening room, with clearly defined stereo space relations.
The N.H.T. SubZero can handle up to 100 watts per channel, and with a list price of $399 for the entire system, it is an oustanding bargain. Both sonically and fiscally it validates the triplet approach.
Another set of recently arrived triplets is the Design Acoustics Micro-Monitor P S. 3. It differs outwardly from the N.H.T. model by having a wood finish rather than black laminate on all three cabinets - a fact reflected in its higher price of $599. In other respects it is roughly comparable, though the upper range of the P S. 3 appeared a little brighter and more incisive than that of the SubZero. Whether this is an asset or not depends on the listener's personal tonal taste.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE ADVERTISING SLUMP;
Cure the Industry With More Creativity

BYLINE: By JOHN PHILIP JONES; John Philip Jones is professor and chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University.

 BODY:
The annual estimates of advertising in the United States have been presented for a number of years in rather a misleading way. In addition to main media figures, the estimates cover other less relevant categories of expenditure.
Fortunately, it is easy to isolate the main media - newspapers, television, consumer magazines, radio and outdoor advertising, like billboards. When we do this and express the total main media expenditure as a percentage of the gross national product - the normal way of measuring advertising's progress relative to other industries - it is clear that the proportion accounted for by advertising has shown no appreciable change since 1984, remaining at a little under 1.5 percent of the G.N.P. And there are forces in the market pointing to continued stagnation. 
The figures have plateaued twice before in the last four decades - at levels of about 1.4 percent of the G.N.P. from 1956 to 1960, and 1.3 percent from 1961 to 1966.
These previous plateaus were followed by a gradual decline until 1975. During this time something very interesting happened.
The old concept of the full service agency became unfashionable; it was in fact pushed aside by a remarkable revival of interest in the creative product, a movement spearheaded by David Ogilvy and William Bernbach, but which by the late 1960's was followed by all the important agencies in New York and elsewhere, even those that Mr. Ogilvy had impolitely but graphically described as the ''extinct volcanoes.''
No one has examined the possible cause-and-effect relationship between the stagnation in the total business and the creative revival of the 1960's. But my intuition tells me that the two phenomena were connected. Advertising had to begin working like a rapier because it could no longer wield the bludgeon of increasing appropriations. A number of the agencies leading the creative renaissance became very successful. Each agency's activity was concentrated exclusively on the work it was doing for its existing clients, and growth to clients and agency yielded profit, the reward of success.
The question raised by this brief incursion into history is whether the present stagnation will call forth a similar innovative response from today's agencies - perhaps a shot of creative adrenaline or even some more unexpected reaction, the nature of which we cannot at the moment guess.
I am not in the business of speculating about the topography of terra incognita, but I do feel able to discuss a related question - whether the culture of the agencies of the 1980's is likely to encourage innovation as radical as the action of their predecessors in the 1960's.
Since the late 1970's the billings of many of the leading agency groups have increased rather strikingly, as a result of mergers and acquisitions. This increasing concentration is one of the most interesting events in recent advertising history, and to understand it we must go further than acknowledging the activities of opportunistic entrepreneurs, whose emergence was a necessary but not a sufficient explanation for why the agency conglomerates came into being.
A conglomerate is said to reduce waste and duplication, thus enabling the agency to achieve greater scales of economy. It is also argued that the working systems and financial controls of the best parts of each organization can be applied to the worst parts, leading to more efficient operation, and cost savings over all. There are possibilities of expanding the business both geographically and by cross-selling between the individual business units (''referrals.'') Lastly, there are - or were - assets to be stripped.
These are reasonably plausible although not entirely convincing arguments. In fact, a good case can be made that the conglomerates were a response to a stagnating business. Depressed growth and profits were the causes of low stock prices, which in turn made certain large American advertising agencies vulnerable to hostile acquisitions.
More important, the arguments in favor of the conglomerates concentrate most on how amalgamation will benefit the agencies (or more precisely their stockholders). Not much is said about advantages to the clients. Little is spoken of plans to invest in recruiting and developing the skills of talented individuals with the aim of improving the creative product; nor of plans to invest in research to improve our dismally inadequate knowledge of how advertising works to sell products.
What we are seeing is the growing importance of agencies that have a different credo from those of the 1960's and 1970's - a new credo that has shifted profit from being a reward to being a direct operating objective. This change did not take place suddenly; it began to happen in the 1970's as the hard and unwelcome lessons of public ownership began to be felt by agencies.
Stagnation in the advertising business will mean an even greater concentration on cost-cutting within the conglomerates - organizations that require high and increasing profit both to service bank debt and to maintain their own stock prices (to protect themselves from financial predators!). It is difficult to see how these conditions will lead to an improvement in each agency's creative work or in its ability to produce brilliant recommendations for its clients.
Readers will have no difficulty in guessing my own belief that the nature of the agency business will not lie with the conglomerates. Indeed the professional deficiencies of the conglomerates will create special opportunities for their organizationally more conservative but professionally more daring competitors.
These competitors are not few in number nor uniform in size. In fact they include some agencies that at the moment are little more than fledglings - American advertising has always provided astonishing opportunities for talented newcomers. Agencies marked for success will have a culture entirely bound up with their work for their existing clients. Rather importantly, such agencies will still be, and will remain, privately owned. And they will be managed by people whose driving force is advertising.

HEADLINE: Prospects;
Productivity's Problem

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
The Labor Department's second-quarter productivity figures showed a modest overall increase of 0.7 percent, with gains of 2.9 percent in manufacturing accounting for nearly all of the increase. Analysts are increasingly suspicious of the productivity numbers as indicators of economic health. Three economists and a former auto worker discuss them.
 
Sam Nakagama
Chairman and chief economist, Nakagama and Wallace Inc.
 I don't believe in the productivity numbers. I have a lot of questions about the way productivity is measured and so, in the main, I ignore the numbers. There are a lot of debates and quarrels about what the real numbers have been and it becomes a technical argument among specialists. I have long ago lost interest in that debate. Of course, we ought to do our best to measure productivity, and I'm not sure it can't be done. But the quarterly numbers are meaningless. On the other hand, there is not much argument over the long-term trend - 15 to 25 years - and those numbers have shown a sharp fall-off in productivity growth. 
 
Charles McMillion
Associate director, Institute for Policy Studies, Johns Hopkins University and former policy director, Congressional Competitiveness Caucus.
 We don't have very good statistics for the service sector. One of the many problems of the Reagan years was the damage done to data collection. Our overall economic data has deteriorated. We now have estimated numbers instead of survey numbers, and the survey numbers we do have come from smaller samples. For instance, the Federal Reserve gets its capacity utilization figures by making estimates of overall capacity and then making further estimates based on these numbers to arrive at a figure for utilization.
We don't even know how big the manufacturing sector is anymore. One set of numbers says it's about 22 percent of gross national product and another says its only 18 percent.
The last input-output table for the country as a whole was done in 1983. This table tells us about the elements that go into the automobile industry, for example, so we can chart its effect on the rest of the economy. This helps us understand the economic effect of an investment. The last Japanese input-output table was done in 1988. It is very hard to make public policy based on our data.
 
Carl G. Thor
President of the American Productivity and Quality Center, a not-for-profit research and consulting center in Houston.
 The quality of the statistics makes them of not much use. What I do is look back at the statistics for the last 12 months, add the numbers and then divide them by four to get my own rough indicator of quarterly performance. What this shows is a general flatness in productivity over the last 12 months. Behind that is the real story. Manufacturing increased by 2.9 percent while overall productivity increased by 0.7 percent for the quarter.
On the manufacturing side, the United States should get a solid ''B'' grade. But while American manufacturing improved its productivity by 2.9 percent, Italy and Britain grew in the 3 to 4 percent range, the Pacific nations grew in the 4 to 5 percent range and over the last 5 years, Japan grew in the 6 to 7 percent range.
 
Eric Mann
Director of the Labor Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles and a former auto worker.
 When I went to work at the General Motors Van Nuys plant there were about 5,000 workers. Now there are about 3,700 workers producing roughly the same number of cars - so that's an increase in productivity. If you did floor-to-floor interviews and asked the work force if they are working harder and faster, they would say ''yes.'' If you asked them if they will be able to do their jobs at the current pace for 30 years, then they would say ''no.''
We have to take a look at the concept of a continually expanding G.N.P., because it isn't improving the standard of living of the work force.
Labor unions have to address the fact that given the environmental dangers, a society that is based on continuous productivity growth is in trouble.

Central Banks Act Against Rising Dollar

BYLINE: By STEVE DODSON

 BODY:
The dollar surged, bringing intervention by the central banks of several nations, including the United States. They succeeded in halting the advance, but that still left the dollar just below the two-mark level against the West German currency and around 148 against the yen. In both cases that is considerably above what is widely assumed to be the upper limits favored by the United States and its economic partners - 1.90 marks and 140 yen. At the start of 1989, the dollar was at 1.77 marks and 125 yen. The Federal Reserve said last week that it sold a record amount of dollars, $11.9 billion, in the May-July period in an effort to halt the dollar's rise.
 
*
 The largest takeover battle in French history ended. Compagnie Financiere de Suez, the Paris-based banking group, raised its bid to $4 billion and gained control of Groupe Victoire, the second-largest insurer in France. Last year Suez defeated Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, in a fight for control of Societe Generale de Belgique, the huge Belgian conglomerate. 
 
*
 A scandal at Italy's largest bank led to the resignation of the chairman of the state-owned institution. Nerio Nesi stepped down from Banca Nazionale del Lavoro after disclosures that the bank's Atlanta branch had issued $2.6 billion in unauthorized export credits to Iraq. Besides raising questions about lax management, the situation caused concern about the bank's large exposure to Iraq. Gimpiero Cantoni, a Milan banker with ties to the Socialist Party, was named to succeed Mr. Nesi.
 
*
 Bloomingdale's is for sale. The Campeau Corporation of Toronto will seek bids for the department store chain as part of a corporate reorganization intended to lighten the heavy debt load it has accumulated through an aggressive acquisition campaign. Last year Campeau bought Federated Department Stores, which included Bloomingdale's, for $6.7 billion. In late 1986 it paid $3.4 billion for the Allied Stores chain. The announcement said that Marvin S. Traub, the chairman of Bloomingdale's, had expressed interest in a management buyout.
 
*
 A takeover of Plessey, the British electronics company, was completed. General Electric P.L.C., which is not related to the American G.E., and Siemens A.G. of West Germany said they had acquired more than 50 percent of Plessey. Their final bid in the nine-month battle priced Plessey at $3.14 billion. The battle was complicated by British Government concerns about a takeover of Plessey, which is a large military contractor.
Bonn approved a merger that would create West Germany's largest military contractor. The Economics Ministry endorsed an $859 million proposal by the auto maker Daimler- Benz to take over the Messerschmitt- Bolkow-Blohm aerospace and armaments conglomerate.
 
*
 Ford and Saab-Scania have talked about a possible linkup, the two companies said. They said that the talks were at an early stage and that they could not speculate about an eventual outcome. Saab of Sweden has had heavy losses in its car business.
 
*
 Stock market sentiment turned somewhat negative, with a few widely followed analysts suggesting it was time to take some profits from the summer rally that sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a record of 2,752.09 on Sept. 1. For the week, the Dow lost 42.55 points, to close at 2,709.54. The bond market had light trading. Prices edged up enough to push the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to about 8.10, from about 8.20 the previous week.
 
*
 Domestic auto sales rose more than 22 percent in late August, aided by aggressive discounting as the model year neared its end . . . Americans paid off $280 million more than they borrowed during July, the first reduction in consumer debt since January 1987 . . . Nonfarm productivity was up seven-tenths of a percent in the April-to-June period; it had declined 1.3 percent in the first quarter.
 
*
 Crazy Eddie's founder was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of overstating the profits of the retail electronics chain. The S.E.C. complaint said that Eddie Antar and some top executives inflated profits for two years beginning in 1985, a period during which Mr. Antar and two executives sold Crazy Eddie shares. Mr. Antar's attorney said his client denied the accusations. Crazy Eddie, which was taken over in 1987 by outside investors, is under bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: Who Will Subscribe to the Valdez Principles?

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Environmentalists and socially minded investment fund managers did not have to look far for a model when they began secret meetings last winter aimed at finding ways to pressure businesses to be more aggressive about protecting the environment.
The concept of comparing the performance of a broad range of companies to a standard of responsible behavior - and to each other - had been established with the Sullivan Principles governing conduct by American businesses in South Africa, introduced in 1977 by the Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia minister and a member of General Motors' board. That model had been introduced with the backing of G.M., Citibank and other large multinationals as a ''socially responsible'' alternative to the position of protesters who wanted the companies to cut all ties with South Africa.
However, the new coalition of environmentalists and investors may have a far tougher time getting corporate support for its code of conduct, introduced Thursday under the name Valdez Principles to memorialize the Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska.
The Valdez Principles are far more sweeping in their scope and objectives, as well as being more vague in their language. Moreover, they have been drafted without input from any companies, including those the coalition hopes will become its first signatories. 
''It's sort of come out of the blue,'' said Lydia Bohl, head of investor relations for the H. P. Fuller Company, a specialty chemical maker in Arden Hills, Minn., that is generally considered among the most environmentally progressive businesses in the nation by fund managers.
The code calls on companies to address the impact of both products and production processes on employees, communities and the environment. It also includes requirements that companies appoint an environmental expert to their board and conduct and publicize an annual independent audit of their compliance with the code.
 
'No Company Is Pure'
 Ms. Bohl said Fuller was first told of the proposals in July, making it one of only a handful of companies that had a chance to see them before their release. Fuller has concerns about the burdens of the independent audit requirement, which might duplicate the company's internal programs. In addition, it has fears that signatories might receive negative publicity for problems they are working on while non-signatories whose problems are less public would escape notoriety.
''No company is pure,'' said Ms. Bohl. ''We want to see a half dozen other companies involved before signing on.''
The Polaroid Corporation, which also was contacted prior to release of the principles because coalition organizers had been impressed by its waste management program, had similar concerns.
''It's an idea we are sympathetic to but it needs further discussion in the company,'' said Harry Fatkin, Polaroid's director of health, safety and environmental affairs.
One problem is the vagueness of the principles in the current form, which some coalition backers describe as a draft. Executives at several companies to whom a reporter recited the principles said they believed that the code was already embodied in their corporate policies, with minor exceptions.
''The principles are not yet in implementable form,'' said John Lickerman, director of research for the Working Assets Money Fund in San Francisco, one of those who advised the Social Investment Forum, a Boston-based trade group of socially minded investors and money managers, in drafting the code. ''We cannot at this point use them to evaluate the performance of a Dow Chemical, G.E. or I.B.M. I'm very skeptical about how the business community will receive it.'' Nevertheless, industry experts said that few businesses are likely to take the new code of conduct lightly. And many companies, they said, may be interested in the coalition's announced intention to invite them to help formulate more specific guidelines.
''My sense is that a lot of companies are looking for ways to show they are environmentally responsible,'' said Bill Ralston, senior consultant on environmental health affairs at SRI International, a consulting firm based in Menlo Park, Calif.
Moreover, leading organizers of the effort to introduce the code, like Joan Bavaria, president of the Franklin Research and Development Corporation, a Boston investment firm, stress that they are trying to find methods to reward those companies that have what the coalition judges to be progressive programs.
If such acknowledgments generate favorable publicity among consumers and shareholders, some companies may find adoption of the code to be a valuable competitive weapon. In that case, the fact that the code was developed without major business input may lend more credibility to positive ratings.
Those companies that dislike the code or believe that they should focus only on complying with existing laws might nonetheless feel forced to address the principles because of the potential clout of the sponsor, the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (or Ceres, after the Roman goddess of agriculture).
 
Economic Pressure
 Organizers of the coalition include some of the nation's biggest environmental groups, like the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Society, as well as the Humane Society of America. These groups say they intend to use the Valdez standards as a basis for exerting economic pressure, possibly including consumer boycotts, on companies that fail to address their concerns.
In addition, the Council on Economic Priorities, a New York-based research organization that has published a widely circulated shopper's guide outlining corporate positions on a broad range of social issues, said that it would pass on information generated by Valdez audits to its growing audience.
''This will represent the largest single tool for consumers to express their concern about the environment that we have ever had,'' said Terry Gips, president of the International Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture in Minneapolis, a coalition member.
Such observations raise the prospect that the environmental groups, some of which have conflicting agendas, may use the Valdez principles to reach contradictory conclusions about how a company is performing. Spokesmen for several of the groups said last week that none of the environmental organizations would be adjusting their positions to account for those of other coalition members.
Pressure will also come from those Ceres members who represent the growing social investment community. Investors with assets totaling more than $450 billion have shown a willingness to consider issues such as corporate policy in South Africa in making their investment decisions and in voting at shareholder meetings, according to Marcy Murninghan, head of the Lighthouse Investment Group, a Boston investment research firm.
 
Of Greatest Concern
 Investor interest in pressing companies on environmental concerns is thought to be far higher. A survey last year by the Calvert Social Investment Fund of its 30,000 clients found the environment to be their greatest concern by far, according to John Guffey, co-founder of the Bethesda, Md.-based fund.
The fund, which manages $350 million, has applied numerous environmental tests to screen its investments since its founding in 1982 but is now weighing several others. These include a ban on investments in manufacturers of plastic packaging and in companies that contribute to the destruction of rain forests abroad or old-growth forests in the United States.
One group that has played a major role in introducing shareholder resolutions on various social concerns and that now intends to push for adoption of provisions in the Valdez code is the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based investment adviser for the National Council of Churches. The participation of such groups and major pension funds - California and New York City's pension funds have already announced their backing - is certain to catch corporate attention.
''We want companies to understand and we want owners of companies to impel them to understand,'' said Harrison J. Goldin, who, as Comptroller of New York City, controls investment of its pension funds.
''We will obviously take a look at it,'' said William Winters, a General Motors spokesman. ''These are major investors that we work with regularly.''
 
The Major Unknown
 Perhaps the key uncertainty at this point is what Ceres expects from the code's disclosure and audit provisions.
 Corporate sources said that it would be difficult to agree to any disclosure policy that might lead to increased litigation against their companies or to disclosure promises that might create liability beyond that specified in state and Federal laws. For example, companies are already required to report environmental hazards or problems that could materially affect their financial situation in their annual 10K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many will be reluctant to go further than that.
As for the audits, coalition members said at Thursday's news conference introducing the code that they expected Ceres to develop standards for such examinations, as the Financial Accounting Standards Board does for financial audits. They also said that they expected the environmental audits to become as routine and widely followed by investors as financial audits.
However, environmental advisers to the business community say that any audit comparable to such financial reports is unlikely to provide coalition members with as much information as they anticipate.
''Typically, financial audit statements are fairly circumspect and don't say much,'' said S. Noble Robinson, head of the Environmental and Risk Management Group at Arthur D. Little Inc., a consultant based in Cambridge, Mass. ''If they say, 'We have reviewed Company X's environmental performance in accord with generally accepted accounting principles and it is fine,' that doesn't get you into a very exposed state in terms of nitty-gritty details.''
Environmental consultants note that financial problems are often hidden from outside auditors and that environmental audits might suffer from the same failings unless they are extremely detailed, which would make them very expensive. Environmental audits are increasingly common in cases where property is being sold and banks, insurers or purchasers believe that a hazardous waste or asbestos problem may exist. But the kind of audit contemplated by Ceres members appears to be far more sweeping and business executives say there are few if any independent auditors capable of doing such a thorough job.
Ceres backers say such problems reinforce the need for having companies voluntarily disclose information on an ongoing basis. How else, asked Denis Hayes, Ceres co-chairman with Ms. Bavaria and chief executive officer of Earth Day 1990, can environmentalists and investors know if the grounding of the Exxon Valdez is a sign that Exxon is operating in an environmentally unsound way compared with other oil companies or is just unlucky?
''This is the most complicated area of social investing, more complicated even than judging employee relations,'' said Mr. Lickerman of the Working Assets Money Fund. ''But we have an obligation to monitor it for our investors and we hope the Valdez Principles will help.''

HEADLINE: Struggling for Profits in Electronics

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: RICHMOND

 BODY:
The last several years have been miserable ones for specialty retailers of consumer electronics. After riding the boom in V.C.R. sales through the first half of the 1980's, most electronics chains are now being battered by flattened sales, brutal price wars and ill-conceived expansions.
But there is one striking exception: Circuit City Stores Inc. Profits for the chain, which is based here, have risen every year since 1980, and tripled since 1986 to reach $69.5 million in fiscal 1989, ended in February. The company has a dominant position in almost every city in which it competes, and is expanding its store base by 25 percent a year despite the sluggish retail electronics environment. With 133 stores, and revenues expected to top $2 billion this year, Circuit City has emerged as the undisputed leader among chains of stand-alone electronics stores.
''Without a question, Circuit City is the best-managed consumer electronics retailer in the United States,'' said David A. Bolotsky, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''By every significant measure, including sales per square foot, sales per store and pre-tax margins, Circuit City outperforms its major competitors.'' 
There is a lesson in retailing to be found in the story of how Circuit City has prospered amid the turmoil of a floundering retail industry. Some analysts believe the lesson is applicable not only in consumer electronics, but in other retail areas as well where deep discounting, fierce competition and a fickle public have taken their toll.
In part, Circuit City has excelled for the same reasons that McDonald's has continued to dominate the fast-food industry: execution. Like the hamburger chain, Circuit City has refined a merchandising formula that is more subtle than it appears. And like McDonald's, Circuit City exercises nearly autocratic discipline in carrying it out.
Still, Circuit City faces tougher times. The mass merchandizers and discount warehouses are expected to prove to be more serious competitors. That is largely why its shares are trading at only 24 - a lower multiple of earnings than other top specialty retailers like Toys 'R' Us or the Limited.
''This is going to be a difficult period,'' said Barry Bryant, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''The markets they are moving into are harder than the ones they are in now, and the markets they are in now are going to get much more competitive. We are entering a period where durable goods sales are not likely to do well. If you combine all those things, you may have a period when Circuit City faces a series of declines in comparable store sales.''
But it is in a stronger position that most other specialty electronics retailers. And the rapid rise of the video cassette recorder are at the root of their current woes. VCR sales exploded in the early 80's, rising to $5.2 billion in 1986, from $389 million in 1979. After the recession of 1981 and 1982, consumers were eager to spend freely on all forms of consumer electronics and appliances.
The craze encouraged specialty retailers to expand like wildfire. Between 1983 and 1986, 14 chains went public, using the proceeds to launch or accelerate their expansions. Detroit-based Highland Superstores, alone, has grown to 84 stores nationwide, from 18 in 1980.
By 1987, however, more than half of all households had already acquired a video cassette recorder. Without a new blockbuster to resurrect the market, sales growth of consumer electronics slowed to a meager 2 percent a year - a trend that analysts expect to continue for several more years.
Competition turned savage, squeezing profit margins, earnings and the stock prices of most chains. Highland, with sales of $1 billion a year, lost $11.2 million in the first half of its current fiscal year. In 1987, it earned $13.9 million. With sales of $506 million, the Best Buy Company of Bloomington, Minn., has seen its profits fall to $2.5 million, from $7.7 million two years ago.
The performance of some chains has been grimmer still. This year, Audio Video Affiliates Inc., a company formed in 1984 by consolidating three smaller retail chains, decided to sell off and lease back its 78 stores to raise $61 million. The company used some of the money to pay down debt incurred when it bought back $40 million worth of its own stock in 1988. (The purchase has not helped the stock, which trades at about 4, down from more than 13 in mid-1986.
 
Flamboyant Flameout
 But Crazy Eddie Inc. of Edison, N.J., has been the most flamboyant flameout. Once one of the hottest names in the field, the company is now in bankruptcy and has shuttered 17 of its 43 stores. The chain's sales peaked at $352 million in 1987, but fell off, precipitating a huge $109 million loss the next year. This week, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that its founder, Eddie Antar, who sold much of his stake in the company several years ago, had fraudulently overstated the company's assets by $65 million.
In contrast, Circuit City expanded more cautiously during the electronics boom. It avoided helter-skelter expansion and instead has methodically blitzed the cities in which it has chosen to compete, coming to dominate almost all of them. It has invested heavily in infrastructure, such as a satellite-linked computer network, automated distribution facilities and truck fleets.
''It sounds boring, but we are doing a lot of things a little bit better than the competition,'' said Richard L. Sharp, Circuit City's chief executive. ''You know, Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers won a lot of Superbowls running Paul Hornung over tackle. Everyone knew that's where he was going, but they executed the play with enough precision and expertise to succeed.''
Brian Berghuis, an analyst at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, gives the company high marks. ''I would put Circuit City up there with the best names in retailing, along with Toys 'R' Us and Wal-Mart,'' he said.
To be sure, Circuit City faces plenty of opportunities to stumble. One problem is the threat of a recession, since most of its products are discretionary purchases that can be put off during hard times.
A second threat is intensified competition. Sears and Montgomery Ward are both upgrading their consumer electronics departments into something analogous to in-house superstores offering brand-name products. Although analysts say their cost structures are higher than Circuit City's, the department stores' formidable marketing clout is expected to increase their market share.
Finally, the chain could run into trouble from the growing importance of membership warehouse chains likePrice Club and Pace Membership Warehouse Inc. Such chains, which have much lower advertising and operating costs, account for up to 4 percent of the nation's consumer electronics sales, but their market share is expected to steadily increase. Should the warehouse stores begin to seriously erode their market share, Circuit City executives say, they have contingency plans for converting affected stores into warehouse operations.
Nevertheless, Circuit City has profited handsomely through what has already been a recession in its industry. And its strong balance sheet, analysts say, should help it extend that record. Circuit City's long-term debt is only 16 percent of total capital, compared with 24 percent at Highland Superstores and 28 percent at Best Buy Company.
 
Slow Evolution
 Although Mr. Sharp gets much of the credit for the company's success, the foundations of Circuit City preceded him. Founded in 1949 by Samuel Wurtzel as the Wards Company, the concern evolved slowly into an operator of television departments inside department stores and then into a small chain of stand-alone retailers in the Middle Atlantic region.
In 1975, Mr. Wurtzel's son, Alan, pioneered the nation's first electronics superstore, a 32,000-square-foot outlet in Richmond that offered about 2,000 product selections. The superstore's high volume made it possible to cut prices and still offer conveniences like home delivery and in-store repairs. The concept proved a hit, and Circuit City has devoted almost all its subsequent expansion to superstores.
Mr. Sharp, previously the owner of a computer software and consulting firm, arrived in 1982, hired to install a computer network that would link the stores with company headquarters. When that task was completed, Mr. Wurtzler hired Mr. Sharp as executive vice president and later promoted him to president and chief executive. (Alan Wurtzel is now Circuit City's chairman.) Mr. Sharp's own discipline has rubbed off on Circuit City. ''He's a systems guy, not a seat-of-the-pants merchant,'' commented Mr. Bolotsky. ''He's not a people person like Sam Walton,'' he said, referring to the head of Wal-Mart.
Mr. Sharp concurs with such assessments. ''I don't claim to be the merchant or even the guru of this business,'' he said. ''My contribution comes not from figuring out which one of those TV's we ought to be selling. What I can do is make sure, in the global sense, that our customers get the kind of service they need.''
At first glance, Circuit City's merchandising strategy seems to rely simply on the discounters' golden rule of high volume and low prices. In reality, however, it is a subtle balance between competitive pricing and customer hand-holding. ''It's very easy to beat Circuit City on price, just by selling televisions out of a garage,'' Mr. Bolotsky said. ''But they have finessed the pricing issue by competing on the basis of superior service and the other components of value.''
This is no small feat, however. Most consumers view TV's, stereos and appliances as ''commodity'' products that should be purchased only on the basis of price. At the same time, however, they want sales representatives who can explain the distinctions between competing products, and they like the conveniences of a full-service department store.
 
An Efficient Warehouse
 In large part, Circuit City straddles these competing demands by being efficient. A central warehouse facility near Richmond, for example, supplies about 50 stores in the Middle Atlantic region. By using computer-controlled routing machines and bar-code readers, the warehouse sorts orders and routes them over several miles of track to the proper loading dock. Only 16 employees receive and load more than $400 million worth of merchandise every year.
Circuit City's store designs are carefully calculated to create the illusion of both warehouse pricing and customer service. First-time customers usually walk in after reading or seeing advertisements about low prices. The stores reinforce that expectation in the lobby, where customers are given a view of the storage area with boxes piled on high. ''The purpose is to give people a little subliminal message, that 'Gosh, there are all these boxes and big volume, so they've got to sell this stuff cheap,' '' explained Mr. Sharp.
Once inside the display area, however, customers are greeted by an orderly, almost cozy, atmosphere. In the television section, for example, some 200 models line the walls, all tuned to the same channel. To make the selection easier, the models are meticulously arranged according to size and complexity. Layout is controlled so carefully that each model is in the same position, relative to its competitors, in Circuit City stores.
Well-groomed sales representatives, dressed in polished shoes and navy blazers (or gray, depending on the day), guide customers to the products in their price range. Salespeople have been schooled intensively on the distinctions between each product, and they specialize in only one category of merchandise at a time. They are assertive, and will always point out advantages of products one level more expensive than a customer has first sought out. But they are trained not to browbeat customers into making more expensive selections or denigrate less sophisticated merchandise.
Customers are reminded that they can return merchandise for any reason within 30 days. If a customer finds the same product selling elsewhere for less than he or she paid, Circuit City says it will refund 110 percent of the difference. The latter point is less helpful than most consumers realize, because appliance manufacturers try to forestall price wars by selling slightly different merchandise to rival retailers. Thus, finding precisely the same model nearby is usually difficult. Nevertheless, much of the inherent anxiety of picking a big-ticket item at more than the lowest available price is relieved.
All these details add to operational costs, and Circuit City's expenses for sales and administration account for about 22 percent of its revenues. They are significantly higher than no-frills warehouse clubs, where expenses average about 11 percent of sales. But 22 percent is still lower than department stores and many other specialty electronic retailers. For instance, those expenses at Highland Superstores have been averaging about 30 percent in recent quarters.
Thus far, Mr. Sharp has managed to stay even on prices with other conventional retailers but avoid bloodbaths. Stores in each market have the authority to lower prices to meet competition, but they are under orders to avoid starting their own price wars.
''This is such an intensely shopped business, and so visible, that essentially what happens is you just bring down the pricing in the market for everyone,'' said Mr. Sharp. ''So, we don't start price wars - but we usually end them. Make no mistake, we have the strength and the ability to respond.''
 
Controlling Expansion
 Unlike many of his rivals, Mr. Sharp has controlled the pace and the breadth of company expansion. Although Circuit City now competes in Los Angeles and San Francisco, all of its other expansion has been into areas contiguous with previously established markets.
As a result, Circuit City has no presence in some of the nation's largest metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Boston or, fortunately enough, any city in Texas. (In one blunder, the company did try to compete in New York. Crushing competition made it impossible for the stores to do much better than break even, however, and the company retreated.) The cautious expansion has produced several benefits. As a practical matter, Circuit City has been able to centralize its entire supply operation in three highly automated warehouses. That has boosted economies of scale, as well as flexibility, in transportation and handling.
On the strategic level, Circuit City has avoided the most brutally competitive markets, while earning comparatively easy profits in a host of smaller cities like Tampa, Fla. ''You can credit them with being brilliant or with being lucky,'' said Mr. Bolotsky of Goldman Sachs. ''But they do not compete against other major chains in most markets.'' Regardless, Mr. Sharp has proved that his company can compete fiercely if it must. Two years ago, Circuit City moved into San Francisco, home of The Good Guys, a highly regarded regional electronics chain and one of the only publicly held companies to increase its profits in recent years.
Consistent with its standard approach, Circuit City did not test the waters with a pilot store. Instead, it launched eight superstores at once to achieve economies of scale for mass-market advertising, distribution and administration. The up-front investment totaled between $40 million and $50 million, not including the initial advertising expenses.
Today, Circuit City is roughly equal in volume with Good Guys. Said Mr. Sharp: ''We move on the assumption that we will do well.''

HEADLINE: Old Newspapers Hit a Logjam

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: GARFIELD, N.J.

 BODY:
Hour after hour, around the clock, bundles of old newspapers rumble along a conveyor until they drop into a large vat at the Garden State Paper Company's recycling mill here along the Passaic River. In a few hours they will emerge as rolls of blank newsprint, ready to be used again.
The company, a subsidiary of Media General Inc., has been turning old newspapers into new newsprint since 1961 without much fanfare. But now municipalities are vying to sell their newspapers to Garden State. And they are hoping that more mills will follow in the company's footsteps and do so quickly. In response to the shortage of landfill space and pressure from environmentalists, municipalities across the nation have mandated newspaper recycling programs. The trouble is, there is a dearth of recyclers.
Paper makers have been slow to face the facts: Recycling is the way of the future and is already shrinking the market for their traditional product. But switching to recycling is no easy task. The industry, encumbered by huge and costly plants, has never been one to react quickly. Paper makers face other obstacles, too, like remote locations and depressed prices. 
It remains to be seen whether these manufacturers will wake up and catch the recycling trend - by building recycling mills or converting existing ones that use trees - or whether recyclers like Garden State will move in to fill the gap.
 
A Common Challenge
 But other industries are no doubt watching the drama unfold. After all, the challenge to recycle is sure to be repeated throughout American business as the public demands stronger conservation measures. In the aluminum industry, which has been struggling with the issue for some time, there already is a range of recyclers.
For now, supply of old newspapers has simply overwhelmed the capacity of recyclers, paper industry officials say. The eight mills in this country capable of recycling newspapers are already running at full capacity and sell all they produce. ''There are a million tons of old newspapers in warehouses, mills and waste paper packing plants now,'' said J. Rodney Edwards, a vice president of the American Paper Institute, a trade group. ''In July the industry said 'we're full.' ''
Some communities have started recycling programs only to find that they still have to truck newspapers to distant landfills. Each ton of newspapers not recycled uses three cubic feet of landfill space and incurs as much as $100 in disposal costs.
Meanwhile, the demand for recycled newsprint is growing. Some states have passed laws encouraging, even mandating, its use. Florida imposed a 10-cent-a-ton tax on non-recycled newsprint, which costs about the same amount as the recycled variety. A Connecticut law requires that newspapers published or circulated in the state use increasing amounts of recycled paper, starting at 20 percent in 1993 and rising to 90 percent. Legislators in New York and New Jersey have also discussed ways to increase the use of recycled newsprint.
If only to stave off more such legislation, newspaper publishers are showing more interest in recycled paper. ''I am very confident that publishers will make a significant commitment to buy recycled newsprint,'' said William M. Ferretti, director of energy conservation services for the New York State Department of Economic Development. He heads a committee on newsprint usage that is to release a report next month.
Executives at The New York Times said they are interested in using more recycled newsprint. ''We would favor another recycled newsprint mill in this area,'' said Walter E. Mattson, president of The New York Times Company. He said The Times would ''seek to be involved'' in attracting such a mill.
The Times currently buys about 30,000 short tons of recycled newsprint a year from Garden State, or about 8 percent of its total usage of 360,000 tons. Most of the remainder comes from mills in Canada using virgin fiber.
Other publishers have been paying more attention to recycled newsprint as well. ''There has been a lot of interest in the last few months,'' said James L. Hutchinson, another vice president of the American Paper Institute. ''There are a lot of discussions going on between publishers and their suppliers.''
The following publishers use varying amounts of recycled paper.
* The Gannett Company, whose 84 daily newspapers consume 962,000 short tons of newsprint a year, has a policy to use more recycled newsprint as it becomes available. ''We are in the 8 to 10 percent range now,'' said Shelia Gibbons, director of public affairs for Gannett.
* Jon Melkerson, director of newsprint operations for The Los Angeles Times, said 83 percent of its newsprint, or 380,000 short tons a year, contains some recycled fiber. The majority is from two mills in Oregon that produce a blend of 50 percent recycled paper with virgin wood.
* Knight-Ridder Inc., with 29 daily newspapers, uses 11 percent recycled newsprint, said Homer Taylor, vice president of supply. ''We will shortly be sending a letter to all our suppliers telling them we intend to be at 25 percent by 1992,'' he said.
 
Publishers Are Key
 Paper makers say the interest of publishers is crucial if they are to make the transition to recycling. ''From a producer's standpoint, if you are going to make newsprint, you would like to know where you are going to sell it,'' said John H. Veidt Jr., a vice president of the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, which has two mills in Oregon. ''In most mill start-ups lately a user was involved, either financially or contractually.''
The paper companies are under added pressure because newsprint prices have been depressed since the beginning of the year. With newspaper advertising linage down this year, newsprint is being sold at a 25 percent discount from the $650 a metric ton stated price, according to trade journals. (A metric ton is 2,205 pounds; a short ton is 2,000 pounds.) Under these conditions, paper makers are reluctant to invest as much as $400 million in a recycling mill - unless they have a financial safety net, either long-term purchase contracts or equity investments from publishers. With the increasing governmental pressure on publishers to buy recycled paper, these kinds of deals may not be far off, industry and government insiders say.
Even now, there are preliminary signs that recycling capacity will grow. Garden State and Jefferson Smurfit, the largest recyclers in North America, are studying the possibility of building mills in the Northeast. Officials ofseveral Northeastern states say most paper producers are considering adding de-inking equipment, at a cost of $20 million to $30 million a mill, to blend in some recycled material.
For the traditional paper companies this push to recycle comes at an inauspicious time. Many are just completing a building phase, started in the mid-80's when paper prices were rising steadily. About a dozen new mills and enlargements are scheduled to go into operation in the next few years, but almost all are based on trees.
And this new capacity is to produce an extra two million tons of newsprint a year, and will flood a market already having trouble absorbing 15 million. Industry analysts say these conditions - overproduction and depressed prices, on top of pressure to produce recycled paper - make the business ripe for a shakeout.
''Political incentives could create demand for recycled newsprint, which would cause problems in the forest products industry,'' said Jon G. Udell, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Business School. ''The impact could be the harshest on the Canadian industry.'' Nearly 60 percent of the newsprint consumed in the United States comes from Canada, where mills tend to be in remote locations, with an abundance of trees and a minimum of people. But recycling mills need to be close to the source of their raw material: large urban areas. Three of the five mills in the United States using 100 percent recycled material have such sites, in the suburbs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
 
The Geography Problem
 For the traditional paper companies, geography will be one of the stickiest obstacles to recycling. The economics of gathering up old newspapers from urban areas like New York, shipping them to distant mills in Canada and then shipping the finished product back are still being evaluated, industry executives say.
''The problem is that it has been difficult to persuade manufacturers with mills in a forest to invest in recycling equipment and go through all the travail involved in collection,'' said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan. ''But it is the manufacturers that will have to solve it.''
Recycling presents another sticky problem: paper quality. Publishers have been reluctant to use recycled paper in the past because it has been more likely to tear, disrupting high-speed pressrooms that operate on tight production schedules.
Recyclers want old newspapers but little else. Yellow-page telephone directories and brown bags, for example, color the paper, making it less desirable to publishers who want a bright white sheet for a more readable newspaper. Coated papers and slick magazines are equally undesirable. If the contaminants they contain get through filters, they can make sheets of rolled paper stick together, causing tears during printing.
Garden State pre-sorts newspapers at the warehouses of its subsidiary, Bruno & D'Elia Inc. Workers say the loads of papers have included everything from hand tools to a cement block. ''People have tried mechanizing the process, but nothing other than hand labor has worked so far,'' said Clare Mullett, manager of procurement services.
Incoming material has a big impact on the economics of recycling. Bruno & D'Elia pays $12 a ton for a ''clean'' load - newspapers tied with cotton string and nothing else. For a ''dirty'' load - one filled with shopping bags, junk mail and other unsuitable materials - it charges $20 a ton.
''Newspapers are teaching us a lesson on the importance of quality in the marketing of materials,'' said Mr. Ferretti, the New York State official.
Paper makers have learned another lesson: recycled paper must coexist with, not replace, paper from virgin fiber. Recycling breaks some fibers in newsprint to lengths too short to make strong paper, so they are filtered out. Ten to 15 percent of what goes into a mill is lost in processing, said James L. Burke, executive vice president of Garden State. And the percentage could rise if paper is repeatedly reused. For this reason, paper industry executives and analysts say Connecticut's demand that publishers use 90 percent recycled paper is unrealistic.
They also note that newspapers can be turned into other materials like like egg cartons and insulation. ''If there is legislation in this area,'' said Professor Udell, ''it should aim for the most economic use.''

HEADLINE: No New Taxes, But Plenty Of New Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the Bush Presidency unfolds, it is becoming clear that the Administration's most ambitious goals, like the war on drugs that the President proclaimed last week, are hostage to his campaign promise not to raise taxes. Even many of the President's strongest supporters agree that the drug initiative and some other Presidential proposals are constrained by inadequate financing, and nobody has proposed a politically feasible way to squeeze the needed funds out of the Federal budget.
In his speech Tuesday night, the President called drugs ''the gravest domestic threat facing our nation,'' but he proposed to spend only $716 million more than had already been budgeted in the next year for drug control programs. That is less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of the $1.1 trillion Federal budget. 
Other Bush initiatives have followed the same pattern.
* The President went to Poland in July to cheer on the cataclysmic political and economic changes under way there. But he pledged only $100 million to underwrite the transition to Polish democracy, 1 percent of the $10 billion in Western assistance that the Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, maintained was necessary.
* Mr. Bush promised in his election campaign last year to be the ''education President,'' but the budget he submitted in February included less money for education than Congress had appropriated the previous year.
* On the 20th anniversary of the American astronauts' first moon landing, Mr. Bush announced the new goal of sending people to Mars. But he never addressed how such a huge project would be paid for.
Mr. Bush maintains that more money is not necessarily the solution to all problems. Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, has argued all year that the secret is to reallocate funds from less worthy Government activities. But as was the case with the President's previous budget submissions, the cuts Mr. Darman suggested to pay for the modest drug program were all but guaranteed to be rejected by Congress. For example, the Economic Development Administration, which Mr. Darman recommended abolishing, is a particular favorite of Congressional Republicans. The agency gives loan guarantees to developers and other business owners who tend to be strong Republicans.
Mr. Bush's habit of speaking loudly but carrying a small fiscal stick has begun to grate even on some of his friends in Congress. Representative Mickey Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican, said of the drug fight, ''If it's not worth spending everything it takes, it's not a war.''
Among Democrats, the irritation was more intense. George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, spoke of ''the gap between rhetoric and reality, word and deed.''
 
Paying the Check
Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the Budget Committee, said he sensed ''a growing concern'' among his fellow Democrats, and among Republicans as well, ''that all these promises are being made and nothing is said about who's going to pick up the check.''
Michael J. Boskin, an economist who is chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told the United States Chamber of Commerce in a speech last week that a ''basic principle'' of the Administration was to reduce the budget deficit by slowing the growth of Government spending.
But the consensus of economists outside the Government is that savings big enough to provide funds to finance the war on drugs, improve public education or make ambitious advances in space exploration can be made only in two areas: the military and social insurance programs.
For example, the single step of canceling the Navy's plans to overhaul the aircraft carrier Enterprise would save nearly $2 billion. Eliminating for one year the cost-of-living increase paid Social Security beneficiaries would save $9 billion in the first year and, because of compounding, much more in subsequent years.
But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proved to be a vigorous advocate of the Pentagon's budget, and President Bush has been unwilling to make sharp reductions there. Both the President and Congress have forsworn reductions in Social Security payments.
''When you have to play off a program that doesn't exist against a program that exists and has strong interests behind it, it makes for very tough sledding,'' said a senior staff economist in Congress.
That leaves higher taxes as the only practical way to meet the President's goals, and most Democrats and many Republicans are hoping Mr. Bush will relax his no-tax stance somewhat to generate more money for the drug program. For instance, Representative Edwards, normally a forceful opponent of higher taxes, said he would support a higher tax on alcohol and tobacco if the money were dedicated to the drug fight. Public opinion polls indicate that this is a popular position.
Doubling the Federal tax on cigarettes to 32 cents a pack would raise about $3 billion a year. Raising the tax on beer and wine, which has been unchanged since 1951, to the same rate (based on alcohol content) as the tax on distilled spirits would raise about $5 billion a year while increasing the price of a six-pack of beer by less than 50 cents.
 
No Change on Taxes
But Mr. Bush has shown no inclination to relent on his tax pledge. In his speech he cautioned Congress against ''a partisan bidding war'' and said, ''We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit.''
Moreover, Mr. Darman, in his countless meetings with Congressional leaders over the last nine months, has given not the slightest hint that the Administration would accept anything that could be construed as a tax increase.
Democrats in Congress say they cannot afford to move toward higher taxes without the President's assent. ''We're not going to have a light-cavalry charge in the face of a certain veto,'' Senator Mitchell said.
The drug program aside, a revenue shortage remains. The law requires the President and Congress to find a way to reduce the budget deficit by at least $36 billion next year. Meantime, in the years ahead, the cost of cleaning up and modernizing nuclear weapons plants will cost more than $100 billion, Government accountants say. Eliminating hazardous waste at military bases will cost more than $10 billion.
Updating air traffic control systems will cost $25 billion in the next decade. And most experts believe the savings and loan rescue plan adopted this year will cost billions more than was budgeted. Furthermore, the demands for Federal help to young families for child-care expenses and to the elderly for long-term health care are mounting.
President Bush has not begun to address those problems in a comprehensive way. William J. Bennett, who devised the President's drug control policy, said last week that he had not been given a budgetary ceiling. ''But I'm a grown-up,'' he added. ''I'm part of the Administration. I live in the real world.''

HEADLINE: COLOMBIA'S VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS;
The President With the Biggest War on Drugs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, who has vowed to crush the drug lords who have turned his country into a killing ground, seems an unlikely field commander. Uninspiring at the microphone and uncomfortable with the grand gestures of leadership, Mr. Barco might be better cast as a university researcher.
Before the current war on Colombia's cocaine traffickers began, his distaste for publicity and reluctance to make public appearances had left many people calling him the ''ghost president.'' But now, confronted by powerful and vicious hoodlums, the 67-year-old scion of a wealthy land-owning family has surprised his enemies and his colleagues by ferociously striking back. Earlier this year, under pressure from Washington to cut the flow of cocaine to the United States, he began ordering raids on processing laboratories and jungle airfields. Three weeks ago, he began to wage all-out war. In the battle, Mr. Barco has to worry about the reliability of his security forces and some elected officials. He is also wary of the potentially undermining effects of a tempting but probably disingenuous offer of a truce by the drug lords. At the same time he and his centrist party have all the typical political pressures of an election year. Many Colombians oppose his decision to send the so-called extraditables to the United States on the ground that it looks like an admission that Colombia's judicial institutions are inferior. As a former executive director of the World Bank in Washington and Ambassador to the United States, he faces criticism at home for seeming too willing to follow Washington's lead. 
But senior Government officials and Western diplomats here said that President Barco had become convinced that the powerful drug traffickers were striving to supplant Colombia's traditional politicians and, through intimidation, bribes and the creation of their own political party, seize control of the country. ''The traffickers are not only criminal, but politically oriented to the extreme right, and he believes they are mortal enemies of our democracy,'' said a senior Government official.
Mr. Barco, who holds a degree in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gave no indication in his lackluster campaign in 1986 that he planned to take on the private armies of the drug barons, who are among the wealthiest men in the world. His toughest hurdle on the way to the presidency was in gaining the nomination of his Liberal Party, which has invariably won office when it has avoided internal warfare.
In his fight against the traffickers, Mr. Barco has the backing of the United States. But he also has more than a few handicaps. His army and police force are ridden with corruption. There are serious questions about whether the Colombian people will be willing to endure an almost certainly long and bloody war.
Furthermore, congressional elections are coming up in seven months with presidential elections two months later. Constitutionally, Mr. Barco cannot succeed himself, but he is being undercut by partisan politics as members of both his party and the opposition Conservative Party, which share a nearly indistinguishable centrist ideology, jockey for personal advantage.
 
Fighting Guerrillas
In his first three years in office, Mr. Barco concentrated on pacifying Colombia's half-dozen leftist guerrilla organizations. His advisers said he focused on the rebels rather than on the traffickers simply because he could not do everything at once and because in the beginning he regarded the leftists as the greater threat. As he progressed toward a deal with the guerrillas, he shifted attention to the drug lords.
The traffickers had long cowed the Colombian judiciary with guns and bribes. In early August a new political party called the National Restoration Movement was born in the Magdalena River Valley, a region of cattle ranchers and peasant farmers. The party says it is for democracy, a better life for Colombia's poor and an end to leftist guerrillas, but the Government warns that it is dominated by the drug barons.
For months, in his methodical, plodding manner, Mr. Barco worked to build a consensus for the plan he announced on Aug. 19 calling for confiscation of property and extradition. That week the traffickers' assassins had gunned down a provincial police chief and a magistrate. Hours before the President announced the campaign, Senator Carlos Luis Galan, the most popular presidential candidate, was killed.
Swept along by the candidate's murder, initial support for a war on the drug lords was overwhelming. An independent poll published Friday showed that more than 75 percent of Colombians were still behind him. But there have been expressions of disenchantment from leaders in both parties. American officials say the latest raids have severely disrupted cocaine production and shipping, but not a single kingpin has yet been captured.
 
Living With Violence
Colombians have been living with violence for decades, and before the latest surge, many of them seemed willing to quietly coexist with the traffickers. In the late 1940's and early 1950's the two main political parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, fought a civil war known as La Violencia that cost 300,000 lives. These days, in addition to the leftist guerrillas, more than 130 rightist paramilitary units are operating in Colombia, many linked to the drug traffickers. There are also legions of criminals who make a living as hired killers and robbers.
Signs of how difficult a task President Barco faces, even in rallying the other leaders of Colombia for the fight, was evident last week. When his Cabinet tried to address the House of Representatives to gain support for converting decrees by Mr. Barco on extradition and confiscation into laws, the acting speaker from the Conservative Party abruptly called for adjournment.
Mr. Barco had angered the Conservatives by abruptly declaring that some civilian mayors in areas dominated by the cocaine traffickers would be replaced by military officers of his chosing. The mayors are considered a key to grass-roots political support and Mr. Barco's Liberal colleagues were as angry as the Conservatives. They fumed about dictatorial tactics and refused to concede that an appointed military officer might prove a more formidable and less corruptible foe of the traffickers than an elected civilian. Within 24 hours Mr. Barco abandoned what he had reckoned to be an important weapon against the traffickers.

HEADLINE: Seoul Is Opening Up, But Its Jails Are Still Full

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
EVEN before the end of the Seoul Olympics last year, which raised Koreans' hopes for progress and stability, leaders here fretted about a potential post-Games letdown. Today the euphoria of that time is long gone, and South Korea is struggling with the shadows of its authoritarian past and lurching fitfully in its transition to democracy after decades of military rule.
As in the past, the challenges facing South Korea are epitomized by the state of its jails. This spring and summer, less than 18 months after President Roh Tae Woo released hundreds of political prisoners in his first gesture toward a more open society, the country faced a wave of sometimes violent strikes, student protests and anti-Government actions, including unauthorized trips to North Korea by leftist dissidents.
Despite the widespread view that this opposition posed only a mild threat to stability, Mr. Roh responded with a crackdown on militant dissent that has filled jails with as many political detainees as were imprisoned before he took office in early 1988. The jailings, in turn, have created new concern about Mr. Roh's commitment to due process and free institutions. 
Mr. Roh's crackdown culminated last month with the indictment of Kim Dae Jung, the most prominent opposition leader, on charges of violating national security laws. Mr. Kim, who was one of Mr. Roh's opponents in the 1987 election, remains free and his frequent denunciations of the Government are widely publicized. But human rights groups say that perhaps 800 dissidents, some of them avowedly radical leftists, are waiting in prison for their day in court.
''There has been a true conservative backlash that makes everyone a little nervous about the future,'' a Western diplomat said.
Mr. Roh's advisers dismiss the concern that democracy is endangered. They assert that the National Assembly is functioning vigorously with Mr. Kim's party in the dominant position, and that freedom of the press and the independence of the judiciary are respected. ''Seoul Plaza is not Tiananmen Square,'' an aide to Mr. Roh said. ''To return to the old ways is impossible.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Roh's actions were a reminder that although a democratically elected government is in place, many trappings of democracy have yet to be institutionalized. A free press prints criticism of the Government, but many Korean oppositionists feel that newspapers still reflect the conservatism of their owners.
 
Showcasing Progress
This autumn was supposed to have been a season in which South Korea would showcase its recent progress. Vice President Dan Quayle is due for a visit later this month, followed by Pope John Paul II in October. Then, Mr. Roh is to visit Washington. United States officials say recent events in South Korea are unlikely to disrupt the exchanges, but they are worried that the situation could deteriorate. Political stability is essential if there is to be any serious discussion of possible reductions in the 44,000 American troops stationed here. Sentiment is rising in Washington for such decreases, or at least for demands that Seoul pay more of their expenses.
Only six months ago, the atmosphere was far less contentious, as opposition leaders urged their supporters to give Mr. Roh time to fulfill his campaign promises. There was even talk, unthinkable a year or two ago, of a possible political alliance between Mr. Roh and the opposition.
But in the spring, an impasse developed over disagreements on several matters, such as how to handle the legacy of South Korea's authoritarian past. An especially delicate subject was the placement of blame for the 1980 massacre in Kwangju, in which hundreds were said to have died as the army and security police suppressed a student rebellion. The opposition demanded that Mr. Roh purge his Government of several people involved in the Kwangju action, but the President apparently felt he could not do so without angering his right-wing backers.
Even some Roh supporters concede that he may indeed have overstepped himself in the crackdown. But they also argue that the success or failure of the Roh Government will rest on other issues. Some say that South Korea's booming economy and rapid industrialization are creating wider and wider disparities, and they maintain that economic deprivation ought to be their most important concern.
''In the past 30 years, we have moved from absolute poverty to unevenly distributed prosperity,'' said Jei Jeong Gu, chairman of the Progressive Political Movement, an independent group. Thus, organized labor is becoming more militant, land prices are soaring, housing is in short supply, and slums are spreading.
Both the Government and the opposition have proposals to deal with such things, and at one point it seemed that the National Assembly would agree on sweeping reforms this year. But for now, all bets for cooperation are off. Political experts say that that South Koreans will have to move beyond their fixation with protests and arrests and get down to providing economic benefits as the best means to assure stability.

HEADLINE: Flight and Futility Are Rountine in the Horn of Africa

BYLINE: By Jane Perlez

 BODY:
THE Horn of Africa, which includes the waters of the Nile and the fertile lands of southern Ethiopia, is rich in the basic requirements for agriculture. Without war, it could easily be self-sufficient in food. But the last two decades have proved a time of hunger and dislocation on an enormous scale throughout the region. In an attempt to resolve one cause of that misery - the civil war between Eritrean rebels and the Ethiopian Government - preliminary peace talks began in Atlanta last week under the auspices of former President Jimmy Carter.
Wars in the Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia have thrown nearly two million refugees across the map of the Horn, and both the Sudan and Ethiopia have come to rely on huge supplies of world humanitarian aid to help reduce hunger. 
The people of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia have intermingled for centuries, giving them a shared cultural, social and historical legacy. Today, what they share most is the despair of civil war, refugee encampments, economic decline and recurring famine.
 
Absolutist Leaders
Throughout the region, absolutist regimes have been waging fruitless wars that threadbare economies cannot withstand. Perhaps most tragic of all has been the tension between Ethiopia and the Sudan; each has helped a long-running insurgency in the other's territory, and each conflict has produced a flood of refugees with which the two countries must cope.
Until recently, much of the misery was being worsened by East-West competition; the Horn was a hotbed of rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, and in 1977, the superpowers even traded client states. Ethiopia became an ally of the Soviets after having had a long allegiance to the United States; Somalia, previously backed by Moscow, was furnished with American weaponry.
But with the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and an easing of tensions in the Indian Ocean, superpower competition for bases in the region has decreased.
 
Superpower Retrenchment
The Soviet Union, which United States officials say has spent $11 billion on supplying the Ethiopian armed forces, has lost its enthusiasm for that civil war. Last week, the State Department said Washington had suspended new military aid and some economic assistance to Somalia because of abuses that included killings by the Somali Army of hundreds of unarmed civilians in rebel areas. And in the Sudan, the United States has urged its ally, the Government in Khartoum, to talk to the rebel southerners, with whom Washington has also been in touch.
While the talks in Atlanta represented a step toward perhaps resolving one conflict, both the Eritrean rebels and the Ethiopian Government said it would be a long and tedious process before a de facto cease-fire now in place could be turned into a firm peace. In Ethiopia, as in the rest of the Horn of Africa, even lasting peace would leave immense problems, particularly the fate of the vast numbers of refugees displaced by war and war-related famine.
 
Civil War
Southern rebels, largely Christian and animist, have fought on and off for 21 years against Muslim Governments in the north. A de facto cease-fire has prevailed since May, but the Sudan's leader, Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, was quoted recently as saying he was prepared to renew fighting. The war and resulting famine have caused the flight of more than one million southern Sudanese to northern Sudan and the area around Juba. Some 367,000 Sudanese, many of them teen-age boys whose parents were killed, have fled into Ethiopia.
 
Hunger
The United Nations estimates that 250,000 people died of hunger last year in the Sudan, mainly in three southern provinces. Large-scale starvation appears to have been averted this year, in part because fighting has abated and a United Nations relief effort has delivered tens of thousands of tons of food.
 
Flight From Chad
Some 20,000 refugees from the civil war in Chad fled into western Sudan in the late 1970's and 1980's and, in the absence of a permanent settlement there, have not returned home even though the battle fronts are quiet.
 
War on Two Fronts
Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 28 years for independence from Ethiopia. Other rebels in the region of Tigre have been fighting since 1977 for greater autonomy. As the preliminary peace talks in the Eritrean conflict began last Thursday, the Government and the Tigrean rebels renewed fighting. The fighting in Eritrea and attendant starvation have caused an exodus of 625,000 refugees into the Sudan in the last 20 years.
 
Specter of Starvation
Two years of adequate rain have spared Ethiopia from famine on the horrifying scale of 1984-85, but agricultural production continues to decline and the population is increasing, keeping the Ethiopians in jeopardy.
 
Rebellion
Northern rebels seek the ouster of Somalia's leader, Gen. Mohammed Siad Barre. In 1988 they retaliated against his forces for abuses that included executions of suspected rebels; the Somali Army then inflicted heavy civilian casualties and damage on Hargeisa and Burao. Recent fighting has been reported in Mogadishu and Kismayu. The Government has armed Ethiopian refugees who fled in 1977 during a Somali-Ethiopian war. Last week the United Nations said it was suspending supplies to these refugees because they are used as combatants in Somalia's civil war. The Government reports 837,000 Ethiopian refugees in Somalia, but United Nations officials say privately that the number may be half that. The civil war has sent 324,000 refugees to Ethiopia and 30,000 to Djibouti.

HEADLINE: Congress Gets Serious On the Capital Gains Tax

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE of President Bush's favorite ideas, to cut the capital gains tax, has been transformed this summer from long shot to near certainty. But what form it will take is not at all certain as Congress sets out to decide how to restore a tax preference that was abolished in the tax overhaul legislation of 1986.
To do this, legislators will have to overcome a lingering reluctance to tamper with the rewritten tax code - in the process undermining the goal of eliminating loopholes - and resist the temptation to reduce a fiendishly complex subject to rhetorical oversimplification grounded in class warfare.
The 1986 legislation was itself a compromise. Along with abolishing the special rate on profits from the sale of stock and other assets - which for 65 years had been lower than the rate on other income - the new law cut overall tax rates, to the current maximum of 33 percent. 
But now the Republicans argue that restoring the capital gains preference would stimulate the economy by encouraging investment and raising revenue. Those who oppose the cut say that it amounts to tax relief for the wealthy, and that in any event it would cause a revenue drain in the long term.
Little is known about the impact of changing the levy on capital gains. The budget, the economy and various groups of taxpayers would all be affected in largely unpredictable ways, various analysts say.
One reason is that taxpayers can exercise a large degree of control over when, if ever, they pay a capital gains tax. The sale of assets that have risen in value can in most cases be accelerated or postponed at will, and tax liability can be avoided entirely if the assets are passed along at death to the next generation.
Another reason for uncertainty is the volume of potential sales. At the end of 1987, Americans held an estimated $4 trillion of unrealized capital gains, about half in stocks and bonds and half in real estate. Securities values have since risen an additional $750 billion.
 
On Verge of Victory
Nonetheless, President Bush, whose campaign pitch for capital gains reduction seemed so unrealistic at the time, is on the verge of a victory that the Administration asserts will provide broad economic gains.
''It's likely to lead to increased entrepreneurial activity, investment, risk-taking and long-range economic growth,'' Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, said last week. He sees these putative benefits as ''swamping'' any loss of revenue or other possible disadvantages.
The political breakthrough came in late July, when six of the 23 Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee joined the 13 Republicans to form a majority favoring a rate cut. This forced the chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, to devise his own relief plan.
Most Democrats still say capital-gains reduction is ''effectively a tax break for the wealthy paid for by the middle class,'' as the Senate Majority Leader, George J. Mitchell, put it last week.
Republicans say everybody benefits from a strengthened economy and insist that taxation of the rich and taxation of a certain form of income are different issues.
It has become clear, in fact, that many ordinary people do have sizable, though perhaps occasional, capital gains. This may help account for the liberal Democrats' inability to bury the idea.
Yet Republicans cannot offer much proof that a rate cut is good policy. It is generally agreed that a straightforward tax-rate cut will raise money for the treasury in the first year or two as people rush to take profits, but nobody can predict what it would do to revenue over the longer term, as the stock market, inflation and other factors would affect decisions about cashing in gains.
There is also little evidence - as opposed to textbook faith - that a cut in the capital gains rate would invigorate the overall economy. Some economists do not accept the assumption that the country needs more risk-taking entrepreneurs, most of whom, after all, wind up failing and wasting resources.
Moreover, capital gains already enjoy preferential status not only because taxes are avoided in the case of inheritance but because for each year the gains are deferred, investors avoid taxes that would have to be paid if they were receiving the interest instead. Thus, the conservative economist Herbert Stein contends, policies that tend to favor long-held assets are exactly backward.
In addition to sliding scales based on the holding period, the score of capital gains plans now before Congress include such possibilities as helping small businesses or other groups, aiming for maximum short-term revenue by making the rate cut temporary, and indexing so gains due to inflation would not be taxed.
The winning combination remains anybody's guess, but the betting in Washington is that the idea of making the rate cut temporary - however clever a budgetary gimmick it may be -will fail while some kind of adjustment for inflation will succeed.
Indexation is the main feature of Representative Rostenkowski's proposal, but this will likely not be enough for his six breakaway Democrats, five of them from the entrepreneurial Sun Belt, or for a White House that sees the center of gravity on the capital gains issue finally moving its way.

HEADLINE: While History Is Conflict, the End Is Not Yet

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your excerpt from ''The End of History?'' by Francis Fukuyama in The National Interest for summer 1989, with its prediction of a coming ''end of history'' and of the ''sad time'' to follow (Week in Review, Aug. 27), is reminiscent of the worries that once led John Stuart Mill to the emotional brink. As recounted in his autobiography, he asked himself: '' 'Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?' And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered, 'No!' At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down.''
Mill found his way out in considerable measure through appreciation of poetry and a new ''theory of life''; happiness, still a goal, ''was only to be obtained by not making it the direct end.'' He continued: ''Those only are happy . . . who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit followed . . . Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.'' 
Yet no more than all Mill's desired ''changes in institutions and opinions'' (perhaps notably woman suffrage) were ever attained in Victorian England, does there seem to be any end in sight in the United States to the conflict we are told is the true stuff of history. Ironically, the focus for the coming victory of the West in Mr. Fukuyama's analysis seems to be an implicit opposition between ''Western liberalism'' and a presumably non-Western Communism or socialism.
Let us not forget that Marxism is also a product of the West (the Soviet Union notwithstanding). Marx himself was a German: not from the outer reaches of East Prussia, but from that outpost of the Roman Empire, Trier. Much of Western liberalism's longevity and strength, especially in Europe, is due to its relationship with socialist-Marxist movements, producing such syntheses as the welfare state and social democracy.
It is an American aberration that we remain outside this synthesis to the extent that we do, even as the inequalities in our society grow. If history is conflict, the United States, with its racial and economic divisions (as well as the sexism that is by no means unique to this country), should provide plenty of grist for historians' mills for some time to come.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
The Phony War

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A President who was serious in declaring a new war on drugs would do at least these things:
* Make a commitment to provide treatment for addicts who want to give up the habit - millions of whom cannot now get into treatment programs.
* Propose plans, and money, to reduce demand by getting at the causes of Americans' lust for drugs.
* Recognize candidly that expensive efforts to stop the flow of drugs into this country have been worthless, and that interdiction can never be very successful.
* Make no promises without committing the funds to pay for them. 
Those are the tests applied by drug experts right across this country, the men and women fighting the menace on the ground. They know the kind of commitment needed to deal with it.
President Bush met none of those tests last week. The ''strategy'' he announced for the war on drugs was virtually empty of new money, realism or candor. What it was long on was politics.
The President put overwhelming emphasis on interdiction and law enforcement, which have been the main U.S. answers to the drug problem over the last decade. In that time supplies of cocaine entering the country have increased so much that the street price has fallen from $60,000 a kilogram to $10,000.
Every decent person wants to see the drug lords broken; everyone applauds the courage of the Colombian Government in fighting the Medellin cartel. But no one who has dealt with the problem really believes that supplies can be cut off. Cocaine is too easy to produce and to transport. New suppliers will arise in new places before long.
Moreover, all-out military action of the kind Mr. Bush has hinted at to stop coca production in South America would risk bringing the coca-growing peasants into revolutionary movements like Peru's Shining Path. William Bennett's draft of the drug plan recognized that eradication of coca crops could sometimes ''be self-defeating, driving farmers into the ranks of anti-Government insurgency.'' But that passage was deleted.
Law-abiding Americans are angry at drug dealers and users. They naturally like politicians who talk about ruthless war on drug barons, about more prisons and tough law enforcement. That is what President Bush did.
At the American Legion convention the President said some who criticized his drug program as insufficient were ''the very people who oppose the death penalty. It's that kind of thinking that's lost too many battles already. So let's not let these critics lose the war.''
The trouble is that the military rhetoric does not actually solve the American drug problem. The words in the White House have just about nothing to do with the reality on the ground. That was made powerfully clear by a New York Times reporter, John Kifner, who visited the South Bronx after the President's speech last week and reported what he saw and heard.
Crack and heroin were on sale almost openly. The police saw what was happening but felt from experience that arresting even significant numbers would have no effect. ''There's so much money in drugs,'' a detective said.
One of the drug men told Mr. Kifner: ''Hey, there's no work. You go looking for a job, they want to pay you $3.50 an hour. New York's expensive, man. You can't live on the breeze. That's why we're selling drugs.'' The conservatives who have been in power under Ronald Reagan and George Bush preach a good deal about the power of economic motivation. But somehow they do not see it when it comes to drugs. They do not recognize that social and economic measures to reduce the appeal of drugs may work better than a ''war.'' Or perhaps they are afraid to say so. The Economist of London, which knows the United States better than any other foreign journal, is not afraid. In its issue of Sept. 2 it analyzed at length America's ''national curse of drugs and drug-financed crime.'' It concluded that the attempt to prohibit drugs should be replaced by a regime of regulation and taxation.
Cheap gin ravaged Britain in the 18th century, the magazine noted. The answer was not to prohibit it but to control the sale and tax it to raise the price. America tried prohibition, and it was a disaster.
''Repression, however vigorous, cannot win the war against drugs,'' The Economist said. ''Legalizing the trade would be risky. Prohibition is worse than risky.''
That kind of talk is too dangerous for American politicians now. But at least they could stop talking cynically about winning a war on drugs.

Diplomatese

BYLINE: By ALVARO DE SOTO; Alvaro de Soto, a Peruvian career diplomat, is executive assistant to Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary General of the United Nations. William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
DIPLOMATS, LIKE all practitioners of a specialized craft, have their own parlance, and in diplomacy, as elsewhere, things are not always what they seem.
The Secretary General's good offices is not a reference to the physical trappings of the United Nations chief's working quarters. (In fact, his office on the 38th floor of the Secretariat building is rather spartan, with a drab view of the East River and Long Island City.) A person entrusted with good offices, or a good officer, is a channel of communication between parties to a dispute who are not on speaking terms.
It is a catchall term, the functions of a good officer ranging from passing messages from one party to another to brokering a ceasefire to negotiating a comprehensive peace agreement. As a rule, the officer does not make proposals to the parties in the formal sense, and operates largely out of the limelight. 
Good offices involve meetings with high-level interlocutors, usually foreign ministers. They are often held, wholly or in part, tete-a-tete- literally, in the language of Talleyrand, head-to-head or, according to current usage in the United States, one-on-one. At the United Nations, tete-a-tete means just that: no one present but the principals. We are, however, increasingly faced with the baffling question: ''Who will join the S.G. as note-taker during the tete-a-tete meeting?''
As a professional diplomat, the S.G. (as the Secretary General is frequently referred to) is perfectly capable of jotting down or dictating an accurate note to the file, known to my American colleagues as a memcon (memorandum of conversation). So a note-taker is not a must for him. Besides, total recall is practically a requirement for effective good officers. However, a note-taker at meetings can be helpful to the principals, and sometimes an interpreter is a note-taker in disguise.
But does a tete-a-tete remain one when note-takers are present? I won't quibble on this point; after all, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, in 16th-century France, tete-a-tete didn't even have a friendly connotation - it referred to single combat. For meetings solely between the principals, I offer this suggestion, also from the French, a quatre yeux, which translates roughly as ''four eyes only.''
In a set-piece meeting, on the other hand, the principals will be accompanied by aides, who are referred to in the S.G.'s office as insiders. An insider is not necessarily ''someone in the know.'' The word insiders, as we use it, refers to people actually inside the room where a meeting is held. Hence, insiders may know far less than outsiders in the know.
At the United Nations, diplomats and their assistants increasingly use a tool borrowed from the world of multilateral diplomacy: the nonpaper. This is an exploratory paper whose author wishes to remain anonymous or at least retain deniability until the chances of success of the proposal outlined within it have been ascertained. Nonpapers are not circulated; they are gingerly floated, falling into the hands of fellow delegates as though by chance, deus ex machina. (''I just happen to have with me a nonpaper which attempts to reflect the idea which Your Excellency has so aptly expressed.'') Without interviewing the many batches of United Nations professionals who have served since the organization was established in 1945 - a daunting, if not hopeless, task - I venture an educated guess as to the word's origins. Having sat in on countless tete-a-tetes and other meetings at the United Nations for more than 20 years, I would say that the expression was most probably coined by a United States diplomat. My no-nonsense American colleagues seem partial to an economy of expression.
Confronted with an unpalatable formal proposal, not preceded by a nonpaper, a diplomat can reject it in a number of ways. He can address the issues raised. He can ignore it. Or he can give it fin de non recevoir - that is, deem it as having not been received.
When an agreement between parties to a conflict has been reached, however, the binding terms need to be recorded. Lest lightning strike one of the negotiators and the understandings go up in smoke, ultimately all aspects of a deal should be committed to some form of record, at least a final act, perhaps an exchange of notes, ideally a sacrosanct treaty.
True diplomats set great store by the written word. Those with classical training quote the Latin verba volant, scripta manent - ''words fly away, writing stays.'' Talleyrand, a stickler for thoroughness, is said to have been told by an exasperated aide about a fine point that the prince insisted on having reflected in a text: ''Mais Sire, cela va sans dire'' (''But Sire, it goes without saying''). To this, the prince replied: ''Cela va encore mieux en le disant'' (''It is even better to say it'').
In addition to impartiality and honesty, people engaged in good offices must have the gift of good timing and a flawless sense of balance, if they are to avoid diving into an empty pool. In the S.G.'s office, we have, since the early 1980's, been consigning certain situations to the empty pool category - shorthand for cases in which it would not be advisable, or might be counterproductive, to attempt to assist in resolving a given dispute or conflict.
Again, it is difficult to pinpoint first usage, let alone the uncontested author, but the expression made its first appearance in print in 1983. The occasion was the bicentennial of the Treaty of Paris, when Sir Brian Urquhart, the United Nations' peacekeeper extraordinaire, gave an address at the Smithsonian Institution.
In a list of ''some don'ts for workers for peace,'' he cited this: ''Don't dive into an empty pool. This may create a temporary sensation, but it will leave you stunned and incapable of further action. It is equally inadvisable to dive into a pool of boiling water.''
If it has been determined that there is sufficient water in the pool, and that its temperature is acceptable, shuttle diplomacy may at some point be warranted. The S.G. does a fair share of traveling. By White House or Fortune 500 standards, his journeys - often hastily arranged -are made on a shoestring budget. So I find it particularly apt that members of his entourage are referred to, regardless of rank, as straphangers.
In 1984, in Timbuktu, I first happened on the word straphanger, as applied to a member of the S.G.'s party. It was used by the personnel responsible for getting the principal and everyone in his party from point A to point B safely, at the appointed hour and with their baggage.
When I first overheard the term, I thought I detected a touch of sarcasm. As a straphanger in the S.G.'s party, I felt more curious than insulted, however. The word is obviously borrowed from the world of mass transportation. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English defines a straphanger as ''a bus or train passenger who has to stand and hold strap for lack of sitting space.''
Straphanger is far preferable to hangers-on, and in its allusion to the New York subway can be said to be part of the United Nations' homespun tribute to the city that hosts it in its inimitable way.

HEADLINE: FOOD;
FREE-TRADE CUISINE

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER and PIERRE FRANEY

 BODY:
A RESTAURANT WRITER'S LIFE HAS BECOME exasperatingly complicated in recent years, what with all the cross-pollination of cuisines and internationalization of kitchen staffs. Dining out used to be fairly straightforward: you went to a French restaurant and ate French food; Italian restaurants served Italian food, and the Japanese respected their gastronomic borders, as did the Spanish, Mexicans and Greeks. American food was a little trickier, melting pot that we are, but our cooking was still regionally identifiable.
A recent call to a Manhattan restaurant that was about to open inquired what kind of food would be served. ''We're sort of an American-bistro-style trattoria,'' the manager explained, which is like describing a puppy as a cocker-spaniel-poodle-Great Dane. He went on to say that the chef was American and that the menu included everything from sandwiches, hamburgers and stews to bistro fare (terrines, cassoulet, choucroute), pastas and pizzas. 
How does one categorize such a gastronomic mongrel? Years ago, restaurants that had multiple passports were dubbed continental, a term that seems dated today, reminiscent of overupholstered hotel dining rooms that served boiled potatoes and creamed spinach with every entree. Some restaurant guides resort to descriptions like nouvelle, international and eclectic - none of which conveys much useful information. But, then, how does one characterize a restaurant like Huberts, in New York, where the appetizer list might include soft-shell crabs marinated in ponzu (a Japanese citrus vinegar), grilled shrimp in a spicy Cajun sauce and rabbit sausage with Mexican mole sauce?
Or how about Jane's Bar and Grill, on East 60th Street in Manhattan. There, the chef, Daniel Baylis (who has worked at two other ''eclectic'' spots, Aurora and the Odeon) serves traditional French fare (duck sausage and lentils) next to such cosmopolitan creations as lobster-filled cannelloni seasoned with coriander and presented over fresh tomato sauce and fava beans.
The liberal borrowing from different national pantries is often traced to so-called California cuisine (another label that has grown a layer of mold), though in fact it began in a big way with French nouvelle cuisine in the early 1970's. Leading chefs like Paul Bocuse and Michel Guerard traveled extensively and were influenced by what they saw, particularly in the Orient. A later generation of American chefs has done the same. Len Allison of Huberts and Barry Wine of the Quilted Giraffe are typical. Both started with essentially French cuisine, yet they later became enamored of Japanese food and esthetics, and as a result nudged their menus toward the East.
And it works both ways. Restaurants with Japanese and Chinese chefs, such as Sino and Duane Park Cafe in New York and Chinois on Main in Santa Monica, Calif., turn out food that is Western-influenced.
Manhattan's Union Square Cafe, which has turned a chronic identity crisis between France and Italy into a culinary triumph, arises from the same circumstances: Danny Meyer, the owner, studied and worked in France and Italy before opening his restaurant. Both of his chefs, first Ali Barker (currently at the supertrendy 150 Wooster Street) and now Michael Romano, came from classical French backgrounds. Yet more than half the menu at Union Square Cafe is Italian or Italian-French.
The internationalization of cuisine is also encouraged by the ready availability of ingredients from around the world in specialty shops and, increasingly, supermarkets. Morels, shiitake mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh game, arborio rice, goat cheese, filo dough, couscous - all are easy to find in major cities. ''It's incredible,'' says Ludger Szmania, the German-born executive chef at the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel, in Seattle. ''Out here we can get everything year-round. You get spoiled.''
Some traditionalists, particularly overseas, have been heard grumbling that, ultimately, cuisine without national borders could have the same deleterious effect as the impending unification of the European Economic Community: one big homogenized stew. While that is unlikely -national tastes and pride are not so fickle - it is true that cooking has entered a daring and potentially exciting new era of experimentation. Like most cooking revolutions, it is pioneered by restaurant chefs before trickling down to the home cook.
We have had the opportunity to sample some of the best cross-cultural (sounds anthropological, doesn't it?) cooking around the country in the past year. The common denominator for success is universal: harmony of ingredients, attention to texture and visual enticement. We have come up with a few of our own recipes, which, to our taste, meet these criteria. One is a ravioli dish that is made with Chinese won-ton skins, which are available in Oriental groceries. These are much lighter and uniform that most home cooks can produce at home, and they are simple to use. They can be filled with all sorts of ingredients - shrimp, pork, seafood mousses - and served with all kinds of sauces - in a light shellfish broth, a beurre blanc, fresh tomato sauce, pesto.
Veal shank, which the Italians customarily make with carrots, celery, onions and tomato, can be given a colorful, light twist by cooking it with Oriental vegetables: Chinese cabbage, snow peas, sprouts, coriander. And for a bright summer dish, we have devised a poached skate with pesto sauce over orzo, the Greek pasta shaped like rice.
And what shall we call these dishes? We'll settle for tasty.
 
SHRIMP AND GINGER RAVIOLI WITH BEURRE BLANC
 
1 1/4 pounds medium-sized shrimp
Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
 1/4 cup finely chopped water chestnuts
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander
 1/4 teaspoon hot red-pepper flakes
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
 About 60 Chinese won-ton wrappers (include extras in case some break)
1 large egg, beaten
1 quart shrimp broth (see recipe)
 Beurre blanc (see recipe).
1. Peel and devein the shrimp. Reserve the shells for shrimp broth.
2. Chop the shrimp into small cubes. In a mixing bowl, combine the shrimp, salt and pepper, water chestnuts, ginger, olive oil, coriander, pepper flakes and soy sauce. Blend well and let sit for about 10 minutes.
3. Lay one won-ton wrapper on a lightly floured dry surface. Brush it with some of the beaten egg. Place three-quarters of a teaspoon of the shrimp mixture on the center of the won ton. Top the won ton with another skin, pressing the edges firmly around the perimeter to seal thoroughly. Trim the won-ton skin edges with a cookie cutter to remove excess dough. Repeat the procedure with the rest of the ingredients. Cover the finished uncooked ravioli with a moistened towel to keep them from drying out.
4. Poach the ravioli, five or six at a time, in simmering shrimp broth for about one minute or until they rise to the surface. Drain and place four to six ravioli on warm serving plates. Drizzle some beurre blanc over and serve immediately.
Yield: About 24 ravioli.
 
SHRIMP BROTH
 
Shells from raw shrimp
5 cups water
6 black peppercorns
 1/4 cup coarsely chopped onions
2 ribs celery coarsely chopped
1 bay leaf.
Put all the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes and strain.
Yield: About four cups.
 
BEURRE BLANC
 
4 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
1 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar
2 tablespoons heavy cream
8 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter cut into pats
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon, or any fresh herb of choice
 Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste.
1. Put the shallots, wine and vinegar into a small, heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is reduced to four tablespoons.
2. Add the cream. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter one pat at a time. Add the tarragon, season with salt and pepper, and keep warm.
Yield: One cup.
 
POACHED SKATE WITH PESTO SAUCE
 
4 boneless, skinless skate wings, about 1 1/2 pounds
4 tablespoons white-wine vinegar
4 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried
1 large bay leaf
4 sprigs fresh parsley
 Salt to taste
8 whole peppercorns
 Orzo with fresh tomato (see recipe)
 Pesto sauce (see recipe).
1. Arrange the skate wings in a skillet large enough to hold all the fish in one layer. Cover with water and add the vinegar, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, salt and peppercorns. Bring to a gentle rolling boil and turn off the heat. Let sit for four to five minutes.
2. Drain the fish and transfer them to warm serving plates on top of the orzo. Drizzle some pesto sauce over all and serve immediately.
Yield: Four servings.
 
PESTO SAUCE
 
2 cups fresh basil
 1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons pine nuts
3 medium-sized garlic cloves, peeled
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 1/2 cup grated Parmesan.
Remove all tough stems from the basil. Place the basil in the container of a food processor or blender. Add the oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt and pepper. Blend to a fine texture. Add the Parmesan and blend quickly. If you make it in advance, serve at room temperature.
Yield: About one cup.

2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saucepan. Cook the onions until they are wilted. Add the tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and the pepper flakes. Stir gently and bring the pan juices to a boil.
3. Add the orzo and stir gently to blend.
Yield: Four servings.
 
VEAL SHANKS WITH ORIENTAL VEGETABLES
 
1 veal shank, about 3 pounds
4 cloves garlic, cut lengthwise into 3 strips
 Freshly ground pepper to taste
4 cups fresh or canned chicken broth

HEADLINE: A KILLING IN MAINE

BYLINE: By James Howard Kunstler; James Howard Kunstler is a novelist who writes about environmental issues.

 BODY:
LAST YEAR, OUTSIDE Bangor, Me., on a November afternoon that could not have been more beautiful, Karen Ann Wood was shot in her own backyard by Donald Rogerson, a deer hunter. The 37-year-old mother of twin baby girls died minutes later. The incident aroused a furor in a state where the traditions of the great outdoors are more and more at odds with the realities of suburban sprawl. It grew even more bitter when a Bangor grand jury refused to indict the hunter, a homegrown son of Maine, on manslaughter charges, fueling an ''us-versus-them'' quarrel between natives and newer arrivals from ''away,'' as the rest of the world is called. Karen Ann Wood was from away. Wood and her husband, Kevin, had come to the Bangor area with their infant twin girls in July 1988 from Davenport, Iowa, where he had been in graduate school. The Woods had both grown up in the small, upstate city of Binghamton, N.Y., met in high school and married a few years later. They had postponed having children until Kevin Wood was settled in his profession as a child psychologist. The move to Maine also represented the fulfillment of a long-postponed desire: to resettle in the East. 
A month after they arrived in Maine, the Woods moved into a new house, a slate-blue Cape Cod home, the last dwelling near the dead end of a one-street subdivision called Treadwell Acres in the town of Hermon, a few miles west of the Bangor city line. What had been forest and puckerbrush only 10 years before - prime deer-hunting territory - had lately burgeoned into a mixed suburb of industrial parks and new homes. The new house, the new children - a new life in Maine was the Woods' reward for the years of struggle in Iowa.
DON ROGERSON, 45, IS THE PRODUCE manager of a neighborhood supermarket in Bangor, a Boy Scout leader and a lifelong hunter. Neither he nor his hunting companion that day, Peter Anderson, a Bangor lawyer, would comment for this article, but in the days after the shooting Rogerson gave an account of the incident to local reporters.
At about 2:45 that Tuesday afternoon, the two hunters parked Rogerson's pickup in a dusty turnaround at the dead end of Treadwell Acres Drive, 200 yards or so past the Woods' house. There is no way they could have failed to notice that they were close to a residential neighborhood when they entered their hunting ground. The weather was perfectly clear, the temperature about 50 degrees.
One of the Woods' neighbors across the street, Cheryl Hamlin, 40, had gone out shopping in the morning and returned home at noon, well before Rogerson and Anderson arrived on the scene. She recalled hearing no gunshots that afternoon until the two that killed Karen Wood.
Treadwell Acres is about five miles from Bangor International Airport. Jet airliners often fly directly over the development at very low altitude, under 1,500 feet. If airplanes were flying low overhead - as they very often did - when Karen Wood stepped out of her house, then she might not have heard the hunters. And they might not have heard her. The absence of other gunshots and the constant airplane noise suggests that she went out there because she saw the hunters near her property. On her way out, she grabbed her dark blue coat and white mittens.
Despite the veil of official secrecy drawn over the case, a few crucial facts slipped out in the days directly after the shooting, when Kevin Wood's backyard was full of wardens searching for bullet fragments, footprints and other clues. Wood fell into casual conversation with the searchers, so it is possible to reconstruct the critical moments when the bullets were fired.
Behind the Wood house is a thin scrim of saplings. Behind these are two connected clearings, just beyond the Woods' property line, 135 feet from the house. Between the two clearings stood two saplings. One was cut down after the incident and taken into the lab because it contained one of Don Rogerson's two discharged bullets. On the basis of it, and of fragments from the second bullet, the investigators placed Karen Wood 130 feet from the house when she was struck down, five feet inside her own property line.
What prompted her to go out there? She'd left her year-old twins inside the house, which suggests that she had meant to stay outside a very short time. Possibly, she went outside to warn hunters that they were too close to her house. But how did she know they were back there? Most likely, she saw the hunters or had seen their truck.
The wardens placed Don Rogerson 189 feet from Karen Wood when he shot her. Thus, Rogerson was 319 feet from the Woods' house. Under Maine law, a hunter can discharge a firearm no closer to a house than 300 feet.
The sun, at that hour (3:30 P.M.) of the cloudless day at that time of year (Nov. 15), would have been behind him, slightly to his left, and low on the horizon (it was an hour until sunset). The trees had shed their leaves by this date, and in that low, clear light, the Woods' next-door-neighbor's house, which was white, must have blazed like a torch.
Rogerson's rifle was a .30-06 mounted with a 4X power Weaver scope. Rogerson told The Bangor Daily News that he had had a deer in his scope when he fired two shots in succession. Since he did not have a doe permit, Rogerson was obliged to correctly identify his target not only as a deer, but as a deer with antlers: a buck. One of the wardens told Kevin Wood that there was not one bit of evidence indicating that a deer had been in the area around the house, let alone in the line of fire. No deer body, no blood, no hair, no droppings and no tracks.
Rogerson told The Bangor Daily News, ''I can honestly say that I do not now recollect anything after the first shot, after I fired at the deer, at the same instant the two white flags appeared.''
These would be Karen Wood's white mittens. Does this mean he fired his second shot at the white flags? The white-tailed deer is called that because the underside of its tail is white. Would he have fired at a deer's rump? This is considered bad hunting practice, because it does not insure a clean, quick kill and it also rips the best meat to shreds. After the second shot, Rogerson hurried across the clearing where he discovered Karen Wood crumpled on the ground.
He said he then lost his motor functions and soiled his pants. He bent down to Karen Wood. At first, he was relieved to see only a little spot of blood on her shoulder. But then he discovered the wound in her upper right chest. Karen Wood was still breathing, but with difficulty. Rogerson put some kind of ''compress'' on her wound and screamed for an ambulance, no doubt in a state of panic. He picked her up, then put her down a few steps later. Meanwhile, his hunting partner, Peter Anderson, ran to Cheryl Hamlin's house for help.
Around 3:30 P.M., Cheryl Hamlin had heard the two shots followed by shouts for help. Thinking that a hunter had been hurt, she had called the Penobscot County sheriff's office in Bangor. Shortly afterward, Anderson came to her door. Then another hunter who had also been in the area emerged from the woods and said that ''a young girl'' had been shot and that it was ''very bad.'' Hamlin called the sheriff's department a second time. The sheriff's cars and the ambulance arrived about 12 minutes later.
At the time, Kevin Wood, 36, was at the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, the new man on the pediatric psychology staff. That day, in addition to his regular duties, he was on call for the emergency room. He had just interviewed a suicidal teen-age girl when the Bangor police called with a garbled, bewildering message: ''Dr. Wood, your son has been in a hunting accident.''
The police were vague about details, and while Wood insisted he did not have a son, they persuaded him to go home at once anyway, offering a police escort, which he declined. The drive took Wood 20 minutes.
''The whole way out,'' he told me, ''I was thinking, Did someone shoot my dog? Did a shot go through the babies' upstairs bedroom and splinter glass and hurt them or something?''
Wood painfully recalled the day. As he approached Treadwell Acres Drive, a news report came over the car radio saying that a hunter had been shot and killed in Hermon. How terrible! he remembered thinking. There were so many vehicles on the street - sheriff's cars, television vans, an ambulance - Wood had to park in front of a neighbor's house.
''It was a big circus,'' he said. ''I was halfway up my driveway and two big officers asked me who I was. They walked me into the garage and told me that Karen had been killed. My first reaction - I'll never forget it - was that this was some kind of cruel joke. Then, as I walked into the house, the reality of what I was seeing hit me. It was the worst nightmare you can imagine.''
The hunter, Rogerson, remained at the scene. Distraught, he admitted pulling the trigger. He was taken in handcuffs to the Penobscot County jail in downtown Bangor and booked on a manslaughter charge. There he remained until the following morning, when he was released on $20,000 bail. Karen Wood's body was not removed from the scene until 8:30 P.M., long after darkness fell.
In the days following the incident, much was made of Rogerson's good character in the local newspapers and on television news shows. He was a solid citizen, ''a most wonderful kind of person,'' a neighbor was quoted as saying. He had been named employee of the year at the Doug's Shop 'n' Save supermarket where he was produce manager. As a scoutmaster, he had led boys up Mount Katahdin. What's more, he voiced remorse for his deed. In an editorial, The Bangor Daily News labeled the death of Karen Wood and the arrest of Donald Rogerson ''a double tragedy.'' Few details about Karen Wood emerged, aside from the fact that she was the mother of year-old twins, and that the family was from out of state, and that when she was shot, she had been wearing white mittens, which might have made it easy to mistake her for a white-tailed deer.
ON DEC. 5, THE CASE WAS PRESENTED to a grand jury, which did not indict Rogerson. An out-of-court settlement of Kevin Wood's wrongful-death civil action, amounting to $122,000, was quickly reached. Rogerson's homeowner's insurance company paid his policy limit of $100,000 plus $2,000 in medical benefits. Rogerson himself paid $20,000 out of pocket, even though court records show that his savings account contained only $200, and he owned little besides two 20-year-old snowmobiles and an even more ancient 15-foot power boat. Had a lawsuit gone to trial, Rogerson would have had the option of declaring bankruptcy, Kevin Wood's lawyer told his client, and the whole thing might easily take years to resolve, so Wood was advised to settle quickly.
By an unfortunate coincidence, Kevin Wood had decided to try to return to work on Dec. 5, the same day the grand jury refused to indict Rogerson. The news was ''the final straw for Kevin,'' according to his friend Dr. Tim Rogers, who was also Wood's boss at the Eastern Maine Medical Center. Before the end of the month, Kevin Wood put his house in Hermon on the market, packed up and temporarily moved to Binghamton, his hometown, where he had buried Karen.
The death of Karen Wood proved to have a strange persistence in the public imagination. For one thing, it had stirred up a lot of debate about hunting, in particular the question of the sport's place in a region where a lot of new homes were being built on traditional hunting grounds. Hunting in Maine is fondly described by outdoor enthusiasts as ''a tradition older than voting.'' In 1988, 227,751 licenses were issued in a state whose population is a shade over one million. The income from hunting generates more than $150 million a year for the Maine economy.
''The bullet that killed Karen Wood killed any rational debate about hunting safety,'' said one Bangor newspaperman who asked not to be identified. ''The thing that shocked me was this spontaneous effort to air every justification, every mitigation of the tragedy, and every reason why the victim might be to blame.''
The Bangor Daily News's outdoors columnist, Tom Hennessey, wrote that if Karen Wood ''had been wearing one piece of blaze-orange clothing, she'd be alive today.'' Hennessey still defends his position. ''If she'd been killed out in her backyard by a limb falling out of a tree, people would have said, 'Isn't that a terrible thing!' '' he told me, ''But there would have been nowhere near the response because of it being hunting-related.''
''I don't think he was callous and uncaring,'' said V. Paul Reynolds, the paper's managing editor, referring to Hennessey. ''I think he was trying to point out that the woman - even though she might have been on the edge of her woods - put herself at risk by going into the woods dressed the way she was dressed.''
Many letters to the editor echoed Hennessey's theme, along with assertions that out-of-staters ought to learn a thing or two about Maine's traditional way of life, which one correspondent said includes ''not going into the woods in November.'' These, in turn, prompted an uproar among citizens disgusted with the hunting fraternity.
''I'm stunned that there could be so much public equivocation about what happened that afternoon, and I'm especially disturbed by oblique references to Mrs. Wood's 'out-of-stater' roots,'' wrote one unhappy Bangorite. ''As a native old-family Mainer, I am ashamed,'' wrote another.
Months after the shooting, feelings on both sides still ran high.
''One guy goes out and makes a very bad mistake, he shoots a woman who waves white gloves. She made a mistake! He never should have shot at her, and she never should have had on white gloves to wave. And the whole ruckus starts!'' said Gene Letourneau of Waterville, who writes a column seven days a week for Maine's Guy Gannett newspaper chain, which includes The Portland Press Herald and The Kennebec Journal.
Some feel the incident sullies Maine's record of hunter safety, which has been improving. ''Had this death not occurred, there would have been no hunting fatalities in Maine this past season,'' asserted Jon A. Lund, publisher of The Maine Sportsman magazine and a former state Attorney General.
''You're safer in the woods during hunting season than you are on the streets of Portland,'' declared Harry Vanderweide, editor of The Maine Sportsman magazine, on ''MaineWatch,'' a public television show aired less than a week before Karen Wood was shot in her backyard.
THE CITY OF BANGOR (pop. 32,000), once the timber capital of the world, now the financial center for eastern and northern Maine, is still the gateway to the big woods. Its roller-coaster main street drops steeply into a downtown of neatly rehabilitated commercial blocks. On a hilly street above the center of town is Doug's Shop 'n' Save, where, one evening after Karen Wood's shooting, produce manager Don Rogerson was greeting a crowd of sympathetic well-wishers just as Kevin Wood's friend and colleague Tim Rogers came into the store to pick up a few groceries.
''There was a line of people standing there, all patting (Continued on Page 119) him on the back, telling him it was O.K., that it wasn't his fault,'' Rogers recalled. ''I waited on line and shook his hand and said I was a friend of Kevin's, and that I held him totally responsible, and said the thing he should do is admit publicly that it was his fault. He said, no, I couldn't understand it because I wasn't there.''
From the very first, Rogerson had admitted that a bullet from his rifle killed Karen Wood. He said he was deeply sorry, many times. But he maintained all along that it was pure accident, that the moment he squeezed the trigger, he held a deer in his sights.
Under Maine law, manslaughter is defined as the reckless or criminally negligent killing of another human being. It can be the result of either disregarding a known risk, or failing to be aware of a risk.
''Criminal negligence exists whenever the hunter is not absolutely certain what he's shooting at,'' said Jeffrey L. Hjelm, 33, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the case. ''People are not charged with these crimes because they're bad people, but because they make errors in judgment.''
''Unless you know you're shooting at a deer, then as far as I'm concerned that presents us with a case that we're going to take to the grand jury,'' said Fernand LaRochelle, Deputy Attorney General in charge of the criminal division.
To date, however, all the facts about the Karen Wood case, as established by the state authorities, have remained officially secret. Under Maine's statutes, not only are the grand-jury proceedings sealed, so is every shred of evidence collected in the case. Not even Kevin Wood has ever been officially informed as to the details of his wife's killing. And legally, the files may remain sealed forever. So secret is the grand jury process, that it can only be assumed that the case was even presented to them.
''I can tell you that the case was dismissed on the day that the grand jury sat,'' said prosecutor Hjelm. ''I can tell you that of the cases the grand jury considered that day, there was one case in which they elected not to return an indictment. And I can also tell you that when Mr. Rogerson was first charged in the district court, I expressed publicly my intention to present the case to the next grand jury. But I cannot go the extra step, because of the rule of secrecy, and tell you that I did in fact present it.''
Many people were shocked when Donald Rogerson was not indicted for shooting Karen Wood, not because he was a bad man, but because there was probable cause to believe that he had made a reckless error in judgment.
''I've been around here since '72, and I've never known of a hunter death when there hasn't been an indictment,'' said Wood's attorney, Frederick J. Badger Jr. ''Somewhere, the process broke down in the grand jury.''
Of three hunting deaths dating from the previous season, 1987-1988, in which human beings were mistaken for animals, two of them resulted in convictions and jail terms.
The detail about the white mittens - ''which at a distance could have looked like the white tail of a deer'' - was prominently played up in the very first news account of the shooting. The fact that the wardens found no evidence of deer at the scene was scarcely mentioned in the press.
According to the state prosecutor Jeffrey Hjelm, the case is still open. The statute of limitations extends six years from the date of the incident.
AFTER SPENDING the winter in his hometown of Binghamton, N.Y., Kevin Wood resettled in Iowa, where his wife had received her bachelors' degree in business administration and given birth to the daughters who will always wonder who she was and what happened to her in the faraway state of Maine.
''I've settled out of court,'' Wood told me. ''The investigation is essentially in limbo. They want this thing to go away. At the very least, I want access to the evidence, so I can make it known that my wife was not the least bit responsible for her own death.''
Back in Hermon, a town councilwoman named Peggy Elmer proposed that the community devise some sort of memorial to Karen Wood, perhaps a contribution to the education fund then being set up for the twin girls, Laura and Lindsey. The town council brought up her proposal on a night when Mrs. Elmer was not present, and instead of tabling it for discussion at a time when she could be there, they voted it down.
As the year turned, and another hunting season approached, the office of the Maine Attorney General said that it would seek to suspend the hunting license of Donald Rogerson. The Hermon town council voted to spend $500 on fluorescent orange plastic disks for homeowners to nail on trees around their property so that hunters will know that they are in a place where human beings live.

HEADLINE: ART: SEASON PREVIEW;
Demanding exhibitions that capture decisive moments in modern art

BYLINE: By Michael Brenson

 BODY:
THIS SEASON IS distinguished by a kind of museum show that is very welcome at a time when more and more members of the art community know how to generalize and theorize about painting and fewer and fewer know how to look at it.
If you are not willing to enter the worlds of ''Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism'' (opening Sept. 24 at the Museum of Modern Art), ''Monet in the 90's: The Series Paintings''(Feb. 7 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) and ''Matisse in Morocco'' (March 18 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington), you will miss artistic feasts that do not come along every year. These shows engage artists for whom painting was the highest calling and pleasure. They present decisive moments not only in their careers but also in the history of modern art.
''Picasso and Braque'' will be the most demanding and polemical. It is the first attempt to establish, point by point, the artistic exchange that gave birth to Cubism. How great will Cubism, which has been so crucial to MOMA's esthetic, seem now? Will new generations of art viewers, raised on alternatives to the Western pictorial tradition, even be able to see what is going on in a Cubist painting? 
The Monet exhibition will bring together for the first time almost 100 paintings of cliffs, cathedrals and the Creuse Valley. By considering the pictorial developments within the works, as well as to whom Monet was responding and why he seemed so obsessed with the idea of the series in the 1890's, the exhibition will clarify the ambition and nationalism of this quintessentially French painter.
The Matisse exhibition is focused after Matisse's Fauve period and before his years of hard analysis and experimentation. In the air and light of Morocco, which had left such a mark on Delacroix, one of his heroes, Matisse found a harmony and ease that he would henceforth be able to integrate with his Cartesian rigor. Even here, in paintings with the floating softness of dream, there is more to the jolting radiance of this great artist than meets the eye.

HEADLINE: Fine-Tuning 'The Piano Lesson'

 BODY:
AUGUST WILSON AND LLOYD RICH-ards have been collaborating as playwright and director since 1982, when Mr. Wilson's ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' was given a staged reading at the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. Mr. Richards, who is artistic director of the O'Neill conference as well as dean of the Yale School of Drama, subsequently staged the play at the Yale Repertory Theater and on Broadway. Mr. Wilson's next two plays, ''Fences'' (1987) and ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' (1988) followed even longer tryout routes, which included stops at several regional theaters. Each of Mr. Wilson's three plays won a New York Drama Critics Circle Award; ''Fences'' also won Tony Awards for best play and best director and the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for drama.
Mr. Wilson's latest play, ''The Piano Lesson,'' is now making its way to New York via a similar regional route. As is the case with his earlier plays, ''The Piano Lesson'' deals with a specific decade of black American life. Focusing on the 1930's, it is a story about the Charles family, Southern blacks who have moved to the urban North. At the heart of the play is a 135-year-old, richly carved piano that represents something different to both of its owners: Berniece, who wants to keep the piano as a symbol of her heritage, and her brother, Boy Willie, who wants to sell it to buy a farm in the South. 
''The Piano Lesson'' has already been presented in Boston, Chicago and San Diego and is scheduled to play at the Kennedy Center in Washington as well as in Los Angeles before it arrives in New York this spring. Shortly after its San Diego run, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Richards met with Mel Gussow, a New York Times theater critic, to discuss the creative process that will bring ''The Piano Lesson'' to Broadway. Mr. Wilson began by talking about the first version of the play at the O'Neill Center.
 
WILSON. At the pre-conference, a playwright reads the play aloud to the other playwrights. There are always parts that you don't want to read - and those are generally where the problems are. Other parts you're anxious to read, because you feel that they're good. I was assigned a director -Steve Robman. At that point in the writing of the script, the play opened with the brother already in his sister's house. Steve suggested that I show him coming in - to get more action into the play. I did a complete rewrite.
 
Q. From that you move into a staged reading?
 
WILSON. You see how it plays in front of an audience. I make notes, and I get critiques from other participants in the conference. I study them very carefully and then do another draft. It was at the O'Neill that I actually learned to rewrite a play, and that's the part of the process that I enjoy -the rewriting and problem solving, what Borges calls the problematic practice of literature.
 
Q. You don't realize the problems until you see the play on its feet?
 
WILSON. Then, and later, when you've sat with an audience for 30 performances and you suddenly begin to see something that should have been very obvious from the beginning. At one point, people did not believe that Boy Willie was responsible enough to go back to the South and buy land. Some of the work was to make him a more responsible character - and we've continued to work on the ending. But the same things still happen at the end of the play that happened in the first draft, more or less.
 
Q. Was the through-line of the play clear to you from the beginning?
 
RICHARDS. Most plays define themselves as they go along. The difference in this play is that we started at an earlier stage. When ''Fences'' came to the O'Neill, it was four-and-a-half hours' worth of material, from which you begin to pull out the threads of the fabric. With ''The Piano Lesson'' we really started with a first draft, and the work has been to flesh it out and make sure that every idea that is expressed is a part of the fabric. Berniece's justification for having the piano had to be fleshed out, so that you have two very strong and valid reasons for that piano going one way or the other.
 
Q. There are a number of set pieces in the play - monologues, dreams. Were they in the first draft?
 
WILSON. Yes. Some of them were cut down and a couple were taken out. I have a tendency to write long.
 
Q. I hope none of the good ones were taken out.
 
WILSON. One of my favorite ones was.
 
Q. Did he [Mr. Richards] do it?
 
WILSON. No, no, Lloyd has this way of suggesting things. He said, ''I think you have one too many stories there. See what you can do with that.'' I came back the next day and Lloyd said, ''Did you make any changes?'' I said no, I couldn't find anything to cut. He said, ''I think you need to look at that again.'' I saw I had one monologue, or story, after the other, and I picked the one that I thought that I could live without - and cut it. And then there were times when I would cut something and Lloyd would say, ''You don't mind losing that?'' I'd say no. He'd say, ''Well, I do.'' And we'd go back and cut something else.
 
Q. Do the two of you ever argue?
 
WILSON. No, we never have an argument. I don't even recall a disagreement.
 
Q. Not even about casting or some scenic effect?
 
RICHARDS. August might say, that wall looks too yellow. That's the only thing I can remember him saying.
 
Q. Was the wall too yellow?
 
RICHARDS. It wasn't because of the wall. It was because of the light from the gel. The lighting was not right yet and he was steamed. August was not familiar with the visual aspect of it. He has become a much more knowledgeable technical theater person about sets, costumes, lights and so on.
 
WILSON. I remember the first audition for ''Ma Rainey.'' I was ready to hire anybody who could read. Lloyd said, ''No, I don't think he's right.'' I learned how to pick a good actor, to discern what's there beyond the way they read.
 
Q. As director, you [Mr. Richards] encourage the actors to create more of a life for their characters than they see in the script.
 
RICHARDS. I try to permit the actor to arrive where I want him to arrive, without telling him where I want him to be. You feed them the right things, and keep stimulating them to the point where they make choices. I would rather an actor discover it for himself than me tell him - it's his then.
 
WILSON. When I would want a particular actor to do a certain thing, I would tell Lloyd, and two weeks later the guy would say, ''Lloyd, would it be O.K. if I do this?''
 
Q. Charles Dutton joined the cast after the first production, didn't he? [Mr. Dutton played in ''Ma Rainey'' on Broadway and ''Joe Turner'' at the O'Neill and the Yale Repertory.]
 
RICHARDS. Charles came into the play as Boy Willie in Boston, with one week's rehearsal. Then we moved to Chicago. It wasn't until San Diego that I got a chance to have a full rehearsal with him. We've had a chance to dig into things that he had only been addressing. The last scene is a tough, tough scene, and in San Diego we tended to get the keys to that.
 
Q. At the end of the play, we hear a violent struggle upstairs, but we don't know whether or not Boy Willie is wrestling with a ghost.
 
WILSON. There are ghosts whether we can hear them or see them. What was important to me was Boy Willie's willingness to do battle. He's not running out the door, he's not relying on Jesus, he's not relying on anything outside of himself.
 
Q. What does the piano represent?
 
WILSON. The legacy. The sister has a self-imposed taboo about playing the piano. The brother is willing to embrace it, and at the same time he's also willing to sell it in order to provide himself with a future. It's also important that he's building on what his father left him. Which is what Americans do, except for blacks who very seldom have anything to pass along to their kids. The only thing his father had to give them was the piano, and he died over giving them that. Boy Willie takes this legacy, and wants to use it to provide for himself a better life, even if that means selling the piano in order to get some land. He feels his father would have done that if he had the opportunity.
 
Q. One of the images you had for the play was a Romare Bearden painting of a piano.
 
WILSON. A Bearden painting called ''The Piano Lesson.'' It's of a little girl at the piano with her piano teacher standing over her. And in my mind I saw Maretha [Berniece's daughter] and Berniece.
 
Q. Following ''Joe Turner,'' this is the second play that a Bearden painting has inspired. Are there more to come?
 
WILSON. That's very interesting; I need to look at some more Bearden. I think he's a tremendous artist.
 
Q. Do you generally start with an image like that or with an idea?
 
WILSON. Well, usually it's an idea. With ''The Piano Lesson'' I started with the idea, can one acquire a sense of self-worth by denying one's past, which is what I felt that Berniece was trying to do. I wanted the past to come in the person of her brother, and I wanted him to come to the house like a tornado and force her to confront the thing she was trying to deny. Then it became, what do you do with your legacy and how best do you put it to use?
 
Q. Do you respond to criticism?
 
WILSON. Not only published criticism. I respond to people walking out of the theater, to my brother, my daughter. I listen to all of that. And critics, of course, have an informed point of view. I don't necessarily change the script because a review said this or that. But I take it all very seriously, and I examine why the person said the thing, and then I go back through and try to see how they arrived at that particular statement and then make a decision based on what I feel is necessary.
 
RICHARDS: It's very important for a playwright and a director to learn what to listen to and what not to listen to. I'm interested in the point that the theatergoer loses interest or becomes confused. I sit in the theater with an audience and live through it with them. Attention brings people forward. When they begin to sit back, then you're on your way to losing them.
 
Q. Do you travel with the play?
 
WILSON. I wouldn't miss it. I enjoy watching the show with the audience - I enjoy the audience. Generally, I go to every show for the entire three weeks.
 
RICHARDS. August is there from the very beginning to the very end. He's even there after I've gone.
 
Q. The tryout process is not the same as it was when you brought Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun'' to Broadway.
 
RICHARDS. There's an important difference. My concept of the American national theater is all of these companies in all of these regions. Artists circulating among them form in their composite the American national theater. But it does have regional aspects, and my hope is that the unique in each region can be transferred to other regions.
I want the nation to experience August's work. At the same time, it gives us an opportunity to continue to work on a play. It used to be when you went to Philadelphia with a show, you lived or you died. That's why you were only booked for a week - you were hoping to be able to sell a week's worth of tickets. Here we go into a theater for three or four weeks. It's a subscription audience, so you can focus on the work without the economic pressures.
 
Q. Where does the play go now?
 
RICHARDS. We have plans to open it at the Kennedy Center and Los Angeles. We're running out of cities! By the time it gets to New York, it will be nationally known.
 
Q. Is there a possibility that the rest of America will see these plays, but not New York?
 
RICHARDS. I think of New York as a major region in America, and I would not want to even consider denying that region the work.
 
Q. But we will have to wait until spring.
 
RICHARDS. You can come out to see it in one of its other guises. It'll be a little different from the play that comes into New York. We haven't finished yet.

HEADLINE: VIEWS OF SPORT;
Football's Muzzled Masses Unleash a Call of the Wild

BYLINE: By W. C. HEINZ; W. C. Heinz was the sports columnist of The New York Sun and since then has been the author of numerous magazine articles and six books.

 BODY:
Last March, in all their might assembled in Palm Desert, Calif., the National Football League owners made a momentous decision. They voted to impose penalties against home teams for crowd noise that continually disrupts the offenses of their opponents, and if they thought they heard noise, the indications are that they ain't heard nothin' yet. After all, you can't smoke in elevators, spit on the sidewalk or shoot off a machine gun in church. Now this.
The vote was 21-7, and proponents of the rule, which allows referees to deduct timeouts from the team whose fans are doing the dinning, and impose yardage penalties if that doesn't impress them, said it was necessary because the crowds were becoming bigger factors than the players. That came as no surprise to anyone who has been watching these past few seasons as the gladiators stood around while the hometown hooters exercised their freedom of expression, their lungs and their vocal chords, the referee having suspended play because the opposing quarterback couldn't hear himself.
Those red-blooded Americans aren't going to take this sitting down, something they seldom do anyway during the height of their hysteria. Already in preseason we have heard their clamors and seen their banners, an army of freedom fighters in training for the season that starts today and - who knows? - may end with William Kunstler quarterbacking them up the courthouse steps. 
To cast light on how this has come about, a little history is called for. Once within living memory the game was played by 22 men -currently the number of some college coaching staffs - and attended by audiences of admirers who came to cheer, providing a sort of operatic chorus to the drama at hand.
Now it is played by an ever-changing cast of characters who commute in and out -sometimes to their own confusion - and attended by crowds who come not to cheer but to jeer and, as noted, hold up the proceedings until the question is not who will win but will they let the game continue before the team trainers and water boys are asked to bring out the mail from home.
A college football game was televised for the first time on Sept. 30, 1939, when Fordham beat Waynesburg, 34-7. Next we settle in on Dec. 22, 1952, when from Balboa Stadium in San Diego NBC prepared to telecast coast to coast something called the Poinsettia Bowl. It pitted the San Diego Naval Training Station against Bolling Field, for the championship of the armed services.
According to Lindsey Nelson, the retired sportscaster, on the morning of the game the rain was hitting the skylight of the hotel coffee shop with such intensity that it was impossible to tell the waitress how you wanted your eggs done. ''As kickoff time approached,'' Nelson wrote of the Poinsettia Affair in his 1985 autobiography, ''we became aware of another interesting development. There were no spectators. I do not mean that it was a small crowd. I mean there did not appear to be one single paid admission. We were about to televise from coast to coast on NBC a football game to which nobody had come.''
Tom Gallery, the director of NBC sports, convened a quick conference of Navy brass. He explained that you could no more televise a game without an audience than you could christen a battleship in secrecy.
''Gentlemen,'' he said, ''we have to have a crowd of some sort.''
Those were the words, the dictum from which all that would follow would derive. Within the hour the Shore Patrol, having made clean sweepdowns fore and aft in every movie house and ale house, paraded in some 200 soggy, sullen and shanghaied sailors -Hayden Fry, now the coach of Iowa, among them. When Bill Bennington, the director, punched in the crowd shot of them sitting in a sodden and unsmiling square, wondering what they were doing there under Niagara Falls, it was established, apparently forevermore, that the crowd shot is an indispensable part of the televised game.
Since then, successive creative directors have embellished and embroidererd the basic principle that you can't enjoy anything, whether it be a football game, a painting or a sunset, without company, the more and more raucous the merrier. To the obligatory long shot of partisans cheering a gain or a score -and what else would they be doing? - was added the close-up. The sideline camera, initially installed to capture play at ground level, was swung up toward the stands, inviting every closet clown in the area out into the open, his face and torso often painted in team colors, raising the question at college games of the benefits of higher education and, at pro games, of the wisdom of universal suffrage.
It was in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium on Jan. 11, 1987, when, by my calculations, the Poinsettia Principle, as formulated in San Diego more than three decades before, finally came to full flower. While the Denver Broncos defeated the Cleveland Browns in overtime, 23-20, there were, by official count, 143 plays on the field and, by my count, 69 crowd shots on NBC. This not only entitled the Broncos to meet the New York Giants in the Super Bowl - a dubious honor as it turned out - but crowds anywhere to assume that, if they were that indispensable to the game on the tube, they might now be similarly important to the play on the field.
This was a concept that had not escaped the keen and inventive minds of a number of coaches who had already begun to include it in their game plans. Some weeks before, Don James, the foresighted head man at the University of Washington, had implored Huskie fans to come to the home game with Arizona State and scream their brains, or whatever, out. A record gathering of 73,883 packed the place, and set up such a clamor whenever Arizona State had the ball that, not only were the visitors unable to hear their snap count, but a member of the gendarmerie became concerned that the sportsmanship might get out of hand. He requested of Mike Lude, the Washington athletic director, that Lude make an announcement asking for calm. ''I told him,'' Lude said, ''to go to hell.'' More recently - last Dec. 31, in fact - the NBC commentators at the Cincinnati-Seattle contest reported that Sam Wyche, the Bengals' resident conductor, had been leading the home crowd in the manner, I judged, of Arturo Toscanini. You'll recall that the Maestro regularly not only conducted the New York Philharmonic but also the NBC Symphony, so that was keeping the old baton in the house.
''Crowds,'' Merlin Olsen, the network's leading musicologist, informed us in seeming admiration that day, ''have become so much more sophisticated in knowing when they can make so much noise that the other team can't hear.''
So the games, repeatedly interrupted by the a capella concerts, dragged on - on Sundays on the East Coast into TV prime time, and on Monday nights into Tuesdays. And the viewers began to drop off or doze off. This left the owners faced with an economic reality. Few things stir these sportsmen like an economic reality, so when they realized that for every TV rating dip there would be a comparable dollar drop, their decree to muffle the huddled masses yearning to be free was as inevitable as it may be vulnerable.
It seems to this observer that, while you can't get away with hollering ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater, there's a constitutional question here that the American Civil Liberties Union will pounce upon as on a fumble on the 5-yard line. The right peaceably to assemble and of freedom of speech are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution. Should the National Collegiate Athletic Association follow in step, I can hear now the cheers change from ''U.C.L.A.! U.C.L.A.!'' to ''A.C.L.U.! A.C.L.U.!'' and foresee the first N.F.L. draft pick coming, not as this year out of that eminent California institution, but out of Harvard Law.

HEADLINE: Talking Condo Funds;
Managing Capital Reserves

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
THE roof shingles will deteriorate, the driveway will need a new surface and even the corridor carpeting will wear thin. But unlike a co-op corporation, which can easily borrow funds for capital outlays to repair such conditions, the condominium is not so fortunate; banks are still wary since the condominium association has no collateral to pledge. And a special assessment creates too much individual hardship and internal strife.
''Raising the possibility of a special assessment is the best way I know to get lynched,'' said Bob Kirkland, president of Professional Property Managers Inc. of Virginia Beach, Va., which manages 72 associations. 
No wonder more and more condo associations are beginning to place greater emphasis on establishing and financing a well- thought-out capital reserves program.
A recent survey by the Commmunity Associations Institute of Alexandria, Va., a national network of condominium officers and their advisers, showed that in 1989 the need to build up reserves was the major cause of an increase in monthly common charges. The use of the special assessment fell from 25 to 16 percent of the 230 associations surveyed in a nationwide random sampling.
A planned program of capital reserves is essential today for other reasons, too, said Douglas Kleine, director of research for the institute. The secondary mortgage market - investor pools that buy individual mortgages - now insists on assurances that such a program is in place. This means a local mortgage officer will require the same verification before approving a loan on an individual unit.
Further, California, Florida and other states have passed laws requiring an association to provide unit owners with details of its capital reserve program on an annual basis. More states may follow. And the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is creating new guidelines that will require the inclusion of a capital reserve program in any audit of an association.
The basic tool to set up a program that will be acceptable to lenders and regulators is the reserve study - a blueprint for action that takes into account engineering factors, like the anticipated life of a roof or heating system, plus financial projections that compensate for inflation and the fluctuating rate of return on invested reserves.
A handful of companies, among them Association Reserves of Calabasas, Calif., and Erickson Associates of Orlando, Fla., and San Diego, are beginning to specialize in this burgeoning field, combining engineering and actuarial expertise to arrive at an accurate figure for the amount of money needed and a timetable for expenditures. If such a company takes over the job, expect to pay around $600 for under 40 units and up to $10,000 for 500 units or more, said Robert M. Norlund, president of Association Reserves.
Most condominiums, however, will begin by simply getting an engineer's report. Mr. Kirkland recommends using only a licensed professional engineer, since specialized knowledge will be needed. Ideally, he said, the person will also have had experience compiling reports for buildings or developments that were being converted from rental status, since the work closely parallels the kind needed for a reserve study.
Condo officers should not rely solely on the cost estimates for replacement provided by such a study, say managers. It is wiser, they say, to get a more precise figure by putting the items out for local bids.
''Each contractor usually knows his particular job and specialized local conditions much better,'' explained Rhonda Major, senior manager with Bay Area Property Management of Clear Lake City, Tex. By contrast, many engineering companies, she maintained, base their projections on national or regional averages. Thus their figures do not necessarily reflect the views of the local contractors who will be doing the work.
THE rule-of-thumb is to have such a report updated every three years. After this, if the association does not have a management company accustomed to making up the funding and expenditures projections, the officers could use a computer program. The Community Associations Institute favors one written by Craig Gilbert, an accountant in Atlanta. Called ''Community Reserves,'' it costs $195 (call 404-231-0349 or write: Front Row Systems, P.O. Box 550346 Atlanta, Ga. 30355).
Some cautions should be observed when making the projections. For example, Mr. Kirkland said that if a roof would cost $100,000 to replace this year and still has a useful life of 10 years, the association would need to set aside far more than $10,000 a year. Assuming only a 5 percent yearly inflation, the cost 10 years hence would reach $163,889, due to compounding.
Further, it is normally assumed that the interest earned on the money as it accumulates will make up the difference. But if $10,000 were set aside each year at an interest rate of say, 8 percent, only $134,805 would be available at the end of the 10th year, Mr. Kirkland warned.
Ms. Major, like others, also favors an unallocated amount of around 3 percent of the total to cover such variables as a shorter-than-anticipated life of a particular system, or perhaps an upgrade to a product that is technically or esthetically more appealing.
''One time I remember we planned for one coat of paint,'' she said. ''But when the painting came due there was so much flaking and rot we needed two coats.'' Thus, in addition to that unallocated amount, she favors maintaining a contingency fund of around 5 percent of the total.
Making certain ongoing maintenance chores become part of the capital reserve progam also helps. ''A generous amount allocated to the regular budget for maintenance can do a great deal to avoid sudden and unplanned capital expenditures,'' Ms. Major said.
Do not forget to amend that reserve plan to factor in sudden and unanticipated changes in costs, Mr. Kleine added, like new regulations that can add hundreds of dollars to any replacement project.
More detailed planning information is available in ''Reserve Study Guidelines'' a 120-page book costing $32.95, and ''Reserve to Preserve,'' a booklet costing $9.50; both are from Community Associations Institute. Write: 1423 Powhatan Street, Alexandria, Va. 22314, or call (800) 342-5224.
Good investment management of the funds is a further complex topic. C.A.I. has a new newsletter for this purpose, called The Ledger Quarterly. The annual subscription for members is $36, for nonmembers, $48.

VICTORIAN FAIR
The Justin Morgan Bicentennial Victorian Fair and Carriage Rally in Old Lyme on Saturday and next Sunday is also being called Stick It to the Tick Festival. Proceeds from the two-day event will benefit the University of Connecticut's research on Lyme disease.
It starts with a parade at 10 A.M. Saturday from downtown to the pre-Revolutionary War McCulloch Farm on Whipporwill Road. The farm's house was built from plans in Christopher Wren's ''Designs for the Colonies.''
Leading off on the three-mile route will be the Governor's Horse Guard, followed by the UConn equestrian team, a collection of antique automobiles, several high-wheeled bicycles and a group of antique carriages drawn by Morgan horses bred at the farm. Justin Morgan was the name of the original Morgan horse, known for its stamina, versatility and economical appetite. It was also the name of the horse's owner, a choirmaster and tavernkeeper when he was not breeding horses. 
The other events take place on the farm. An auction of collectibles at noon Saturday features a 26-foot used powerboat, a quilt made for the occasion, a three-generation-old handmade bedspread and an original Katzenjammer Kids cartoon. A square dance will be held Saturday night, and a horse-drawn carriage rally begins at 10 A.M. Sunday, followed by hayrides in the afternoon and a chamber music concert titled ''Victorian Women in Song'' to be held in the parlor of the house on Sunday evening.
Throughout the two days, there will be Morgan horse demonstrations, a petting zoo, children's games, puppets, songs by the Sweet Adelines as well as information about Lyme disease. Admission is $10; the chamber music concert costs an additional $5. Call 434-7355 for tickets.
 
LYME IMPRESSIONISM
More than 400 paintings, drawings and watercolors were destroyed when Everett L. Warner's studio burned down after his death in 1963. As a result his work is extremely rare, but a representative collection of his paintings goes on exhibition at the Connecticut Gallery in Marlborough today; it remains through Oct. 22.
Best known as a Lyme Impressionist because of the many exhibitions of his work displayed there, and because of the frequency of his stays at Florence Griswold's boardinghouse for artists, he was a native Midwesterner. Born in Iowa, he lived and studied in New York and Paris, taught at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, served as a camouflage artist for the Navy in World War I and II, and finally settled down in New Hampshire in 1947.
His work was reqarded with most of his generation's prestigeous prizes, including ones from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Washington Water Color Club, the National Academy of Design the Art Institute of Chicago and the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915 in San Francisco.
In the Marlborough show are paintings of New York City wharfs, Connecticut landscapes and depictions of Pittsburgh's industrial day in the 1920's and 30's. A reception will be held from 2 to 5 P.M. today. The gallery is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday and by appointment on Sundays and Mondays by calling 295-9543.
 
LIBERATION OF MARSEILLES
''The Resistance and Liberation of Marseilles, 1941-1945'' is the photographic record kept by a Polish photojournalist during her flight from the Nazis and her years as a resistance fighter in France. The exhibition may be seen from Thursday through Sept. 28 in the Art School Gallery of the University of Hartford. It is being sponsored by the University's Maurice Greenberg Center for Judaic Studies.
The photojournalist, Julie Pirotte, took pictures at underground meetings, among starving children, in camps for German-Jewish mothers who were later killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and with the French Guerillas fighting German soldiers. She is the only surviving member of her family. Her sister, also a member of the Resistance, was killed by the Nazis.
After the war she returned to Poland with her negatives, but most of her prints were missing until the 1970's when they began turning up in museums and in documentary films in Europe and the United States. Ms. Pirotte will give a talk with slides at 8 P.M. on Sept. 21 in the gallery, followed by a public reception. The exhibition is open from 9 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. weekdays and from noon to 4 P.M. Sundays.
 
MUSIC FROM THE '30s
''Wobbly Music,'' composed in the cause of the International Workers of the World (whose members were called wobbles), is to be performed in three concerts by the American Music-Theater Group, the Wesleyan Singers alumni and Marni Nixon, a soprano soloist.
Christian Wolff, a professor of music at Dartmouth, was commissioned by Wesleyan in 1975 to compose a cantata of settings for labor songs of the 1930's and music by the Composers' Collective, a group of young musicians in New York City that included Aaron Copland, Mark Blitzstein, Elie Seigmeister and Earl Robinson. ''Wobbly Music'' has been performed 18 times throughout the Northeast since the mid-70's.
The first of three upcoming performances will take place at 8 P.M. Saturday in the Charter Oak Temple Cultural Center, 21 Charter Oak Avenue, Hartford. It will be repeated at Wesleyan's Crowell Concert Hall in Middletown at 8 P.M. next Sunday, and at 8:30 P.M on Sept. 20 at Merkin Concert Hall in Manhattan.
Ms. Nixon will be featured in the first half of the program in songs by Blitzstein from ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' in Harold Rome's ''Pins and Needles,'' and in labor-related music of the Composer's Collective members.
The Wolff cantata, called ''Wobbly Music,'' will fill the second half of the program with settings from the Workers Collective Songbook, many of them written during the textile strike in Larence, Mas., in 1912. Mr. Wolff has also composed original material based on documents, letters, and the preamble to the constitution of the Internal Workers of the World. The work will be performed by a four-part chorus and various instruments including guitars and piano. Neely Bruce, the chairman of the music department at Wesleyan, has organized the program and will conduct.
Tickets in Hartford are $8, students $4. Details are at 249-1207. At Wesleyan they are $3, students and the elderly $2. Information is available at 347-9411.
 
VENISON AND CIDER
The Renaissance Deer Farm in Woodbury will supply the venison for a cooking workshop by the connecticut Culinary Institute on Tuesday. The workshop, ''Connecticut Venison,'' is part of a series being led by the school's master chefs and cosponsored by the State Department of Agriculture and Connecticut-based companies. The dishes include juniper bery and red wine roast of venison, ragout of fallow deer and venison chili.
Apples and sider supplied by the Old Cider Mill in Glastonbury will be used for appplesauce, chicken with apples and cider cream sauce, and apple and cider cinnamon pie on Wednesday. Both workshops are to be held from 6:30 to 9:30 P.M. and cost $25.
Beth Hillson, author and chef, will conduct the ''Open Hearth Cooking and Wine Tour'' on Saturday with a cooking workshop at the Open Fireplace in Randall's Ordinary, the historic tavern in Stonington, followed by a tour and tasting session at Stonington Vineyard with Nick and Happy Smith, the owners. Details are at 677-7869.

HEADLINE: False Economy: Cutting School Costs

 BODY:
I read with great interest your article on the changing Long Island economy [''L.I. Growth Years Over, Looking Beyond Defense,'' Aug. 13]. All of us who have made our lives and careers here have much at stake. A significant increase in unemployment and the subsequent impact on property values would certainly affect us all. I was concerned, however, about the comments made by Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. 
His first suggestion for improvement is to cut the cost of public education. Once again, the schools are the scapegoat for a much broader problem. For most homeowners, school taxes account for less than half the total real estate tax burden. Real estate taxes themselves are not the major factor in the high cost of living on Long Island. The cost of everyday necessities such as power, transportation, clothing, food and even garbage disposal are much more of a hindrance in making ends meet.
I was also surprised to read that Mr. Koppelman suggests consolidating school districts as a way of saving money. New York City is desperately trying to find a better way to localize control of their school system as a means to salvage a once-great institution.
He then mentions the cost of duplication of effort by town and county governments. Is consolidation what he has in mind here as well? While duplication may be costly, I can't imagine the expense required to establish and run a bureaucratic structure that would govern all of Nassau and Suffolk Counties as one.
We should keep in mind that the fine quality of our schools and the distinct nature and personality of each Long Island town are major reasons Long Island is considered one of the 10 best places to live in the United States. Radical changes in either could do more harm to the Long Island economy than any Pentagon cutbacks.
While it may be difficult for young professionals starting their careers, perhaps an economic slowdown would not be so bad. Because we are an island, we have a limit to our resources and a finite amount of room for expansion. Let's not turn Long Island into a blivit.

HEADLINE: ART;
Looking at an Unkept Promise

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
ALJIRA'S ''Promise of Progress: Present Conditions'' is the third sociopolitical show to be staged by this Newark gallery since it moved to 2 Washington Place. It was organized by Carl Hazlewood, the gallery's artistic director, and its six participants, a press release says, ''have shed the disengaged 'cool' of much mainstream art.''
This is to assume that they have the cool to shed, which is inconceivable where the expressionistic Jacob Landau and Luis Cruz Azaceta are concerned, and improbable in the cases of Willie Birch, a naif, and Cliff Joseph, who owes a little something to Ben Shahn. Nor are cool pasts easily imagined for Scott Dedecker, a commentator on international immorality, and Mo Bahc, a Korean-born painter who attempts the reconciliation of Eastern and Western cultural traditions. 
As political statements, Mr. Bahc's images will be meaningless to Western viewers, since the writing in them is Korean. Taken at face value, though, they are blends of abstract shapes in paint and collage ornamented with ''braids'' of black pigment, oversized characters and faint allusions to Buddhist art, and as such seem grandiose. The founder of a politically oriented gallery (in Brooklyn), Mr. Bahc has talent and conviction, but he may have to choose between politics and art if he is to make himself understood.
His subject the violence in Lebanon, Mr. Dedecker bases his enameled-looking images on news photographs, which leads him to paint tonally and in what are essentially blacks, grays and whites tinted with such colors as sepia, reds, blues, yellows and so forth. The results are impressions - of a dark wasteland illuminated by puffs of creamy white smoke, figures picking through the wreckage of a building and, in some watercolors, landscapes dotted with groups of Muslim soldiers.
Of all the artists, Mr. Dedecker is said in the press release to be closest to the avant-garde, in terms of ''ironic/critical stance.'' But to the reviewer he seems as literal (if not as grand) as Meissonier is in his 1870 rendering of the Tuileries in ruins.
The violence that Mr. Birch reports in ''Johnny Make the Nightly News'' is strictly home-grown. A bloody corpse lies in the street, cordoned off by red tape; the police are at hand; people stand on the sidewalk watching. Decorating the picture's dark wood frame is a painted relief of crack vials and daggers - shades of Gauguin and the motifs he carved on the frames of his Polynesian works.
Mr. Birch may lack technical sophistication, but he is a shrewd observer, particularly in ''Season's Greetings.'' The scene is a room attractively furnished in a middle-class, arty style; the chief figures are a black boy and a black girl (the boy in a Yale sweatshirt), on the floor studying economics by way of a Monopoly game. A man sits nearby reading The New York Times Magazine; an orange cat cleans itself on a divan. All is brightly colored domestic bliss, except for the acrimonious atmosphere around the game and the overall implications that, sooner or later, penalties must be paid for this or any other kind of prosperity.
Mostly, it is in ''Freedom,'' a small painting of black, green and yellow balloons held aloft by a disembodied black hand, that Mr. Joseph conveys his attachment to Shahn. Otherwise, he is his own man - an odd mixture of reticence, militancy and humor. The painting of a black family bivouacked on the sidewalk outside a waterbed store, ''Have More Fun in a Waterbed,'' is not the average comment on homelessness. But then the family isn't exactly typical either.
Cradling an adolescent boy in her lap, the woman sits staring into the store that is advertising the fun, while her man lies sleeping with one hand on the back of a bright-eyed white terrier. The color is drab; the drawing is sometimes good (the man's shoes), sometimes inept (the figure of the boy), and the whole spectacle is tinged with improbability.
But as a statement about poverty, it is far superior to ''Oh Say Can You See,'' where Mr. Joseph hauls in props from the dissidents' warehouse - the flag, skyscrapers, dollar signs and other symbols of capitalism - juxtaposing them with a garbage basket containing cutouts of African sculpture.
A goblin with large eyes and a hooked nose, Mr. Azaceta's alter ego continues to play Everyman. In one of these large, crusty canvases, he squats, seeming unable to decide which of the open manholes around him to scuttle into; in the other he is but a head bobbing on a choppy sea in a small boat. He is a character that everyone, regardless of political affiliation, can identify with.
Mr. Landau gives the show perspective, as a resident of Roosevelt, the community that Shahn lived in, and as the one artist in the show to be inspired by the Bible. His pencil and pastel drawings of torsos, heads and limbs speak, variously, of Christ's ''wars and rumors of wars''; the ladder full of angels that Jacob dreamt about, and the fragmentation prophesied by the Book of Revelation.
Though none are demagogues, these artists make it plain that ''present conditions'' don't begin to fulfill the ''promise of progress'' forever being made by political leaders. A gallery that was originally oriented to minority artists, Aljira is setting an example with art that generally transcends minority issues. The show, through Sept. 30, is open Wednesday through Sunday from noon to 6 P.M.

HEADLINE: Being Taxed Out of One's Town

 BODY:
Re: ''West Milford Journal: Angered by Tax Increases, Residents Seek an Investigation'' (Aug. 13):
Any political candidate for office in the State of New Jersey should read this article and understand that every community in our state is also West Milford. The issue is not if our present methods of establishing the priorities for the people's business work, but whether their continued functioning can be rationalized quickly enough to prevent the destruction of the state's basic unit, the family. 
The effects of taxation are absorbing the disposable income of average citizens at a rate that families find impossible to replace. Who should be identified as these average citizens? They are the nondominant political culture people (retired, aged, single-parent, fixed-income, lower middle class, the non-upwardly-mobile middle class and the documented poor). And those in ''dominant political and socioeconomic culture'' are finding that they can reconstruct their once stable and ethnically and economically mixed communities (regardless of the Mount Laurel decision) into isolated and insulated reflections of themselves and their values through the use of creative capital projects and related increases in local property taxes.
Is your town using the coercive power of local property ordinances and taxation to gentrify you and your neighbors out of town? Do you now understand why there are no low-income homes for families in New Jersey communities except the huddled masses' ghettos of Camden, Newark et al?
We are a new statewide coalition. We are not associated with either political party, but we are the reason your town or the state exists, to create equity from chaos.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
First-Time Buyers Face Some Agonizing Choices

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
WHEN it came time to buy their first home, Jeff and Kelly Bonser of suburban Los Angeles matched the experience of many young couples setting out to buy into the American dream. They paid more than they had expected to, and settled for less than they had hoped for.
But it was a home, and it was theirs. So last December they joined the ranks of American homeowners, achieving a goal that is becoming more and more elusive for other young couples like them. Over the last decade, relatively high interest rates, housing prices that outpaced the rise in wages, and high rents that limited the opportunities of young families to save - all have seriously eroded the proportion of owners among people in their mid-20's to mid-30's, traditionally the prime ages for first-home buyers.
The Bonsers - he is 27 years old and she is 25 - increased their expenses and lowered their expectations in buying a 2,000-square-foot badly deteriorated house in Rancho Cucamonga in San Bernardino County, and Mr. Bonser set to work with hammer and saw to make it livable. Their dream, to live higher up in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, will have to wait, they said. 
In becoming homeowners, the Bonsers joined Alex, 27, and Betsy Sosa, 24, who gave up on finding something they could afford in their first choice, Irvington, N.J., and camped out for three days before the builder's trailer to sign up for a new state-subsidized brick-and-frame town house in a redevelopment area of Newark.
At about the same time in North Carolina, Charles and Elizabeth Tysinger, both 24, decided against spending more money for less in their first choice location - Chapel Hill - and ''got lucky,'' spending $20,000 more than they had planned for two acres and a big house in the town of Elon College, outside Burlington.
Each of these couples is typical of two-income middle-class home buyers in their new towns. The men have special skills - one is a pharmacist, another a carpenter, and the third a telephone technician - and their wives are office workers. What they discovered in looking for their first houses, and the choices they were faced with, say much about the difficulties a young family faces in acquiring a home these days. They needed patience and some luck. Two of the couples got help from their parents and the third took advantage of a state program that helps first-time home buyers.
AND despite wide differences in the relative cost of housing among the American regions they represent, the young home buyers agreed that one element above all others was crucial to clearing the first hurdle to buying a home: an iron determination to scrimp and save, even while friends were buying new cars and leaving on expensive vacations, to amass a big enough down payment.
Having a baby on the way helps on the inspirational side. ''When I found out I was pregnant, it was no more 'wait 'til next year,' '' said Mrs. Bonser. ''I said, 'Jeff, we've got to find a house!' ''
Federal officials, social planners and demographers are expressing a growing distress that fewer and fewer Americans in the 25-to-35 age group are willing or able to achieve the goals of these young couples. After rising steadily since home-ownership percentages were first being tracked by the Bureau of the Census after World War II, the percentages of first-time buyers becoming homeowners began to drop after 1980, from 43.3 percent to 36.2 percent in 1988 for 25-to-29-year-olds, and from 62.4 percent to 52.6 percent for 30-to-35-year-olds.
If ownership participation by those groups had remained at the pre-1980 levels, said a recent report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, two million more home-owning households would now dot the country.
The decline in home ownership among young people is not simply a matter of a different lifestyle for the coming generation, the experts warn. The country's retirement system assumes that a certain number of citizens will have acquired substantial savings in their homes by the time they leave work, and the Harvard study warns of the consequences of a generation of renters coming to retirement.
''THE growing poverty population and the decline in homeownership rates among the young are likely to contribute to further increases in the inequality in income and wealth,'' it concluded. Unless reversed, it said, this trend ''threatens to produce a permanent underclass of disadvantaged renters and jeopardize the long-term financial security of future generations.''
For Mr. and Mrs. Sosa of Newark, the connection between home ownership and future security hardly needed an academic explanation.
''My whole idea is, number one, if you really want to save money and make money for the future, real estate is the only way to go,'' said Mr. Sosa, a telephone-line technician for New Jersey Bell. ''So you have to think what you would rather do, drive a new car every year or keep the one you have for three or four years and own your own home. That's the choice you have to make.'' Mr. Tysinger, a pharmacist with the Super X chain in Burlington, N.C., and his wife, a production scheduler at the A. T. & T. plant there, took the most drastic steps to get their $24,000 down payment together.
After their marriage in January 1988, they moved deep into the country to a little farmhouse that rented for only $235 a month and lived on Mrs. Tysinger's salary while banking his.
''Basically we didn't go out like a lot of people and look for a nice expensive condo with a pool and everything that rents for $800 a month,'' Mr. Tysinger said. ''We found this nice little farmhouse and put my salary in the bank, and that gave us the idea that, hey, we could make the house payments because in a sense we were doing it by putting that money in the bank.
''You say in your mind that you have to do this thing, and if it means you have to scrimp a little bit, you do it.''
Indeed, while studies bemoan the loss of the savings ethic among Americans, the Tysingers were eager to explain that looking years instead of days ahead is something they learned growing up.
''We're both owe a great deal to our parents,'' Mr. Tysinger went on. ''They did give us some money to help buy the house, but what they also did was work hard all their lives to be able to send us to school and to send us through college. They have had to work hard all their lives, and we feel very strongly about how important that has been for us.''
The Tysingers have a combined income of about $70,000, compared with the statewide median household income of $30,200. They are also childless, increasing their disposable income.
So when they decided they were ready to start looking in earnest last October, they were confident that their $100,000 upper limit for the purchase price would give them their pick of houses.''
''We were incredibly unrealistic about it,'' Mrs. Tysinger said with a laugh. ''We thought that if we were spending $100,000 for a house, we would end up with a mansion. Well, we found some very nice residential sections but they were very expensive, and they still didn't have the privacy and the room we were looking for.''
AFTER looking since last October, the Tysingers found their three-bedroom, three-bath home on two acres of oak, hickory and walnut trees. Best of all, from Mr. Tysinger's point of view, it overlooks a neighbor's pond. Ponds feature prominently in his plans for a small ranch later one.
''We got lucky,'' Mr. Tysinger said of the $120,000 purchase. They closed on the house June 21.
For the Bonsers of Rancho Cucamonga, an $80,000 home was the original upper limit. He is a finish-grade carpenter, and his wife, who handles billing for Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center according to the National Association of Realtors.
For a while, they rented a home in Ontario, the adjoining community, and found several houses there in their price range.
''BUT we also heard gunshots in the night, our neighbor had a bullet go through his wall, the whole nine yards,'' Mr. Bonser said. ''We have kids and we want them to be able to play outdoors, so our goal went up to $100,000 in a real hurry.''
Even that price put their first dream of a house in the foothills out of reach, and Mr. Bonser was half hoping his family would wait a few years, until they could move over the San Bernardino mountains to the high desert around Victorville, where land was cheaper and he would be able to build a house of their own.
But with a second baby on the way, and Mrs. Bonser insistent that she remain close to her parents, they eventually found their home at the outer edge of Rancho Cucamonga, just inside the right side of the railroad tracks from Ontario, for $102,000. The house had been vacant for some time, and had been badly vandalized. Not a closet door was hanging, the stove was a mess, there were holes in the wall, and most electric fixtures needed replacing.
''I went to look at it with a girlfriend and she kept saying, 'Oh, Kelly, you can't live in here,' and I kept saying 'Yes, but Jeff can do this and Jeff can do that, and it's going to be O.K.' ''
So it has. Mrs. Bonser traded in her beloved Thunderbird on a compact to save on gas, and they rearranged other parts of their budget to swing the deal.
Since moving in just before last Christmas, Mr. Bonser has repaired the interior, and only a pile of cinderblocks in the driveway, awaiting Mr. Bonser's plans to level the front yard with a retaining wall, remain to recall the house's former state.
''I never thought I'd be paying a thousand dollars a month for house payments,'' Mr. Bonser remarked. ''But it sure feels good.''
Mr. and Mrs. Sosa - she is a supervisor at Citibank in New York City - were faced with the problem many first-time buyers confront in the New York area. Their combined income of about $50,000 is close to the New York metropolitan area median of $54,300, but in that same region, the median house price is $178,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.
''We've been trying to find a home like any young couple, and we've been looking for two and a half years.'' Mr. Sosa declared. ''It always turns out to be a little harder than you expect.''
Their bid of $99,900 for an older house in Irvington, a suburb of Newark, was accepted, and the Sosas spent $1,300 on engineering reports and other services before being turned down by the bank. At a 10.5 percent interest rate, the bank decided, they could not qualify for the loan.
THEN, just a year ago, the Sosas saw an ad for new town homes being built in Newark by the Inner City Division of K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., a leading builder of modestly priced housing in New Jersey and Florida. The project was rising in a redevelopment area of Newark that had been bulldozed clear of the slums that once stood on the site.
The City of Newark donated part of the land for the project in exchange for a pledge from the developer to include low-cost rental units in the condominium project.
Society Hill Newark, as it is known, offered brand new homes for under $100,000, and the Sosas showed up at the builder's sales office three days before it opened, sleeping bags and pillows in hand. They were 30th in line. They took turns standing, and sleeping, in line, and when the office opened, they signed up for a two-bedroom, two-bath corner unit on Howard Street, with cabinets and carpets they picked out and equipped right down to the washer and the dryer, for $97,600.
BUYING a house even at that price required the help of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, a state office that lends the proceeds of tax-free bonds as reduced-interest mortgages for first-time home buyers in the state.
The Sosas were just under the upper-income limits set by the program, and qualified for an 8.5 percent, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, 2 percentage points below the prevailing bank rate. They closed on the house May 19.
Their total monthly charges for mortgage, taxes and insurance come to $888. At that price, the choice of a condominium townhouse in one of the least fashionable cities of the Northeast was easy, because in the case of Newark, Mr. Sosa said, fashion lags behind reality.
''Many people would say we must be crazy to move from Woodbridge to Newark,'' Mr. Sosa said. ''It's the typical New Jersey attitude - you just mention Newark and people assume its all bombed out and terrible. But this city is coming back, and because we are owners now, we are a part of it.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Demographics Hold Key To Home Appreciation

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
AS vice president and chief housing analyst for the Chicago Title and Trust Company, John Pfister is among the legion of real estate professionals who consider home ownership one of the most solid long-term investments available to American families.
But ask Mr. Pfister about his own parents, who bought a three-bedroom home on Chicago's North Side in 1929, the year of the stock market collapse, and sold it in 1945 after a decade of deflation, a global depression and a World War. The house they bought for $11,000 sold 16 years later for $9,200.
''There are never any guarantees that a housing investment will pay off,'' he said. ''Things go sideways, and even downwards for a while, and sometimes people get hurt.'' Like Mr. Pfister, experts across the nation now are reassessing the prospects for home value appreciation with a newfound sense of caution. Most continue to believe that home prices will continue to rise over the long term. But they point to factors already responsible for downturns in some markets, and that could spread to others. 
Never mind wars or depressions, the housing analysts say. Many expect the most potent force in the nation's housing markets to be the demographic reality of the baby-boom generation, which created a huge new population of first-time home buyers from the late 70's to the mid-80s, and which is now growing into middle age.
Between this year and the year 2000, according to the Bureau of the Census, there will be no increase in the number of Americans between 25 and 44 years old, the group that traditionally has included most of the first time home buyers. By contrast, the population of those 45 to 60 years old will grow by 18 million, according to the government projections.
''The group with real problems are those born in the middle 60's, people at the lagging edge of the baby boom and leading edge of the baby bust,'' said John Tucillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.
People in this age group - now 20 to 25 years old - will buy their first homes at prices that have been pushed up by a larger population of slightly older buyers. And when they decide to sell, the analysts caution, they may find the market has weakened because of a dwindling population of first-time buyers younger than themselves.
Nor are demographics the only reason for skittishness in some parts of the country, the experts say. One clear characteristic of the housing market dur-ing the late 70's and the 80's was a volatility rarely experienced in the past, bringing periods of soaring price escalation in some areas that inevitably have led to downward adjustments.
''We have seen - and will continue to see - an actual price decline in places that overshot the market,'' said Kenneth Rosen, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California in Berkeley and chief real estate analyst for Salomon Brothers. He added that he sees no immediate signs of a turnaround in two large markets currently experiencing a downward adjustment - the New York City region and New England.
DESPITE their warnings of caution, however, experts say that over the long term a home is a safe - some say essential - investment for people looking forward over decades toward retirement. Shortages of land suitable for development, the rising cost of construction, and the fact that Americans are living longer and are healthier in their old age are all factors that should serve to buttress demand for homes and push prices higher, the experts say.
Some have concluded that home ownership is the most important means of accumulating wealth, and that having complete or partial equity in a home will be crucial to planning a secure retirement.
''As households continue to delay or forgo becoming homeowners, their economic security at retirement is threatened,'' said a report issued in June by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.
Nonetheless, few expect the surging pace of price escalation that took place in many parts of the country between 1970 and the mid-1980's to be repeated. Some experts are urging young home buyers to consider not only the soaring prices of recent memory, but conditions in the housing market in several preceeding decades.
One rough measure of home prices over 50 years is provided by the Census Bureau, which has asked homeowners across the nation every 10 years what they think their homes would sell for. On that basis, it has reported a median home value once each decade.
Beginning with 1930, when the median home value was $4,800, the census data show clearly that prices move down, as well as up. By 1940, the median value had dropped more than 50 percent to $3,000. It shot back up to $7,400 by 1950, then climbed at a more gradual pace to $11,900 in 1960 and to $17,000 in 1970.
That is when prices began to soar. By 1980, the census data show that the median price had almost tripled, to $47,200. Data obtained by census using the same techique show that the median price had climbed to $73,536 by 1985.
And the volatility of prices has been much greater in some areas, particularly California, New England and the New York metropolitan region. The price swings around New York are reflected in research by the Housing Information Committee, a group of New Jersey realtors that commissioned a title search on a large four-bedroom house in Westfield, 20 miles southwest of Manhattan.
The group said the Westfield house was typical of homes in affluent suburban neighborhoods that are within easy commuting distance of New York City.
The search found that that title to the house was transferred in 1932, when a savings bank foreclosed on a $12,000 mortgage outstanding on the property. Later the same year, the savings bank sold it to another real estate concern for $11,500. In 1937, with its value still sinking, the house was sold to a family for $10,900.
That family kept the house for 12 years, selling it in 1949 at a time of rapid suburban growth after World War II. It was sold twice in 1949 - for $18,000 in January and for $22,500 in June.
IN 1953, a family bought the house and kept it for 28 years, profiting handsomely when it ultimately put it on the market. The family paid $32,000 in June 1953 and sold it for $166,500 in March, 1981. But while the value of the house rose rapidly in three decades, its price surged even faster in the 1980s. It sold in February 1987 for $390,000, more than double the price six years earlier. Its current owners paid $530,000 in August 1988.
But analysts say the values of the Westfield house and others like it in the New York suburbs have leveled off and in many cases declined slightly over the last year. Thus, recent buyers who now have to sell may have to accept losses. The decline, however, has been far less severe than in some other regions -home values plummeted over 20 percent Houston and Dallas during the early 80's - but it is having a painful impact on the plans of some suburbanites around New York.
The National Board of Realtors estimated that home prices have dropped three percent in the last year in the New York suburbs. If the owners of the Westfield house had to sell at a 3 percent loss, they would forfeit $16,000, plus thousands of dollars more in bank finance charges, legal fees and other costs associated with buying and selling real estate.
They would also have to suffer through the emotional ordeal of selling in a weak market in which buyers are holding out for unrealistically steep discounts and homes are languishing on the market for months.
''There is a tendency to think the housing market is going to collapse,'' said Mr. Tuccilo. ''It won't, but just as there always have been in the past, there are going to be shakeouts in individual markets.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION: CHICAGO;
A Residential Flying Community With Streets Called Taxiways

BYLINE: By JODY BROTT

 BODY:
GOLFERS and boaters long have known the advantages of living along the fairway or at a marina. Now pilots are carving out their own niche in the residential real estate market. The latest in this area is Meadow Creek, a 212-acre airport community under construction near Monee 35 miles southwest of the Loop, where pilots will be able to taxi their private planes up to their front doors.
Roads will not be called roads, but ''taxiways'' named after World War II aviation heroes such as Jimmy Doolittle and Butch O'Hare. Houses will have airplane hangars with direct access to a 3,400-foot runway, this area's longest residential airstrip. And closed-circuit television will carry information about runway and weather conditions. 
''The ideal situation is for the pilot to store his plane in his attached hangar, just like you would park your car in an attached garage,'' said William W. Pradelski, codeveloper with Edward Rachanski.
''We buy aircraft for pleasure and convenience,'' said Terrence Kunes, one of Chicago's largest car dealers, who bought a Meadow Creek lot and owns a Beech Baron, a Cessna Skylane and a Piper Lance. ''And usually the distance between home and the airport dictates whether it's convenient or not.''
The Meadow Creek Corporation already has spent $6 million on land, improvements and the runway. Most of the houses on the 150 one-acre lots will be under construction within two years and completed within four years, Mr. Pradelski said. Since some buyers plan to build on more than one lot, about 135 houses will go up at $310,000 to $1 million, including lot, hangar and house. As of mid-August all but 38 lots had been sold and most purchasers have chosen to have a hangar at home.
The first residential airport community in the Chicago area was Brookeridge, built in 1956 in southwest suburban Downers Grove. A handful more were built in the 60's and 70's throughout the metropolitan area - the aviation hub of the nation, with six airport communities including Meadow Creek.
Richard M. Ware, chief of the Illinois Bureau of Aviation Education and Safety for the Division of Aeronautics, estimated that there are a dozen airport communities in Illinois, adding that Western Flyer Aviation, a biweekly newspaper, reports 250 across the nation.
Meadow Creek, is situated in the 25-square-mile area known as unincorporated Will County, still predominantly farmland. Mr. Pradelski, a pilot and former airport community resident, bought the land in 1983 for about $1.5 million.
The project is expected to appeal to private pilots who want the convenience and economy of keeping their airplane, or airplanes, in their backyards. Its homeowners' association - the projected maintenance charge is $40 per month - will own the runway and will sell fuel to residents at cost.
CONSTRUCTION of a one-plane hangar costs $40,000 to $80,000 depending on design and extras, such as a turntable or special plumbing system for washing the aircraft. Typically, they are 50 feet wide, about as wide as a four-car garage and about 15 feet deeper. Some homes will have three-plane hangars.
Meadow Creek will also offer 270 condominium hangars, basically to accommodate residents of its second phase - 225 town houses and 50 single-family homes on an adjacent 139-acre site with smaller lots that afford no room for hangars. The hangars, which will also start at $40,000, will be available to residents of the first phase of construction who do not choose to house their planes at home.
Residents may take off and land at any hour, with no noise problems anticipated by Mr. Pradelski who described an airplane as ''quieter than a truck going down a highway.'' There will be no control tower, but there will be runway lights and markings, a wind tee and a windsock. The subdivision will be private and will have extensive security, including a guardhouse, an electronic entrance, individual alarm systems and a 24-hour television monitor of the runway. The acre to an acre-and-a-half lots cost $60,000 to $140,000, with ''premium'' parcels on the runway.
HOUSES must be at least 2,000 square feet, not including garage or hangar. However, plans that have already been filed show that one will be 8,000 square feet and Mr. Pradelski said that he expects others to be as large. He added that an architectural review committee must pass on all plans. Buyers may use Meadow Creek's builder or hire their own.
Once built, Meadow Creek will help meet a growing demand for residential airports, said Mr. Ware, noting that at least four privately owned Chicago area airports open to the public have closed since 1980.
In addition to providing much needed space, airport communities separate smaller general aviation aircraft from commuter airplanes, and thereby help alleviate traffic delays at larger municipal airports, where monthly hangar fees of $300 to $400 are common.
As a result, the state is encouraging airport-home developments. The Illinois Department of Transportation is drawing up guidelines for such communities. In 1985, the state created a special classification of residential airport, making it easier for airport communities to gain approval from local zoning boards which previously were uncertain how to classify such developments. Mr. Ware believes Illinois is the only state to recognize the classification of residential airport.
Developers have been slow to enter the residential airport market because of its high cost, including leveling land for the runway, Mr. Pradelski said. Other deterrents are special zoning requirements, Federal Aviation Administration approval and the scarcity of locations that cause no conflict with existing traffic patterns.
Who will live at Meadow Creek?
FIFTY percent of the buyers will use their aircraft for business. Among the buyers are an automobile dealer, a real estate developer, a physician, an aircraft insurer, and a retired Air Force colonel. Some now hold breakfast club meetings at airport restaurants. Some collect antique Stearmans and aircraft from World Wars I and II. Some are stunt fliers. Some build experimental aircraft.
Their airplanes cost between $20,000 for a four-seat single-engine airplane and $300,000 for a twin-engine eight-passenger craft.
For them, moving to Meadow Creek will mean the hours of washing, polishing and repairing their aircraft will be hours spent at home.
''It's fulfilling a lifelong dream,'' said Dean Del Bene, who insures aircraft. He calls his four-seat single-engine Mooney and 1937 Stinson Reliant his ''magic carpets.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NEW YORK REGION;
A Soft Market Is Chilling Apartment Construction

BYLINE: By MARK McCAIN

 BODY:
SOMETIMES when he answers his phone, Robert Ginsberg gets the feeling that home buyers in New York City today are a band of marauders driven by a thirst for rock-bottom bargains.
''People haven't been shy about negotiating over the phone - to see how far they can whittle down the price before they even look at my apartment,'' said Mr. Ginsberg, who is asking $167,000 for a studio apartment on East 56th Street that he believes was worth more than $200,000 before the stock market crash of 1987.
''Nonserious shoppers are looking for the steal of century,'' he said. ''And unfortunately, some owners are panicking and selling their apartments for less than they're worth - which hurts all the rest of us.''
Whether the motivation is panic or simply realism, successful sellers today are often resigning themselves to break-even deals. And sellers who bought nondescript apartments at the peak of the bidding frenzy four years ago are looking at losses that sometimes exceed $50,000. Buyers have become choosy and cautious, amid fears that prices have not bottomed out yet. Deals are still being struck, but hot spots in the market are few. 
''It's much harder to make a sale because buyers have tremendous choices, and in some segments of the market - like postwar apartments east of Lexington Avenue - there have been lots of price reductions,'' said Eva Fabry, a broker on the Upper East Side with Albert B. Ashforth, a realty company.
''But when someone is matched with an apartment that fits their needs to perfection, they'll readily buy it for the right price. I made three sales last month, all with serious sellers who weren't playing games and who had attractive prewar apartments.''
Clearly, the market is feeling the aftereffects of a major boom in housing construction and resale activity during the mid-80's. ''Lots of people are sitting in homes they've only owned for short periods of time, so we've really zapped the trade-up activity,'' said John Savacool, who tracks residential real estate in the New York metropolitan area for WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
Moreover, as fears of a recession waft through the air, and homes appear to be uncertain investments, it takes more courage to trade up for a home.
''Everyone wonders,'' Mr. Savacool said, '' 'Will I survive if I happen to be caught in the midst of an economic constriction?' Nobody wants to be in a new trade-up home with a fat mortgage, trying to make ends meet on unemployment compensation.''
Developers, too, have grown cautious. In Manhattan, about 3,500 market-rate condominium and rental apartments will be erected this year, according to Yale Robbins, a Manhattan publisher who tracks the real estate industry. That is less than half the annual volume of 1987 and 1988, when an expiring tax-abatement program spurred builders into action.
But on the other end of the affordability spectrum, New York City began a $5 billion program last year aimed at producing more than 250,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing over the next decade. The central focus is on new construction and rehabilitation projects in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
In the suburbs, 1989 has been a year of bloodletting, with builders reducing their volume or shutting down completely. Yet even though buyers appear to be an endangered species, they are not extinct.
''This project indicates that even in a bad market, and you'd have to call this a bad market, there's still demand for well-designed, low-priced product,'' said Martin Berger, developer of the largest condominium tower ever built in Westchester County - a 17-story, 316-unit project in White Plains called the Seasons Club and Spa. Prices start around $150,000 for one-bedrooms with about 700 square feet of space. The building will be completed next spring and so far there are about 90 buyers.
''IF we were in a brisk market, I think we would have sold double that number by now,'' said Mr. Berger, president of Robert Martin Company, based in Elmsford, N.Y. ''Even a slow market you can find niches to move into - and that's what we've done.'' But a good niche is hard to find. Every developer, when mapping out strategy for a project one or two years before construction begins, attempts to guess what buyers will find attractive. As the market grows weaker, that becomes more difficult.
''Buyers today are looking for apartments that they know aren't being duplicated elsewhere,'' said Steven G. Rockmore, chairman of Gilbert Charles Beylen, a Manhattan marketing firm that assists developers. ''It's a very difficult time for any building that has cookie-cutter boxes.''
Two of the projects that Mr. Rockmore is handling have exceptional views. A 21-story building at 222 Riverside Drive overlooks the Hudson River, while a slightly taller building at 279 Central Park West offers views of the park. Prices there average $800 a square foot, more than double the price of plain-vanilla condominiums in Manhattan.
But $800 is not the peak of the market. Last year, the top square-foot price in a condominium transaction was $1,840 - for an eight-room, $3.6 million apartment $3.6 million at St. James Tower, a building east of First Avenue on 54th Street that opened in 1983.
WITH prices like that, no one can say the Manhattan housing market is moribund. Yet many sellers are frustrated. They believe they have attractive, well-priced homes. But no one seems interested in buying.
''It's a great apartment and I think it's a great buy,'' said Denise Lipman, who has been trying to sell a 1,300-square-foot duplex in a renovated armory near the Hudson River on 42d Street for almost a year. ''A lot of people are shopping around, but no one wants to commit themselves.''
Two months ago Ms. Lipman, her husband and their two children moved to a house in suburban New Jersey. As a sweetener, the Lipmans now are offering to pay the first year of maintenance fees - totaling more than $13,000 - on their apartment, which is priced at $279,000.
''We've been really anxious,'' Ms. Lipman said, ''but now I guess we've resigned ourselves to the idea that we'll probably have to rent it out for a couple of years.'' Decisions like that are putting downward pressure on rents in Manhattan. Individual owners and condominium developers alike are shifting apartments into the rental market temporarily, intending to sell them when prices move up again.
Most owners are renting their apartments for less than their attempted sale prices might seem to warrant. That is forcing landlords to become more aggressive, too. In July, a new 1,107-unit rental project on Roosevelt Island, across from the Upper East Side, began offering free rent through November to anyone signing a two-year lease.
''At this point, I can get a better quality apartment by renting rather than purchasing,'' said Mr. Ginsberg, who is selling his small apartment and looking with his fiancee for a two-bedroom apartment. ''Comparing total costs after taxes, I figure a rental will be about 70 or 80 percent of what I'd just be throwing to the wind by owning a place in this soft market.''
But once he began looking around, Mr. Ginsberg discovered to his dismay that two-bedroom apartments have continued to hold their value in the resale market. According to the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan firm, average asking prices in virtually every size category of co-op and condominium apartments dropped during the 12-month period ended in June - except two-bedroom units.
''A few years ago baby boomers like me paid a lot for studio and one-bedroom apartments,'' Mr. Ginsberg said. ''Now we're all looking for family-sized apartments and so those are the ones that are selling for top dollar.'' Usually a home seller waits no longer than two years to reinvest in another home, thereby deferring taxes on capital gains. But for people like Mr. Ginsberg, who expects to only break even on his apartment, capital gains are absent, so tax liabilities are absent, too.
Other hopeful sellers have decided now would be a good time to buy -if only they could find a buyer.
''I think it's a bad market,'' said Alan Solarz, who is asking $165,000 for a one-bedroom apartment at 245 East 54th Street. ''People come through our apartment and look in two seconds, so there must be a lot of supply on the market.''
Many brokers report that sales activity has been improving since a nearly comatose stretch last winter, but buyers are still hestitant.
''FIVE years ago buyers would walk into in an apartment and feel they had to take it immediately,'' said Betsy Dean, a senior vice president of Douglas Elliman-Haldenstein, a major co-op brokerage on the Upper West Side. ''Now they no longer feel under the gun psychologically. There's lots more out there.'' In July, New York State extended a 0.4 percent transfer tax on houses and condominium apartments to co-op apartments as well - sparking a surge in co-op sales during April, May and June as owners raced to beat the new tax liability.
Apartment sales within about 200 co-op buildings surveyed by Douglas Elliman increased from 83 during the first quarter of 1989 to 173 in the second quarter. Many brokers are predicting that third-quarter activity will fall somewhere between the first-quarter stupor and the second-quarter frenzy.
Both Douglas Elliman and the Corcoran Group, another Manhattan brokerage that tracks the high end of the resale market, showed declining sale prices during the first six months of this year. The average price per room in both surveys, tabluated from different samples, was down by about 2.5 percent from 1988. Before this year, the average price in Elliman surveys had been climbing every year since a slight dip in 1976, while the Corcoran survey had its last price drop in 1982.
''For years, we'd laugh if a prospective buyer asked, 'Where can I find a good deal,' '' Ms. Dean said. ''But now, for the first time in a long time, we can say, 'There are some good deals out there.' ''

Old Mill Town Revived, With a New Twist

BYLINE: By PHOEBE ZERWICK

 BODY:
RUSSELL AND DEBORAH WRIGHT, both workers at R. L. Stowe Mills in this textile town just south of Charlotte, live in a frame house built about 70 years ago by a man who made his fortune in spinning mills.
Like other mill owners in the Carolinas in the early years of this century, R. L. Stowe knew that if he wanted to lure farmers from the Catawba River Valley and beyond to run his spinning machines, he had to provide inexpensive places for them to live.
Now his grandsons are renovating those same mill houses as rentals to recruit workers like the Wrights, much the way the grandfather did years ago. In the next five years they plan to spend $7 million to $8 million to turn drafty frame houses into modern homes with central air-conditioning, dishwashers, double-pane windows and vinyl siding.
Richmond Stowe, 27 years old, the youngest of the three brothers who now run the mill, said of the project, ''It got to the point where they were in such bad shape and the work force around here got so tight, we felt it would solidify our employee base.'' 
In some ways the Stowes are just following the advice that their father, R. L. Stowe Jr., always gave them about the 350 rundown houses they owned and rented to mill workers around town. ''He always said they were an asset, that he would never sell them off,'' Richmond Stowe said.
Housing experts say the Stowes are reviving an employee benefit that other companies are just now discovering. Assemblyman David C. Schwartz of New Jersey, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and director of its American Affordable Housing Institute, said he believes that employer-assisted housing in general will be an important new personnel benefit in the 90's.
In Princeton, N.J., for example, Church & Dwight Company, which makes Arm & Hammer baking soda, lends its employees up to 15 percent of the purchase price on a condominium town house in the Griggs Farm development in Princeton Township. If the employee remains for five years - during which time no payments are required - the loan is forgiven.
In Santa Barbara, Calif., a dozen companies have agreed to do business with the Santa Barbara Bank & Trust in exchange for low-interest second mortgages to help their employees make down payments.
And on the northwest side of Chicago, seven companies have agreed to invest in a revolving loan fund, called the Walk Home Program, for down payments for employees who buy houses in the surrounding neighborhood. Elizabeth Lockwood, one of the directors of the program there, said that the businesses - mostly manufacturing companies - started the fund because they were losing employees to the suburbs and losing the neighborhood to crime.
''It keeps people in the city and industry in the city,'' she said. With a cost of about $5 a year per employee, ''it's a real low-cost, high-visibility fringe.''
In Belmont, the approach is different, and perhaps fitting, in a town where working for a mill and living in mill-owned housing has always been a way of life. Rather than help employees buy their own homes, the Stowes are repairing the broken-down homes their employees have always rented from them.
RENTS have been low - 10 years ago, for example, an employee got a three-bedroom house for $25 a week - but there were few amenities. Most houses did not have heat and the tenants used space heaters; indoor plumbing was something of an afterthought, with toilets tacked onto back porches.
''Most of the companies around the country who have chosen to get into employer- assisted housing,'' said Mr. Schwartz, ''have avoided rental housing precisely because it reminds them of the company town of the late 19th and early 20th century.'' But times have changed, he said. ''After all,'' he said, ''the workers are not being brought in by bayonet. People who come in and rent these houses presumably know what their housing needs are and presumably could get a job somewhere else. I think the fear of the company town is really a yesteryear story.'' Nelson J. Bradshaw, who has sold appliances and groceries to mill workers for more than 40 years and cashed their paychecks, said: ''It's going to give them an edge. A man's going to think twice about leaving when he doesn't have a house to go to.''
In North Carolina, most other textile makers say that mill villages are a throwback to a time of company control that they would rather forget. Most of the big companies - Hanes, Cone, Burlington - bowed to public pressure and sold off their houses years ago.
''To the extent that there was a great deal of competition, it was a benefit,'' said Dennis M. Julian, a spokesman for the North Carolina Textile Manufacturing Association. ''A company could say, 'You work for me and you'll get an inexpensive house.' The reason they got out of it was because it was a bit of paternalism and an administrative burden.''
The Stowe brothers, however, are willing to bear the burden. With an unemployment rate in the surrounding county at 2.2 percent, the lowest in North Carolina, Stowe Mills often cannot find and keep the 1,300 workers it needs to run its spinning machines. And often as many as 20 percent only stay a few months before moving on to one of the dozens of other mills in Belmont and nearby.
Repairs on the first of six villages, near Stowe's National Plant and the new automated Helms Plant, are nearly done. On the advice of a public relations concern, the Stowes changed the village's name from National Mill Hill, as it had been known for decades, to Cottonwood, and published a brochure that looks like any other subdivision leaflet.
THE tongue-and-groove board walls are gone, as are the wild shades of green, blue and purple that mill workers had used to brighten their neglected homes. In their place are white sheet rock, country print wallpaper and wall-to-wall carpeting.
The houses have small back and front yards, but no basements or garages.
The Wrights, in their mid-30's, live with their three sons at the end of a row of gleaming white houses in Cottonwood. They both work in the winding room at National; Mr. Wright working the second shift during the week, and Mrs. Wright two 12-hour shifts during the weekend for 30 hours of pay.
Like the other houses on the street, theirs was gutted before they moved in. The wiring and plumbing were redone; central air-conditioning and heat were added, and the makeshift bathrooms off the back porch were replaced with modern ones. The total cost was about $20,000.
The Wrights' rent of $50 a week comes out of their paycheck, ''so you never miss it,'' Mrs. Wright said.
Cheap housing in the area for a family with three boys is scarce, so they will probably stay on at the mill to keep their home, they said. Nevertheless, they wonder if they will ever be able to save enough money to buy a house for their retirement.
When a spinner or winder stops working at the mill, he loses his house. ''If we didn't do that, we'd have a retirement community,'' Richmond Stowe said. A younger couple with an infant that took advantage of the availability of housing at Stowe Mills are Angie D. Roark, 21, and her husband, Richard, 26. They moved to Belmont from depressed West Virginia to find work, and Mrs. Roark said her husband had taken a job with the mill just to be able to rent a home for his family.
''This was the only way we could afford it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: More Prisoners Serving Time Outside Jail

BYLINE: By NANCY KENNEDY

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A STATE program that allows people convicted of nonviolent crimes to serve the bulk of their sentences outside prison has prompted three counties to create similar programs and three other counties to consider establishing them.
To date, the majority of the participants in what is known as the Intermediate Sentencing Program have been first offenders convicted of drug-related crimes. They are required to find sponsors in the communities where they work, undergo counseling and perform community service. They must also submit to drug testing and observe strictly enforced curfews.
Advocates of the program dismiss criticism that the program's participants are let off with lighter sentences than warranted. They say that it has shown impressive results in rehabilitating its participants, frees up much needed space in overcrowded prisons and is far less costly than incarceration. Critics maintain that the program gives officers who supervise participants far too much influence over their lives. 
In this decade, largely because of the rise in drug use, lawmakers have taken a tougher stand on crime, instituting a range of measures like mandatory sentences for illegal gun possession. Such actions resulted in a rapid increase in the prison population. With 18,500 inmates, state instutitions today, on average, are at 125 percent capacity.
The idea for the Intermediate Sentencing Program grew out of a 1982 seminar on correction issues sponsored by the State Supreme Court. With $1 million in state money, the program was set up in September 1983 with six participants and placed under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Office of the Courts.
The program in New Jersey was the second in the nation; the first was in Georgia. Today there are 28 similiar programs across the country.
Harvey M. Goldstein, the Administrative Office of the Courts assistant director in charge of probation, said that similar programs had been set up in Essex, Middlesex and Union Counties. He said Hudson, Camden and Gloucester Counties were considering such programs.
''We are taking what we have learned from the intensive supervision program and attempting to apply it to the entire probation system,'' he said. ''We are very pleased with the inroads we have made. With reasonable safety, we can provide the support needed to enable an individual to act in a manner that society demands we act.''
Richard Talty, the program director, said state support for the program had grown steadily. In the 1988 fiscal year, the Legislature approved $2.4 million for the program and $2.9 million for the next fiscal year. Last year's appropriation, he said, was increased by $300,000 at midyear to allow for 75 additional participants.
Mr. Talty said the program has had about 500 participants a year since its inception six years ago. ''It's not the answer to overcrowding in the prisons,'' he said. ''But we think it makes a lot of difference in people who are ready to make a change in their lives.''
George Biddulph, 33 years old, of Hamilton, who completed the program in June, said he was looking for a way to redirect his life. ''I felt like I fell behind in life,'' he said. ''I needed somebody watching over me.''
The program imposes a grueling regimen that far exceeds the reach of most standard parole or probation programs. About one in four ''outmates,'' as some have dubbed program participants, ultimately returns to prison after violations of program regulations.
Those seeking to take part in the program are not eligible to apply until they have served at least part of their sentences in prison. Applications are reviewed by a panel made up of officials of the program and residents of the community in which a participant will reside after release from prison.
Those accepted into the program are released into the care of sponsors - a spouse, a parent or a graduate of the program, for example - who serve as the primary contact for a participant's officer. Completing the supervision circle are so-called network team members: employers, family members, ministers or friends who also agree to help a participant comply with program regulations. The extensive support network is intended to reinforce the efforts of program officers.
To remain in the program, a participant must be employed, meet at least three times a week with an officer, participate in individual counseling sessions, attend fellowship meetings like those of Alcoholic Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, and perform community service work. Officers from the program randomly test the participants for drug or alcohol use and strictly enforce curfews.
Participants spend from 16 months to five years in the program. The length of stay is determined by the length of the prison sentence.
 
'Pretty Rough at First'
''It was pretty rough at first,'' Mr. Biddulph said. ''After 9 or 10 months, it was wearing thin. The curfew checks bummed us out; the phone would ring at 11 o'clock at night and you're sound asleep.''
But because participants were imprisoned while their applications for the program were under review, vivid memories of incarceration provided most of them with the motivation to succeed.
Antonio Santos, 28, of Trenton, who spent eight months in prison after his conviction on drug charges, said: ''What kept me going? The thought of being where I was before. The thought of being incarcerated and knowing I don't want to be there again.'' He entered the program in December 1988.
The intense supervision by program officers makes some participants uncomfortable.
''They sometimes are apprehensive whether an officer is really there to help them,'' said Damery Bonilla, a New Brunswick-based program officer. ''They know I can recommend to the judge if a person is not making it they should be returned to jail.''
Most, however, gradually come not only to accept but also appreciate their officer's guidance. ''Joe's wonderful - he really encourages you,'' Mr. Santos said of his officer, Joseph Grinkevich, another New Brunswick officer.
 
Appealing to Women
The program is especially attractive for women whose prison sentences might otherwise separate them from their children. ''All the women in the program work, just as any other woman might,'' Ms. Bonilla said. ''But they'd rather be on I.S.P. with their families than be incarcerated in the state prison and have no contact at all.''
Statistics on recidivism bear out the success of the support-based program. Participants have a low probability of further illegal behavior. Fewer than 2 percent of about the program participants studied have later been convicted of felony offenses, while 6 percent have been convicted of misdemeanors, Mr. Talty said. None of the offenses involved violence. The program has graduated about 670 participants.
Those figures, Mr. Talty said, compare favorably with probation and parole results in which about 50 to 60 percent of those completing probation or parole go on to commit further acts of crime.
''We don't recycle people,'' Mr. Talty said. ''In that, we have really achieved something.''
Mr. Talty also points out that while the state spends about $19,000 a year on every prison inmate, the program costs $6,000 a year for each participant. In addition, he says, participants contribute an average of $3,500 a year to the economy through taxes, fines and restitution payments, community service work, child support and supervision fees.
''Judges originally were totally in opposition,'' Mr. Talty said. ''I guess they were thinking, 'I sent this person to prison and this other person is taking him out.' That has since changed. But prosecutors do not like the program. They feel it interferes with their prerogatives.''
 
Reaction of Prosecutors
Prosecutors, while generally favoring the program, oppose the participation of those convicted of dealing drugs. ''We have been resisting anyone with a violent background or drug dealing, and have not been totally successful in the latter,'' said Alan A. Rockoff, the Middlesex County Prosecutor. ''We can argue at the hearings although we have no veto power, and we have successfully argued in a few instances.''
Acceptance of the program by prosecutors was slow. At the program's inception, Mr. Rockoff said, he and his colleagues made their protests known to the Administrative Office of the Courts, describing their ''war stories'' in detailed letters.
''Prosecutors reluctantly accepted the program because it doesn't seem to be adequate punishment for a person sent to prison after diversionary and probation programs have failed to be released into the care of a sponsor to enjoy his conjugal rights, his refrigerator and his own bed,'' Mr. Rockoff said. ''But rehabilitation is the name of the game. There is such intensive supervision in this program that their statistics of success, if correct, are good ones.''
Diana Gordon, a professor of political science at the City College of New York who is writing a book on such programs, said the programs might not be as beneficial as expected. ''These programs are very intrusive on family life,'' she said. ''If it becomes a major option, we will see ghetto communities and the poor under benevolent supervision by the justice system, and I'm not convinced that's an appropriate role.''
 
Middle-Class Values
While granting that most participants embrace the structure imposed by the program on their lives, Ms. Gordon also questions the appropriateness of the perceived middle-class values imputed by the program.
''There are many requirements - written and communicated - concerned not so much with prevention of crime as with fitting people into an image of life which values hard work, not complaining, not asserting one's rights,'' she said.
Officer Grinkevich said, ''If requiring someone to have steady employment, to bring in a regular income, to support one's family or pay child support, to live up to his responsibilities - if that's considered middle class, then so be it.''
Both Mr. Santos and Mr. Biddulph are making plans for the future. Mr. Biddulph is starting night school this fall, working on a civil engineering degree to further his opportunities in the heating and air-conditioning trade. He and his companion have an infant son, are planning marriage and are hoping to buy a house.
Mr. Santos is headed for night classes at Mercer County Vocational School, hoping in two years to have a welder's certificate. He and his companion and their 8-year-old son also are looking to leave their drug-infested neighborhood behind.
''This program gives you a second chance,'' Mr. Santos said. ''It's tough, but it's fair. I feel like I've gained a little confidence in myself now.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 1989, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a state program that allows sentences mainly outside prison for people convicted of nonviolent crimes misidentified the program. It is the Intensive Supervision Program, not the Intermediate Sentencing Program.

Just Next Door to the Polo Club, Island Homes With Riding Trails

BYLINE: By TODD WOODY

 BODY:
FOR those who prefer their horse near home and hearth, equestrian residential communities have become the latest option in a state that offers planned communities for everyone from baby-boom tennis players to golf-playing retirees.
The developers of one such new community, the Equestrian Club Estates in western Palm Beach County, hope to lure the horse set with 200 homes - 34 villas attached in pairs, 39 detached patio homes and 127 detached single-family homes - surrounded on three sides by riding trails and adjacent to the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club's new $12 million equestrian center. Home to the Winter Equestrian Festival, the center will be host to more than 1,500 horses and their riders in the annual national jumping competition. The next one is in February. 
''There were about 200 acres next to a world-class facility, and it occurred to me that there definitely would be a market for a residential community featuring an equestrian theme,'' said Larry Throneburg, president of Equestrian Club Ltd., the partnership that purchased the land in April from his former employer, the Landmark Land Company.
The key to the future of Equestrian Club Estates is the equestrian center next door. But Jim Corbin, a horseman and manager of the Merrill Lynch Realty office here, said horse-oriented communities in Palm Beach County had not been unqualified successes.
''Mallett Hill was a sleeper for a long time,'' Mr. Corbin said of an equestrian community near Mr. Throneburg's project. ''It didn't really start selling until the equestrian center came along.''
And fewer than half the lots at White Fences, a similar community in western Palm Beach County, have been sold after seven years, other brokers say. Part of the reason, they explained, was legal problems between the developer and its lender that delayed sales for two and a half years.
MR. THRONEBURG is launching his project into a soft South Florida housing market, analysts say. Sales of single-family homes in Palm Beach County declined 4.5 percent in the first half of this year, compared to the first half of last year, said R. Thomas Powers, an economist with the Goodkin Research Corporation in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.
''Palm Beach County is the only market in South Florida experiencing a downturn,'' he said, noting that the market in the rest of the area is relatively flat. ''The county is particularly dependent on the second-home market and when you have a softness in the Northeast market, people are going to think twice about buying a second home down here.'
Landmark sold the tract to Mr. Throneburg and his partnner Denis Quinlan for $5.9 million. Until this year, Mr. Throneburg was Landmark's sales and marketing director for the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club. Mr. Quinlan is a former vice president of contruction and development for the club.
Equestirian Club Estates will consist of six islands set in artificial lakes, with a moat along its perimeter. It will have a clubhouse, four tennis courts and a pool, and riding trails around the community and leading the equestrian center, where resident can board their horses.
The project's first phase - the first homes will be started by the middle of next year, and all are to complete by 1991 - will offer 34 two-unit villas on one island and 39 Mediterranean-style patio homes on another.
The patio homes will be built around a central courtyard and will share common yards. Twenty-six single-family homes will rise on half acre lots on the third island, to complete the first phase.
The remaining islands will be reserved for single-family homes to be built on half-acre to three-acre lots. Although barns will not be permitted, residents will be able to build training rings on the larger lots, Mr. Throneburg said.
He said the single-family home lots will be priced from $140,000 to $175,000 when sales begin in the fall. The town homes will sell for around $240,000 and the patio homes will be priced around $350,000, he said. He added that he expected the single-family homes to range in price from $500,000 to more than $1 million.
The villas and patio homes will be designed by a firm hired by Equestrian Club Ltd. Mr. Throneburg said the company will offer buyers of the single-family lots the choice of six builders. Buyers may choose their own architects for the custom homes. The project is scheduled to be completed in 1994.
Know in the past for horse racing, Florida now increasingly attracts enthusiasts of polo and equestrian events. 'When people used to think of polo, they thought of Beverly Hill,' said Deborah Clark, manager of the Merrill Lynch Realty office in Palm Beach. 'But Prince Charles changed that.'
The polo-playing Prince's visits to South Florida helped popularize equestrian events and have attracted second-home buyers, brokers say.
Mr. Throneburg said that although polo and the Prince of Wales - a photo of Prince Charles is displayed on an office desk - helps popularize a number of horse-related properties, he said the proximity of the new equestrian center will distinguish Equestrian Club Estates from the competition.
The 125-acre equestrian center at the Palm Beach Country and Polo Club features five show rings, including a 160,000-square foot Grand Prix ring with seating for 5,000 spectators, Four rental barns have been built, and plans call for building 12 more barns to house 1,024 horses.
As the equestrian center adds more year-round events like the Arabic Horse Classic scheduled for next spring, Mr. Corbin said, he expects that more people not involved with horses will choose equestrian communities for their year-round homes.
But the popularity of such communities poses some problems for the local government. 'We didn't anticipate so much horse traffic and, of course, there's the manure,' said Ed Lowder, cheif administrator for the Acme Improvement District, which governs Wellington.
Mr. Throneburg said he intended to market Equestrian Club Estates as a year-round residence for full-time equestrians and armchair horse enthusiasts.
'We're offering large lots that should appeal to those who want a permanent home,' he said. 'But I want this to be a place to come home to for those people out on the equestrain circuit, as well as people who just like to look out their window and see horses riding down the lane.'
Mr. Throneburg said he hoped that at least half of his project's owners will be year-round residents, adding that the new equestrian center should guarantee the success of his equestrian community. But brokers with experience in the equestrian market such as Mr. Corbin are cautious.
'Anything in Florida real estate can be dicey,' he said. 'But they're smart guys and there's a market out there to be captured.'

TIANANMEN DIARY
Thirteen Days in June.
By Harrison E. Salisbury.
176 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. Cloth, $18.95. Paper, $10.95.
On June 1, 1989, Harrison E. Salisbury went to Beijing to make a television documentary for Japan's NHK network about the first 40 years of the People's Republic of China. The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for The New York Times, the author of ''The Long March'' and many other books on both China and Russia, stayed at the Beijing Hotel with his television crew. In the last five years Mr. Salisbury had spent almost a third of his time in China, and he knew the country well. But he did not know that from his window in Room 735, overlooking Tiananmen Square, he was about to witness and chronicle one of the most violent and mysterious upheavals in Chinese history. 
''Tiananmen Diary'' is, as its title suggests, written in a day-to-day format, beginning with the author's flight from the United States to Tokyo. On June 2, he arrived in Beijing, where Chinese students were demonstrating and calling for democracy, an end to official corruption and an honest dialogue with their leaders. The students were occupying Tiananmen Square, which, at a hundred acres, is the largest public square in the world. The Government had taken a hard line, proclaiming martial law on May 20. Troops were maneuvering on the outskirts of the city and deeper and deeper into the city itself. From news reports and personal communications, Mr. Salisbury learned that Beijing had been issuing warnings to correspondents, and that several aides to the ousted party secretary Zhao Ziyang, the leading liberal, had been arrested. Optimistic Chinese friends, however, assured him that the army would not kill students.
Mr. Salisbury searched for signs of unrest, but saw none. Instead, he found ''a lot of new planting along the highway, lovely flowers blazing in new beds. No troops hiding in the bushes.'' He saw, as the world did, the Goddess of Freedom, the symbol of liberty that the Chinese students had erected on May 30 in the center of Tiananmen Square. There were soda and Popsicle vendors, creating the atmosphere of ''a small-town summer festival.'' At that point ''there was nothing tense about the mood at Tiananmen as darkness began to thicken; instead, it seemed to me rather a holiday atmosphere. Young people hanging out, aimless sightseeing. Going to Tiananmen is the in thing.''
On June 3, he learned from friends, colleagues and foreign radio broadcasts that armed and unarmed troops had entered Tiananmen during the night. An army truck had accidently hit and killed civilians. Fighting between troops and students had erupted, with tear gas and clubs. Still, Mr. Salisbury was optimistic about the students' camp, with its cluster of olive-drab ''nylon half-moon tents'' neatly placed in horizontal patterns. The next day his admittedly sanguine perspective was shattered when he was awakened at 4 A.M. by heavy gunfire. In almost hourly entries, he records the bloody events of the day: the continuous barrages from automatic weapons, the explosions and screams. On June 5, as the cannonading and machine-gun fire continued, Mr. Salisbury was shocked to hear a foreign radio broadcast announce that the death toll had reached thousands.
For reasons of safety and work, Mr. Salisbury then left Beijing. Although he was frightened, he says, he did not go back to the United States. Instead, for the next eight days he toured provincial cities and towns in China and Hong Kong, filming his television documentary and preserving in his diary the enraged and confused voices of the Chinese people he encountered, while trying to make sense of the Chinese Government's cover-up and propaganda.
In the final section of the book, he offers a complicated analysis of what had taken place and why, noting the impact of the regime's economic problems and corruption. He cites China's ''geriatric leadership'' and 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping's failing physical health, mental decline and mistrust of the students. According to Mr. Salisbury, Mr. Deng thought the students were ''uppity, rambunctious, ungrateful,'' that ''they didn't know their place.'' Having let thousands go abroad to study and work, and having spent more money than any previous Chinese Government had on their education, he felt let down and betrayed. His temper overcame his reason. He believed ''that a plot threatening not only to overthrow the party but also to take his life and those of other leaders was developing under cover of the student protests.''
Mr. Salisbury traces the origin of the events of May and June back to the autumn of 1986 and the vicious campaign that forced Hu Yaobang to resign as party secretary in January 1987. This campaign against ''spiritual pollution'' was designed to combat the Western ideas that Hu had permitted to flourish. The army and the Public Security Administration then began, for the first time, to prepare for riot control. There had been rumors in March and April of 1989 of a possible comeback for Hu. His death on April 15 touched off immediate demonstrations at Beijing and other universities that rapidly evolved into the marches at Tiananmen Square. When the demonstrations escalated, the decision was made on April 26 to use force, but to delay any confrontation until after the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit of May 15-17.
Mr. Salisbury's firsthand account is written in a fast-paced, chaotic and colloquial style, which often feels confused and hastily set down. He interweaves maps, history, rumors, interviews, news reports, descriptions of what he eats for lunch and accounts of phone calls home to his wife in Connecticut. Rushed into print, the book lacks coherence, an overarching synthesis, yet in the end the material is so fascinating and so important that the rush seems justified.
The specific details lend the volume a particular flavor and authority, best shown by Mr. Salisbury's recital of Chinese graffiti. Slogans chalked up on walls included ''Good news: Deng Xiaoping's death is near!'' and ''Against Violence by Fascists!'' Spray-painted on the side of a bus was the slogan ''White Cat, Black Cat, Any Cat Is a Bad Cat!'' - a play on Mr. Deng's famous statement, ''It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white so long as it catches the mouse.'' The author's idiosyncrasies, such as having Chinese friends autograph his old pacemaker and using a 1942 Remington portable typewriter, add to the human side of the story, as do his expressions of guilt: ''My presence may have encouraged them to stay and be mowed down. Was I just a Judas goat? The idea haunts me.''
Mr. Salisbury's political insights and informed theories provide the motivation and historical reference that were missing in the news media's extensive coverage of the Tiananmen Square massacre, while his intense and angry reactions make the events gripping and real. In a story that exemplifies the book's emotional tone, he tells of a young Chinese woman who, a day after the violence in Tiananmen, asked a supporter of democracy, ''What's the news today?'' The man replied, ''The news is that one point one billion hearts are dead.''

HEADLINE: Developer's Monorail Plan Scrutinized

BYLINE: By JEFFREY HOFF

 BODY:
WHEN Gov. Thomas H. Kean proposed a multibillion-dollar transportation system for the Hudson River waterfront in June, state officials acknowledged that the announcement followed months of lobbying by the Hartz Mountain Development Corporation to promote a monorail that would link its projects in the Meadowlands and the waterfront.
While no one questions the need for a comprehensive transportation system along the waterfront, no consensus has emerged among planners and officials on what is the best approach. Notwithstanding, the Hartz plan has raised questions about the feasibility of a monorail system and the role the developer has played in the formulation of the transportation plan.
An improved transportation system for the waterfront area has significant implications for Hudson County and the thousands of New Jerseyans who commute daily into Manhattan.
From 7 to 10 A.M. every workday, 1,000 commuters a minute cross the Hudson River into New York. Planners fear that the 80,000 workers and 50,000 homes in proposed developments along New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront will further tax the area's already overburdened transportation systems. Officials and developers are concerned that the lack of mass transit and highway access to the waterfront will threaten the viability of office complexes needed to improve the area's economy. 
The Governor's proposal, called the Circle of Mobility, is a collection of earlier suggestions by private developers and state agencies to link bus, car and rail transport to ease clogged traffic arteries through Hudson County to Manhattan. Determinations about which of the plan's elements will receive state or Federal funds await the findings of a series of studies to be completed over the next two years.
In addition to engineering and demographic factors, political disagreements remain between the State Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority over which portions of the plan are most important and which should benefit from hundreds of millions of dollars at the authority's disposal.
The monorail proposal promoted by Hartz has won strong support from the authority's chairman and 11 members of Congress. The monorail would run from Hartz properties in the Meadowlands through a new tunnel that Hartz argues should be dug under the Palisades to its properties on the waterfront and south to Hoboken.
Hartz's plan, however, has been coldly received by State Department of Transportation officials who say other elements of the transportation ''circle'' would benefit more commuters at lower costs while the Hartz plan would principally benefit Hartz developments.
The transportation agency wants to use an existing tunnel under the Palisades linking the Meadowlands and the waterfront and operate a light-rail, not a monorail, system. The agency has pushed to establish mass transit in southern Hudson County, Jersey City and Hoboken, where there is more development, than in northern Hudson County, where Hartz has properties. The agency, however, has frustrated developers by showing no results after announcing such plans in 1985.
Because of that frustration, Hartz lobbied state officials to develop a transportation plan and as an incentive proposed a monorail. Officials say the Hartz proposal spurred the Governor to take action. ''I think the Hartz plan was one of the key things that started a lot of creative thinking,'' said Brenda S. Davis, the director of the Governor's Office of Policy and Planning.
Some, like Representative Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of Jersey City, see Hartz's monorail plan as ''visionary.'' Others, like David Phraner, supervising planner for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, caution that monorails have never really worked as a commuting vehicle in any American city.
Detroit is the only American city with a long monorail. The Detroit monorail, which makes a loop in its business district, was never intended as a vehicle for commuting. Still, the $200 million, 2.9-mile system was $65 million over budget and two years late. In support of its proposal, Hartz points to a monorail system, built by a Swiss company, being used in Sydney, Australia.
Hartz officials argue that it would be faster and cheaper to build a monorail because one can run on supports above ground and does not need expensive rights of way and environmental permits. Light-rail advocates say their system can run above ground or on street level, can carry more people and is more flexible because vehicles running on a rail could also run on the street.
Ralph A. Loveys, chairman of the Turnpike Authority, has sought to broaden the authority's mandate beyond highways to mass transit, which would allow his agency to build the tunnel and monorail proposed by Hartz. Mr. Lovey has offered to support the Hartz plan with $500 million initially earmarked for widening of the turnpike in northern New Jersey.
The offer comes as questions have been raised about the authorit's contract with a licensed lobbyist who also works for Hartz.
Dolores T. Prideaux, a member of the Turnpike Authority, voted against the extension of a $40,000 contract to the Marcus Group, a Secaucus public-relations and lobbying concern, at the authority's August meeting. Alan Marcus, the owner of the concern, is one of the state's most active lobbyists, with about 50 private clients.
Ms. Prideaux suggested that the Marcus company's work for the Turnpike Authority as it considered spending millions to aid Hartz was a potential conflict of interest. ''My problem with the Marcus people is that they also represent Hartz Mountain,'' she said.
Mr. Loveys said that Mr. Marcus, as the authority's lobbyist would seek support for legislation that would allow the authority to spend hundreds of millions on the monorail and tunnel desired by Hartz. Mr. Loveys and Mr. Marcus said that Mr. Marcus was not in a decision-making role in the authority and thus no conflict of interest existed.
Mr. Marcus strongly supports the monorail plan and said he had promoted it to the members and staff of the authority. But he said he stayed out of negotations over the Circle of Mobility plan.
Mr. Lovey added that while he had liked the idea of a monorail after hearing the proposal from Gene Heller, the Hartz president, he would not make a final decision on supporting it until further studies were completed.
The authority's bond counsel, Hawkins, Delafield & Wood, a Manhattan law firm, however, has cautioned that the authority may not be able to spend $2 billion originally earmarked for turnpike widening on the mass transit plan even with new legislation. Availability of those funds is crucial to the progress of any plan because other state agencies do not have money available and Federal support is low.
 
Allied Junction Plan Backed
Mr. Lovey is also supporting plans to build a new turnpike exit in southern Secaucus to link a proposed commuter rail station where four train lines would be brought together, easing traffic to the Jersey City and Hoboken waterfronts as well as Manhattan.
Yet that plan, known as the Allied Junction Transfer Station, which is being backed by a contribution of $100 million from another private developer, the Allied Junction Corporation has been given far less attention by Mr. Loveys and local members of Congress. Mr. Lovey said the Allied Junction plan, which could include a rail link to the Meadowlands sports complex, would cost some $190 million for a new turnpike exit and another $110 million for road links to Jersey City. It has not been determined where $200 million for track improvements will come from.
The Turnpike Authority is prepared to spend $750 million to $800 million on the Circle of Mobility effort to speed traffic into Manhattan and the Hudson waterfront, Mr. Loveys said.
Mr. Heller has retreated from initial reports that Hartz would absorb up to $100 million in expenses for the monorail and tunnel above the first $150 million from state sources. Mr. Heller now says Hartz would contribute land, services and cash worth about $10 million for a monorail system that may run beyond Hartz property in Secaucus west to the sports complex and south from Hartz property in Weehawken to Hoboken. The tunnel Hartz proposes would run under the Palisades, linking the Meadowlands to Weehawken or West New York.
 
'120 Reporters Listening'
 
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Englewood, and Representative Guarini both support the Hartz plan. They said their interest was piqued after Hartz offered to build a baseball stadium in the Meadowlands. At a widely covered news conference last spring, Hartz officials pointed out that a tunnel would be needed under the Palisades to get people to the stadium from the Hudson River waterfront.
Mr. Torricelli now says he believes that Hartz never really wanted a baseball stadium but wanted to draw attention to the transportation plan.
Mr. Heller acknowledged that the ''stadium idea came about because we were talking about transportation,'' adding, ''All of a sudden we had 120 reporters listening.''
Both Representatives Guarini and Torricelli sent letters to the Governor seeking his support for the Hartz plan in June before Mr. Kean and Mr. Lovey announced the Circle of Mobility plan. Nine other members of Congress from the state signed Mr. Guarini's letter.
Mr. Guarini sent another letter to the Governor in July, again pushing the monorail concept, but received a heated response. In an Aug. 9 letter, Mr. Kean cautioned Mr. Guarini that ''Hartz Mountain has never prepared a complete written proposal for the construction or financing of this project.''
 
Light-Rail Plan Criticized
Moreover, Mr. Kean said that in a meeting with officials of the Transportation Department ''Hartz expressed reluctance to pursue the monorail proposal in favor of maximizing automobile access to their property on the waterfront.''
The Governor concluded: ''It is wholly inappropriate to describe the Hartz idea as the Hartz/Turnpike plan for the northern waterfront. Neither the engineering nor the funding is in place for their proposal.''
Criticizing Mr. Kean for not moving more quickly on plans to improve transportation along the waterfront, Mr. Torricelli has also dismissed the light-rail plan first announced by Mr. Kean in 1985 as too expensive.
Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Heller say that a light-rail system may be able to carry more people than a monorail, but that a monorail could be built more quickly.
''I don't have to worry about the year 2030 I am worried about 1990,'' Mr. Heller said. ''If the Circle of Mobility gets a light rail done in 1996, wonderful. Just attach it to the monorail.''

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: THOMAS A. AQUILA;
'Education Is a People-Intensive Business'

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THOMAS A. AQUILA has been a member of the State Board of Governors for Higher Education since 1983 and this year he became its chairman. The board oversees a $433 million budget and it licenses and approves all academic programs at the public and private colleges and universities in the state. It also administers student financial aid programs.
Dr. Aquila, a resident of Weston, was schools superintendent in Weston from 1961 to until his retirement in 1982. He has been president of the Connecticut Association of School Administrators and now runs Educational Counseling Associates in Westport. Through the counseling service, he interviews students and recommends colleges based on their needs, interests and personalities. He also helps students file their college applications.
In an interview at his office in Westport, Dr. Aquila talked about the state's higher education system. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:
Q. About two-thirds of Connecticut's high school graduates go on to college. Are you satisfied with that? 
A. Yes, but I think what has concern for me is the large percentage of Connecticut kids who don't go to our educational facilities. About 66 percent of our kids go on to college, but of them 45 percent go out of state. That's quite a brain drain.
If you go after the reason, you hear that kids want to really get away from home. I think that's a little bit of a cop out. I'm not at all sure that the average Connecticut resident holds his state university system in as high in esteem as some residents of other states hold their university system.
It would be very interesting to find out what the attitudes are now and what the attitudes will be five years from now. Because of the low tuition rates, more and more families who would have normally gone out of state are now saying, ''What's wrong with UConn?'' We have a commitment to turn our university system into one of the top 15 or 20 in the nation by the year 2000.
Q. How are you going to do that, given your budget problems?
A. We're very concerned about that. Last year our budget went up about two-tenths of a percent, which didn't even keep up with inflation. The six years before that we spent catching up on maintenance and equipment and the book situation; we had generous budget allotments. Last year it hurt, and I expect it's going to hurt even more this coming year. We asked for a 6.5 percent increase, and got a two-tenths of a percent increase, whereas elementary-secondary education got pretty close to 20 percent. We have to have a higher priority than we have at the moment.
Q. How well has your minority-enrollment program worked?
A. That's one thing we can take considerable pride in. More minority students are taking advantage of the educational system. Since 1980, the minority enrollment surged to 17,000 students, up 38 percent. In addition, more minority students are earning degrees. The number of minority student graduates is up 36 percent.
Q. Why is racism on the rise on campuses?
A. I think it's a cyclical thing. I think you maybe see some concern, some envy, by the nonminority student saying: ''Well, they're getting admission breaks. They're getting tuition breaks. And my brother or sister can't make it.'' Their education has been limited in seeing there is an obligation, and it's not too surprising. Here we have the minorities living in our four largest cities primarily, not in the suburbs, yet when it comes time for college, we mix them up on our campuses. They've never learned to live together; suddenly, differences are obvious.
Q. What can schools do about it?
A. Just wringing our hands or being punitive is not enough. Education is the key. The earlier it starts in our lives, the better. What we're trying to do on the university campuses is to set parameters to show we won't tolerate it. By beginning there and by trying to bring right into the curriculum what this is all about, we will make progress.
Q. With 23 public and 25 private colleges and universities in the state, does Connecticut have too many institutions of higher learning?
A. In my judgment the answer would be an unqualified no, but I would say it's close. What we have to keep in mind is that most of the colleges are placed where they are for geographic representation. The enrollment is high at all of them, except at one private institution, the University of Bridgeport, with 10,000 seats and 5,000 kids. I certainly wouldn't be recommending we add any more universities. We don't need them, but what we do have seems to be functioning well, at least until you get to the technical colleges, where the enrollment is down.
Q. Enrollment decline was one of the reasons for merging the technical and community colleges. How is that working out?
A. We have now a single board of trustees. That group has met once, and there's a single-mindedness to strengthen technical education in this state. That's going to mean more funding for the system. And with the merger we have reduced the size of the central office, which was getting to be huge.
But underlying it all, we have to persuade families that it's O.K. for their children to get a technical education, that it's not only rewarding financially, but that it may be the way to go. You have to get into the high schools and inform the guidance counselors so they see this as a viable alternative.
Q. One question on parents' minds is why have college costs risen so much and how long can it go on? M
A. What we have to remember is that education is a people-intensive business: nearly 75 to 80 percent of its costs are salaries, and you can't ask those people to live on a lower standard of living than the rest of the nation or you lose them. So as a consequence, costs go up. And what we have is tuition moving ahead of inflation because it didn't for a number of years.
I have no clear vision how we're going to stop it. I see for the short term it will continue, almost at its current rate, although I see a decreasing incline. I think we have to look at our marketing a little harder to find ways to improve our revenues.
For instance, business spends almost as much as higher education does in training their own people, simply because many of the colleges are not responsive to their needs. It would be wonderful if we could find ways to tap part of that, to do the job for them.
Q. A couple of public schools have made it a requirement for undergraduates to volunteer for community service. Do you predict an expansion of that?
A. There is much to gain by having students realize as early as possible in life that it's not all ''what can I get?'' It's that ''I owe, and what can I give?'' And from that, everyone gains.
I think volunteerism is becoming a major plank in our lives. That's something the world has always admired about this country, and it's a more positive direction than I've seen over the last 10 or 15 years, when the drive was ''I'm out to get what I can and what I give in return may be a little bit to get the tax write-off.''
Q. For a long time college presidents moved up through the academic ranks, but now, a lot of schools are picking business leaders. What should the background of a college president be?
A. You should have a heavy concentration in the academics, be a scholar in some discipline. She would have published in her field. The individual would have vision, high energy, be people-oriented with superb communication skills, be practiced in collegiate management, which is far different from trying to manage a business. Someone who understands fund-raising and economic management theory. Someone who can work effectively with a very diverse constituency: trustees, alumni, faculty, students.
Given what's happening on a college campus, an individual with corporate training only is not enough. If the college is in financial trouble, there's a tendancy to want to go for a business type. Dartmouth did it. Trinity did it. Wesleyan did it. After that cycle's over and people have had it up to here with business management, they want the academic type. So they get the academic type, who is not raising enough money. It's cyclical. But the college president, unlike the corporate executive, has no real power. Whatever he gets done, he gets done by persuasion.
Q. A common complaint among public college presidents is it is hard to foster the kind of identification with alumni that the private colleges get, especially when it comes to fund-raising. Why is that?
A. The alumni I talk with have pride in their school, but there's a loose connection. They're not involved in any of the planning, any of the programs. Some may do some loose recruiting, if it's sports. They don't necessarily put any influence on their children to attend their school. But they do contribute. Not as much as you would find or expect to find at the private schools.
There's not a long, rich tradition yet within our public institutions. I would say, however, that the trend that I see - now that there is a major effort on the part of the public universities in new marketing techniques, actually having people in charge of development - is that their contribution rate is moving upward. The pride will increase.
At a great university, the loyalty is to what that school has done for me as a person, and as we get a larger and larger movement and we begin to really believe that school has done that for me and that I didn't get it in spite of, I think you will see the connection. At the moment it's loose, but it is better now than it ever was.
Q. If you could give one message to the students coming in as freshmen this month, what would it be?
A. I would advise them to leave their self-centeredness behind and to reach out and be of service to anyone in need. I would ask that they dream and accept no limits.

HEADLINE: Where Addiction Is the Subject Matter

BYLINE: By SHARON L. BASS

 BODY:
IT carries titles like ''Fat Is a Family Affair,'' ''Is It Love or Is It Addiction?'' and ''If Only I Could Quit.'' And in less than a year, the Meridian Shoppe in Stamford, a bookstore that specializes in literature on addiction and recovery, has already turned a profit, its organizers say.
Most likely, they agree, it is because it is the only one in the state and one of just a few in the country. 
''When I learned there were 6,000 publications that come out every year which deal with addictions, the number just jumped out at me,'' said Manuel P. Fonseca, the executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council in Stamford. The Meridian Shoppe, which opened last December, is a program of the council.
Typically, bookstores stock 6 to 10 titles that deal with addiction, said Joyce Hall, the manager of the shop, which has more than 300 books displayed by category in glass and wood cases. The shop is at 159 Colonial Road, in the same building as the council's outpatient rehabilitation program.
Mr. Fonseca said the store was conceived to raise money for the council's residential halfway house for recovering alcoholics, called the Meridian House. In addition to the halfway house and the outpatient center, the council also runs a community drug and alcohol prevention program.
 
Funds for Halfway Houses
''Halfway houses are economic nightmares,'' Mr. Fonseca said. Meridian House, he said, operates on a $350,000 annual budget, and much of its funds come from United Way campaigns in the area and the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council. He said he hoped the bookstore would supply the halfway house with 10 percent to 20 percent of its budget.
The books are geared to people with addictions to alcohol, drugs, sex and love, overeating, smoking and gambling. Ms. Hall said most customers previously ordered books through the mail or went to a bookstore out of state. Books on healing and meditation are also in stock.
Dena L. Anderson, a resident of New York City, was shopping at the store during her second visit there one recent afternoon. ''When I first came in, I loved it,'' she said. ''The literature keeps the recovery going. I spent $80 during my first trip here.''
In addition to books, the store keeps a modest selection of T-shirts, sweatshirts, license plate frames that say ''One Day at a Time,'' jewelry, bumper stickers that say, ''Honk! If You're a Friend of Bill W.'' (Bill W. was one of the founding members of Alcoholics Anonymous), and one slightly controversial item: cigarette lighters. ''They say to concentrate on one addiction at a time,'' Ms. Hall said.
While most books focus on addictive behavior, others deal with emotional healing and healthful living. There is an assortment of meditation books, a different one for nearly every type of addiction.
Ms. Hall, who used to be a night manager at the Meridian House, set up the bookstore. A recovering addict herself, she said she finds the store and the interactions with the customers to be healing.
Although the store draws people with addictions, many of whom are involved in the council's recovery program based on Alcoholics Anonymous, Ms. Hall said she does not find the atmosphere depressing or discouraging. To the contrary, she said, ''most of the people who come into the shop are looking for help and to make their lives better.''

HEADLINE: Farms, Food and Chemicals: Seeds of a Revolt

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept 10

 BODY:
Although the transition to natural cultivation has begun in several regions, the National Academy of Sciences' proposal to shift most of American agriculture from a heavy dependence on synthetic chemicals would take decades and require profound changes in attitudes and public policy,farmers and agricultural experts say.
The transformation, if it occurs in both farming techniques and agricultural policies, could also mean regional shifts in crop and livestock production in the United States.
For instance, Florida, which supplies half of all vegetables eaten in the United States in the winter, could be forced to grow crops less vulnerable to insects and diseases unless new pest control methods are developed.
And the intensive cultivation of irrigated corn on the delicate, erosion-prone soils of western Nebraska might be replaced by the growing of dry land wheat if Congress eliminates tax and crop subsidies that promote the use and development of irrigation systems, the experts say.
Jim Hightower, Commissioner of Agriculture in Texas, is a strong proponent of natural farming and says its time has come. ''What we've had here, and what we found elsewhere, is that farmers doing this kind of agriculture make money,'' he said. ''They pay off their notes; they pay for tractors and they do it without crop subsidies. There is a conversion coming.'' At Mr. Hightower's urging, Texas has established programs to help farmers practice organic farming and use techniques relying on fewer chemicals. 
Congress, which has historically considered natural farm practices to be whimsical and incapable of satisfying the food demands of the nation and export customers, also appears inclined to consider changes in farm policies that have encouraged farmers to rely on fertilizers and pesticides.
Lawmakers face pressures for a shift, ranging from the cost of farm programs - more than $136 billion since 1980 - to consumer concerns about pesticides in their food and pollution caused by agricultural chemicals to chronic food surpluses throughout most of the decade.
''I would hope that our colleagues will pay attention to some of these issues,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. ''Everybody is aware that we have to make some changes. It can't be business as usual as we go into the next century.''
''We have the responsibility to give these ideas a fair assessment and we haven't done that yet,'' said Representative Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas who is an influential member of the House Agriculture Committee. ''Our responsiblity is to get the facts out and say, 'Look, we have the studies and this is worth a try.' ''
But there remain strong concerns in the agricultural community about natural farming. One concern is that the quantity and quality of food could be sharply reduced; another is that the cost of food could rise. Even supporters of natural farming concede this last fear could turn out to be accurate.
 
Step Toward Mainstream
Farm practices that use fewer chemicals took a step toward the mainstream of American agriculture last week when the National Academy of Sciences issued a report concluding that carefully managed farms growing diverse crops with little or no chemicals are as productive and often more profitable than those using pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.
In a lengthy study, the nation's pre-eminent scientific body urged changes in Federal policy and in research to encourage farmers to switch to natural farming techniques.
''Alternative farming practices hold promise for many other farmers and potentially significant benefits for the nation,'' the report said. ''How fast and how far this transformation of U.S. agriculture will go depends on economic opportunities and incentives, which are shaped by farm policies, market forces, research priorities and the importance society places on achieving environmental goals.''
 
Use of Biological Controls
Natural farm practices involve an array of techniques that use natural biological controls to do the same things chemicals do now.
For instance, instead of planting corn on a flat field, some farmers in the upper Middle West grow their corn in beds six to eight inches above the field, allowing mechanical cultivators to get to the ground around the plants to control weeds.
In Massachusetts, the State Agriculture Department has helped farmers learn techniques to reduce pesticide applications. And apple farmers have begun to control coddling moths, a voracious pest, with one application of diluted insecticide at the crucial moment when the insects are most vulnerable instead of 5 to 10 applications at predetermined times as was the common practice in New England until recently.
In California, the nation's largest agricultural producer, the transition to natural cultivation practices, especially in the fruit and vegetable industries, has been moving swiftly. Some of California's largest farms began to grow crops this year without any synthetic pesticides, joining hundreds of smaller growers. In the Salinas Valley, Tanimura and Antle, the nation's second largest lettuce grower, developed new vaccuum equipment to suck insects from the plants instead of killing them with toxic sprays.
 
Skepticism in Midwest
Fruit growers are using wasps and other beneficial insects to kill destructive ones. Across California, farmers are counting bugs in the field and spraying insecticides only when insect populations reach threatening levels.
''Given intelligent farming practices and given proper information, yes, in fact, we can greatly lower our reliance on pesticides,'' said Dr. Steven S. Balling, manager of entomology and pesticide control for Del Monte Foods, USA.
Grain growers in the Middle West and Great Plains are more skeptical. Over the last four decades, Grain Belt farmers were encouraged by researchers and policy makers to change from diverse small farms that also raised livestock into large, specialized farms that grow the same two or three crops year after year. Such farming would not be feasible without expensive equipment, generous amounts of fertilizers to boost yields and pesticides to protect the enormous harvests.
More than half the 430 million pounds of pesticides used each year on the United States cropland is applied on corn, wheat and soybeans in the Grain Belt, the Academy of Sciences study found.
Many grain farmers see a shift from industrialized practices to systems that use crop rotations and other natural farm methods as a step backward to an era when the work was more backbreaking and the profits not nearly as substantial.
 
'I'd Go Broke'
''What they're talking about is doing what we did in the 1950's with the cover crops and animals and spreading manure,'' said John K. Pellet, who farms 750 acres of corn, wheat and soybeans in Maryland Heights, Mo., 25 miles west of St. Louis. ''But if I did it now I'd go broke. My yields weren't near what they are today. My neighbors would outproduce me. We need the fertilizers and the herbicides very bad. I know what happens out here if we don't use them. The yields won't be the 150 bushels an acre I'm used to, and the weeds will be so thick out there you can't see the corn.''
Yet the Academy of Sciences argued in its report that switching to systems that involve planting more crops in rotation to build the soil's fertility and reduce pest pressures could yield the same size harvests while reducing operating costs.
One of the 14 farms studied by the Academy was Glen and Rex Spray's 720-acre farm in Knox County, Ohio.
Without using commercial fertilizers or chemicals since 1971, the Sprays had built their farm into one of the largest and most profitable in the region, the Academy said. The Sprays raise corn, soybeans, wheat and oats, along with red clover, white clover, blue grass and other pasture and cover crops. Their beef and dairy herd supplied manure, which was spread on 100 acres each year. Yields for corn and soybeans were substantially above the county average, and the cost of production was less, the Academy said.
 
More Research Urged
In the report, the Academy urged Congress and the Agriculture Department to play a more decisve role in encouraging the transition to natural practices. The report said the Agriculture Department should increase financing for research on natural farm methods from $4.45 million in 1990, to $40 million.
Dr. Charles E. Hess, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Science and Education, said the Bush Administration was preparing to ask Congress to increase the department's overall research budget from $1.2 billion annually to $1.7 billion to provide more money for research on natural farm practices and other scientific studies.
In the meantime, the study's authors urged Congress to enact changes in farm policies that now discourage farmers from trying the new techniques. Farmers participating in subsidy programs for grains, soybeans and cotton are now encouraged to maximize their yields to gain maximum benefits from the Government. The policy of paying higher prices encourages overuse of fertilizer and pesticides and chronic surpluses because producers strive for maximum yield for each acre instead of maxmimum return in the marketplace, the Academy said. The farm policy also discourages diversification into other crops not covered by the Government's farm program, the Academy said.

HEADLINE: Arkansas Spa Pushes Quest For Retirees

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Ark., Sept. 10

 BODY:
Hot Springs has an army of people who love to boast about mineral springs, pure air and cheap living in the Ouachita Mountains.
When a prospective settler calls the city-run Retiree Recruitment Office, the coordinator, Gail Ezelle, unleashes a force of 150 silver-haired volunteers whose bubbly enthusiasm matches this resort's hot spring water.
Dapper in matching blue blazers, breast pockets adorned with their names and the city logo, the volunteers court potential new neighbors with information about health care, expenses and recreation.
They escort guests up the 216-foot Hot Springs Mountain Tower for a panoramic view, then head downtown for a look at Bathhouse Row, which has been restored. The tour may end with a meal or a sunset cruise aboard a party barge on Lake Hamilton. 
 
Economic Effect on Community
The personal approaches have been potent. The Retiree Recruitment Office has handled more than 6,500 inquiries since it started advertising nationally last summer; it takes credit for 75 moves.
Part of its success stems from a 1987 Rand-McNally study listing Hot Springs as the nation's third most desirable retirement spot after the areas of Murray-Kentucky Lake in Kentucky and Clayton-Clarksville in Georgia.
To Mrs. Ezelle, 55 years old, who moved here from Texas, recruiting the retired is just like recruiting an industry. ''They have such a tremendous economic impact on the community, and they give us expertise and enthusiasm,'' she said.
But they do not bring some of industry's pollution, clogged highways and fluctuating work forces. The retired people arrive with average assets of $215,000 and average annual incomes of $33,000 a year, along with taxes and spare time to devote to community activities.
 
It's an Arkansas Tradition
Mrs. Ezelle praises her volunteers, who buy their own jackets, pay for their own gasoline and provide any extras like lake cruises or meals. The coordinator offers a toll-free telephone line and complimentary passes to the mountain tower.
Hot Springs is innovating on aggressive recruiting of retired people by applying the concept to an existing city rather of a carefully planned development for the elderly, said Charles F. Longino Jr., an expert on aging.
''Arkansas has been a nice place for people to retire for a long time, so they have a tradition up there,'' said Mr. Longino, who is the associate director of the Center for Adult Development and Aging at the University of Miami. ''But the difference with Hot Springs is they are really going after the retirees, instead of letting the retirees come to them. States have to kind of compete for retirees.
 
The Commuting Got Too Long
''They bring expendable income and lots of advantages. And older people rarely move someplace where they don't know anybody.''
Dick and Marge Bingham moved to Hot Springs in 1987 from Covina, Calif., their home for more than three decades. Mr. Bingham, who is 57, said he knew it was time to retire when he found his daily commutation to a securities office stretch from its average of 28 minutes to one and a half hours.
The Binghams were familiar with Arkansas because their daughter and grandchildren live in Mena, on the state's western edge. A deal on a lake house cemented their the decision. Once Mr. Bingham had lost his tensions after three months of relaxation, he decided to tell others about Hot Springs.
 
Everybody Knows Everybody
Marge Bingham, who is 52, says she was floored by friendliness. ''Out in California, it was so huge and impersonal,'' she said.
''We maybe knew our neighbors across the street and on either side of us. But here, we've already got 50 to 100 close friends, and 500 speaking acquaintances. I love it.''
Mr. Bingham says he likes to end a recruiting session by inviting guests onto his party barge, which is docked a few yards behind his home on Lake Hamilton. He doffs his blazer, takes the controls and steers the barge toward the setting sun.
His wife waves to a passing dinner cruise boat. Two dozen strangers wave back. ''See what I mean?'' she said. ''Everybody's friendly. Heck, in California, if a guy raises his hand like that, he may have a gun in it.''
The office generally refrains from criticizing other states, but it proudly displays a map shading in blue the states generating the most inquiries this year. In descending order, they are California (400 calls); Illinois (314); New York (291); Texas (265); and Florida (221).

HEADLINE: Medicaid Rationing Will Cost More in the End

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposal of New York State to limit the number of physician visits by Medicaid recipients (news story, Aug. 17) is yet another quick fix for a complex problem. Certainly, medical costs of all sorts are soaring, and certainly there are people who visit doctors needlessly. It is even possible that some of these unnecessary visits would not be made if patients were forced to pay out of their own pockets. 
Limiting the number of doctor visits is not, however, economical. People who are cautious (and I would wager that the majority of Medicaid recipients are) would ration their visits against a real crisis, thus neglecting ailments that, promptly treated, could be remedied easily and economically. Fearing to use up their allowed visits, they would, in the long run, cost the system more when those ailments reached an acute stage.
And those who cannot see beyond the immediate and save visits for the rainy day will continue to use the system as at present, knowing that in a real crisis they cannot be turned away from the emergency room. There would be no savings on them either. Of course, hospital emergency rooms might end up swallowing those costs, but that is merely a bookkeeping shift.
The blithe assertion by a spokesman for New York's Social Services Department that in real need, ''it's simply doubtful in most cases that we would overrule a doctor's decision,'' is not persuasive to someone who has seen a private health insurance carrier overrule two competent neurologists to avoid paying a legitimate claim for brain surgery. When people plan social policy that looks good on paper, they may comfort themselves with the thought that ''in most cases'' no one will be hurt. How much pain, injury and human cost is encompassed in the exclusions?
While we must, as a society, find ways to provide health care to everyone without bankrupting ourselves in the process, we must avoid solutions that are neither cost-effective nor workable. Until we find a reasonable solution, it seems to me, we are better off staying with the imperfect system we have.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Doesn't Need Fixing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One of the reforms Marriner Eccles achieved in the 1935 Bank Act was to remove the Administration from direct involvement in the central bank. He did this by removing the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the Treasury from the Federal Reserve Board. Eccles believed that the automatic majority of the seven governors (all political appointees) in the Open Market Committee, together with the President's right to appoint his own chairman, constituted sufficient politicization of the system. 
Representative Lee H. Hamilton's scheme to readmit the Administration by putting the Treasury Secretary back on the Federal Reserve Board (front page, Aug. 24) has less than nothing to recommend it. We have developed the childish custom of blaming the Fed chairman for economic slowdowns and crediting the reigning President for ensuing upturns. This curious rite has been accepted by the news media and, apparently, by the electorate.
The Federal Reserve System is one of the regulatory agencies that has survived the last decade without corruption, political or financial. The board does its job with few public defenders. It must accept in silence obloquy heaped upon it by self-serving politicians.
Even so, monetary policy has been managed with admirable objectivity and without overt guile. There are few enough Federal agencies with such a record of service. Our governments since the 1960's have reduced fiscal policy to annual deficit targets and the comedy of agonizing over the (ever-increasing) debt limit.
No public purpose can be served by immersing our best Federal agency in this morass. The Treasury interest will always be easier terms (lower interest rates) to finance future deficits. This should not be made easier, but Mr. Hamilton's proposal would assure just that.

HEADLINE: Five Reasons to Transform 42d Street

 BODY:
A giant cylindrical sign, 27 stories high, gyrates on one corner. The Great White Way dazzles with the brilliance of 20,000 new bulbs. Late-night strollers wander through concourses of shops and food stands.
That's what Times Square could look like and it's no pipe dream. The developer George Klein and the architect John Burgee have now offered their revised plan for the transformation of 42d Street's most squalid and dangerous block. 
The plan, once sensible but lifeless, is now imbued with a vitality that answers any lingering doubts. The design can still be improved, but it shows how staid office structures can become, at night, colorful backdrops for the city's prime entertainment district.
The 42d Street plan has already won unanimous support from the Board of Estimate and survived 41 court challenges. There are five powerful reasons for it to move forward, as soon as the 42d challenge is heard and appeals are concluded: (1) To disinfect the dangerous Deuce; (2) to reclaim nine magnificent old theaters; (3) to produce millions in new city revenue; (4) to rehabilitate the seedy, sprawling Times Square subway stations; (5) to conquer, finally, the sour obstructionism that has come so often to strangle visions and to stifle growth.
The first reason is the most important. ''The Deuce'' is police slang for one of America's most dangerous blocks, 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. It was the scene of 2,246 reported crimes in 1988, of which 462 were murders, rapes, robberies and assaults. Another 468 felonies were committed in the subway passages.
Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch agreed long ago on an Urban Development Corporation plan for restoring the street's grand old theaters, now decaying movie houses whose sex and violence films mirror what goes on outside. Even so, no plan for restoring the block would have won Board of Estimate approval if the city had to pay. The 42d Street plan it approved not only spares the city any expense; it would bring in extensive revenue.
The idea is to consolidate the rights for potential high-rise buildings on the theater sites and concentrate development in four office towers in Times Square. In return, the developer must pay to rebuild two of the nine legitimate theaters and purchase six others. The city will receive more taxes from the finished office buildings alone than it now collects from the whole area. And the developer will pay more than half the $120 million cost of rebuilding the vast subway station.
Critics raise one objection after another. Some charge that the office buildings would deaden the theatrical district. That's hard to understand because there have been office buildings in the theater district for years. Theaters and office buildings require convenient transit, but at different hours; the combination seems desirable.
A more common objection is bulk and density. The new plan improves notably on the four gray towers previously proposed but even it includes a truly formidable hulk on the northeast site - which might still be moderated in size and appearance. In any case, any alternative will need to meet the plan's basic economic need: office floors large enough to attract tenants and to generate enough income to subsidize the public benefits.
Other critics claim that, as West Side development flowers, the block would be redone without government condemnation. Yet not one investor has sought to assemble the whole site, nor could any single developer make a move on one part of 42d Street without knowing the adjacent dilapidation and crime would be removed.
Litigation and criticism have brought improvements, like the enlivened new plan. Even it may serve merely as the beginning of further imaginative detailing. But the plan is sound. After eight years, the courts can be rightly impatient with arguments that could have been advanced long ago. It's time to proceed in Times Square.

HEADLINE: Judges Anguish Over Medical Issues

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RENO, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Saying they increasingly face anguishing decisions about medical cases, judges debated this weekend whether the courtroom is the place to resolve them.
''I don't think anyone here would ever say we enjoy this sort of decision,'' said Judge Gladys Kessler of the District of Columbia Superior Court, who was an organizer of the conference.
More than 90 judges from 47 states attended the meeting, and many said they were haunted by the prospect of a late-night phone call that, for medical reasons, required an immediate decision on highly complex legal issues.
Indeed the judges repeatedly asked themselves if they were being confronted with issues that courts were unequipped to resolve. Many complained that state legislatures were passing their responsibilities to make difficult choices in the biomedical area to the courts. 
 
Urged to Refuse Arbiter's Role
Alexander Morgan Capron, a professor of law at the University of Southern California, said in a keynote talk Thursday that a judge should refuse the role of society's ''bioethical arbiter'' or ''physician surrogate.''
Mr. Capron, who directed a Presidential commission on ethical problems in medicine, praised the courts for returning to patients the power to make decisions and warned that society could push the courts to take back those powers.
But Justice Stewart G. Pollock of the New Jersey Supreme Court said that judicial initiatives were frequently needed to stir debate and to open the way for legislative action.
Robert L. Schwartz, a law professor at the University of New Mexico, said, ''I've been distressed by suggestions that you should be timid. Social policy is made in large part through the common law.''
Also defending ''judge-made law'' as inevitable and useful, Justice Linda K. Neuman of the Iowa Supreme Court said, ''You don't have to be an activist judge to be concerned with social policy; it comes with the territory.''
While Mr. Schwartz encouraged judges to take an active role, he concluded they would find legal fields like constitutional law, criminal law, property law or family law inadequate for handling the fundamental problems raised by biomedical developments, as well as contradictory.
 
Conflicting Legal Approaches
Frequent groping among these legal approaches marked the judges' discussions. The judges were told of disputes like the Baby M case in New Jersey pitting a biological mother against the couple who had paid her to be artificially inseminated and bear a child for them and the case involving the conflicting claims of a divorced couple in Tennessee about control over previously frozen embryos. While some judges favored turning to contract law or property law for those cases, others argued that family law, custody principles and adoption practices were more appropriate.
Judges here considered those cases as well as hypothetical ones, including who should decide if a comatose woman should be disconnected from a respirator keeping her alive and whether a pregnant teen-ager who abuses drugs should be put in jail to protect her fetus.
Many judges acknowledged that their choices of legal approaches were guided by their initial intuitions of what outcomes they would consider just. But one judge, Addeliar D. Guy 3d of Nevada Circuit Court, provoked a sharp rection when he said during a heated debate on the withdrawal of life support systems from a permanently comatose woman was a foregone conclusion. ''The problem is not what to do with her but to find some way to do it and make it look good,'' he said.
Judge George L. Stigler of the District Court in Waterloo, Iowa, said a judge like him could not ignore that rural hospitals were being sentenced to bankruptcy ''if you allow individuals like this to languish.''
But for Judge Janine P. Geske, a Circuit Court judge in Wisconsin, such economic considerations were ''totally inappropriate'' in a specific case about suspending medical treatment.
 
Questions Involving Pregnancy
An equally sharp debate came when the judges discussed restraint or punishment of women whose behavior during pregnancy is likely to harm their fetuses.
All participants agreed that education and access to prenatal care ought to play the chief role in preventing harm to children before birth. But John A. Robertson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, compared extreme cases of harmful behavior by pregnant women to parental abuse of children already born and said parents should be held legally responsible in both cases.
Other participants objected that efforts to control the behavior of pregnant women legally rather than by persuasion threatened their right to control their own bodies.
Patricia King of the Georgetown University Law Center said courts would use sanctions more readily for poor women or those with criminal records , ''and we will talk next about their right to be parents at all'' and confront proposals for forced sterilization.
The conference was held at the National Judicial College on the campus of the University of Nevada at Reno and ran from Thursday through today. The college provides training for many of the country's trial court judges. The chief justice of each state was invited to send two judges to the conference, where they were joined by other court officials and representatives of major legal and medical organizations.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Reaction to China Reopens Old Battle

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
China has disappeared for the moment from the headlines and the newscasts, to be replaced by Poland and South Africa and Colombia, but the constriction of freedom in China continues, by all accounts, and so does the argument here about how the United States should respond.
''There is no clear road map as we feel our way through an ambiguous passage,'' writes Winston Lord, the former United States Ambassador to China, in the current issue of Foreign Affairs quarterly. ''We cannot practice business as usual; nor do we wish to destroy all the structures in place. We do not seek to hurt the Chinese people, but we also do not want to hand the leaders photo opportunities depicting normalcy.'' 
Both sides in the argument - to oversimplfy, the White House and Congress - agree with that. What they disagree on is what measures the United States should take to express its outrage at the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in June and what the Government has done since then, most recently in purging the culture minister, Wang Meng.
''The situation has been steadily worsening, with the hard-liners consolidating their power,'' said one of the Bush Administration's top China analysts. ''We don't question that. But China is difficult to deal with in the best of circumstances, and now more than ever, the executive branch requires the maximum latitude to make the relationship work.''
In other words, Congress should lay off and leave such delicate and important work to the professionals.
When President Bush visited China earlier this year, one of the senior aides who traveled with him recalled last week, Deng Xiaoping lectured his guests on his country's history for more than an hour. The main point being made by China's senior leader was that China had only two permanent adversaries, the Soviet Union because it occupied territory that China claimed, and Japan because it killed millions of Chinese in World War II.
The President drew two lessons, the adviser said: that the Chinese harbor grudges for a long time, that the United States must take care not to become the third country on the list, as it once was.
Thus the Administration is considering softening its opposition to Chinese membership in GATT, the organization that manages world trade, and it still hopes to soften or eliminate the sanctions against China voted by Congress this summer despite their relative mildness.
The House approved the sanctions 418-0, and the Senate followed with only a slightly less decisive margin. The two packages are attached to different bills and they contain some differences that will have to be taken up by conference committees.
''We would prefer nothing,'' said a White House strategist, ''but being realistic, it's obvious that Congress wants to express its disapproval. So we'll push as hard as we can for the greatest possible Presidential latitude. The House bill, for instance, bans some of our programs indefinitely and the Senate bill bans them for only six months. Obviously we prefer the Senate version.''
It is an old fight, this struggle for control of foreign policy, and it has a partisan and philosophical subtext, too. One of Mr. Bush's main foreign policy advisers argues privately, as do most other Republicans, that ''it's time that human rights stop driving our foreign policy, whether you're talking about China or South Africa.''
Most Democrats, like Representative Steven J. Solarz of Brooklyn, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, still advocate giving as much weight to human rights as to realpolitik in foreign policy.
The contrast was drawn unusually starkly last month when former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger wrote in a syndicated newspaper article that ''no government in the world would have tolerated'' the students' occupation of Tiananmen Square, defending Mr. Deng as ''a reformer and a good friend of the United States'' and attacking Congress.
Mr. Solarz wrote in reply in The Washington Post that ''when the Chinese Government resorts to the wanton violation of human rights, it will inevitably pay a price with the American public and its elected representatives,'' and he denounced Mr. Kissinger's views as ''amoral.''
As Mr. Lord says, Washington faces a difficult period as it struggles to get the balance right.

HEADLINE: COLOMBIANS FEAR FOR THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Sept. 10

 BODY:
As Colombia's stepped-up campaign against drug trafficking goes into its fourth week, many Colombians are divided over the wisdom of trying to abruptly shut down the country's most lucrative industry.
Both Government and independent economists say that a sudden halt to the drug trade, which last year yielded $4 billion, would throw the country into a deep recession that might run four or five years.
''It should be reduced gradually over five or six years,'' said a leading economist, who requested anonymity.
The Government's anti-narcotics campaign has slowed dramatically since the first few days of raids and none of the major traffickers have been caught, although an economist accused of helping the Medellin cartel launder $1.2 billion was extradited to face Federal charges in Atlanta last week. But Government officials deny that economic concerns are a factor. 
 
'Committed to This Fight'
''President Barco is committed to this fight,'' a senior Government official said. ''I've never heard any Government ministers or important pressure groups argue that we should soften the effort for economic reasons.''
''On the other hand,'' he added, ''there are decent people who would prefer to keep things as they were.''
Immediately after President Virgilio Barco Vargas declared war on the drug traffickers on Aug. 19, 11,000 people were arrested and hundreds of planes, boats, cars and weapons were seized. But since then the traffickers have had the Government on the defensive with almost nightly bombings in Medellin, the country's drug trafficking hub, and sporadic attacks in the capital.
Today, the Associated Press reported that the Government had signed extradition orders for three more imprisoned Colombians. They were identified as Ana Helena Rodriguez, jailed in Bogota on drug trafficking charges, Bernardo Londono Quintana, 47, jailed in Bogota on money-laundering charges, and Alberto Orlando Gamboa, 37, held in Medellin on money-laundering charges.
The income from cocaine last year was more than three times the $1.2 billion expected this year from coffee, Colombia's leading legal export. Eighty percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States is processed in Colombia.
The Colombian Government, which insists that it is not dependent on cocaine and not influenced in its policy-making by cocaine dollars, says that most of the traffickers' earnings are stashed in banks and investments outside the country.
 
'It Could Be Disastrous'
Even so, Government and independent economists estimate that as much as $1.5 billion in drug trafficking profits circulated in the Colombian economy last year, accounting for 20 percent of the country's total export earnings. By some estimates, as many as 300,000 of Colombia's 32 million people may be directly or indirectly employed in the cocaine business and as many as 1.2 million may benefit from the proceeds.
''If the narcotics trafficking stopped suddenly,'' said Fernando Tenjo Galarza of the Department of National Planning. ''it would be like having a coffee crisis and oil crisis at the same time.'' A university economist said: ''I think we would see a very deep recession. It could be disastrous if you don't manage it properly.''
In recovering from a cocaine-induced recession, the economists said, Colombia would need substantial aid from the United States and other countries. Colombia would probably not ask for money, they said, but would expect American support for an agreement guaranteeing favorable prices for Colombian coffee as well as a reduction in import restrictions.
Colombia might also ask for leniency in repaying its $16 billion foreign debt, which is now devouring 42 percent of its export earnings.
 
Where Drug Barons Invest
Narcotics trafficking is an embarrassment to the Government and it refuses to acknowledge that tens or hundreds of thousands of Colombians are living better because of it. It makes no effort to track the flow of narcotics dollars and omits the income from official reports and calculations.
The drug barons have amassed fortunes that exceed anything previously known in Colombia. Often using ficticious names and dummy corporations, they have invested extensively in Colombian business and industry. But most economists say they doubt reports that the traffickers also own large blocks of corporate shares traded on the Colombian stock market.
The traffickers have bought millions of acres of prime farm and ranch lands and invested heavily in construction.
Jorge Enrique Vargas, the deputy director of the Department of National Planning, portrays the cocaine money as an unwelcome factor that distorts the Colombian economy.
In the last three years, he said, it has caused the price of real estate and houses to double. The finance industry has suffered, he said, because ''these people pay cash'' and food production has declined because workers have been lured away from farms and ranches by higher paying jobs in the drug trade.
The Government does not appear to expect a quick end to the cocaine business. It has developed no plan for coping with the loss of cocaine dollars, Government economists say, and no one is working on such a plan.

HEADLINE: Housing Plan Is Central Issue In Yonkers Primary Contests

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YONKERS, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Local officials who favor compliance with a court-ordered housing desegregation plan have long felt that a majority in this city of 190,000 agreed that continued opposition to the plan was pointless.
That theory will be tested in Tuesday's primary elections, where candidates on opposite sides of the long-running housing dispute face each other.
The Democratic Party has primary contests for the mayoral nomination and for City Council seats in three of the six Council districts. The Republicans have Council contests in two districts; the Conservatives have a Council race in one district. 
In 1986, the city was ordered by Judge Leonard B. Sand in Federal District Court in Manhattan to build 1,000 units of low- and middle-income housing in mostly white neighborhoods to help remedy what the judge said was nearly 40 years of ''intentional segregation.''
Opponents have argued that the city was unfairly singled out and that forced integration will depress real-estate values. Those who favor compliance say that legal appeals have been all but exhausted.
 
Clear Test in November
Until now, the debate has been conducted almost entirely in the seven-member Council - six councilmen and the Mayor - where four members have been able to delay carrying out the judge's order.
For the clearest test of voter sentiment on the housing issue, observers will have to wait until the November mayoral election. If he wins the Democratic primary, Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko, the major proponent of compliance, will facethe housing plan's most outspoken opponent, Councilman Henry Spallone.
Mr. Spallone, the vice mayor, has used his Council seat to press for resistance to the housing plan. He abandoned a re-election campaign a few months ago to run for mayor, switching to the Republican Party. The switch allows him to avoid a primary contest with Mr. Wasicsko.
The results of Tuesday's primary will be studied for hints of support or opposition to the plan. Observers will have to interpret the results carefully because other factors, including a struggle among Democrats, may have a bearing on the primary contests.
 
Challenge to Mayor
Mr. Wasicsko, for example, faces a Democratic primary challenge from a former four-term councilman, Dominick Iannacone, who has the support of the city's Democratic leader, Ralph Arred. Mr. Iannacone's entry in the race was inspired by Mr. Arred, the Mayor said, ''to derail my candidacy.''
Mr. Iannacone ''has been silent on the housing issue,'' Mr. Wasicsko said., But Mr. Iannacone said carefully that he would ''not break the law,'' which means complying with the judge's order.
Mr. Iannacone, 61 years old, says the 30-year-old one-term Mayor not only lacks experience, but, with Mr. Spallone, has ''polarized the city'' on the housing issue.
In the Third Council District, where the incumbent Democrat, Charles A. Cola, died in June, there are two primaries. On the Republican side, John N. D'Agnillo, who says the plan will place a social and economic burden on the city, faces John L. Spencer, who has his party's endorsement and favors compliance with the court order.
The two Democratic candidates favor compliance with the housing order. They are Thomas G. Meier, who has Mr. Arred's support, and Barbara C. Cola, the former Councilman's widow, who played an active role in her husband's political life.
 
Outspoken Newcomer
The Fifth District offers another faceoff on the housing issue, but it also pits an experienced Republican incumbent, Nicholas V. Longo, against an outspoken newcomer, Thomas A. Dickerson. Mr. Longo, who has Conservative Party support, also faces a primary challenge on that line, from Alyssa A. Scelza, also a newcomer.
Mr. Longo is firmly opposed to compliance and has fashioned much of the strategy used by the Council majority in seeking to overturn or delay implementation. Mr. Dickerson is in favor of the housing plan. If Mr. Longo, an eight-term Councilman, wins his primaries, he will face George Oswald, the Democratic candidate, who opposes compliance, as well as Mr. Dickerson, who is also running as an Independent, in the general election.
In the Sixth District, two Democrats are seeking the nomination against the incumbent, Edward J. Fagan Jr., a Conservative-Republican candidate. The challengers, like Mr. Fagan, oppose compliance but differ in degree. Ralph Ferraioli, the party's choice, would limit opposition to court appeals, while Mel Ellen, a fervent opponent of the housing plan, would challenge construction at every stage.
In the First District, which has a 65 percent minority voter enrollment, a seven-term incumbent Democrat, Harry Oxman, is seeking re-election without Mr. Wasicsko's endorsement and without the support of a majority of local leaders in his district, although he has Mr. Arred's backing.
Mr. Wasicsko has said that while Mr. Oxman, who is white, has long favored compliance, he has not been vocal on the subject. The district leaders and Mr. Wasicsko are supporting Joe L. Farmer, an administrator in the Yonkers school system, who is black.

HEADLINE: Despite Skew Rates, Few Fear Recession

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
In the opinion of some analysts, tight monetary policies in the United States and other major industrial nations are at best likely to produce a slowdown in growth next year while increasing the possibility of a global recession.
For the first time since the early 1980's, the major central banks' desire to fight inflation has pushed yields on short-term debt securities in countries like West Germany and Japan, as well in the United States, Canada and Britain, above those offered on long-term bonds. In the past, this inversion of the ''yield curve'' has often been a harbinger of economic downturns.
But at the moment, the chances of a recession appear remote, the analysts said, in part because the inversion is slight in most countries and current conditions are far different than they were at the start of the decade. 
 
Inflation Difference
''The difference between now and then is that inflation was running rampant back in the early 1980's, and in order to brake inflation and regain credibility, central banks were forced to drive real interest rates to record levels,'' said Nicholas Sargen, a director in bond market research at Salomon Brothers Inc.
''Real interest rates around the globe are not as high now as they were then, and central banks won't have to push them up as high or keep them up as long,'' Mr. Sargen continued. ''There won't be a global meltdown. We think there will be a slowing of growth in the United States and the world economy.''
While bond-equivalent yields on short-term Treasury bills are currently below those offered on 30-year bonds, investors in instruments with maturities from two years and up can capture a higher yield than on the Government's bellwether 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019.
At the end of last week, the 8 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.25 percent; the 30-year bond was offered late Friday at a price to yield 8.07 percent. Three-month Treasury bills were offered on a bond-equivalent basis to yield 8.01 percent.
The Treasury yield curve has been inverted or flat for much of this year, but outside of a slowdown in the goods-producing sector, there are few signs of economic weakness. Yet the fact that short-term interest rates have risen above long-term rates around the world is a reason to be optimistic about bonds, some market participants maintain.
''We are in a period of wonder right now,'' said James M. Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management in Palo Alto, Calif., which has more than $5 billion in assets. ''But the fact that yield curves in all of the Group of Seven countries are inverted is bullish, because it is likely to create a slowdown in the world economy.''
 
A Warning
Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said the inverted yield curves in major countries are a warning.
''They mean a slowdown in growth, which has already materialized here, will spread to Europe in the months ahead,'' he said, noting that the most prudent course would be less caution by the Group of Seven, which comprises the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and Canada. ''I think the Fed will move to ease rates very soon, probably within the next month.''
A slew of economic reports, many to be released Friday, could produce swift action by the Fed, though most analysts said the chances of that occurring are slight.
The figures include August retail sales figures, which should be strong because of healthy auto purchases, and a report on changes in producer prices last month. Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company predict that the producer price index will register a drop of two-tenths of a percent, in large part, because of softness in energy prices.
An August decline in the index would mark the first time since early 1986 that producer prices have declined in more than two consecutive months. The index fell by four-tenths of a percent in July and by one-tenth of a percent in June.
 
Washington Public Power Issue
Elsewhere, new-issue activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market is almost certain to pick up sharply this week after a slack summer.
Roughly $3 billion in new municipal issues could be offered to investors this week. The list includes a $450 million issue of refinancing bonds from the Washington Public Power Supply System, the utility's first offering since 1982, when it defaulted on $2.25 billion of bonds issued to finance two nuclear power plants.
Participants in the municipal bond market said they expected the sales to go well.
''When interest rates fell through the first half of the summer, municipals underperformed Treasuries, and as a consequence our rates didn't go down as fast,'' said Neal Atterman, a vice president and manager of municipal bond research at Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''That means that retail investors are likely to be back. This sort of supply will get their juices going.''

Lag Expected For German Chemicals

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Facing an uncertain global economy, currency swings and new health-care regulations, West Germany's chemical industry, the fourth largest in the world, may be nearing the end of its six-year boom.
In the last few weeks, the nation's three largest chemical companies -BASF A.G., Hoechst A.G. and Bayer A.G. - reported quarterly results that signal another record year for an industry that had sales of about $90 billion in 1988, of which $17 billion, or 19 percent, was earned in the United States. But there are signs of weakening.
The results of Hoechst, for example, were below analysts' expectations, a performance attributed to weakness in its plastic division. The company did not release details of its plastic division's earnings, but said: ''The competition with polyproplylene increased. Sales stagnated at a high level.'' 
 
Revamping and Lower Costs
Stagnation at a high level could well describe what lies ahead for the German chemical industry, whose success can be largely attributed to far-reaching cost reductions and management reorganizations undertaken in the early 1980's, comparable to a phase that the American chemical industry has also undergone.
Profits in the industry as a whole are likely to decline by 1.8 percent in 1990, in the view of Peter Dietelmaier, an economist at Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt. ''But one must consider that profits are at their highest levels to date,'' he added. ''I wouldn't sound any alarm bells. They are stabilizing at a very high level. These high rates of growth just can't continue indefinitely.''
Like the global chemical industry, one area of concern for the German companies is overcapacity. Buoyed by surging profits in recent years, they have invested heavily in new plant and equipment.
 
Pressure on Prices Seen
''There will be massive new capacity coming into the chemicals market between 1991 and 1994,'' said Huber Gunter of Bank in Liechtenstein A.G. ''That is going to put a lot of pressure on prices, particularly if demand weakens for any reason.''
Some of the expansion was to prepare for the unified European market envisioned for 1992, but analysts said that may have been unnecessary.
''The West German chemical industry is already very international,'' said Jackie Ashurst, who follows the industry for James Capel & Company in London. Exports were up 10.5 percent from the year before and accounted for 53 percent of the value of the industry's sales in 1988, according to the West German Chemical Industry Association.
Unlike Japanese and American chemical producers, the German companies are more dependent on exports to other nations, including the United States, where they had a 7 percent share of the market in 1988. Much of its growing foreign presence, built through acquisitions in the current boom, is concentrated in a few product areas, like paints, plastic and fibers.
 
Mexican Paint-Maker Bought
On Aug. 29, BASF bought Aurolin, a family-owned Mexican paint producer for an undisclosed price. But BASF's most important North American acquisition to date was its $1 billion purchase in 1985 of the Inmont Corporation, the second-largest producer of paints and lacquers for the United States automobile industry.
In late 1986 Hoechst followed BASF's lead by making the biggest United States acquisition to date by a West German company with the $2.8 billion takeover of the Celanese Corporation, putting it in the thick of the commodity fiber market.
Bayer has chosen not to make any spectacular acquisitions in the American market, choosing instead to expand gradually its Mobay Corporation and Miles Inc. subsidiaries. Its rivals say that Bayer is not likely to make major foreign deals for the next few years while consolidating past acquisitions.
Their United States business activities have made the German companies more vulnerable to swings in the dollar-mark exchange rate, analysts said. If the dollar rises sharply, this can be a boon, but if it falls dramatically, it cuts into earnings.
 
Changes in Health System
Changes in the German national health system, aimed at cutting Government health spending, also loom as a threat. Some industry executives say they fear the changes could also erode earnings by pushing consumers toward generic producers and reducing demand for the products of the chemical companies.
Hermann J. Strenger, Bayer's managing board chairman, said generic producers cut the company's drug earnings by 30 percent in 1988 and he expected a further erosion this year.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Latin America Records Some Economic Gains

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Despite a sharp contraction in economic growth last year, Latin American countries increased both exports and imports and managed for the first time since 1982 to reduce foreign debt, the Inter-American Development Bank said Friday.
In its annual report, Economic and Social Progress in Latin America, the bank found ''reasons for hope as well as disillusionment.''
Overall growth of the international economy was nearly 4 percent last year, mainly reflecting strength in the industrialized economies, but the growth in Latin America was just six-tenths of 1 percent, markedly below the 3 percent in 1987.
The Latin economies, the report said, were battered by a three-percentage-point surge in international interest rates between the first quarter of 1988 and the first quarter of 1989, which restrained growth and added $10 billion to debt service. 
 
Pressure to Export
With debt in Latin America totaling about four times the size of exports, every percentage point increase in rates requires a 4 percent increase in export earnings to keep even.
Yet in spite of the higher interest payments, the Latin debt fell to $426 billion at the end of 1988, from $441 billion a year earlier. Much of the decline occurred in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, whose lenders agreed to swap large amounts of debt for equity in various enterprises in those countries.
Bank economists project further declines this year as a result of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's plan to reduce debt by offering banks incentives to forgive a portion of their loans. An agreement reached between Mexico and its foreign creditors in July, for example, could lead to reducing the $54 billion of commercial bank debt of that country by as much as 35 percent.
For the average citizen in Latin American, the region's weak economic performance has meant a declining standard of living.
 
Measure of Decline
One measure of this is per-capita gross domestic product, representing total economic output divided by population. As populations were rising throughout the region, the per-capita measure fell by 1.5 percent last year.
Between 1980 and 1988, output per capita fell by 7 percent, or $176, after rising almost 40 percent, or more than $700, between 1970 and 1980.
The region also continued to be buffeted by a sharp decline in capital inflows and investment rates, a drop in foreign exchange reserves, continued high unemployment and rampant inflation in some countries.
''This has been a lost decade for Latin America,'' Enrique Iglesias, president of the bank and a former foreign minister of Uruguay, said at a news conference in presenting the report. He added, however, that the future looked better, citing the region's expanding exports and policy changes that focused on a market orientation.
The bank, a major source of financing for Latin America, recently was granted increased funds. It gets its money from the United States and other industrial countries.
 
Some Progress
Some nations, the report said, have made progress. Chile is the most dramatic example. In 1980 it owed $21 billion and exported $3.5 billion. By 1988 its debt shrank to $17 billion with exports up to $8 billion.
The region's exports in 1988 came to a record $102.6 billion, up 14 percent from 1987, surpassing the previous record $100.7 billion in 1981. Nearly all of the increase for the region was accounted for by gains by Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
Imports, at $78.2 billion, were the highest since 1982, though still nearly $25 billion lower than their peak in 1981. Imports were held down by the need for foreign exchange to pay interest on the debt.
Imports had also strengthened in 1987. The combined increase of $16 billion in the two years represented the first clear evidence of a much delayed recovery in Latin imports, the report said.
Many economists say the Latin import contraction accounts for a large part of the United States' trade deficit. Latin America is a traditional market for many American capital goods and other suppliers.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Argentina Faces Fight on Oil Plans

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Facing labor opposition, Argentina's new Government is pushing ahead with efforts to reorganize the deficit-ridden state oil company and increase private participation in oil and gas exploration and production.
The policy of opening up the oil business was begun under President Raul Alfonsin in 1985. Since Carlos Saul Menem took office two months ago, his Government has awarded 24 exploration contracts to private concerns, many of them foreign, including several American companies.
But as it moves closer to the promised sale of pieces of the state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, the Government expects a conflict with the strongly nationalistic views of the oil workers union. 
 
Rampant Inflation
The company, known as Y.P.F., is an example of the problems the Menem Government faces in trying to reduce the state's role in the Argentine economy. The effort will require bringing fiscal order and better management to more than a dozen state companies that account for most of the immense fiscal deficit, which, in turn, is blamed for the country's vulnerability to rampant inflation.
Octavio Frigerio, who was named by Mr. Menem to head Y.P.F., inherited a company with an operating deficit running at an annual rate of more than $1 billion. He said that much of the deficit was the result of selling gasoline at the pump far below international prices and that the situation had been corrected by raising them to about $1.50 for a gallon of premium-grade gas, more than three times what they were two months ago.
Mr. Frigerio said the basic requirement for reorganization of the state companies was ''mostly political.''
 
Against the Heritage
In deciding to turn the Argentine economy more toward free enterprise, President Menem is going against the heritage of his Justicialist Party and the political movement founded four decades ago by Juan D. Peron. Until now, its basic tenets had been economic nationalism and a big role for the state in the economy.
The choice of Mr. Frigerio to run Y.P.F. reflects the drastic shift that Mr. Menem has led in his party. Mr. Frigerio is an economist known for free-market thinking, and not a Peronist. His father, Rogelio, was a leading adviser to President Arturo Frondizi, whose 1958-62 Government unsuccessfully attempted a similar opening of the economy.
Many in Peronism, including the labor movement, the traditional backbone of the party, still differ with Mr. Menem. The union representing the 36,000 state oil workers has been in the forefront of opposition.
Diego Ibanez, secretary general of the oil workers union, declined to be interviewed, but his public statements suggest that he wants Argentine oil production to be used mainly to assist the nation's industrial growth, without the country trying to become an exporter, and that he does not want Y.P.F. broken up.
 
'Mix of Distinct Interests'
Mr. Frigerio said he considered the labor opposition to his plans to be based on ''a complex mix of distinct interests, part ideological and partly an attempt to protect old corporativist privileges.''
The term corporativism is used in Argentina to describe the custom of interests, like labor and private enterprise, negotiating shares of power and income without concern for productivity, quality or competition.
Mr. Frigerio said he believed that the oil workers would be better off in the long run ''if Y.P.F. becomes professional, modern and internationally competitive.''
Before the end of the year, Mr. Frigerio said, he expects to come up with a plan to sell pieces of the firm as private operations. Possibilities include the shipping fleet, the drilling activity and the gas stations. Then, he said, the production section would remain as a much smaller firm or would disappear as private companies took on its functions.
He said the Government was not making any plans to dismiss oil workers, even though he said that their salaries were double the national average for industrial wages and that he thought it took ''about four people in Y.P.F. to do what one person does in a private firm.'' He said he had found Y.P.F. to be ''organically inefficient.''
 
No Confrontation
Despite this, he said he was not going to confront the union over the size of the work force because salaries account for only 6 percent of the Y.P.F. budget. Argentina has no unemployment insurance system, another reason the Menem Government is trying to avoid dismissals.
Until the Alfonsin Government initiated the change in oil policy, the oil business in Argentina was dominated by the state. The private companies here either worked on drilling contracts for Y.P.F. or exploited fields after Y.P.F. abandoned them. Now, the emphasis is on private exploration, with production itself to be either by Y.P.F. or the private companies.
The exploration contracts signed in the last two months constituted the fourth round in the series of auctions of exploration rights begun in 1986. The companies that signed those contracts are expected to invest $266 million.
The extent of Argentina's oil and gas reserves is unknown because only a small percentage of the sedimentary basins, both on land and offshore, has been explored. The country is considered self-sufficient in oil.
Many Argentine oil experts contend that the country would never be an important oil producer, but Mr. Frigerio said that is a premature judgment.
''I think we could have a lot of oil,'' he said, ''and, above all, a lot of gas.''

HEADLINE: Yeltsin, the Moscow Populist, Takes Manhattan (in Stride)

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

 BODY:
When he spotted the Statue of Liberty yesterday from the window of a circling helicopter, Boris N. Yeltsin smiled broadly and applauded. Then, in a spontaneous gesture of delight, he gave a lusty thumbs-up sign - as if he, the maverick prince of the Soviet Communist Party, and she, the symbol of American freedom, have a special thing going.
Mr. Yeltsin, 58 years old, a leader of the Soviet Union's first independent parliamentary caucus, spent the first full day of his first trip to the United States embracing much of the American way of life - even as he sounded notes of warning about the difficult times faced by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev back home.
''All my impressions of capitalism, of the United States, of Americans that have been pounded into me over the years, including by the Short History of the Communist Party - all of them have changed 180 degrees in the day and a half I have been here,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, whose populist politics have won him a large following in Moscow.
He said he hoped for a meeting with President Bush in Washington at which he would outline in detail how the United States could help Mr. Gorbachev's program of restructuring. 
 
Criticizes 'Half-Measures'
As for Soviet society, Mr. Yeltsin told reporters yesterday that it is facing its worst crisis of several decades - economically, socially and politically. He voiced criticism of the ''half-measures'' and ''compromises'' taken by his former ally, President Gorbachev, but discounted some of the more alarming predictions being made about the Soviet Union.
''A coup d'etat is pretty unrealistic,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, who lost his seat on the ruling Politburo and then his job as Moscow party leader after making a particularly frank speech at a party meeting in 1987. He dismissed talk of a civil war - raised by Mr. Gorbachev in a television address to the Soviet people on Saturday night - as a ''useful scarecrow to scare people with.''
Mr. Yeltsin made it clear that he intends this eight-day trip - sponsored by the Esalen Institute's Soviet-American Exchange Program - to be as much a chance to learn how to propel Soviet restructuring forward, as to lecture about it.
 
Learning From America
''We have to learn lessons from America - how to work, how to learn, how to enjoy life,'' he said as he took his entourage on a brisk walking tour around the southern rim of the Central Park Reservoir in the hot sun, alternatively damping his brow with a handkerchief and gulping down a Pepsi-Cola.
A native Siberian known for his physical strength, Mr. Yelstin turned his energy loose on Manhattan almost as soon as he and his small entourage arrived on Saturday afternoon. By midnight they had managed a walking tour of Fifth Avenue, a dinner at a Chinese restaurant, a close examination of the fresh fruit and working habits of a Korean grocery, a quick trip to the 102d floor of the Empire State building and a brief chat with a group of homeless people protesting outside the United Nations.
''They were complaining the Government does not give a place to live,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, ''but while they were protesting, they seemed quite good-natured.'' Aides said the conversation, joined by a dozen people who seemed to recognize the tall, broad-shouldered man with a shock of white hair, turned quite jocular as people suggested an exchange between the homeless of New York and Moscow.
The next morning, before brunch with a small group of business leaders and economists, Mr. Yeltsin, an engineer and chairman of a parliamentary committee on architecture and construction, went on a tour of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, casting an expert eye on the brass-and-glass atrium.
His host in New York, Robert Schwartz, a former journalist who has worked closely with Esalen's East-West exhange programs, then took him on a helicopter tour of the city and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There, he made a direct line for the Flemish painters and the Impressionists, giving short shrift to modern art, except for one short, stunned look at the giant poster of Mao by Andy Warhol.
 
Department Store Skipped
The original schedule had included a visit to Bloomingdale's, but Mr. Schwartz said Mr. Yeltsin had quickly vetoed the idea. ''He said forget it,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''He said if he didn't go to the Metropolitan, New Yorkers would never forgive him, and neither would Muscovites.''
When he was named Moscow party leader in 1985, Mr. Yeltsin soon made his mark as a streetwise politician, sending out the message that he had traded his Zil limousine for the city's crowded buses, publicly attacking the privileges reserved for the party elite.
Yesterday in New York - where six candidates are winding up real mayoral campaigns before Tuesday's primary elections - Mr. Yeltsin gave passers-by a hearty Russian version, with handshaking at every turn, quick quips and even one episode of baby-kissing on Central Park West.
''He doesn't come out of the tradition of Marx or Jefferson,'' said an American member of his entourage, perhaps thinking more in terms of Harry S. Truman. ''He comes out of the Pendergast machine in Missouri.''
 
Gives U.S. Benefit of Doubt
But wherever comparisons could be made, Mr. Yeltsin seemed to give the benefit of the doubt to the American way of doing things - listing ability to govern with a two-party system, protection of individual rights, direct elections, antitrust laws and religious tolerance. ''I think you have a very healthy society,'' he told reporters.
Besides such theoretical advantages, Mr. Yeltsin had good reviews based on his own observations. The Chinese dinner was ''10 times better'' than the fare at the average cooperative restaurant in Moscow, he declared, and not that expensive on an average American salary.
Looking out the window of the helicopter at the Alfred E. Smith public housing complex along the East River, he declared the apartments to be ''Khrushchevki,'' or Soviet housing units built during the Khrushchev era, now mostly rundown. ''In our terms, your buildings look more comfortable,'' he told reporters later.
But perhaps the most impressive sight so far was the Korean grocery, where, he said afterwards, ''everything was so clean, so tidied up, with only one man serving all those people.'' He had taken careful note of the variety of fruits and vegetables - one of the most painful shortages facing Soviet consumers - and their prices, declaring that they, too, were ''not bad for an average American salary.''
 
'It Can't Get Any Worse'
The day when Soviet shoppers will see such an array is still far off, he said in an interview during a walk through Central Park. ''The situation is so bad, it can't get any worse,'' he said. ''There are even lines for bread now in some parts of the Soviet Union. But we will not be able to decide this problem with half-measures and compromises.''
''Compromise should be a temporary policy,'' he said. ''But Gorbachev has pursued a policy of continual compromise.'' Mr. Yeltsin is a leader of an inter-regional group, made up of several hundred deputies to the Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, that seeks to offer alternatives to Government policy. He said no real change in strategy is possible until ''one-half of the Central Committee and one-half of the Politburo are changed at the upcoming 28th Party Congress. Until then, it will be impossible to carry out perestroika to its conclusion.''
Both privately and publicly, Mr. Yeltsin reserved his harshest comments for his longtime opponent, Yegor K. Ligachev, a member of the Politburo now in charge of agriculture. At an afternoon news conference, Mr. Yeltsin accused Mr. Ligachev of ''spewing venomous saliva,'' and during the visit to the Korean grocery he privately mocked Mr. Ligachev's efforts at reforming Soviet agriculture.
He waved toward the stands stacked with fresh produce, one aide reported, and said contemptuously, ''And Ligachev is still holding seminars.''
 
Calls Restructuring Necessary
Although he said the Soviet Union needed someone ''more decisive'' than Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin said at the news conference that his criticisms should not be seen as undercutting Mr. Gorbachev's position. The collapse of the Soviet President's efforts to restructure society would be ''a tragedy, and not only for our country,'' he said.
But changes in Soviet politics have only just begun, he said. With crucial local elections due before the end of the year, he called for a greater separation between the Communist Party and the Government. ''Things are not as they should be in the future,'' he said. With greater political decentralization, he said, some of the national problems that are now plaguing Moscow will recede.
He said that if a meeting with Mr. Bush took place, he would outline proposals on how the United States could help the process, including a proposal that would allow direct investment by American businesses in the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Is Bush Repeating Rockefeller's Folly?

BYLINE: By Stephen Gillers; Stephen Gillers is professor of law at New York University Law School.

 BODY:
If Miguel Ruiz were alive today, he might tell George Bush a thing or two about getting tough on casual drug users, one objective of the President's new drug plan.
Fifteen years ago, as a young court-appointed lawyer, I represented Mr. Ruiz (this is a pseudonym) following his arrest under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's tough new drug law. As Mr. Ruiz and hundreds like him were herded daily before new judges and prosecutors in bright new courtrooms, they were living proof of the gulf between political rhetoric and what toughness can actually deliver.
Mr. Ruiz, in his mid-30's and employed, lived alone in a rented room. He had no criminal record. He spent evenings with friends in a Manhattan bar, where they talked, drank beer and took trips to the bathroom to ingest cocaine. They had no trouble buying the drug, which had not yet achieved notoriety. 
In Mr. Ruiz's group, whoever bought the cocaine shared it and got reimbursed. On a day that Mr. Ruiz happened to be the supplier, one of his newer ''friends'' turned out to be a police officer, who paid him for a portion then busted him for selling it.
Under the new law, Mr. Ruiz faced life in prison with no parole for seven and a half years. The prosecutor offered to let him plead to a crime that carried a life sentence, with eligibility for parole after one year. This was the best deal the law allowed.
Mr. Ruiz's cocaine habit made it hard to discuss the offer. He could be enraged one minute, docile the next. He had trouble concentrating. But most of all, he could not understand why anyone would want to lock him up even for a day just because he shared cocaine with his friends.
Most Rockefeller defendants took the deal. It would be the officer's word, supported by a tape recording and the actual drug, against theirs. And many defendants, like Mr. Ruiz, could not even tell their story. The act of attempting to testify would reveal to the jury unmistakable symptoms of prolonged drug use.
But Mr. Ruiz didn't want to plead guilty. If he went to prison, he said, he would lose his job and his room. He wanted a trial to explain this to the judge. My effort to tell him that he faced a sentence seven times longer if he was convicted caused him to suspect me. He seemed to believe that imprisonment was my idea, that the judge would be more reasonable.
Eventually, he accepted a sentence of one year to life. I heard later that he died in prison. Had he lived, he would have left prison homeless and unemployed.
New York, like other states and the Federal Government, has responded to people like Mr. Ruiz in three ways. At times, it has been generally content to ignore them. Occasionally, it has offered treatment. Under the Rockefeller drug law, it designated them a grave danger to the social fabric, people who had to be stopped through tough law enforcement.
Echoing the former Governor, the President has made ''getting tough on drug criminals'' the first ''element of our strategy.'' Miguel Ruiz might have told the President that broad get-tough strategies mainly catch people like him, people for whom drugs are part of a social subculture, not a criminal enterprise.
A year from now, the White House will cite numbers to prove the success of the President's plan. So many thousands arrested, convicted and sentenced to so many millennia in prison; so many tons of this or that drug seized, having a street value of so many millions of dollars; so many new prison cells, police officers and prosecutors built or employed.
To impress, these numbers have to be big. The surest way to get big numbers is to arrest people like Miguel Ruiz. There are lots of them and they are easy to catch.
Governor Rockefeller also relied on numbers. He didn't identify the people behind them, but we in the bright new courtrooms knew who they were. The millions spent to imprison Mr. Ruiz and others had no effect on the drug trade.
After Rockefeller left office, New York overhauled his law, silently acknowledging what Miguel Ruiz, his brain addled from cocaine use, already knew, although Mr. Bush may not. Prosecuting adults because they casually use and share drugs, however unfortunate that may be for them and those who love and depend on them, costs a lot, makes hard lives worse and accomplishes nothing.

HEADLINE: The Dream Of Reunion;
Idea of One Germany Gains New Currency

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
As thousands of East Germans seeking freedom streamed across the Hungarian border to Austria and West Germany today, the ''German question,'' the dream, or fear, of German reunification, also came alive with them.
''It's still not going to happen any time soon, but there's beginning to be serious thought about it,'' a senior American diplomat said. ''It's not just a pious platitude anymore. You have to think about what it really means.'' 
West Germany's European allies gave lip service to the idea for years, precisely because it was out of the question. Today, it is being debated again publicly not only in Britain and France, which have always been afraid of it, but also in West Germany, where for the first time in years it is not taboo.
 
Guilt, Shame and Debate
As a headline on the front page of the weekly Die Zeit this month described the ''guilt and shame'' felt by Germans on the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, interviews and articles inside discussed how best to overcome the main consequence of it for Germany, the division of the country.
Fritz J. Raddatz, an author not given to romanticizing in the past, wrote a nostalgic ''brief for German unity,'' arguing that the idea was unthinkable only for people who were unimaginative, but should not be for the visionaries who make history.
And, he asked, ''where is it written in stone that both Germanys have to maintain armies?''
The implication of that question -that the two remnants of Germany could become one again, neutralized instead of firmly in the clutches of their respective alliances - is precisely what many in Britain and France fear most, despite constant reassurances from governments of whatever political party in Bonn.
 
Disintegrating Forces
''What we are envisaging is the gradual emptying of NATO's content and a growing divergence in political direction between Germany on the one hand, and Britain and France on the other,'' Peregrine Worsthorne wrote in the conservative Sunday Telegraph over the weekend.
''And this in turn would mean an end to all dream of a 'political Europe.' Disintegrating forces are at work not only within the Russian empire.''
Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said in an interview: ''Most of what has been happening is attributable to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. When he visited Bonn in April, what I saw was that the West Germans really considered the cold war was over, and that other items could come to the fore.''
Perceptions of President Gorbachev, and of the meaning of the changes unleashed in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary since he came to power, differ significantly between Bonn, Paris and London. What the others often overlook is that West Germany feels the effects of changes in the East sooner, and more directly, than they do, whether the change involves arms or emigration.
''We've always operated on the assumption that the Russians would never agree to reunification of Germany, but I'm not so sure any more,'' a high-ranking British official said. ''Recently they've hinted that they might accept it, under the right conditions.''
Those are generally believed to require the neutrality of any united Germany, something that would shake the European Community and NATO as fundamentally as it would the Warsaw Pact.
 
Bonn's Growing Role in East
No responsible West German political leader has even raised the possibility of leaving NATO and declaring neutrality. West Germany has sought its destiny up to now in the context of a firm commitment to the process of Western European integration, coming to terms with its eastern neighbors in hopes of easing economic and political pressures there.
Most of the Germans' neighbors, east and west, hoped they really meant it, but their belief is still easily shaken as Bonn's economic role in Eastern Europe grows.
Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement that dominates the new Polish Government formed after free elections there, spent last week visiting West Germany, though Polish officials have also been pleading with other Western countries for economic aid to help avert collapse.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is to see Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow on Sept. 23, recently wrote to President Bush and President Francois Mitterrand suggesting discussions on how to better concert help to Hungary and Poland to encourage them to move toward democratization and freer economic conditions.
 
Idea Gaining Validity
East Germany's refusal to do so is causing many Germans to take up Bonn's offer of citizenship to oppressed Germans everywhere, and giving the idea of German unity a validity in other European countries that it has not had since the height of Soviet repression in the 1950's.
''The time for hypocrisy is past,'' Peter Millar wrote in The Sunday Times over the weekend.''For 40 years Western politicians have sympathetically clucked when their colleagues from Bonn made lachrymose speeches about their 'divided fatherland,' while privately congratulating each other on letting the Russians keep the Hun in place.''
Luc Rosenzweig, the Bonn correspondent of Le Monde, told a German television audience the same day, ''The Germans could gain a lot more sympathy if they would end the absurd pretension that reunification would take place within the prewar borders of 1939.''
Mr. Heisbourg said: ''The notion of returning to a previously existing Bismarckian state, which the word 'reunification' implies, is something that nobody wants, including most Germans. The Germans sometimes use the expression 'new unification' to describe what is more plausible. But it cannot happen without the involvement of the great powers, because of their status in the division of Berlin.''
An adviser to Mrs. Thatcher said: ''One of the reasons why all this is happening in Eastern Europe is the success of the Western alliance. But it's definitely fasten-your-seat-belts time.''

HEADLINE: CAR MAKERS WEIGH GASOLINE CHANGES TO CUT POLLUTION

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Big Three auto makers are close to joining leading oil companies in testing the feasability of using reformulated gasoline instead of methanol or other alternative fuels to meet stricter clean-air standards proposed by the Bush Administration.
The Administration proposal, submitted to Congress in June, calls for the auto industry to begin producing up to a million vehicles annually by the mid-1990's that would burn an unspecified ''alternative fuel.''
Officials of the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as some officials in Southern California, are thought by the oil and auto industries to favor methanol, but those industries have serious reservations.
 
Pilot Models Being Tested
The Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation have all expressed confidence that they can build methanol-burning vehicles in quantity, if required to do so, by the mid-1990's; Ford and G.M. are now testing pilot models in California. 
But auto executives also worry that short of a law requiring the purchase of such vehicles, consumers may ultimately reject methanol vehicles, leaving the companies to bear the financial brunt of the law.
The research project under discussion would examine various reformulations of gasoline, as well as fuels like methanol, ethanol, natural gas and perhaps others. Tests would provide data on the nature of emissions and performance characteristics of the fuel when burned by engines now built by Detroit, said Helen O. Petrauskas, a Ford vice president.
 
Vote by Early 1990 Seen
Mrs. Petrauskas said she hoped the project could begin ''within a few months'' so a great deal of data would be accumulated in advance of rule-making hearings that would start 18 months after the passage of a bill. Many in the industry and the Government believe a bill could be put to a vote by early 1990. ''The sooner we get started, the more data we'll have when rule-making starts,'' she added.
In the past, the auto makers and the oil companies have conducted joint research on other issues of mutual interest, like motor oils and lubricants, through committees of the Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association. But few projects have held as much potential for making an impact on the way cars are designed - of the way fuel is processed and delivered - as the project under discussion.
Oil companies have billions of dollars invested in gasoline refineries in the United States and abroad, and industry officials say they prefer to comply with provisions of any new law by providing a reformulated gasoline.
''What we're looking for is a level playing field so that every fuel that might be a cost-effective solution to the problem might have a chance to compete,'' said Keith McHenry, a senior vice president of the Amoco Corporation, a major oil refiner. ''We want to find the truth. We'd prefer to sell reformulated gasoline, but if the research shows that methanol is the best solution, we'll sell methanol.''
Privately, Federal environmental officials insist that oil industry lobbyists are waging a behind-the-scenes political battle to remove methanol and other non-gasoline alternatives from consideration.
 
Many Issues Not Resolved
Conversely, auto and oil industry officials believe E.P.A. officials are predisposed in favor of methanol, even though many technical and other issues have not been resolved, like how to inhibit emission of formaldehyde from methanol-burning engines. Another serious drawback of methanol is that it contains less energy than gasoline, and thus vehicles would have to be redesigned to carry a significantly bigger tank of fuel to equal the range of current models.
''The oil companies are working hard to get the alternate fuels provisions killed,'' said Richard D. Wilson, director of the E.P.A.'s office of mobile sources. ''We know for sure that ethanol, methanol and compressed natural gas can meet the emissions targets we've set. If the oil industry can come up with a reformulated gasoline that can meet the standards, it's fine with us.''
Gasoline is a combination of many hydrocarbons, sometimes more than 100, that can be varied in amount to affect the fuel's properties, like volatility or how easily the fuel evaporates in the atmosphere.
 
Statement by Sununu
One Big Three lobbyist in Washington, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the companies had been told by John Sununu, the President's chief of staff, that the Government has not already decided the case in favor of methanol. ''Sununu has told us it's a level playing field and may the best and most economical fuel win,'' the lobbyist added.
Although the specific emissions standards would be set in the rule-making phase of the legislative procedure, the President's bill would generally lower the amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and other particles that could be emitted legally from a car's tailpipe. Auto makers have said they are not sure whether such reductions will do much to clean up the air, but they have said they will support the legislation.
Auto makers have suggested for some time, however, that reformulation of gasoline could reduce so-called running losses, or gasoline evaporation, which contributes to air pollution. Recently the oil industry has begun to respond. The Atlantic Richfield Company, a major gasoline marketer, last month announced a lower-polluting formulation of a new fuel for cars that still burn leaded gasoline; the company said it was working on a version for cars that burn unleaded fuel, too.
Denying a report in the automotive trade press that the purpose of joint research was to kill methanol as an alternative fuel, Arthur E. Wiese, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said: ''We're not against methanol per se. We're against doing it before we can answer the various technical and environmental questions.''
Several major oil companies are testing reformulated gasolines -sometimes referred to as ''designer'' gasolines, while others, including ARCO and the Sun Company, are test-marketing methanol in areas where experimental vehicles are being studied.

HEADLINE: Harar Journal;
Ethiopia Drives Its Peasants Off the Good Earth

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARAR, Ethiopia

 BODY:
With rows of Marx and Lenin volumes in his bookcase and piles of tracts on his desk, Ali Youssef, the head of the ideology department here, explained the alacrity with which the process being called ''villagization'' had been accomplished in his region.
In seven months, he said, half a million houses for more than two million people were built. ''There is systemization; there is mobilization,'' he said, lifting some of the argot from his desktop literature. ''They used to construct at midnight.'' 
It is precisely the speed and authoritarianism of the Government's villagization program - the relocation of peasants from their traditionally scattered homes in nearby areas to new villages established in gridlike patterns - that have caused many of its problems, Ethiopian and Western agricultural experts say.
Villagization was heralded by President Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1984 as the answer to many of the difficulties of the impoverished, drought-stricken Ethiopian peasantry, who make up 90 percent of the country's population. By being grouped together, the argument went, peasants would be able to produce more and have easier access to such services as schools and health clinics.
 
Resettlement Also Introduced
Unspoken, but more to the point, in the view of many Ethiopian and Western researchers, villagization was an effort to increase the power of the state by marshaling people in more easily controlled groups.
Experiments in consolidation and forced resettlement have been tried elsewhere in Africa, most notably under President Julius K. Nyerere in Tanzania, with results that are debated widely.
Along with villagization, which now affects about 40 percent of Ethiopia's population, the Government also introduced resettlement, a program under which thousands of people were moved long distances from one arid region of the country to a more fertile one. This program, smaller in scale and often carried out forcibly, has largely been halted, not because of second thoughts but because of its expense for the war-ravaged and virtually bankrupt economy, Ethiopian officials said.
Both villagization and resettlement have been criticized by many Western countries. The two policies are among the reasons that the United States gives for refusing economic aid to Ethiopia, as distinct from humanitarian aid.
This year, the Swedish Government's aid agency, the Swedish International Development Agency, traditionally one of the most generous donors to Ethiopia, withdrew its support of a major agricultural project in Arsi Province because it concluded ''the actual purpose of villagization was political.''
 
A 'Frightening' Development
President Mengistu himself acknowledged in an address to the congress of the Workers Party of Ethiopia last November that his agricultural policies were not working.
He said agricultural production had declined by an average of 0.4 percent annually. ''It is frightening to see that agricultural productivity is steadily decreasing in this manner at a time when the population is increasing at an annual rate of 3 percent,'' he said.
Visits to villagization projects by most foreigners are circumscribed affairs, conducted in the company of local party officials who unfailingly show model sites. The first stop on such a visit is usually to the local ideology boss, like Mr. Ali, who presides over politics in eastern Harar Province.
Recently Mr. Ali arranged a tour of two villagization projects with three party officials and an agricultural expert, who usually deferred to the party officials. The projects, Dire Tayara and Rare Chillalo, are in the countryside around the town of Harar.
At the first, it was proudly stated that about half the peasants belonged to the producers' cooperative. As an inducement to join the cooperative, priority was given to members for fertilizer and better seeds, the officials said.
At the second, a ''mobilization campaign'' was in progress. A long line of peasants, swinging hoes, were digging up old bushes to plant grain.
''Once every 15 days, everyone does a campaign,'' a party guide said. ''If necessary, every week.'' A Long Way to Walk A more revealing explanation of villagization is provided by Ethiopian agricultural researchers. But they, too, complain that party officials in the villages are loath to talk frankly about the problems and create barriers that make it difficult to speak to the peasants.
One of the new villages that have been studied by the University of Addis Ababa lies in a fertile valley surrounded by high peaks 50 miles outside the capital.
For the most part, the land in the villagization projects is not collectivized. Peasants keep their land but have long distances to walk to their farms from the new villages.
As a result, peasants have told the researchers, they have been unable to protect their crops from the hyenas, monkeys and porcupines that pervade the hillsides.
Their new houses were often built with the materials from their old places - a strategy used by party officials to force the peasants to move - and were put up so hastily that they were beginning to crumble and leak, researchers found. Moreover, the houses were built so close together that peasants had little room to grow vegetables, which previously provided valuable income.
''There are some social gains: greater access to schools in some areas and to water and electricity in some of the villages,'' a researcher said. ''But they do not outweigh the economic difficulties. People have been brought closer to the roads but it's questionable how much the road is being used. If the farmer doesn't have cash, what does it mean being closer to the asphalt road for transport?''

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
Behind the No-Tax Talk, The Drug War's Bill

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Like Capt. Louis Renault, the police chief in ''Casablanca'' who professed to be ''shocked, shocked,'' that gambling was going on under his nose, the White House is shocked, shocked at the notion of new taxes to pay for the $7.9 billion war on drugs.
Unthinkable! Read our lips! No new taxes!
But behind the protestations, there are hints that the devastation of the drug epidemic and the Administration's efforts to cope with it may serve as a wedge for a tax increase.
The White House is reluctant to give up the public advantage of its no-tax stand. Even some Democrats say that many in their party erred in saying the only way to pay for the drug war was to raise taxes. Republicans were plainly delighted that Democrats were casting themselves once more in the role of the party that wants new taxes. 
But some senior Republican officials have indicated, though more by innuendo than actual deed, that paying for the emergency on drugs, dealing with the education problem, helping Poland out of its economic morass and starting a new program to send astronauts to Mars will inevitably mean a tax increase.
''There's the possibility of an increase, but it's very complicated because of the atmospherics on Capitol Hill,'' said Stephen E. Bell, managing director of Salomon Brothers here and former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.
''Once the President says drugs are a national emergency, and he's willing to raise taxes for that purpose, then he'll be confronted with a new national emergency on, say, education or health care. People will say these are just as important as fighting the drug war.''
Mr. Bell said an increase in taxes on alcohol or tobacco - was possible. ''You can say these should be taxed higher for the greater public good and we'll use the revenues for a greater public good,'' he said. ''Sort of like killing two birds with one stone.''
A senior White House aide said, ''The attitude has perhaps hardened on the anti-tax thing because the Democrats almost always have a Pavlovian response to a new program, saying, 'Let's raise taxes,' and that sets off a counter-Pavlovian response of no tax increases in the Bush Adminstration.''
Robert Teeter, the President's poll taker, said: ''The public mind is absolutely that you don't have to raise taxes to do these things. They believe you can reduce spending in enough other areas. And you can accommodate these things without a tax increase.''
Others close to Mr. Bush, as well as academics and lawmakers, say new taxes are probable down the line. ''The funny thing about all this,'' said Erwin C. Hargrove, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, ''is the surveys show people are willing to pay more taxes to meet severe national problems, so I don't think there are political dangers here. But Presidents always worry about their credibility. Bush has himself to blame for the bind he created for himself. Probably he'll have to resort to an artifice of some kind to pay for this.''
''The failure to mention taxes in the drug speech is a clue to the fiscal and I would say intellectual bankruptcy of his proposals.'' said James MacGregor Burns, author of books on the Presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. ''It's obvious that when you're concentrating people's attention on the problem and fail to ask people generally to be responsible for financing that program, it raises questions of how sincere the President is about the program. I don't take seriously a speech that would not raise the question of mobilizing fiscal resources.''
But White House officials say that money can be siphoned from other programs. They say Democratic and academic critics miss the point. The Government, in the words of William J. Bennett, the head of the anti-drug initiative, ''is not a sugar daddy.''

HEADLINE: Dr. Axelrod's Potent Health Plan

 BODY:
Roughly 37 million Americans lack basic health insurance, including 2.5 million who live in New York State. In the absence of any serious Federal attempt to address this need, Dr. David Axelrod, the State Health Commissioner, proposes his own plan. It includes a stunningly bold strategy for controlling medical expenses and thereby protecting the taxpayers as well as the uninsured. 
The medical profession will recoil, but Dr. Axelrod has the right idea.
An obvious way to create universal coverage would be to replace existing medical insurance with a single health plan paid for entirely with tax revenues - Medicare for everyone. But that would cost a fortune to administer. Dr. Axelrod therefore would follow the example of Massachusetts and build upon existing coverage.
Most New York residents receive medical insurance through their employers. The 2.5 million who remain uninsured either are not employed or work for firms that do not provide insurance. Under the Axelrod plan, all employers would be encouraged to extend medical insurance to their workers.
As in Massachusetts, those who refuse would be required to pay into a fund financing medical insurance for any uninsured state resident. Individuals covered by the state insurance would have to pay a premium, but it would be set according to the individual's income.
So far so good. Dr. Axelrod's proposal then departs from the Massachusetts approach by recognizing that universal insurance coverage solves only half the problem. Without some limits on costs, the price tag for such a taxpayer-supported benefit could doom the program.
Dr. Axelrod would establish the state as the sole payer of hospitals, physicians and other health providers. Only the state would pay the doctors and hospitals; then Albany would collect reimbursement from the insurers. The state alone would negotiate fees that doctors, hospitals and clinics would be allowed to charge. New York has already laid the groundwork for this ''one-payer'' system with the program it established in 1983 for setting reimbursement rates that hospitals may charge for inpatient care. Extending this program to physicians would likely evoke passionate resistance from the health providers.
In one bold stroke, the state would become a monopolistic buyer of all medical services, with the power to control costs. And because the state would be negotiating the fees that apply to every resident, health providers would not be able to shift costs onto uncovered patients.
Dr. Axelrod has wisely outlined several different versions of his plan. The least expensive, which could be implemented relatively quickly, would cost taxpayers as little as $100 million a year.
Imposing medical insurance on employers is often criticized as a hidden tax. And so it is - some effects on prices and wages are inevitable. But the whole community benefits from broader health coverage, and the state would be spared the cost of administering a huge program of its own. Employers can be expected to come up with a wide array of different plans - a healthy experimentation that might eventually yield an ideal plan.
No such bold initiative is without danger. By saddling New York companies with additional costs, the plan could unintentionally encourage employers to locate in neighboring states. Still, the health economist Karen Davis of Johns Hopkins University, who applauds the Axelrod plan, estimates that the cost increases to business would be small.
So far, the plan is no more than a proposal; Governor Cuomo has yet to endorse it. Given the inevitable opposition of organized medicine, and perhaps some business groups, implementation is hardly guaranteed. But at very least, Dr. Axelrod deserves credit for stirring the health insurance debate with a powerful idea.

HEADLINE: Salvador's Troubles, in Salvador's Hands

 BODY:
Washington no longer focuses much attention on the political future of El Salvador. Its once-dramatic concern has dissipated in the wake of frustration with a seemingly endless military struggle, the election of an extreme rightist Government and progress toward a political settlement in neighboring Nicaragua.
Yet with 70,000 of their countrymen already dead and 1 in 10 uprooted from their homes, Salvadorans cannot afford to resign themselves to the status quo. Peace talks open tomorrow in Mexico City between representatives of President Alfredo Cristiani and leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. These may be a first step toward a better future. Finally, Salvador's future is in Salvadoran hands. 
In recent days the leftist guerrillas of the F.M.L.N. eased their conditions for negotiations, accepting that the meetings be held outside El Salvador and that Government representation be at less than the highest levels. The insurgents have also announced a unilateral 11-day cease-fire and have called on the Government to take similar conciliatory steps.
It would be unrealistic to expect too much from these discussions. Mr. Cristiani's Arena party contains many people who regard the fight against the guerrillas as a holy crusade. And it is far from certain how much further the guerrillas are willing to compromise. Earlier this year, after the outgoing Government of Jose Napoleon Duarte rejected the guerrillas' proposal to delay elections in exchange for a cease-fire, they launched a bloody offensive that helped cement Arena's electoral victory.
An earlier round of talks, begun amid much hope in 1984 with the then-new Duarte Government, was fruitless. But presumably Mr. Cristiani won't have to worry as much as Mr. Duarte did about Arena's possible reaction to any concessions he might make for peace.
And both sides are now less able to count on outside support. American military aid will not flow indefinitely for a Government that rejects reasonable peace offers while turning its back on economic and social reforms. And Nicaragua's commitments to the Central American peace process limit its ability to support the Salvadoran guerrilla forces.
A decade of U.S. involvement, including $3 billion of military and economic aid, may well have prevented an early guerrilla triumph. But the days of passionate debate in Washington over El Salvador are an increasingly distant memory. That country now faces a deadly stalemate. It's up to Salvadorans themselves to take the next step.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Main St. Ponders An Innovation From Fifth Ave.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: PORT JEFFERSON, L.I.

 BODY:
Don't get Edvin Stromsten wrong. He'd love to see planter boxes full of pansies and petunias in the Main Street business district in this waterfront Suffolk County village.
More trees along the sidewalk to the harbor would be nice, too. And while you're at it, how about some new storefront facades that hark back to when this was a 19th-century shipbuilding port? 
''Who could object to improvement?'' asked Mr. Stromsten, a 58-year-old architect who has lived here on and off for 25 years.
But if improvement means losing control of Main Street, the heart and soul of this village of 7,600 people, Mr. Stromsten and dozens of his neighbors want no part of it. What has them worried is a proposal to create something called a business improvement district that could include several blocks of Main Street, East Main Street and West Broadway.
''It's another layer of government that we don't need,'' said Mr. Stromsten, who is president of the newly formed Port Jefferson Civic Association, a group of about 60 homeowners.
For years, property owners and business groups in specially designated sections of New York City have voluntarily agreed to pay additional property taxes for amenities and extra services like Christmas decorations or increased security. The New York State Legislature broadened the law this summer to allow such districts in suburban towns and villages that want them.
Village officials and many business leaders here think that would be a great idea. The business district would, essentially, impose a user's tax on merchants within its boundaries. Residents would not be affected. ''With business on Long Island not great, this could bolster the economy here,'' said Harold Sheprow, the Mayor of Port Jefferson.
It would help preserve a vibrant Main Street at a time when ''we don't have a lot of Main Streets on Long Island anymore,'' said Lois Brager, a village trustee and an owner of Mac Snyder's Army and Navy Store. ''They're all shopping malls now,'' she said. 'Doug Norton, president of the Port Jefferson Chamber of Commerce, said merchants in the new district might pay as little as $35 a year in additional taxes to help pay for promotional campaigns, new street lights, street signs, benches or whatever else the leaders of the district decided. ''We could control our own destiny,'' he said.
Residents are hard-pressed to give a strict definition of where the business district as it now exists here begins and ends, so closely do private homes nestle up to shops. Creating meaningless geographic boundaries would drive a wedge between the commercial and residential areas, they say. ''Having business on one side and residents on another side would break down the traditional community here,'' said Mr. Stromsten.
''The commercial districts are not just commercial,'' he added. ''They are the core and the essence of the village and the public places that belong to all villagers.''
Many residents - and some merchants -fear that essence could ebb away. ''The village would abdicate responsibility for maintaining downtown,'' said Michael Mart, an owner of the Good Times Book Shop, who has lived here since 1970. ''I really don't think it's for this community.''
A business improvement district would be governed by a management association whose members would be mainly merchants appointed by the village. ''We're not sure what type of power this group would have or how far it would go,'' said Jacqueline Lewis, a junior high school teacher and 28-year resident.
There are fears that outsiders could alter the character of the village. ''The people it will help are real-estate developers,'' said Charles Kohn, a silversmith with a shop on East Main Street who has lived in town 15 years. ''The residents will lose their say over what goes on in that district.''
''The people who've spoken against it are negative about anything in the community that's positive,'' said Joan Elliott, a florist on Main Street. She is chairwoman of a committee that will present the proposal's pros and cons at a village meeting on Oct. 2.
Until then questions will abound. For both residents and merchants, the predominant feeling about the proposal is one of uncertainty. Who would be in a district? How much would it cost? Exactly who would benefit from the district?
''I want to see a total picture,'' Phil Mishuck, the owner of P&J's Harbour Sound, a record store. ''No one really knows what we're getting.''
''We're at the very beginning stages here and have a lot to learn,'' Mrs. Elliott said.

HEADLINE: Camden's Contradictions Connect Florio's Images

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
For 20 years, James J. Florio has projected a series of seemingly contradictory images: the city street fighter, the suburban Congressman; the political boss, the idealistic reformer.
These images in many ways reflect the divided society in which Mr. Florio rose to power - a Camden County cleanly severed into two separate worlds of city and suburb, poverty and wealth, black and white.
Since his election as a Democratic Congressman in 1974, he has had unusual success in appealing to both, holding together a coalition of white ethnic suburbanites and urban minorities that Republicans elsewhere have torn apart.
''What people in the city and the suburbs still had in common was that they all wanted to climb to the next rung,'' said State Senator Daniel J. Dalton, who worked in Mr. Florio's first campaign for Congress, in 1972. ''Jim portrayed government's function as to help people climb that ladder. The thing that rang true was when he used himself and his work ethic as an example.'' Now, as the Democratic candidate for governor, Mr. Florio says New Jersey must overcome problems of soaring tax and insurance costs, threats to the environment and urban decline. The state's future, he says, depends on resolving the contradictions between its thriving suburbs and the cities they left behind. 
 
Focus on Camden
If Mr. Florio wants to focus on urban issues, his critics are happy to oblige. They note the continued decay of Camden into one of the nation's poorest cities during the 14 years he has represented it in Congress. They say he merely replaced the old Camden Democratic machine with one of his own.
His Republican opponent, Representative Jim Courter, and Gov. Thomas H. Kean have called the conduct of Mr. Florio's associates in Camden the premier issue in the campaign.
''Camden is a political culture reminiscent of the old New Jersey,'' said a Courter spokesman, Gordon Hensley. ''It sticks out in dramatic contrast to where Tom Kean and Jim Courter seek to lead the state.''
In a recent interview in his campaign headquarters in West Orange, Mr. Florio described a New Jersey in which self-interest would turn the suburbs back toward their central cities.
With the social costs of urban blight raising property taxes in the suburbs, and with businesses hungry for workers that only the city's unemployed can provide, he said, the forces of the marketplace, together with government, can begin to address long-ignored ills.
 
Self-Interest, Public Interest
''You are going to have to harmonize self-interest with the public interest,'' Mr. Florio said. ''If you are concerned about drugs in your nice suburban schools, you better be concerned about the market that is operating in an urban community. Because that is where it all comes from.
''You, business person, are going to have to try to help with the drug rehabilitation problem that we have,'' he continued. ''Not because it is the nice thing to do, but because evidence is that 14 percent of the work force has a drug- or alcohol-related problem.''
Businesses must be encouraged to provide child care for the mothers they need to attract in a tight labor market, Mr. Florio said, and suburbs must be encouraged to invest in the cities to help reduce the cost of government and ease their own congestion.
 
One Pair of Shoes
Mr. Florio was born in Brooklyn in 1937 and raised on East Seventh Street in Flatbush, a Jewish, Italian and Irish neighborhood much like the Camden districts he later represented. People there equated government with the New Deal and considered government jobs the most dependable kind.
Like many people in Camden, Mr. Florio's father lost his shipbuilding job after World War II, and Mr. Florio recalls a painful struggle to keep the family afloat. Starting at age 12, he developed an almost fanatical work schedule and a spartan sensibility.
''My philosophy has always been, I have one pair of shoes because I have one pair of feet,'' he said. ''My father always worked, always worked very hard. It is just beyond comprehension that anyone would not.''
At age 17 Mr. Florio dropped out of high school to join the Navy, where he fought as an amateur boxer and received blows that crushed his left cheekbone, leaving that half of his face permanently sunken.
On his return he earned a high school equivalency diploma and attended Trenton State Teachers College, where he graduated magna cum laude. Later, he took graduate courses at Columbia University and attended Rutgers Law School while working as a night janitor to support his wife and three children. #15 Races in 20 Years At 25, he went to work as a district leader with the Camden Democratic machine and pursued politics with the same energy.In 1968, he recalls being inspired by the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy, who delivered a speech in Camden with a ''serene, almost spiritual quality.''
Starting with an Assembly race in 1969, Mr. Florio ran for public office 15 times in 20 years. During that time almost all of Camden's factories shut down and its white work force moved out. The new suburbanites, often enraged at the city and minorities, were pried loose from the Democratic coalition by Republicans during the Nixon and Reagan years.
But Mr. Florio worked to appeal to voters in both worlds. Beginning with his first, unsuccessful Congressional bid in 1972, when he ran on a ticket headed by George McGovern, he stressed day care, transportation, the environment, and other issues that defied easy labels of left and right.
In his 14 years in the House, Mr. Florio has won the respect of Democratic colleagues for his record on consumer, transportation and environmental issues, including his authorship of the 1980 Superfund law that allocated billions of dollars to clean up toxic-waste sites.
Though he lacked the intellectual breadth of Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey or Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York, Democratic colleagues say, he gained an unrivaled expertise in issues he concentrated upon. #2 Races for Governor Mr. Florio ran twice for governor, in 1977 and again in 1981, when he lost a substantial lead to be beaten by Mr. Kean by 1,797 votes.
At times during that campaign, Mr. Florio's manner seemed forced and rigid. The candidate turned prickly when questions turned personal. By the end, Mr. Kean was parodying his opponent's lengthy and technical responses.
Opponents said that the 1981 race revealed Mr. Florio for who he was: a brusque loner, well-versed in public policy but insensitive to people.
After he lost the governorship, a number of his associates went to work in Camden County, where, two years before, Mr. Florio and his supporters had overthrown the Democratic machine controlled by Mayor Angelo J. Errichetti.
Republicans say the best testament to Mr. Florio's use of government is the record of his allies who governed Camden County throughout the 1980's. Camden County government, they charge, has existed largely to promote the interests of Mr. Florio and his party.
 
'Spreading Money' Around
''They were spreading money to everybody and his brother,'' said Michael DiPiero, a Republican freeholder from Camden.
In one case, Joseph C. Salema, Mr. Florio's chief of staff, and Nicholas Rudi, a campaign aide who became the county administrator and treasurer, left their jobs to form a consulting firm that then received hundreds of thousands of dollars in no-bid consulting contracts from the county.
In another, Mr. Salema, Mr. Rudi and Mr. Florio, with other investors, bought the faltering Continental Bank of New Jersey with promissory notes that they never had to repay. The county subsequently deposited $2 million there.
After newspapers raised questions of impropriety, Mr. Florio sold his interest in the bank and donated the profits to Trenton State College.
In a third case, Dr. William Steinberg, a Florio campaign contributor, received a $1.1 million no-bid contract to supply staff doctors to the county hospital. Mr. DiPiero charged that the county could have obtained cheaper bids.
The Greater Camden Development Corporation was shut down in 1986 after being accused of distributing patronage and Federal housing money to allies of the Democrats. And the County Parks Commission, embroiled in charges that it handed out jobs to party loyalists, was abolished last year and is under a grand jury investigation.
Despite several investigations into charges of corruption, however, there have been no indictments.
''Jim Florio is the boss of Camden County,'' said Mr. Hensley of the Courter campaign.
But Mr. Florio says he was never involved in the workings of county government, instead devoting his time to his work in Congress.
During the 1980's, he says, his allies broke no laws and were engaging in common practices. But he says he was disturbed by such practices and supports efforts begun last year by the new Freeholder Director, Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat, to clean up county government and impose a strict ethics code. And he has proposed a strict ethic code for state government.
''With hindsight, did these people think about how it would look when people looked back?'' Mr. Florio asked. ''I suspect probably not.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 16, 1989, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about Representative James J. Florio, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, referred incorrectly to an investment involving the Continental Bank of New Jersey. Mr. Florio was part of a group that bought the bank's building and land, not the bank itself.
In addition, the group has made payments on a promissory note used to finance the purchase.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Most in U.S. Back Bush Strategy on Drugs

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
Seven out of 10 Americans approve of President Bush's strategy to fight drugs, and 6 out of 10 say they think that the plan, if enacted, will significantly reduce the nation's drug problem, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Even so, there was division on whether Mr. Bush would succeed in curbing illegal drug sales and use and whether his spending priorities were the right ones.
But despite those differences there was striking public agreement about the priority that drugs should command on the national agenda.
The proportion of Americans who cited drugs as the nation's most important problem has nearly tripled since the end of July, to 64 percent from 22 percent. The rise came after weeks of sustained news coverage of the worsening crack epidemic and the turmoil caused by cocaine barons in Colombia and after Mr. Bush's address to the nation Tuesday when he outlined his anti-drug policy. 
The percentage was the highest recorded for any single issue since the Times/CBS News poll began in 1976 and is one of the highest registered by any major national survey.
 
A National Consensus
Americans in every region and every income level reported that in some way illegal drugs had intruded upon their lives. Forty-eight percent of the adults questioned said they knew someone who had been ''seriously affected'' by illegal drugs, either through that person's drug use or another's. Twenty-eight percent said they knew of a specific drug seller or a place in their community where drugs were sold.
The nationwide telephone poll of 824 adults began Sept. 6, the night after Mr. Bush's speech, and concluded Sept. 8. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Over all, 69 percent said they approved of Mr. Bush's drug package, and 56 percent said that if it was enacted the plan would lead to a ''significant reduction'' in the drug problem. Seventy-three percent said they believed it was possible to significantly reduce the drug problem, while 19 percent said it was beyond control.
But there was division over whether Mr. Bush would actually reach his goal. Thirty-eight percent said he would be able to reduce the drug problem, but 44 percent said he would not.
Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they had heard or seen Mr. Bush's speech, and of that group, 81 percent said they approved of his plan.
The program calls for higher spending in areas like building new prisons and increasing military and economic aid to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, the primary sources of cocaine shipped into the United States. Roughly 70 percent of the money is earmarked for law enforcement and 30 percent for treatment and education. Forty-three percent of those surveyed said there was too much emphasis on law enforcement rather than on root causes of drug use like poverty and unemployment; 42 percent said the emphasis was appropriate.
The public was sharply divided on whether Mr. Bush's proposed $7.9 billion was an appropriate sum to fight drugs. The largest fraction, 38 percent, said it was the ''right amount.'' But 22 percent said it was ''too little'' and 16 percent said it was ''too much.''
There was general agreement that the Federal Government should spend more than in the past to combat drugs. Fifty-six percent said that in general they favored such higher spending, and 39 percent even said they would be willing to pay $100 a year more in taxes to increase the budget for drug programs, although Mr. Bush has pledged not to raise taxes.
While there was widespread familiarity with illegal narcotics among most age levels, most striking was the high percentage of young adults who reported being touched by drugs.
Among the 18- to 29-year-olds, 45 percent said they knew of a place in their community where illegal drugs were sold, or of a person who sold them. The figure dropped to 27 percent among 30- to 44-year-olds and to 26 percent among 45- to 64-year-olds.
Twenty-eight percent of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they had seen drugs sold in their neighborhood, as did 12 percent of those who are 30 to 64 years old.
There were clear generational patterns among those who said they had tried illegal drugs. Over all, 28 percent of those surveyed said they had tried an illegal drug, but the figure rose to 38 percent among 30- to 44-year-olds and 50 percent among 18- to 29-year-olds.
Mr. Bush's program puts new emphasis on punishing not only drug sellers but also drug users. Still, 47 percent of those surveyed said the sellers were more responsible than users for the nation's drug problem. Thirty-one percent said the users were more responsible, and 20 percent said the groups were equally to blame.
Sixty-one percent of those surveyed endorsed requiring ''workers in general'' to be tested for illegal drug use, a point stressed in Mr. Bush's plan. In a Times/CBS News poll in August 1986 only 44 percent favored such a policy. In the recent poll 24 percent said testing of workers would be an unfair invasion of privacy, a sharp decline from the 44 percent of three years ago.
Sixty-two percent said they would favor mandatory drug testing for high school students, while 27 percent said it would be an unfair invasion of privacy.
Mr. Bush's plan calls for a major increase in expanding Federal prisons for drug offenders, as well as stiffer penalties for drug users convicted for the first time. Eighty-four percent of those questioned said first offenders should be sent to treatment programs, while 8 percent said they should be imprisoned. Seventy percent said jail should be mandatory for repeat offenders, while 16 percent favored treatment.
 
Replies From Drug Users
Those who say they have tried illegal drugs are as likely as all adults to approve of Mr. Bush's plan. Sixty-four percent said of that group supported it, as against 69 percent of all adults surveyed.
But those who report having ever used drugs were more likely to say that law enforcement gets too much emphasis, as against treatment and education.
In addition, 75 percent of those who have tried drugs at some time said that someone who smoked marijuana occasionally should not be prosecuted, while 50 percent of the general public gave that response.
Mr. Bush has said he would not send troops to Colombia in a combat role, although White House officials said they would consider such a request if Colombia's President made it.
If there was such a request, 42 percent of those surveyed said the United States should send the troops, while 47 percent said it should not. Support for dispatching soldiers fell to 34 percent if the troops could be in Colombia for a year or more.
The poll showed that Mr. Bennett, a former Secretary of Education, is still not well known among the public. Seventy-three of those surveyed said they ''didn't know enough'' about him to have an opinion, 11 percent said they had a favorable opinion and 3 percent unfavorable.
For Mr. Bush, however, the approval rating was 70 percent, up from 61 percent in June, but statistically indistinguishable from the 67 percent registered in July.
Until the latest poll, the highest percentage of Americans listing a single issue in the Times/CBS Poll was in October 1979, when 52 percent cited the economy. In the Gallup Poll, which asks people to list more than one problem issue facing the country, 81 percent cited inflation in October 1974.
No current issue approaches drugs for capturing the public's interest as a major problem. The economy was a distant second in the Times/CBS News poll, cited by only 5 percent, followed by the poor, with 3 percent. In the Times survey six weeks ago, 22 percent cited drugs as the most important problem, followed by 9 percent for the deficit and 8 percent for unemployment and jobs.
When asked in a separate question for the most important problem facing the community they live in, the public mentioned drugs more than any other topic, with 35 percent saying it was the most important local problem.
George C. Edward 3d, a professor of political science at Texas A & M University who has studied public opinion and the presidency, said: ''The President is exploiting the moment, if you will, and I use that in a positive sense Normally, a President is not able to set the agenda quite so easily.
''But there has not been a lot of news in domestic policy recently and, rather remarkably, the media has given a tremendous amount of attention not only to the President's speech but to specials on drugs.''
 
How the Poll on Drugs Was Taken
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 6-8 with 824 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country.
The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for people who are 18 to 29 years old it is plus or minus seven percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: House Fight Continues On Cutting Gains Tax

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee will return to its struggle over capital gains tax reduction on Tuesday with committee Democrats and the House Democratic leadership no closer to a consensus than they were before the August recess.
The Ways and Means panel is under orders from the House Budget Committee to complete action on tax legislation by the end of this week, so committee proposals for raising $5.3 billion in new revenue can be rolled into the deficit reduction package Congress must pass by Oct. 16 if it is to avoid automatic budget cuts. The committee has already agreed on how to raise the revenue but has been stymied for weeks over an Administration-backed proposal to reduce the capital gains tax temporarily.
The capital gains proposal, sponsored by Representative Ed Jenkins, Democrat of Georgia, would reduce the capital gains rate - currently 28 percent for most taxpayers - to about 20 percent for 18 months. The proposal is supported by all 13 Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee as well as five other committee Democrats, giving Mr. Jenkins the 19 votes he needs for passage. 
 
Liberal Economists Oppose Plan
A group of liberal economists criticized Mr. Jenkins's proposal in a Capitol Hill news conference today, contending it would ultimately increase the budget deficit. ''An across-the-board, temporary tax cut, by encouraging the churning of assets, would worsen the shortsightedness that plagues the United States investment horizon,'' the economists said in a statement.
''A temporary tax cut will reward those who have already made profitable investments and not at all those who must choose whether to invest in the future. After a quick surge, revenues will fall both because capital gains realizations induced in the short term are at least partly borrowed from those that would have been realized later, and because the long-term economic benefits are negligible.''
The statement was signed by Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Alan Blinder, chairman of the department of economics at Princeton University; Alan Auerbach, chairman of the department of economics at the University of Pennsylvania; Lawrence Summers, a professor of economics at Harvard University, and Joseph Minarik, executive director of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
 
Rostenkowski Proposes Indexing
To derail the Jenkins plan, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, has proposed an indexing alternative that would allow taxpayers to avoid taxes on the portion of their capital gains solely attributable to inflation. Although Mr. Rostenkowski's plan has the general backing of the House Democratic leadership, it has so far failed to move any of the committee Democrats supporting Mr. Jenkins.
The issue was further muddled today when Representative Byron L. Dorgan, a liberal Democrat from North Dakota and a member of the Ways and Means panel, said he would propose yet another alternative to lower the capital gains tax rate to 19.6 percent permanently for taxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000, while extending the 33 percent marginal tax rate to certain upper-income taxpayers. His proposal would provide a smaller capital gains break for those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,00 and no break for those with incomes above $200,000.
Mr. Dorgan told reporters that while he preferred no change in the capital gains rate, if a rate cut was inevitable, it should be aimed at the middle class - those now taxed at a marginal rate of 33 percent - rather than the wealthiest taxpayers, who are taxed at 28 percent. He contended the primary benefits of the Jenkins and the Rostenkowski plans would go to taxpayers with incomes of more than $100,000.
Under current law, a taxpayer with two children and filing a joint return is taxed at a 28 percent rate on income between $47,500 and $105,000. Those with incomes between $105,000 and $260,000 are taxed at a 33 percent rate, while for those with income above $260,000, the rate drops back to 28 percent.
Mr. Dorgan's plan would maintain the 33 percent rate for those with incomes above $260,000.
The plan's emphasis on middle-income taxpayers may have some appeal among some House Democrats, but House Democratic leaders, fearful of endorsing any proposal Republicans might characterize as a tax increase, are likely to be wary of extending the 33 percent income tax rate to those who now pay at a 28 percent rate. Mr. Dorgan said, however, that he expected to raise the proposal on the House floor if it failed in the committee.

HEADLINE: Dow Loses 5.13 Points as Trading Slows

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks fell moderately yesterday in exceptionally slow trading as a late burst of blue-chip buying sharply shaved losses on the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow dropped 5.13 points, to 2,704.41, after being down more than 21 points in the early afternoon. At the same time, declines on the New York Stock Exchange, at 936, smothered the 530 issues that advanced. 
''A lot of the potential participants in the stock market are still on vacation,'' said Jack Conlon, executive vice president at Nikko Securities. ''The retail sales number on new domestic car sales for the first 10 days of September, to be released on Wednesday, should provide more action into Friday and next week.''
Other key economic indicators scheduled to come out this week are retail sales on Thursday, and business inventories, the United States trade balance, producer prices, industrial production and capacity utilization on Friday.
''There could be a decline beginning early next week that could lead to a correction of between 5 and 10 percent over the short term,'' Mr. Conlon said. ''If the drop occurs in an orderly fashion, however, it should not be viewed with alarm.''
 
Decline Doubled at Midday
Equities began the day broadly but only moderately lower from a blue-chip standpoint. The Dow was off about eight points after the first half-hour before more than doubling that decline at midday.
Some program trading and caution ahead of Friday's ''triple witching hour,'' when the spot contract in stock options - in this case September -stock index futures, and options on stock index futures expire, also curtailed buying. The next triple witching hour will come in December.
In the broader market yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.10 points, to 347.66, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index eased by 0.65, to 193.30.
Volume on the Big Board contracted sharply to a skimpy 126 million shares, from 154.1 million on Friday. This was the lightest volume since 68.87 million shares were traded on July 3.
With little conviction as to the direction of the overall stock market after the Dow's recent failed efforts to finish above its Aug. 24 high, investors appeared content, if not enthusiastic, about concentrating on special-situation issues, especially takeover-related stocks.
UAL, for instance, dropped 3 7/8, to 276 3/8. A spokesman for Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, the New York leveraged buyout firm, said it was not interested in bidding for the parent of United Airlines. On Friday, Kohlberg, Kravis was said to have contacted the United Air Lines machinists' union about possibly bidding for the airline.
 
AMR Up on Trump Report
AMR rose 2 3/4, to 83 3/4, following a report in USA Today in which Dan Dorfman said that Donald J. Trump had taken a stake in the parent of American Airlines. Both parties declined to comment on the report.
Manufacturers Hanover Trust climbed 2 7/8, to 42 1/2. The company said it was holding talks on the possible acquisition of a part interest in its CIT Group subsidiary by the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.
Among the active issues, A.T&T. was the Big Board's busiest stock, rising 7/8, to 40, on a volume of more than 1.9 million shares. General Electric added 1/8 at 56 5/8; Eastman Kodak eased 1/8, to 49 3/4, and Exxon rose 1/4, to 44 5/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market value index fell 1.67 points, to 382.43, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index slipped by 0.89, to 470.42.

HEADLINE: Accountants Group Urges A Financial Officer for U.S.

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has urged the Bush Administration and lawmakers to name a chief financial officer of the United States to oversee the recording, monitoring and reporting of the Government's financial operations.
Borrowing two other ideas from the private sector, the professional body is also proposing that the Government adopt a uniform financial accounting and reporting system to replace several hundred systems now in use. The organization would also like to see the Government submit to annual independent audits. 
 
Report by Study Group
The recommendations, detailed in a report that was sent to the Bush Administration and members of Congress over the weekend, are the results of an eight-member study group formed in 1987 by the organization to suggest ways of improving how the Government accounts for its vast operations. The institute, with 285,000 members, is the profession's national organization and principal self-regulatory body.
''I'm all for it,'' said Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, who plans to reintroduce legislation backing a finance officer. ''Had there been a C.F.O., it is far, far less likely we would have had a Housing and Urban Development scandal breaking.
''I don't know how many H.U.D.'s are out there waiting to be discovered,'' Mr. Glenn added, ''but we'd like to get a C.F.O. in there making sure it does not happen again.''
Internal investigators at H.U.D. and Congressional panels have uncovered widespread favoritism and mismanagement in H.U.D. programs during the Reagan Administration. The agency has estimated that the mismanagement may have cost the Government more than $2 billion.
Other governmental accounting experts agree with the New York-based group's recommendation for a finance officer, but think the inevitable turf battles will prove its demise.
The leading contenders for the high-level position would probably be from the accounting community -possibly from the ranks of the study group itself. Mandating independent audits for more than 300 Federal agencies, departments and offices would also create huge amounts of paid work for public accounting firms.
''That could be self-serving,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University. Comparison With Medical Profession Cornelius E. Tierney, the national director of government practice for Ernst & Young and the chairman of the study group, said he did not dispute that the proposal would strike some that way. ''But I don't think it's any more self-serving than the medical profession discussing a medical problem,'' he said.
The idea of creating a chief financial officer is not entirely novel. House and Senate committees have conducted hearings on the issue, and the Office of Management and Budget recently added the finance officer's title to an associate director of management.
Nonetheless, the accounting group contends that the chief financial officer needs the statutory support of Congress to be effective. Under the proposal, the executive would be appointed by the President, subject to Congressional approval, for 15 years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Lower in U.S. After Posting Gains Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower amid profit taking on domestic markets today after rising in overseas trading. Gold prices edged lower. Analysts said the dollar's upward momentum was slowed by increases in market interest rates in other countries, including West Germany, and United States traders, fearing the dollar would decline in response to those developments, rushed to take profits. 
''Interest rate differentials begin to work against the dollar at this level,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust in Chicago.
 
Economic Data Awaited
In earlier overseas trading, the dollar rose, but dealers said three coming economic reports from Washington have made traders reluctant to push the currency much higher.
The Commerce Department's August retail sales figures will be announced on Thursday, and on Friday reports are due on the July trade deficit figures and August producer prices.
''Anyone buying dollars at this stage is taking a big risk,'' said an American investment bank dealer in London.
The financial markets are concerned that the Federal Reserve might change its monetary policy in response to the reports, which will give an indication of the economy's health. If the economy is strong, the Fed would be expected to keep credit tight - a move dollar investors would prefer.
The dollar fell against the British pound in New York. It cost $1.5460 to buy one British pound, compared with $1.5380 on Friday. In London earlier, a pound cost $1.5450, cheaper than the $1.5505 late Friday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with Friday's prices, included: 1.9865 West German marks, down from 1.9950; 1.7135 Swiss francs, down from 1.7245; 6.6910 French francs, down from 6.7195; 1,425.875 Italian lire, up from 1,421.00, and 1.18715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18745.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.9875 West German marks, up from 1.9795; 1.7150 Swiss francs, up from 1.7080; 6.6970 French francs, up from 6.6710; 2.2425 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2320; 1,424.75 Italian lire, up 1,421.70, and 1.1873 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1877.
 
Gold Prices Down
Gold prices slipped in all major markets. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $358.10 a troy ounce for gold, down from $359.40 on Friday, and on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold slipped to $359.20 an ounce, from $359.40 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Allies Faulted On Dollar Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The director of a Washington research organization said today that economic cooperation among the leading industrial nations had collapsed, and as a result the dollar has risen to heights that will cause trade imbalances to worsen.
Speaking at a press luncheon, the director of the Institute for International Economics, Fred Bergsten, said that by allowing the dollar to rise 10 to 15 percent this year, the seven leading industrial democracies had insured that the current account deficit of the United States, which measures trade in goods and services, would grow by $80 billion to $200 billion by 1992. 
The Group of Seven, which is mde up of the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, has attempted since 1985 to bring the world economy into balance by coordinating economic policies and controlling exchange rates.
Representatives of those countries will meet in Washington this month on the eve of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Bergsten, a former top Treasury official during the Carter Administration, said the group's ''reference ranges'' for trading in the dollar had not merely been breached, they had all but disappeared.
As a result, the group has lost all credibility in the financial markets and currency traders are no longer so wary about driving the dollar up to levels that cannot be sustained by economic fundamentals, he added.
To improve the process of United States exchange rate policy-making, a new study by the institute recommends that Congress and private business be given a louder voice.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Press for Talks On Aid Tied to Exports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Bush Administration told Congress today that it planned ''vigorous new negotiations'' to dissuade industrial governments from using foreign aid programs to expand their exports.
A report to Congress released today, which was mandated by last year's Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, recommended such negotiations as part of a package to reduce the commercial disadvantage for American exporters from so-called tied-aid credit practices.
Under such practices, an industrial country, like France or Japan, gives a low-interest loan or grant to a developing country for a major project, like a power station or telecommunications system, but with strings attached: The equipment must come exclusively from that donor country. Legitimate or Unfair? Many industrial competitors consider the practice a legitimate way of allocating foreign aid. The United States regards it as unfair export competition. One of the reasons for the difference is that the American aid program has traditionally been geared more to satisfying basic human needs in developing countries. Relatively small sums are available to support exports or to generate the sort of activity requiring the purchase of United States industrial products. 
Some politicians and business people termed the initiatives announced today as weak and held out little hope that much would be achieved.
''In terms of the magnitude of the tied-aid credit problem, the Administration's response is minimalist,'' commented Willard M. Berry, vice president of the National Foreign Trade Council.
Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, said the report was ''unrealistic.''
The negotiations called for by the study would be conducted within the Paris-based group of 24 industrial countries known as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
According to estimates by the National Foreign Trade Council, an American business organization whose 500 member companies account for 70 percent of American exports, one-third of the $25 billion to $30 billion a year of capital goods traded worldwide is financed through tied-aid packages.
 
Up to $1 Billion in Losses
According to a report last April by the Export-Import Bank, the American agency that provides credit to the customers of American exports, American industry is losing up to $1 billion a year of foreign sales because of such export-linked foreign aid.
It is not the first time that the United States has sought to curb the practice through negotiations.
After O.E.C.D. talks that ended in the spring of 1987, an agreement was reached under which the concessional part of an export credit package was lifted from 25 to 35 percent, so that a donor country would have to give a larger aid donation to win the business. The hope was that by making it more expensive the practice would be discouraged.
Instead, by most estimates, tied-aid credit offers have increased. Their value in 1988 was placed by the Export-Import Bank at $15 billion, compared with $12 billion in 1986.

HEADLINE: REVIVAL IS URGED FOR WIDER I.R.A.'s

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, today proposed a restoration of widely available, tax-deductible individual retirement accounts as an alternative to President Bush's plan to lower the tax rate on capital gains.
The proposal by the Texas Democrat represented an attempt to capture some political advantage for Democrats on the tax issue. It was immediately endorsed by George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, who said: ''The Senate and the American people now have a clear choice between competing plans to advance our economy. The Republican plan, the President's plan, is to give a very large tax cut to a very small number of Americans, those at the very top of the income scale. The Democratic plan, the Bentsen plan, is to give all Americans a tax incentive.''
After a speech tonight to a business organization, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, the Administration's chief economic spokesman, said he was not familiar with the details of the Bentsen proposal, but that ''I.R.A.'s are one of the things we are looking at.'' 
''The problem,'' he said, ''is that it's enormously expensive. Obviously, we have to take that into account.'' In his speech, Mr. Brady proposed a separate tax initiative, suggesting a reduction not only in capital gains taxes but also in taxes on corporate dividends as a step toward reducing the cost of capital to American companies, making them more competitive with those abroad and ending ''the bias of the tax system toward debt financing.''
Mr. Brady's speech, to the American Business Conference, an organization of medium-size, rapidly growing companies, was not intended as a rejoinder to Mr. Bentsen.
Rather, Treasury officials said, it was the first of a series of speeches by the Secretary this fall devoted to the competitiveness of American companies. It was his first important speech as Treasury Secretary that did not involve an immediate crisis like the budget negotiations, the savings and loan crisis or third world debt.
Mr. Bentsen's I.R.A. proposal came as Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, struggled to reach a compromise among committee members on alternatives to an outright cut in the capital gains rate. The committee met in closed session for two hours and came to no resolution, but there were indications that Mr. Rostenkowski made some headway toward a consensus among Democrats and Republicans on the panel.
Proponents of a capital gains tax cut have argued that reducing the rate would stimulate investment and capital formation. But Mr. Bentsen, who has in the past favored a reduction in capital gains taxes, said the I.R.A. deduction, by encouraging saving, was a better way to accomplish that goal. In broad economic terms, the larger a country's savings pool, the more savings, instead of borrowing, can be used to finance investment.
Neither Mr. Bentsen nor Mr. Brady addressed where the money would come from to offset the revenue lost from the tax breaks they suggested.
Mr. Bentsen said his plan, which would allow half the money invested in an I.R.A. each year to be deducted and would also permit penalty-free withdrawals to pay for college expenses and first-time home purchases, would cost the Government $1.2 billion in the first year, rising to $4 billion by 1994.
A reduction in the capital gains tax would actually raise several billion dollars for the Government in the first year as investors rushed to take advantage of the lower rate. Many experts believe it would lose significantly more in subsequent years, but the Bush Administration disputes that analysis.
A senior Treasury official said the Brady idea of allowing corporations to deduct the dividends they pay shareholders could eventually cost $30 billion to $40 billion a year in lost revenues if a full deduction is permitted.
The budget deficit, the official said, ''stands in the way of doing anything dramatic'' and meant that any dividend deduction would have to be put in place gradually.
Until the 1986 tax law was enacted, individuals could deduct from their taxes up to $2,000 a year for money invested in a retirement account. The deduction was especially popular among middle- and upper-income taxpayers.
The 1986 law, however, disallowed the deduction for taxpayers with incomes above $35,000 ($50,000 for a couple) who were enrolled in company pension plans. Since the law was passed, the number of people investing in I.R.A.'s has fallen sharply.
 
Stimulating Saving
Mr. Brady and Mr. Bentsen maintained that restoring the deduction would stimulate personal saving. But economists are divided on whether the old system actually increased saving or merely encouraged taxpayers to shift money that would have been saved anyway into an account with tax advantages.
Mr. Bentsen did not say whether his proposal to allow penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s to pay higher education bills and make a downpayment on a home would apply to existing accounts. As the law stands now, money is taxable when it is withdrawn, and a 10 percent penalty applies if it is withdrawn before the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2.
Initial reaction in the Wall Street community to restoring widely available I.R.A. deductions was highly positive, with some Wall Street representatives predicting that some form of liberalized I.R.A.'s would sail through Congress because of the popularity of the issue and the support of such lawmakers as Mr. Bentsen, regardless of what would happen on capital gains.
Democrats have been reeling on the capital gains issue since early summer, when it became apparent that six Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee were prepared to break party ranks and vote for a rate cut. That would send the measure to the House floor, and Democrats are unsure they could win there.
The capital gains tax cut proposal currently pending before the Ways and Means committee, which is sponsored by Representative Ed Jenkins, Democrat of Georgia, would temporarily lower the capital gains rate to 19.6 percent from the current 28 percent rate paid by most taxpayers. It has the backing of the Bush Administartion and all 13 Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee.
The committee is scheduled to resume its deliberations on Wednesday. The panel must complete action on tax legislation by the end of this week so that its proposals for raising revenue can be incorporated into this year's deficit-reduction package.
In the meantime, in another concession to political pressure, Mr. Rostenkowski said today that he would favor repeal of rules that require companies to give the same tax-free medical insurance benefits to rank-and-file workers that they provide their executives. Lobbyists for small businesses, for which this is very expensive, have worked vigorously against the rules.
 
Not Cleared by White House
At the Treasury, senior officials, who did not wish to be identified, said Mr. Brady's speech had not been cleared by the White House. But the officials said an Administration working group on saving and the cost of capital, headed by Robert Glauber, Under Secretary of the Treasury for finance, had been meeting for six weeks with an eye toward producing proposals that could be included in President Bush's budget and State of the Union message early next year.
''One of the Bush Administration's top priorities,'' Mr. Brady said, is ''to maintain our competitiveness where it's strong and to rebuild it where it has faltered.''
Mr. Brady maintained that the cost of capital - what companies pay after taxes for equity and debt financing - was higher in the United States than in most other developed countries. ''Our high cost of capital makes long-term investments too expensive and forces capital into short-term projects,'' he said.
The first step toward bringing down the cost, he said, was to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Other steps, he added, were to enact Mr. Bush's proposal to lower the capital gains tax and to find ways to increase the rate of personal saving.
A fourth measure, he said, would be to ''work toward the goal of tax integration, removing the double taxation on dividends.''
Under current law, corporations must pay taxes on profits before those profits are passed on in dividends to shareholders. The shareholders must then pay income taxes on the dividends they receive. Many economists believe this system encourages debt financing, since interest payments, unlike dividends, are considered a deductible expense for corporations.
 
Brady Takes Issue
Mr. Brady took issue with those in Congress who would change the system by limiting the deductibility of corporate interest payments. That would be a ''mistake,'' he said, because it would ''make capital more expensive for American companies and hurt their ability to compete.''
Instead, he added, the tax on dividends should be lowered.
The senior officials who briefed reporters said the Treasury Secretary had not decided whether corporations that pay dividends or individuals who receive them should get the tax break.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Shortages Predicted for 90's In Professors of Humanities

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
Unless preventive steps are taken soon, American colleges and universities face a major shortage of faculty members starting in the next several years, according to the most comprehensive study ever conducted of the academic job market.
Contrary to the common wisdom, the study, released yesterday, found that the biggest shortfalls will occur not in the sciences but in the humanities and social sciences, and that the shortage will be caused mainly by growth in student enrollments and not by large-scale retirements of professors.
''We need to increase overall production of new Ph.D.'s by two-thirds,'' said William G. Bowen, co-author of the report. ''In the humanities and social sciences, we need to double the current numbers.'' 
 
First Statistical Confirmation
The study was conducted by Mr. Bowen, former president of Princeton University, who is now president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Julie Ann Sosa, a Princeton graduate now studying at Oxford University.
Their research provides the first statistical confirmation of a faculty shortage that has been discussed anecdotally in academic circles for the last three years.
It also puts some new twists on the debate, starting with its rejection of prevailing thought that the expected faculty shortages will result primarily from the extensive retirement of faculty members hired as American higher education was expanding in the 1950's and 1960's.
 
Main Factors Are Demographic
While such retirements will create much of the vacancies, the year-by-year rate at which they occur is expected to be steady. The major cause of the shortage will be the opening up of new jobs to accommodate a growth in enrollment expected to begin in 1997. ''The main factors are demographic,'' Mr. Bowen said, referring to the bulge of students now moving through elementary schools.
This finding alone could reduce concern about new Federal legislation banning mandatory retirement.
''Eliminating mandatory retirement won't kill off jobs,'' said Mr. Bowen. ''You're talking about a couple of percentage points.''
The study, ''Prospects for Faculty in the Arts and Sciences: A Study of Factors Affecting Demand and Supply 1987-2012,'' is being published by Princeton University Press at 41 William Street in Princeton, N.J. 08540.
The picture the authors paint of what Mr. Bowen called a ''serious staffing problem'' in higher education contrasts sharply with popular images since the 1970's, when hiring became sluggish and the taxi-driving Ph.D. an established part of the American scene.
The study reported that in the 1987-1992 period, there will be 1.6 candidates available for each available teaching position. But by 1997-2002, the figure will drop to 0.83 for each job, with 30,934 new faculty members to fill an estimated 37,091 positions. . For 2002-2007 the figure is projected to be 0.82.
 
Where Real Shortfalls Lie
The study found that contrary to widespread belief, the pending faculty shortage would not be concentrated in the natural sciences. ''There's a problem in the sciences,'' said Mr. Bowen, ''but the real shortfalls lie in the humanities and social sciences.''
The study estimated that in the 1997-2002 period the candidates-to-jobs ratio would be 0.71 in the humanities and social sciences, 0.80 in mathematics and the physical sciences, and 1.13 in the biological sciences and psychology.
Mr. Bowen said a ''flight from the arts and sciences'' was the cause. His data show that from 1971 to 1985 the percentage of graduate and undergraduate degrees conferred in the arts and sciences fell to 25 percent, from 40 percent. By contrast, major increases occurred in business and engineering.
Mr. Bowen emphasized that as in any industry, the ideal situation would be a ratio of roughly 1.3 candidates available for each job. ''You never have a perfect match,'' he said. ''If you're looking for a Renaissance scholar, it doesn't help much to have an economist available.''
 
Rise in Doctorates Needed
The study estimated that restoring the overall ratio to the 1.3 level would require a 64 percent increase in new doctorates. To do so in the humanities and social sciences would require a 92 percent increase.
Quality problems are also an issue. A ratio close to 1.0 means that colleges are in the position of having to hire just about anyone who comes along. The quality issue is magnified, he said, by data showing that the proportion of doctorates being awarded by major research universities is declining.
The study focused on the arts and sciences in four-year institutions and did not cover professional schools or their undergraduate equivalents in fields like education, engineering or business.
Mr. Bowen emphasized that the findings of the study were projections rather than predictions. ''Enlightened policies can be adopted to increase the pipeline so that the shortages we envision do not come to pass,'' he said.
 
Steps to Ease Shortage
He said universities should shorten the time required to obtain a Ph.D., which now ranges from about 7 years in mathematics to more than 12 years in the humanities. One way of doing this would be to ease up on the number of hours that candidates must spend teaching.
Another need, he said, is to increase the number of fellowships and the amount they pay. Part of the responsibility for this, he said, lies with colleges and universities and part with the Federal Government, whose support for fellowships has declined substantially since the late 1960's.
''Prospects for Faculty in the Arts and Sciences'' is the first major study of the academic labor market since a 1974 report by Allan M. Cartter that discussed the tight conditions of the recent period.
The two researchers analyzed faculty employment data and other statistics compiled by the National Research Council and other sources. They were the first to use computers to develop overall conclusions about faculty employment by assembling data on various trends, like birth or college-going rates, and by factoring out Ph.D. holders likely to seek nonacademic employment and foreign nationals likely to return to their own countries.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expands Its Sanctions Against Panama

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it has expanded economic sanctions against Panama in an effort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to relinquish power there.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the measures included suspending imports of Panamanian sugar and widening the list of Panamanian companies and individuals associated with General Noriega to whom Americans will be barred from making payments.
The United States first imposed sanctions against Panama last year but so far they have failed to budge General Noriega, who is under United States indictment on charges of illegal drug trafficking. 
''All of these actions are a direct result of General Noriega's continued unwillingness to respect the will of the Panamanian people by stepping down and permitting the installation of a freely elected government,'' Miss Tutwiler said.
She said Panama's 1989 sugar quota of 30,537 metric tons has been reallocated to the other countries, which she did not name, that take part in the United States sugar quota program. The loss of the sugar quota denies the Panamanian Government close to $15 million in revenue, she said.
In addition, Miss Tutwiler said, the United States trade representative has suspended a further quota of 23,043 metric tons to which Panama would have been entitled because of a quota increase.
She also said that on Aug. 31, the Bush Administration expanded a list, first published last year, of Panamanian companies and individuals affiliated with General Noriega and the military-backed administration to which Americans cannot make payments. The list is undergoing further revisions and more additions will be published soon, she said, But she could not say how broad the expansion would be or how much revenue this action would keep from the Panamanian Government.
Although she acknowledged that the United States objective was General Noriega's removal as head of the Panamanian Defense Forces, she said the Administration could not be certain the new sanctions would achieve that goal.
President Bush opposed sanctions on China after Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last June, saying sanctions would hurt the people more than the leadership.
Asked to square that rationale with increased sanctions against Panama, Miss Tutwiler said, ''And as far as hurting the people, Noriega is hurting them more by staying.''

HEADLINE: Princely Love in Japan: A Semi-Public Thing

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
News flash from the Department of Fairy Tales Come True:
The second son of the Emperor and Empress of Japan was walking his girlfriend home from the university where she was studying three years ago, and he popped the question while they were waiting for a traffic light.
''I remember that I said something like, 'Will you spend your life with me?' '' Prince Aya, 23 years old, disclosed today about his street-corner marriage proposal, as Japanese reporters scooped up even the most mundane details of his engagement to the daughter of an economics professor.
The Prince made his comments at the first official announcement of his ''love marriage'' - as opposed to an arranged marriage - which became formal today when it was approved by the Imperial Household Council, a 10-member body headed by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
Since word leaked last month of the Prince's match with Kiko Kawashima, a commoner whom he met in a bookstore near Gakushuin University in Tokyo, Japanese have been delighted by the prospect of a royal wedding. 
The current Empress of Japan, Michiko, was the first commoner to marry a future Emperor, but she was from an upper-class industrial family, whereas Miss Kawashima's father is a faculty member of modest means who lives in university housing in Tokyo.
Miss Kawashima is said to speak excellent English and spent some time in the United States when her father did some research at the University of Pennsylvania.
Many commentators have said what a relief it has been to have the Prince, a slight, smiling young man with long hair and a mustache, become engaged in a year when Japan has been otherwise preoccupied by political crises, scandals and the like.
Prince Aya appeared today with his 23-year-old bride-to-be to answer questions, like whether he was the first man she had ever fallen in love with. ''May I answer that?'' she said when the question came, then added simply, ''Yes.''
 
There's a Senior Prince
The Prince is actually second in line of succession to the Chrysanthemum Throne occupied by Emperor Akihito, son of the late Emperor Hirohito, who died in January. Only after the end of the mourning period for Hirohito next Jan. 7 can the young couple marry.
Japanese are eagerly awaiting news of the more politically and socially significant marriage of Aya's older brother, Naruhito, who is not yet engaged although he is 29. Naruhito is to become Emperor on the death of his father. News reports have suggested that some conservative members of the Imperial Household Agency did not want Prince Aya to announce his marriage before that of his older brother. Even Prince Aya said today that it would have been ''preferable'' for his brother to marry before him.
Palace watchers agree that the main problem in finding a bride for Naruhito is concern over the enormous obligations that would be placed on the woman who is to become the next Empress. These burdens have reportedly been hard on Empress Michiko, and it is said that many well-to-do families would oppose having a daughter take on such a life.
The princess-to-be is doing graduate work in psychology at Gakushuin University, the alma mater for many members of the royal family, and Prince Aya is studying zoology at St. John's College at Oxford University, where he will graduate next June.
News accounts say the two met in 1985 when she joined a nature-and-culture club that he was heading at Gakushuin University, and they went on outings and mountain-climbing expeditions together, always accompanied by friends and chaperones.
''I saw him talking to his friends, and I thought he was much more unpretentious than I expected,'' Miss Kawashima recalled today.
Both Prince Aya and Miss Kawashima are said to be good tennis players, skiers and lovers of the outdoors. She said today that one of the first things that impressed her about her future husband was his affectionate approach to animals, like the catfish and ducks at the Imperial Palace.

HEADLINE: Human Activity Is Found to Harm Wildlife Areas

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The wildlife on Federal preserves is being harmed by human activities ranging from water-skiing to military dogfight practice, Congressional investigators reported today.
Managers in the Interior Department know that secondary uses of refuges are ''causing direct harm to wildlife,'' the investigators from the General Accounting Office concluded.
But their report said the managers often gave in to ''intense'' local pressure for more recreational areas, or were forced by law to share ownership of the land with other Government agencies or private interests like those with drilling rights. 
The G.A.O., an investigative arm of Congress, reported on the refuges at the request of Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on the environment, and Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on the environment.
The Fish and Wildlife Service, a part of the Interior Department that manages the preserves, acknowledged the problems in testimony prepared for a joint hearing that was held today by the two panels.
David Olsen, an assistant director of the wildlife service, said a review was under way to see whether the management system should be changed.
 
Conclusions of Study
Among the findings of the Congressional investigators were these:
* On the Des Lacs refuge in North Dakota, power boating and water-skiing have disturbed migratory bird nesting and the broods of newly hatched chicks. The production of ducks and other birds is 50 percent below what it could be.
* At the Chincoteague refuge in Virginia, off-road vehicles and thousands of visitors on the beaches are threatening the breeding of piping plovers, an endangered bird, and reducing the number of other migratory birds.
* At the Cabeza Prieta refuge in Arizona, military exercises, including air-to-air missile firings, are believed to be harming the desert bighorn sheep and the endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope. The exercises are authorized by Congress.
* Livestock grazing at the Browns Park refuge in Colorado is hampering efforts to improve goose and duck production, disturbing the nesting birds and destroying plant growth necessary to provide optional nesting habitats.
* Drilling for new gas wells and operating existing wells at the D'Arbonne refuge in Louisiana is destroying the habitat of endangered red cockaded woodpeckers and other wildlife. A Federal judge has permitted the continued drilling.
 
Issue of Compatibility
With Federal law requiring that refuge use be compatible with wildlife protection, Mr. Olsen said, ''The issue of compatibility determinations will receive a lot of attention'' in the Government review.
He said activities like water-skiing in the Des Lacs refuge ''would clearly seem incompatible.'' But he added, ''It is a historic use of the area, one that the local public has come to expect, and is therefore extremely hard to curtail or eliminate, as you might imagine.''
Mr. Olsen said the proximity of certain refuges to urban areas ''leads inevitably to pressure'' for picnic grounds, campsites, beaches, boat ramps, baseball fields, target ranges and other recreation. ''Once any of these forms of non-wildlife oriented public use becomes established,'' he said, ''it often increases and becomes difficult to terminate.''
The Congressional report said managers reported that secondary uses were occurring on 92 percent of all refuges, including ''all manner of public, economic and military activities,'' like power boating, mining, military air exercises and use of off-road vehicles.
Managers told the investigators that they were ''sometimes willing to accept the adverse effects of some harmful activities as the price of obtaining the good will of the local public or various economic interests.''

HEADLINE: David Dinkins, With a Roar

 BODY:
What a stunning victory - more decisive than anyone anticipated. David Dinkins toppled Ed Koch, the man who has held the title so long that ''Mayor'' and ''Koch'' blurred into one word, the politician who dared try for an unprecedented fourth term. Mr. Dinkins stopped him - by offering New Yorkers everything the Mayor is not.
The combative, driven, cheerleading Ed Koch masterfully brought New York through rough times. But a city now facing different torments hungers for change, and calm. Enter Mr. Dinkins -placid, contained, conciliatory. 
Mr. Dinkins maintained a gracious dignity throughout the campaign. Even on the last day, when the Mayor grabbed front-page attention with his call for unity, Mr. Dinkins shrugged, smiled -and remained comfortably in character. He is entitled to New York's applause, for his victory and for the honorable way he earned it.
Earned may also be the right word for Rudolph Giuliani's victory over Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir who lavished $13 million on his campaign. The two other Democrats, Comptroller Harrison Goldin and Richard Ravitch, conducted themselves with grace and restraint in the face of predictable defeat.
No one came within a mile of predicting so monumental a Dinkins victory. It could only have happened because a stream of white voters joined with blacks in supporting Mr. Dinkins - a hopeful portent that many New Yorkers yearn for racial peace and harmony. The general election is still to come, however. With the tragic racial murder in Bensonhurst raw in New York's memory, it's too early to conclude that the city has transcended polarization. This is a fit moment to recall a day last February. Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani met, at Mr. Giuliani's prescient suggestion, and pledged to defuse any potential racial misunderstanding. It's a pledge worth renewing.
The general election campaign offers voters the opportunity to hear the nominees on issues beyond race relations. They discussed their positions on crime and drugs early in the primary campaign. Then came Bensonhurst, overshadowing all else. New Yorkers will wish to know more about their views on the proposed City Charter overhaul, about land use, about economic growth. Who would they bring into government? Mr. Dinkins needs to demonstrate decisiveness and managerial skill; Mr. Giuliani has yet to show that he's more than a zealous crime buster.
But there's time for all that. At the moment, it's enough to reflect with gratitude on all Ed Koch has done for New York over 12 years, and with admiration on what David Dinkins achieved in the campaign. Six months ago, there were plenty of patronizing voices. What a shame, they said, that he had to throw away his comfortable job as Manhattan Borough President, in a lost cause. Now, with the Age of Koch suddenly crashing, those voices are gone, drowned out by the quiet roar of David Dinkins.

HEADLINE: Give the Poor Better Choices Than Drug Dealing and Addiction;
Dangers of Abuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lest any hasty or careless reader of your excellent Economic Watch account of my work on Federal marijuana enforcement (Sept. 5) might have received a misimpression about my views on legalization, allow me to state them briefly.
If marijuana were legally available, as alcohol and tobacco are legally available, it might be nearly as widely used and abused, particularly by adolescents, as alcohol and tobacco now are. In my view, that would be a bad result, so bad as to overwhelm whatever cost savings and revenue gains legalization would bring. Cutting back on Federal marijuana enforcement seems to me an obviously wise step with very limited risk. Legalization, by contrast, would be a high-risk gamble against unknown odds.

HEADLINE: Need Should Determine Student Financial Aid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A decision by the House of Representatives could have a severely adverse effect on the lives and prosperity of three million low-income Americans who depend on Pell Grant financial aid to attend college. By failing to increase Pell Grant funds to reflect rising college costs, increased student participation and a new funding estimate by the United States Education Department, the House plan reduces the top Pell Grant benefit level in the 1990-91 academic year by as much as 21 percent - from $2,300 to as little as $1,800.
The purchasing power of the maximum grant, which covered 46 percent of average college costs in 1979, covers only 29 percent of those costs today. Under the House plan, the grant's purchasing power falls below 23 percent, forcing even the neediest to assume heavy loan burdens. 
The House appropriation was accompanied by a committee statement decrying ''liberalizations in student aid rules'' that provided funds to ''nontraditional'' students, including students who do not receive financial support from their parents. This statement is very troubling. The central purpose of programs such as Pell Grants is to assure that ''nontraditional'' students have the same access to college as 18- to 22-year-old white males from affluent families.
That Federal policy has made it easier for low-income adults to attend college, often part time, is a great Congressional achievement, not a problem that needs fixing. That an increasing number of members of minorities, welfare mothers and unemployed adults can receive remediation and postsecondary education is a wise investment in our people, not an unwarranted strain on resources.
The leadership of the Senate must revise the House action. The Senate should move Pell Grant purchasing power forward, not backward, by passing a program budget sufficient to raise the maximum grant to $2,500, as provided in the Congressional budget resolution. Congress should reaffirm the principle that only financial need is a correct yardstick for deciding which students receive aid and how much.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Primary Won By Holtzman

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn, who built a reputation as a crusading Congresswoman into a tempestuous eight-year tenure as a prosecutor, won the Democratic primary race for New York City comptroller yesterday, virtually assuring her election as the city's chief fiscal officer.
Riding her high name recognition and strong support from organized labor, civil rights and women's groups, Ms. Holtzman handily beat her closest rivals by about 2 to 1. Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens ran second and Frank J. Macchiarola of Brooklyn, the former city Schools Chancellor, came in third.
In unofficial results with 90 percent of the precincts reporting, Ms. Holtzman received 46 percent of the vote, Mr. Hevesi 25 percent, and Mr. Macchiarola 22 percent. 
Assemblyman Jerrold L. Nadler of Manhattan, who dropped out of the race last week more than $100,000 in debt and endorsed Mr. Hevesi, received 4 percent of the vote, while Stephen J. Rose, a registered nurse who described himself as a gay-rights advocate and was affiliated with the New Alliance Party, received 3 percent.
 
A Testy Campaign
Ms. Holtzman won in four of the city's five boroughs, beating Mr. Hevesi on his home turf in Queens. Mr. Macchiarola won in Staten Island.
Ms. Holtzman's rivals ran far behind her throughout a testy campaign, each struggling to hold her below the 40 percent plurality needed to avoid a runoff with the second-highest vote getter. She now faces token Republican opposition in the general election on Nov. 7.
A 48-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer who won praise for revamping the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, hiring more blacks and women and starting new programs, Ms. Holtzman has nevertheless been harshly criticized by some of her staff members in recent years, and by her rivals in this campaign, as a poor manager.
Now she is poised to succeed Harrison J. Goldin, who gave up the Comptroller's job to run for mayor, as chief guardian of the city's coffers, helping to guide the investment of its pension funds and the marketing of its bonds. In a campaign that stressed her reputation for rooting out wrongdoing, she pledged to fight waste and corruption.
Ms. Holtzman issued no position papers in the campaign although she did participate in five debates. The candidates differed only occasionally on substantive questions about how they would handle the comptroller's job, debating instead each others's qualifications and records.
In their final debate last week, Ms. Holtzman said that if elected she would create a ''blue-ribbon'' panel of experts to recommend how the comptroller's office might best be run. The office would be reshaped substantially if proposed changes to the City Charter are approved by the voters on Nov. 7, abolishing the Board of Estimate and confining the comptroller to a more strictly fiscal role.
In a hard-fought race in which the three leading candidates spent a total of well over $1 million for television advertising - a city record for a primary for comptroller - both Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Macchiarola attacked Ms. Holtzman's record as prosecutor.
 
Attacked Their Integrity
She responded late last week with an commercial attacking their integrity. She called Mr. Hevesi a crony of the late Donald Manes's ''scandal-ridden political machine'' who ''did nothing to stop the corruption,'' and charged that Mr. Macchiarola ''squandered millions and violated rules by hiring political cronies and friends'' when he was Schools Chancellor.
Mr. Hevesi, 49, a longtime member of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, ran third in the polls for most of the race, but moved ahead of Mr. Macchiarola after receiving endorsements from The New York Times, The Daily News and Newsday.
Mr. Macchiarola, 48, a professor of business at Columbia University, who also headed New York City Partnership, a civic and economic development group, styled himself as ''the fighting professor'' and ran a series of humorous commercials criticizing Ms. Holtzman's performance and qualifications.

HEADLINE: Home Rule Giving Way to Joint Plans

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
For three years, 20 Bergen County fire departments have been saving money on new equipment by joining a common purchasing plan. Last fall, officials from 50 of the county's 70 towns met in Ridgefield Park to discuss rising garbage costs.
Midland Park is discussing common bids for road resurfacing with Glen Rock and Ramsey. Rochelle Park is planning to join the Saddle Brook recycling program. Park Ridge and Montvale are exploring joint garbage collection, and throughout the county, towns facing a shortage of fire and ambulance volunteers, as well as the prospect of higher police salaries, are seeking to share expenses and equipment. 
In the past, such measures would have been regarded, in the words of one mayor, ''as political heresy,'' as eroding the sacrosanct concept of home rule in New Jersey. But in recent years the financial pressures facing northern suburbs have pushed more to band together to explore money-saving solutions, from sharing equipment to consolidating some services.
Bergen, along with Essex County, is in the forefront of such initiatives, which would have been unlikely 10 years ago, said William G. Dressel Jr., assistant executive director of the State League of Municipalities.
 
'A Financial Imperative'
The director of planning and economic development in Bergen, Chester P. Mattson, said that in meeting with officials of every community over the last 18 months to help draft a report for the state's master development plan, he was impressed with the willingness to look beyond municipal boundaries.
A reason, he said, is that local costs have soared as Federal aid has dwindled. ''Regionalism is a financial imperative, not an ideological preference,'' he added.
In his report, Mr. Mattson appended comments by municipal officials. Many dealt with home rule and revealed that many officials were ambivalent about home rule and willing to experiment with cost-saving.
''Home rule is the best thing and the worst thing that has ever happened,'' said Mayor Bernard Kettler of Woodcliff Lake. You can drive three miles from our town and find five fire chiefs. There is also a duplicating of equipment. Why should every town have its own hook and ladder? Its own snorkel? Why should there be several different Boards of Health? Every one of our municipalities operates like a small country.''
 
'To Think Regionally'
Of three towns that could share the costs of fire equipment, Mayor Richard Mancinelli of neighboring Park Ridge, said: ''In the past, this would have been regarded as political heresy. Fiscal realities are forcing us to think regionally.''
Mayor Leonard Nicolosi of Bogota was quoted as saying, ''The time will come soon where some moderating of home rule would be found necessary if a regionalizing of expenses could have beneficial results.''
The Pascack Valley Mayors' Association in north-central Bergen has long taken strong regional approaches. In its 20 years, it has been a lobby for Emerson, Hillsdale, Montvale, Old Tappan, Oradell, Park Ridge, River Vale, Washington Township, Westwood and Woodcliff Lake.
The group helped create the state's first municipal insurance pool. And it was a meeting of the mayors, confronted with a state mandate to purchase fire helmets and other equipment to meet Federal standards, that prompted cooperative purchasing.
 
Through Unanimous Vote
Two assistant fire chiefs, Richard Talley of Emerson and Victor Egg of Oradell, worked out the system, whereby each year chiefs in 20 towns from Ramsey to Fairview send lists for equipment to the two officials, who give them to the administrator of Hillsdale, Joseph S. Rompala, who processes the bids, this year on 225 items.
The president of the association, Mayor Robert Gardner of Westwood, said home rule had been preserved, because actions could only be taken by unanimous vote.
Elsewhere, rising garbage-disposal costs prompted the East Bergen Mayors Association to invite all county mayors to meet, said Mayor Fred J. Criscuolo of Ridgefield Park, who sponsored the initial meeting.
About 50 mayors attended and created a group to meet with county officials. The discussions have touched other concerns and prompted friendships among mayors that cross party lines and improved communications with county officials, Mr. Criscuolo said.
 
Guarantees for Localities
Mr. Dressel does not see such arrangements as threats to home rule. They are not static, he said, but ''constantly changing to meet the new demands of the day.''
The ''delicate balance'' in regional decision making is in guaranteeing that localities ''have a strong voice in the process, and are not dictated to by county or state government,'' he said.
Mr. Mattson said he was aware that many people considered regionalization a step toward centralized county control, ''the camel's nose in the tent.'' But, he added, the county's role should be to provide technical support.
''What I'm trying to say is that home rule is going to spawn whatever departures occur from it,'' Mr. Mattson said. ''How we move away from home rule toward regionalization is going to start with decisions that are made as part of home rule.''

HEADLINE: Colt Told to Rehire 800 Strikers; Back Pay Is to Be in Millions

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 12

 BODY:
An administrative law judge has ordered Colt Firearms to rehire 800 strikers and pay them lost wages, a ruling that could deliver millions of dollars to striking workers who have picketed for three and a half years.
A regional official for the strikers' union, the United Automobile Workers, estimated the total value of back wages at $40 million. That would average $50,000 per worker, said the official, Robert Madore.
But a spokesman for Colt, Michael Dunn, said that even if the judge's order is upheld, the company's liability would be less than $6 million. 
The decision by Judge Marvin Roth, though not final, was greeted with joy by members of Local 376 of the U.A.W., who have been on strike since January 1986.
''They can't believe we won the whole decision,'' Mr. Madore said. ''We see that the administrative law judge did his homework, ruled in our favor and we're ready and willing to go back to work.''
 
Unfair Labor Practices Cited
''This is wonderful,'' said Marie Lambert, who worked for Colt for 14 years before the strike. ''There haven't been any Christmas presents for my kids for the past three years.''
Judge Roth, in a ruling dated Thursday and released Monday, found that Colt had engaged in dozens of unfair labor practices during the strike.
The judge found that Colt unilaterally changed working conditions, failed to bargain in good faith, offered to settle separately with employees who quit the union and rejected the union's August 1986 offer to have strikers return to work under terms of their old contract.
The company has until Oct. 5 to appeal his decision to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington.
Mr. Dunn said lawyers for Colt would study the complex decision to determine whether to appeal.
About 1,050 workers walked off the job at Colt plants in Hartford and West Hartford on Jan. 24, 1986, after working 10 months without a contract.
Colt Firearms, which was put up for sale by the New York-based Colt Industries in April, has kept the plants operating using replacement workers and about 200 union members who crossed picket lines.
 
Hearing Last Year
If neither side appeals, the five-member labor board will adopt Judge Roth's decision, said John Sauter, assistant regional director for the labor board in Hartford.
The decision came more than a year after a six-month hearing on 28 complaints issued by the labor board's Hartford office against Colt.
The Hartford office had also issued two complaints against the union.
Judge Roth dismissed Colt's allegations that its negotiators had been threatened by the union but did find that union members were guilty of strike misconduct by threatening people and property during picketing. He ordered an end to such behavior.
A state review board ruled in April 1988 that the Colt workers were victims of a lockout and were entitled to millions of dollars in unemployment benefits. Colt appealed the decision.
 
M-16 Contract Loss
Despite the labor dispute, Colt Firearms management and striking union members in July joined forces in a bid to buy the firearms division from Colt Industries.
Mr. Madore, the union leader, said the potential $40 million liability could make the division less attractive to buyers.
''We think anyone from the outside is going to have to address the issue of back-pay liability,'' he said.
Mr. Madore attributed the difference in how much the union believes Colt owes the striking workers and what the company feels it owes them to the issue of back pay and when it stops. He said that union lawyers were reviewing the judge's decision, and that the union was prepared to appeal on the back pay issue, if necessary.
Colt suffered a serious setback last year when it lost the contract to produce M-16 rifles for the Army. Officials have denied that either the loss of the contract or the strike prompted the decision to sell the firearms division.
Colt was founded in 1836 by Samuel Colt, the inventor of the first successful repeating pistol. After his death in 1862, the company developed the six-shooter that almost every cowboy carried -the legendary gun that won the West. In addition to the M-16, the standard Army-issue rifle still used today, Colt manufactures the Colt .45 handgun, the King Cobra magnum revolver and the AR-15 rifle.

Learning Conditions in U.S. Get C-Plus on 'Report Card'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
American students have little incentive to achieve good grades, the head of the nation's largest school administrators' group says.
The official, Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, examined learning conditions in the United States and compared them to those in South Korea and West Germany.
In a ''National Report Card'' that he prepared for the October issue of the association's journal, Mr. Thomson awarded South Korea an A-minus and West Germany a B-plus. He gave the United States a C-plus, saying, ''American society doesn't measure up.'' 
In preparing his report card, Mr. Thomson said on Monday that he examined five broad categories that researchers say consistently affect learning.
The United States received a D for prevalence of illegal drugs and B's for the percentage of its gross national product devoted to public education, the place of schooling in family value structure and the percentage of families below the poverty line. The only A for the United States was in the percentage of its 16-year-olds in school.
 
North Carolina Survey Cited
Mr. Thomson pointed to a North Carolina survey last year that found that half of the high school juniors were working, with 67 percent of these students working 20 hours or more a week. In South Korea, he said, students ''simply do not hold jobs while attending school.'' In West Germany, students are not in the job market except perhaps informally in family-owned businesses.
''Compared to their international counterparts, most American students not only have fewer incentives to achieve good grades, they also have more incentives to hold jobs during the school week,'' Mr. Thomson said in the article.
Mr. Thomson contended that many American students were lured into low-paying jobs to earn money for designer clothes promoted by advertisements on television. He said a market analysis concern, Teenage Research Unlimited, found that television's focus on the teen-age consumer market has now dropped to the age of 15 from 18 because the typical high school junior has nearly $60 a week in spending money from jobs and allowances.
''Brand loyalties are established at an early age, hence the hard sell to youth,'' Mr. Thomson said. ''The American television industry tends to view children and youth as consumers rather than as learners.''
Commenting on television and its effect on learning science and mathematics, Mr. Thomson said 71 percent of 13-year-old South Korean students consistently watched science programs, while only 37 percent of Americans of similar age watched such programs, the lowest of any group studied.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade In Services At a Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The service and investment sector of the United States economy, where international surpluses have long been relied upon to offset deficits in merchandise trade, is now itself showing red ink.
Although the overall deficit in the current account - which represents trade in merchandise, services and investments - narrowed in the second quarter of 1989, the United States showed a deficit of $200 million in the service and investment sector, the Commerce Department said today, largely because of increased earnings by foreigners on assets held in the United States. It was the first time in about 30 years that this sector has shown a deficit. In the first quarter, the services and investment showed a surplus of $1.5 billion. 
The deficit in investment earnings reflected payments from United States entities of interest, dividends and other earnings from the holdings of American assets by foreigners, a trend that has been increasing in recent years. The deficit was seen by economists not as a dramatic new setback but as the inevitable result of Federal budget deficits and the need to finance them and support other activities by borrowing from and selling assets to foreigners.
 
Belt-Tightening Urged
''The bottom line,'' said William R. Cline, a senior fellow of the Institute of International Economics, ''is that we have to tighten our belts to service our debt.''
American investment and service receipts for the quarter rose $700 million, to $55 billion, the department said, but payments rose more than three times as much, to $55.2 billion. The resulting deficit was thought to have been the first since 1958, but the department said it was not sure of the exact date because of changes in the way the figures are gathered.
Taken by itself, the investment account had fallen into deficit for two quarters last year.
The overall American current-account deficit, which also includes unilateral transfers such as foreign aid, climbed $600 million in the quarter ended June 30, to $31 billion, the department reported.
The deficit in traded goods has been shrinking of late but many analysts believe this improvement might be ending because of strength in the dollar that makes United States exports more expensive in world markets and imported goods cheaper. In the spring quarter, the merchandise deficit narrowed by 2.3 percent, but this was not enough to keep the overall current account deficit from rising.
On Friday, the department is to report the monthly merchandise deficit for July, with analysts predicting it will rise to about $9 billion, from June's $8.1 billion.
Today, attention was focused largely on the swing into deficit, albeit not surprising, of the service and investment sector, a category in which the drain in the investment component is now offsetting continued good performance among such traditional export earners as insurance, accounting, advertising, brokerage, shipping and computer and medical services.
To maintain its advantage in tradeable skills the United States is pressing to bring services under the international trading rules administered by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The investment account, however, is likely to increase its drag on the balance of payments. Receipts from American assets abroad rose slightly in the latest reporting quarter, but payments of income on foreign assets in the United States - direct investments such as plants or real estate and portfolio investment such as stocks and Government bonds - increased far more, the department reported.
The service and investment surplus, which peaked in 1981 at $43.8 billion, fell to $20.8 billion in 1984, then rose for three years in a row before plunging to $15.3 billion in 1988.
 
New Categories Included
This category does not include flows of capital, only the interest and other earnings associated with them. The department amended its procedures this summer to include educational, travel, business, professional and technical services. Without the change, said Christopher L. Bach, a Commerce official, the services and investment deficit would have been about $176 million.
But while Mr. Cline said the latest figures showed an urgent need for a change in American policy - by cutting the budget deficit and bringing down the international value of the dollar - others said there was no cause for alarm.
''If it's a concern, it's a very long-term concern,'' contended Roger M. Kubarych, a top official at Henry Kaufman & Company, the investment banking concern, declaring that the necessary investment in American productive capacity was, in fact, being sustained and that it did not much matter that foreign money was doing it.
Nonetheless, he added, the investment deficit ''should be a longer-term warning that we've got to get our savings rate up.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about the United States' current account deficit referred incorrectly to the change for the second quarter.
The deficit widened by $600 million, to $31 billion.

HEADLINE: Pilots' Union Is Divided By Walkout at Eastern

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The union that represents the vast majority of the nation's airline pilots has been drained by the six-month strike at Eastern Airlines and has begun polling its membership on whether to continue financial support for the walkout.
The strike has divided the union, the 38,000-member Air Line Pilots Association, as thousands of pilots at other airlines withhold their union-mandated contributions to the strike and as some leaders privately question whether the battle is still worth the expense. Some union leaders also worry that the costly strike has weakened the union's bargaining position in talks with other airlines.
The union has already put up $69.5 million for the strike, its president, Henry A. Duffy, said. Special strike contributions of $33 million have been assessed, of which $22.5 million has been collected. Almost $10 million has been raised by borrowing against the union's building in Herndon, Va. The balance of the spending has come from the union's major-contingency fund, now at $13 million. 
Mr. Duffy said the union could afford to pay strike benefits as long as members voted to continue their assessments and did not fall further behind in payments. The A.L.P.A.'s finances should bounce back quickly from the strike because even without a special assessment its union dues and major-contingency fund fees total 2.35 percent of members' annual salaries, which average $83,000, he said. The separate strike assessment is about 3.5 percent.
''One thing that this association has is a good recovery process,'' Mr. Duffy said.
The strike has not harmed the union's ability to negotiate with other airlines, he said. But some leaders of the union disagree, and are concerned that new applications of bankruptcy law and the high cost of the long strikes that followed deregulation of the airline industry have diminished the influence of the pilots' union.
 
Strike Weapon Questioned
The Eastern dispute ''has once again pointed out that strikes are not a way to deal with problems,'' said an A.L.P.A. executive board member who asked not to be identified. ''The way the laws are written, that weapon has been taken away from labor.''
The board member was referring to the apparently successful use of the bankruptcy courts by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent, the Texas Air Corporation, to shield Eastern from the strike.
By filing on March 9 for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the airline has avoided paying its bankers and suppliers and therefore has conserved the cash to train replacement pilots and rebuild as a smaller carrier. The filing came five days after Eastern's machinists, supported by the pilots and flight attendants, went on strike.
The financial problems of the pilots' union come at a busy time for labor relations in the industry. Contracts at USAir, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are all in negotiations or mediation.
The shortage of money has already affected bargaining at another airline, a top A.L.P.A. official said. Leaders of 5,000 pilots at Northwest Airlines abruptly abandoned strike threats and agreed to a new contract last month, in part because of concern that pilots at other airlines would refuse to pay benefits for two strikes, he said. ''If they aren't supporting 2,500 Eastern pilots, they sure aren't going to support 7,500 pilots,'' the official said. About 2,500 of the 3,500 pilots at Eastern when the strike began have not gone back to work at the airline.
Union officials at Northwest declined to comment. Mr. Duffy said the union could have paid for concurrent strikes at Northwest and Eastern.
 
Effect Called Minimal
Joseph P. Kernan, chairman of USAir's 3,200 pilots, and James H. Suckow, chairman of 7,500 pilots at Delta, both played down the impact of events at Eastern on their respective contract talks. ''The effect the Eastern strike has had on our negotiations has been minimal if at all,'' Mr. Suckow said.
But David Lewin, a business professor at Columbia University, disagreed. He said it would hurt the bargaining position of the union at other airlines.
Despite its problems, the union still has many strengths. It has contracts with every major airline except American, which has a small union, and Continental, another Texas Air subsidiary at which the A.L.P.A. retains organizing rights but no longer represents pilots.
National union leaders ''still can raise the money'' when it is needed, Mr. Kernan said. ''We're a resilient organization. We've had setbacks and we've come back, and we'll come back again.''
Indeed, the union was also short of cash after an unsuccessful walkout at Continental Airlines in 1983. After that strike the union started its major-contingency fund, which collects $1.5 million a month from members.
 
Real Estate Holdings
The union also has an office building in downtown Washington, that has been appraised at $25 million but carries only a $13 million mortgage, Mr. Duffy said. And it has other real estate holdings purchased for a total of $1 million and also not mortgaged, he said.
Finally, the major-contingency fund has made $7 million in secured loans to Eastern pilots that should be repaid next year, Mr. Duffy said.
A.L.P.A. officials also say the funds spent on the walkout - including preparations that began in 1986 -have struck Mr. Lorenzo a heavy blow. Indeed, Eastern was virtually shut down for four months, and its president estimates the strike's cost at $400 million. The airline plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection this winter with most of its pre-strike schedule intact but with little cash to cushion it against an economic downturn.
Yet the union's weakened finances were one reason for the executive board's decision on Aug. 18 not to call a national work stoppage at all airlines in support of the Eastern pilots. ''If there had been $100 million in the kitty, I would have worried a lot less about it,'' a board member said. ''The funds were not available.''
 
Assessments Reduced
The drain from the union's coffers has accelerated in the last two months as a growing number of pilots have reduced or stopped payments of their special assessments, said two executive board members who asked not to be identified.
Pilots are dropping out of the special assessment program or moving to extended payment programs at a rate of nearly 4,000 a month, the two board members said. Mr. Duffy said the rate was lower, although he did not have a precise figure.
The assessments have financed strike benefits of $600 a week for Eastern pilots on strike. The assessments have also paid for a public relations and lobbying effort that initially won widespread public support for the Eastern pilots.
Another A.L.P.A. executive board member said the Eastern pilots should return to work and questioned whether their strike benefits should be maintained. ''If you continue to tell people who are emotionally involved that you are going to pay them $2,400 a month, they have less incentive to face reality,'' he said.
 
Ballots Sent Out
Ballots have been sent to all union members asking whether the strike assessments should continue. The ballots are to be counted on Oct. 10. If the membership votes against the measure, the last biweekly benefits would be paid on Oct. 14, while the assessments would continue for another month to restore $10 million to the major-contingency fund.
''We anticipate a positive vote,'' said Edward J. Breen, the chairman of the Eastern pilots' strike committee.
But in interviews over the last three weeks, the chairmen of several A.L.P.A. chapters were less confident. ''In my view, it would be a toss-up,'' said Mr. Kernan at USAir, who added that he favored continuing the strike assessments.
In an earlier setback for Eastern pilots, the national union's executive board voted on Aug. 18 not to allow them to retain their seniority automatically if they took jobs at other airlines.
Worse off than the A.L.P.A. is local 553 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents 6,000 Eastern flight attendants. The T.W.U. does not have a strike fund, so the local was forced to create one after the strike began and hold fund-raisers for it, said Mary Jane Barry, the local's president. The fund makes payments only to members facing financial hardship.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 8,500 striking Eastern machinists and ramp-service workers, has $100 million in its strike fund, enough to pay the current benefits of $100 a week for two years, a spokesman for the Eastern machinists said.

HEADLINE: Fuji Bank To Buy Unit Of Kleinwort

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Fuji Bank Ltd. and Kleinwort Benson Ltd. announced yesterday that Fuji had agreed to buy 100 percent of the stock in Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., a Chicago-based dealer in Treasury securities.
The deal is significant because it will give Fuji control over a primary dealer. The Federal Reserve trades securities directly with primary dealers and many institutional investors will place orders only with such firms. 
The agreement is the first purchase of an American primary dealer since the Federal Reserve Board voted in August to allow Japanese firms to continue to act as primary dealers in Treasury securities, although several Japanese firms had already acquired such control before the matter became an issue.
 
Law Passed in 1988
In response to complaints by American securities firms that they were being discriminated against in Japan, Congress passed the Primary Dealer's Act of 1988 as an amendment to the omnibus trade bill. It would have excluded Japanese firms from the elite group of primary dealers if the Fed found the Japanese Government had discriminated against Wall Street firms operating in Tokyo.
The Fed's ruling cleared the way for yesterday's announcement of the deal, which is worth $44 million. It has been under negotiation for two years, said Tom O. Chandos, a director of Kleinwort Benson in London.
Last year, just after Congress passed the trade bill, Fuji purchased 24.9 percent of the Kleinwort Benson unit for $14.5 million, keeping within the 25 percent limit set by the law. In addition, Fuji assumed the unit's subordinated debt that was held by its London-based parent.
American firms had complained that they were being excluded from the syndicates that bought bonds from the Japanese Government, denying them an essential product to sell to customers. In addition, the American firms said, officials in Tokyo were sharing important economic information with Japanese firms first, putting the American firms at a competitive disadvantage.
 
Concessions Have Been Made
Since then, the Japanese have made a number of concessions to the American firms, including offering more bonds for sale through open auction.
Despite the Fed's vote, some members of Congress expressed concern yesterday about the Fuji purchase. ''The Fed's decision opened the door for more of these deals to happen, and without responsive action on the other side of the Pacific, I think that the situation will remain unfair,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat.
Wall Street deal makers who work with the Japanese said a number of banks were considering investments in primary dealers. ''We've had a regular dialogue with all of the largest Japanese banks, and our view is that this is part of a continuing trend,'' said Mark J. Lerner, a vice president of the Japan Banking Group of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''Japanese banks are continuing to show interest in expansion in the American markets through select investment and acquisitions through firms such as primary dealerships.''
Fuji will be joining a number of other Japanese companies that control primary dealerships in the United States. Those companies include Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities. Primary dealers are also controlled by Japanese banks, including the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan and the Sanwa Bank.
The deal with Fuji, which is subject to approval by the Fed, would give the company a significant foothold in the American securities market by allowing it to learn in advance about Government securities offerings. That would increase the bank's legitimacy in that market in Japan, bringing greater amounts of capital from Japan to the unit, officials with both companies said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Talk Is Cheap, Dollars Dear

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IF President Bush decided to order tail lights for the Stealth bomber or buy a scrimshaw collection for the National Gallery, he would first have to convince Congress. But there is no such restraint on the unelected Government officials who spent $12 billion this summer to hold down the exchange value of the dollar - and kept it secret until last week.
I. M. Destler and C. Randall Henning, specialists in government at the Institute of International Economics in Washington, see nothing sinister in the way exchange policies are carried out. Day-to-day discretion and the legal right to keep decisions secret are needed to achieve maximum impact in currency transactions. 
But in their new book, ''Dollar Politics,'' they draw a sharp line between policy making and execution. They argue that the Reagan Administration's laissez-faire dollar policy, adopted without serious discussion in or out of the White House, led to ''near catastrophe'' in the early 1980's. Their proposed remedy: drawing Congress and private interests into future dollar debates before the fact.
Americans hardly noticed exchange rates until the 1960's, and for good reason. Europe and Asia failed or thrived on their ability to compete abroad, and their competitiveness depended heavily on their currencies' exchange value. But American manufacturers produced largely for the home market, and had little to fear from imports.
America's splendid economic isolation has gone the way of the vacuum tube. But business and labor lobbies have been slow to grasp the importance of exchange rates. Dollar policy has remained a political afterthought - a bone to throw to the resident ideologue at the Treasury, a few platitudes inserted in economic summit declarations to placate the foreigners.
As a result, Mr. Destler and Mr. Henning argue, there have been ill-considered swings from intervention to neglect. And while the costs of erratic shifts might have been supportable in the 1970's, continuing integration of world markets for money and goods has greatly raised the stakes.
In April 1981, Beryl Sprinkel, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, declared that the price of the dollar, like the price of computers or corn flakes, was best left to the free market. Over the next three years the dollar's exchange value rose by half, forcing hundreds of efficient American businesses to close or move abroad.
Only in 1985, with the trade deficit approaching the $140 billion level, did the Administration stop crowing about the high-flying dollar as evidence of the success of Reaganomics. And Secretary James Baker's decision to intervene, announced at the Plaza Hotel accord that September, came only after the dollar had already begun to fall.
The policy in force today, maintenance of the dollar's exchange value within an undisclosed band, exudes a vague sense of probity - the destination of the 747-of-state may be unknown, but almost everyone seems satisfied that the captain can fly around the thunderheads.
The plane's destination, however, may matter as much as the pilot's ability to avoid wind shear.
Dollar stability at current exchange rates implies United States current-account deficits exceeding $100 billion for the indefinite future. And as Walter Russell Mead of the World Policy Institute in New York argues, failure to cope with this chronic external imbalance is likely to halt the trend toward world economic integration. The resulting fragmentation of the industrial economies into isolated trading blocs, he says, would sharply reduce growth.
To Mr. Destler and Mr. Henning, the best way to insure that international finance receives as much attention as higher-profile budget and monetary issues is to make it a formal process.
Congress, they say, should create oversight committees that focus specifically on the dollar and the current account. The Administration should be required to review its exchange policy annually, reporting its findings to the public. And a business-labor advisory group on the dollar should be created, diffusing pressure for protectionism and focusing attention on broader issues of competitiveness.
Cynical political analysts scoff at the idea that the obligation to talk about exchange-rate policy will influence its substance. In Washington, where money talks and nobody walks, it is assumed that those with a stake in the issue already have adequate means to make their views felt.
But the experience of the early 1980's, when outsiders to the establishment were busy redrawing the world economic order on the backs of napkins, suggests otherwise. In any case, talk is cheap -and well worth the price if it even marginally increases the chances that George Bush and his successors will take consequences of current-account deficits more seriously.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 2.85 as Volume Rises

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices edged up on a broad front yesterday as volume rose moderately.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 2.85 points, to 2,707.26, but that was well below the 10-point gain it was showing about an hour before the 4 P.M. close of trading. The secondary market showed much more strength, however, as advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines by 824 to 632. 
''Select technology and airline issues continued to be among the stronger and more active issues,'' said Brian Luedtke, an analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis. ''Investors remain hesitant ahead of Friday's economic reports.''
Mr. Luedtke said that lagging areas had shown strength recently while leading averages ''have been caught in a consolidation range.''
Traders in both stocks and bonds remained nervous about the spate of economic data scheduled to be released on Friday, which includes reports on the Producer Price Index, industrial production, capacity utilization, merchandise trade and manufacturing and trade inventories and orders.
 
Takeover Issues in Spotlight
In yesterday's market, individual takeover-related issues remained in the spotlight. Volume on the Big Board rose to 142.1 million shares from a slow 126 million shares on Monday.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.04 points, to 348.70, while the New York Stock Stock Exchange composite index tacked on 0.58, to 193.88.
Among individual issues, UAL rose 4 5/8, to 281. An employee-management group is offering $300 a share to take the United Airlines unit of UAL private.
Other airlines showed mixed results. AMR slipped a point, to 82 3/4; Delta gained 3/8, to 75 7/8; Pan Am was unchanged at 3 3/4, and USAir also stayed the same, at 48 1/2. The results of the group, however, helped lift the Dow transportation average by 7.47 points.
Procter & Gamble slipped 1/2, to 123 1/4, despite the fact that RJR Nabisco, Pepsico and United Biscuits agreed to pay the company a total of $125 million to settle a patent-infringement suit.
 
Chemical Stocks Advance
Some chemical stocks gained on news of an early-morning explosion at Quantum Chemical's ethylene unit. Union Carbide was up 1/2, to 29 5/8, while Ethyl gained 1 1/8, to 27. Dow Chemical, however, slipped 1/4, to 101 1/2.
Datapoint was the most active stock, slipping 1/2, to 5 3/8, on a volume of 2.7 million shares. Asher B. Edelman, the New York investor, said he had raised his stake in the company to 40 percent.
Among actively traded blue chips were A.T.&T., up 1/2, to 40 1/2; McDonald's 5/8, to 29 5/8; Exxon 3/4, to 45 3/8, and I.B.M. 5/8, to 116 7/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index rose 2.11 points, to 384.54, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index was up 1.44 points, to 471.86.
Technology stocks were strong in the over-the-counter sector. Lin Broadcasting, which said on Monday that it would merge its cellular telephone operations with those of the BellSouth, rose 1 3/4, to 108 1/2.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in continued sluggish trading yesterday. For the second straight session, short- to intermediate-term issues outperformed longer-dated securities.
Dealers said that demand from institutional investors for four-year and five-year Treasury notes was particularly strong. As much as $1 billion worth of the issues were rumored to have been purchased. 
''There is a lot of uncertainty around about the high-yield market, about the stock market and about the economy in general,'' one government bond trader said. ''As a consequence, there is tons of money that is just hiding out in the front end of the market right now. And that story will hang around for a while.''
 
Economic Reports Due
At least some of the questions about the economy will be answered tomorrow and Friday, when many reports, including retail sales and producer price data for August, are scheduled to be released. A number of market participants have indicated that uncertainty about the upcoming releases is momentarily preventing them from making any strategic decisions.
''We are bullish in the longer run, but think there is still a chance that the economy could show a little more resilience,'' said Roger A. Early, a vice president at the Federated Research Corporation, ''and that long-term interest rates could back up to 8.30 percent to 8.50 percent before heading lower.'' Federated Research is a unit of Federated Investors Inc., the Pittsburgh money management firm that manages more than $21 billion in Treasury securities. Bond prices eased again yesterday. In late trading, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds that mature in 2019 were offered at a price of 100 14/32, down by 7/32, to yield 8.08 percent, up from 8.06 on Monday.
Among the secondary Treasury note issues, the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 22/32, up by 1/32, to yield 8.07 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent four-year notes were offered at 100 2/32, up by 3/32, to yield 8.10 percent.
 
Treasuries Fall Again
Treasury bill rates dipped again yesterday, following big declines on Monday.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.58 percent, down by 4 basis points, or hundredths of a point. And six-month bill rates dipped by 5 basis points, to a late-offered rate of 7.57 percent.
Elsewhere, new-issue activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market picked up markedly yesterday, as about $1.5 billion in new competitive and negotiated deals, including the first issue from the Washington Public Power Supply System since 1982, were priced.
Aside from the Washington Public Power issue, which was increased to $721 million, from $450 million, the New Jersey Housing and Finance Agency offered $256 million worth of serial and term bonds in a negotiated transaction.
The largest single maturity of the issue is a $149 million issue of bonds that mature on Oct. 1, 2029. The bonds, which are subject to provisions of the alternative minimum tax, carry a 7.70 percent coupon and were priced at par.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets was the lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated AAA by Moody's Investors Service Inc. The issue is insured by the Municipal Bond Investors' Assurance Corporation.
A number of issues were priced at competitive bid.
The largest was a $68.5 million offering of serial bonds from Mississippi.
Maturities on the bonds are from 1990 to 2009, with coupons ranging from 5.90 percent on bonds maturing next year, to 6.90 percent on those that mature in 2009.
 
Morgan Unit Wins Bonds
A bid from an investor group led by J. P. Morgan Securities, the investment banking subsidiary of J. P. Morgan & Company, won the bonds, which are rated AA by Moody's and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the corporate debt market, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation priced a $276 million offering of senior debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
The 10 1/8 percent debentures, which mature on Sept. 15, 2009, were priced at $99.35, to yield 10.201 percent, 2.11 percentage points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt bonds was light, the dealers said. The prices of most municipal issues dipped by about one-eighth of a point, the market participants said.
Meanwhile, long-term corporate issues dipped, also by about one-eighth of a point, while intermediate-term issues were unchanged.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Coffee Prices Fall on News Of U.S. Stance on Quotas

 BODY:
Coffee futures prices plunged yesterday on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on indications the United States will not support a return to international export quotas that would raise coffee prices.
On other markets, sugar futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans were lower; energy futures weakened; precious metals advanced, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
All New York coffee futures except the contract for September delivery plunged the permitted daily limit of 6 cents a pound. The September contract, which does not have a daily limit, tumbled 6.68 cents, to 81.48 cents a pound, a two-and-a-half-week low. 
Analysts said prices plummeted amid panicked selling prompted by a report that the Bush Administration will reject Colombia's plea for United States support in pushing for a resumption of export quotas among producer members of the International Coffee Organization.
 
Quotas Suspended in July
The 74-nation cartel suspended the quotas in July amid discord caused in part by American demands for controls on sales of coffee at cut-rate prices to Soviet-bloc nations that are not members of the coffee organization. The United States is the organization's largest consumer member.
A return to export quotas would lead to higher coffee prices and would help the economy of Colombia, which needs money to battle cocaine cartels.
Sugar futures prices soared in New York after the United States announced it had raised its 1989 sugar import quota by 860,000 metric tons, to 1.99 million, and had extended the import quota period by nine months to Sept. 30, 1990. Sugar futures rose 0.37 cent to 0.54 cent, with October at 13.95 cents a pound.
 
Soybean and Corn Down
Corn and soybean futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade, under pressure from a lack of overnight frost in the Midwest and forecasts for improved crop weather next week. Oat and wheat futures also retreated.
After the close, the Agriculture Department issued a new crop report revising downward its August estimates for 1989 United States corn and soybean production and raising its wheat-crop estimate.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 7 cents lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with October at $19.70 a barrel; heating oil was 0.64 cent lower to 0.15 cent higher, with October at 55.37 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.03 cent to 0.28 cent lower, with October at 56.89 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Are Mixed As Traders Await Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was narrowly mixed yesterday, marking time as traders awaited a batch of economic reports to be issued later in the week. Gold prices were also mixed. Traders were reluctant to make significant adjustments to their positions in advance of the reports due from Washington tomorrow and Friday, analysts said. 
The Government will issue its August retail sales figures tomorrow, and on Friday, reports on the July trade deficit and August producer prices and industrial production will be released.
The reports are expected to indicate how the economy is faring, providing clues on whether the Federal Reserve will adjust its policy on interest rates. Dollar traders hope the Fed will tighten credit, which moves interest rates higher and is bullish for the currency.
 
Focus on Producer Prices
Analysts said the market was most concerned about the producer price report, which will show whether inflation is accelerating. If it is, the Fed would be expected to nudge interest rates upward.
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5470 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5450 late Monday. In later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.5485 from $1.5460.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.9865 West German marks, unchanged; 1.7140 Swiss francs, up from 1.7135; 6.6920 Swiss francs, up from 6.6910; 1,422.125 Italian lire, down from 1,425.875, and 1.8725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18715.
 
Dollar Rates in Europe

HEADLINE: Japanese Trade Surplus Narrows by 31%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
A surge in oil imports, robust domestic demand and a strong dollar helped narrow Japan's trade surplus by 31 percent in August, and economists here say the trend should continue for the rest of 1989.
The Government reported today that the trade surplus narrowed to an unadjusted $3.44 billion in August, from $4.97 billion a year earlier, marking the fourth straight month the trade gap has shrunk.
It also said the trade gap narrowed to an adjusted $4.43 billion in August, from $5.05 billion a month earlier. 
''The underlying trend is continuing,'' said Shoichi Enkyo, an economist at the Bank of Tokyo.
Japan's sensitive trade surplus with the United States shrank moderately, to $3.03 billion, from $3.24 billion a year earlier, as Americans continued their heavy purchases of autos and other Japanese-made goods. Shows Strength in U.S. ''If anything, it suggests that the U.S. economy is not quite as weak as people had thought,'' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
Japan's vehicle exports grew a surprisingly fast 4.7 percent on a rise in shipments to the United States, Europe and Asia, after year-to-year declines of 5.3 percent in July and 1.7 percent in June, Mr. Morgan said.
Some analysts said that past dollar weakness was continuing to increase the cost-competitiveness of American products on foreign markets. The dollar's recent strength against the yen has also cut Japan's export earnings by depressing the dollar value of Japanese exports contracted in yen, economists said.
''At a later date, however, the depreciation of the yen will add to export competitiveness'' in Japan, Mr. Enkyo said.
If the dollar stays strong, Japanese export volumes will eventually balloon, reversing the current narrowing trend in its surplus, economists warn.
 
Trend Seen Continuing
''This trend will continue at least through the end of this calendar year,'' Mr. Enkyo said. ''But toward spring, we could see the rather weaker yen increasing the volume of Japanese exports.''
Economists forecast a reduction in Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus to between $65 billion and $73 billion for this calendar year from $77.6 billion in 1988.
In the August period, the shrinking trade surplus was linked most directly to the stronger demand for higher-priced imported oil. The value of crude oil imports last month rose to $1.86 billion, up 39 percent from a year earlier. A buildup of inventories before the introduction of an oil import tariff in August last year led to plummeting oil imports that month.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By DENSIE WEBB; Densie Webb, a freelance writer and editor, is a registered dietitian.

 BODY:
THOUGH it's hard to recall now, eggs once had high status. They were thought of as a wholesome, natural and nutritious food. But no more.
That belief has been shattered by the national obsession with cholesterol. Eggs - egg yolks to be exact - are one of the most concentrated sources of cholesterol in the American diet. Egg lovers who have wanted to eat less cholesterol but not eliminate eggs have generally turned to packaged egg substitutes to replace whole eggs in cooking. But the taste of several of these is, shall we say, different from real eggs. 
Enter real eggs advertised as having ''25 percent less cholesterol.'' The eggs, produced by R. W. Sauder Inc. of Lititz, Pa. and Rosemary Farm of Santa Maria, Calif., began appearing in supermarkets last year. They were said to have 25 percent less than the 274 milligrams of cholesterol that then constituted the United States Department of Agriculture standard. But it was soon discovered that regular eggs actually had less cholesterol than the Government standard.
''The 274 number was based on old data collected from the 1950's through the 1970's,'' said Cathy McCharen, the director of the Egg Nutrition Center in Washington, which represents the egg industry.
New analyses by the U.S.D.A. found that regular eggs had 213 milligrams of cholesterol. The lower number prompted the American Heart Association to adjust its longstanding recommendation that people eat no more than three egg yolks per week to no more than four. The association recommends total cholesterol consumption not exceed 300 milligrams a day.
Meanwhile producers have been working to develop eggs that will be significantly lower in cholesterol than even the new standard demands. Michael Foods Inc. of Minneapolis has developed a technique to remove 70 to 90 percent of the cholesterol from egg yolks. The company said it could not predict when the product would be on the market.
Full Spectrum Farms of Lancaster, Pa., is currently producing eggs that the company said contain only 169 milligrams of cholesterol each, 20 percent less than regular eggs. But Jeff Cramer, a chemist at the bureau of food and chemistry in the Pennsylvania department of agriculture who is testing the cholesterol claims of Full Spectrum Farms eggs, said the average cholesterol content is closer to 182 milligrams each.
The Full Spectrum eggs are produced by providing the chickens with special feed, controlled lighting and improved air circulation and quality, said John Albright, the president of Environmental Systems Inc., which owns Full Spectrum Farms.
They cost 25 to 30 cents more per dozen than regular eggs and are being distributed in northern New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Ohio; they may be available in New York City in the next few months. For consumers the best bet in the meantime may be egg substitutes, which, with a few exceptions, are cholesterol-free.
Though each is advertised as the next best thing to eggs, they vary in taste, texture and color.
Powdered egg substitutes are the least expensive and the quickest to mix and prepare, but they also tend to be the least appetizing in appearance and taste.
Liquid substitutes, which generally cost about three and a half times as much per serving as real eggs, usually look and taste better than the powdered type. They are frozen in containers like small milk cartons and must be thawed before use, which can take up to one hour, depending on the size of the carton.
While real eggs can keep in the refrigerator for up to five weeks, manufacturers advise against storing thawed egg substitutes in the refrigerator for more than 7 to 10 days. Powdered products, on the other hand, keep indefinitely.
Egg substitutes can generally take the place of whole eggs in baking, with fair to excellent results depending on the recipe and on whether a liquid or powdered product is used. Liquid egg substitutes work especially well in quick breads, cakes, coatings and batters, said Robyn Flipse, a registered dietitian in Ocean, N.J., who teaches classes on healthful cooking.
Though most ingredient lists on packages of egg substitutes begin with egg whites, indicating they are the predominant ingredient, corn oil is often added to replace the fat in egg yolks, and artificial flavors, colors and preservatives are included as well.
Egg substitutes are lower in total fat than real eggs, but few are fat-free. Most package instructions call for the addition of one teaspoon of margarine during preparation. While this does not add cholesterol, it can raise the fat level to that of a whole egg or higher. Using a nonstick pan or a vegetable spray eliminates the need for added fat. Nor are egg substitutes necessarily cholesterol-free. They may contain 15 to 120 milligrams of cholesterol, which is still less than the amount in whole eggs.
Unlike whole eggs - which are relatively low in sodium at 63 milligrams each, most of which is in the white, not the yolk - packaged substitutes contain as much as 220 milligrams in a serving equivalent to a single egg. People who are trying to cut down on cholesterol are likely to be watching their sodium intake as well.
An economical yet often overlooked egg option is to stay with the real thing and simply substitute two egg whites, which are cholesterol-free, for each large whole egg called for in a recipe. Or as a substitute for plain scrambled eggs, one whole egg beaten with one egg white per two-egg serving works well.
The yolk adds both color and flavor not found in pure egg whites or most egg substitutes. Though not as inexpensive as powdered substitutes, the one yolk- two whites mixture costs less than liquid substitutes and tastes better.
Omitting a single yolk cuts the cholesterol of a serving of two scrambled eggs in half, from 426 milligrams cholesterol to 213 - less than in two lowered-cholesterol eggs. If preparing more than a single serving of scrambled eggs, you can increase the ratio of egg whites to cut the cholesterol further.
Pure egg whites can be used for cholesterol-free scrambled eggs, but they taste bland and lack color. The whites are more appealing as an omelet mixed with other ingredients like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Mayor Faces Suit on Ethics; No Crime Is Charged

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The City Attorney of Los Angeles filed a civil suit today against Mayor Tom Bradley, charging that he failed to disclose six personal investments as required by California law. But the City Attorney, ending five months of inquiry into possible conflicts of interest by the Mayor, said there was not enough evidence to press criminal charges.
The City Attorney, James K. Hahn, said his investigation had not been able to prove that the Mayor intended to use his influence to benefit various banks and companies with which he had financial ties. But he made it clear that he felt the 71-year-old Mayor, who recently won a fifth term, had lost his ethical compass. 
''No vindication of the Mayor's conduct is intended, implied or should in any way be inferred,'' Mr. Hahn said in a report. He said the Mayor ''clearly stepped into that gray area of the law between factual innocence and a chargeable offense, but our system of justice rightfully gives him and the rest of us the benefit of the doubt in such circumstances.''
 
Bradley Admits His Mistakes
In a long televised reply this evening, Mr. Bradley defended his ethics and admitted mistakes. ''When all is said and done,'' he said, ''the inquiry confirms what I have said all along: I did not engage in conflicts of interest. I did not violate the public's trust.''
The report was a major milestone in the troubles that have swirled around Mr. Bradley, a former police officer who has been widely credited with bringing racial harmony and economic prosperity to the nation's second largest city.
A number of articles in The Los Angeles Herald Examiner and The Los Angeles Times raised questions about Mr. Bradley's relationship with several banks the city did business with and about his ties with a project that has been under investigation by the city's Police Department.
Despite the criticism in Mr. Hahn's report, many local politicians believe Mr. Bradley has weathered this storm. But he faces other, potentially more serious, investigations by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State Attorney General. The Federal authorities are looking into Mr. Bradley's stock investments made through the investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, which recently pleaded guilty to securities fraud, and his relationship to Michael R. Milken, who headed the firm's junk bond unit.
The civil suit filed by Mr. Hahn charges Mr. Bradley with six violations of the California Government Code, which requires public officials to disclose their personal economic interests. It charges that Mr. Bradley intentionally or negligently failed to report investments in companies like Trans World Airlines Inc., L.A. Gear Inc., and Gibralter Financial Corporation.
The fine for such infractions can total the amount of the investments, said by the two local newspapers to be about $2.2 million. But aides to Mr. Hahn said that it was likely that the Mayor would reach an out-of-court settlement for considerably less.
The report by Mr. Hahn, an elected official who has been considered an ally of the Mayor, painted a picture in sharp contrast with Mr. Bradley's reputation for honesty and with Los Angeles's reputation for comparatively clean government.
 
The Most Serious Charge
The most serious charge involved the Far East National Bank, which paid Mr. Bradley $18,000 in 1988 as a foreign trade advisor. On March 22, the Mayor called the City Treasurer, Leonard Rittenberg, asking why the city had withdrawn $1 million from the bank. After that, the Treasurer's Office deposited $2 million in the bank.
Mr. Bradley told investigators that he only inquired about the deposit and therefore, Mr. Hahn said, there was insufficient evidence that he intended to violate the law by using his influence to favor a bank for which he worked. Mr. Rittenberg concurred with the Mayor.
''Although the Mayor clearly exercised poor judgment in this particular instance, we did not find a violation of the law,'' Mr. Hahn said at a news conference today.
In his reply, Mayor Bradley asked Angelenos to ''remember how I've served this city for 47 years with honor and integrity. I work 16 and 18 hour days because I love this job.'' He conceded he had failed to fully disclose his financial interests but said these were ''technical errors'' resulting from his filling out his own forms. He has since established a blind trust for his assets.
The bulk of his comments addressed the Far East matter. He said he had returned the $18,000 fee, though not legally required to do so, and denied knowing that officials in the city Treasurer's Office had contrived documents to make it look as though the deposit was made through competitive bidding. ''I never doubted that the inquiry would conclude that I played no role in the deposit of city funds with Far East,'' he said.
After local news stories reported his links to the banks, Mr. Bradley resigned his positions at both Far East and Valley Federal Savings and Loan, where he had served as a paid director for a decade. While Mr. Bradley approved zoning changes favoring subsidiaries of Valley Federal, Mr. Hahn concluded the Mayor was unaware that they were owned by the bank.
 
No Evidence of Influence
Similarly, the City Attorney found no evidence that Mayor Bradley had influenced the placement of hundreds of millions of dollars of city deposits in Gibraltar Savings, in which Mr. Bradley owned bonds valued at more than $100,000, nor that he influenced city decisions concerning properties owned by Abraham Spiegel, a longtime friend and benefactor who founded Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills.
Mr. Hahn also investigated Mr. Bradley's ties to the Task Force on Africa-Los Angeles Relations, founded in 1978 to expand links between Los Angeles and African nations, which has been under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department for its handling of $180,000 in city funds. Mayor Bradley's daughter, Phyllis, worked for the task force as a secretary for nine months and earned $16,697. Mr. Hahn found no conflict of interest on Mr. Bradley's part, but referred the report to the California Attorney General's office and the United States Comptroller of the Currency.
Reaction to Mr. Hahn's report today was one of shock. ''The change in perception is the significant issue here,'' said City Councilman Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood. ''The Mayor's previous image of a white knight has ben tarnished with the months of speculation.''
One of the Mayor's harshest critics on the Council, Zev Yaroslavsky, who had considered challenging Mayor Bradley this year, said the report pained a ''sordid picture'' of City Hall.
But Joseph R. Cerrell, a powerful political consultant here, discounted Mr. Bradley's transgressions. ''To put it religiously, these were venial sins as opposed to mortal sins.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Rejects Increase in Aid for Poland

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Despite appeals from Congress and officials in Poland, the Bush Administration has ruled out any major, immediate efforts to provide economic assistance to Poland, Administration officials said today.
Agreement on a course of action for Poland was reached at a meeting of the National Security Council last Thursday, the officials said, adding that it reflected American budget restraints and skepticism of the Treasury and the Central Intelligence Agency about the Warsaw's ability to control inflation and thereby begin to resolve longstanding economic problems.
The Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, who is to visit Washington in November, has called for $10 billion of emergency assistance, involving $2.7 billion from the International Monetary Fund, $3 billion from the World Bank and $4.3 billion in new bilateral credits.
 
Other Proposals Also Rejected
After the Polish Parliament voted Tuesday to establish a government in which Communists are not dominant, the first since the 1940's, several members of Congress called for stepped up American assistance. 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, urged that the Administration work with Congress on a ''united bipartisan substantial program of aid to Poland.''
When President Bush traveled to Eastern Europe in July, he proposed a package of aid totaling $119 million, including food and technical aid.
Administration officials said that as a result of the National Security Council meeting there would be no expansion of that package. In addition the council rejected proposals to undertake a food airlift and to double American technical assistance to Polish enterprises to about $200 million, and it decided to halt unpublicized efforts to persuade the World Bank to release $250 million for projects in Poland.
 
Encouraging Private Investment
The officials said the centerpiece of the Administration program for Poland would be a trip next week to Warsaw by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who is taking with him a delegation of American business chiefs. The aim of the visit is to spur private investment in Poland.
Explaining the Administration's reluctance to undertake a major aid effort, a senior official said: ''The economic situation is still a swamp over there. Government unions are trying to be more militant than Solidarity, striking for large wage increases. It's still not clear that hard-liners in the Communist Party are reconciled to the new Government and want it to succeed.''
The decision to postpone the food airlift was taken because information is sparse about stockpiles of food in Poland. Chris Goldthwait, assistant general sales manager for the Foreign Agricultural Service, an arm of the Agriculture Department, is expected to visit Poland shortly to try to provide an accurate picture of its food needs. No Talks With I.M.F. The World Bank has been preparing a first wave of loans to Poland, intended chiefly to attack specific bottlenecks currently inhibiting Polish production and distribution. For example, the lack of capacity to produce cans of smaller size keeps Polish hams out of reach of many consumers, foreign and domestic.
But under new guidelines, the bank is reluctant to make loans to countries that have not agreed to economic adjustment programs with the International Monetary Fund. Polish officials have yet to sit down with the I.M.F.
Both the World Bank and the I.M.F. lend money for economic development, chiefly in developing countries.
Mr. Mosbacher said in an interview last week that he thought American business should be interested in investing in Poland because ''it's potentially a very large market, a market that has virtually no fulfillment.''
Several joint ventures are expected to be signed during his visit, involving such businesses as tourism and a Baltic fisheries operation near Gdansk for the export of cod and herring. ''They need a whole free enterprise system,'' he declared. ''They are looking for all the know-hows, from technology to accounting and finance, right across the spectrum.''

HEADLINE: Guerrillas Begin Salvador Talks By Offering a 3-Stage Peace Plan

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Negotiations between the Government of El Salvador and the leftist guerrillas seeking its overthrow began here today, with the rebels presenting a peace proposal to bring the decade-long civil war to an end in three stages over the next five months.
The plan made public by the rebel group, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, calls for an initial cease-fire no later than Nov. 15, to be accompanied by political, judicial and military measures by the Government.
If the Salvadoran Government agreed to the conditions, negotiations aimed at achieving a ''definitive cessation of hostilities'' would then take place by Jan. 31, the rebels said.
In response, the Salvadoran Government presented a plan that was limited to procedural matters. Participants said that the Government had proposed holding talks every two months at rotating sites, with the Roman Catholic Church present as a ''witness'' but barring the Organization of American States or United Nations observers the rebels have been demanding. 
Speaking for the Government delegation at a news conference tonight, Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria said the first day of talks had produced ''a positive balance.'' But Joaquin Villalobos, a rebel military commander, said the Government proposal was ''very poor'' and that he had expected ''to discuss something more than whether the table is going to be square or round.''
The talks here are the first between the two sides since President Alfredo Cristiani and his right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance, took power on June 1. They come at a time of growing political pressure from El Salvador's neighbors and from a populace exhausted by 10 years of conflict.
 
Change to a Political Party
The rebel proposal calls for Mr. Cristiani to move up legislative and municipal elections now scheduled for 1991 and to pledge ''a self-purification and professionalization of the armed forces.'' He would also have to agree to ''guarantee the clarification of responsibilities and sentencing of those guilty'' of the 1980 assassination of a Roman Catholic Archbishop, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, and ''all those involved in death-squad activities'' that have resulted in thousands of deaths.
As rebel leaders were quick to acknowledge, that last point is likely to prove especially delicate. The founder and behind-the-scenes leader of the governing party, Roberto D'Aubuisson, has been implicated in the assassination of Archbishop Romero and is also said by diplomats to have commanded other death-squad activities.
In the second phase of the plan, the rebel group would ''take the first step toward its incorporation into political life.'' Mr. Villalobos said that meant the rebels would be transformed from a heavily-armed insurgent military force into a political party willing to compete in elections.
''It is a step that implies great risks, but we are prepared to assume them as a show of real will, even when negotiations for a definitive halt to the hostilities have not been completed,'' he said. But when asked whether that meant the rebels were also prepared to surrender all their arms, he declined to be specific, saying the issue was ''absolutely secondary.''
The final phase of the rebel proposal would require a ''restructuring of the electoral system'' and fundamental changes in the Constitution. But its central element would be ''recognition of a single national army and its gradual reduction to the size strictly necessary for the defense of national sovereignty,'' accompanied by the fusing of all Government-security organs into ''a single one, under civilian command.''
On several occasions in the past, the rebels have offered peace plans calling for an overhaul of and diminished role for the Salvadoran Armed Forces, demands that the Government has always rejected.
Many senior officers in the armed forces, which have quadrupled in size to about 56,000 in the course of the war, favor a military solution to the conflict and doubt the sincerity of rebel peace overtures.
Finally, the rebel plan calls for the United States to convert its military assistance program to the Salvadaron Government into ''an aid fund for the economic and social recovery of the nation.'' Over the last decade, Washington has supplied more than $3.3 billion in aid, including nearly a billion dollars in military assistance, to El Salvador. [In Washington, a Bush Administration official said it would be inappropriate to comment on the rebels' proposal to convert military aid into economic assistance. ''We are not negotiating with the rebels,'' the official said. ''We deal with the established Government of El Salvador.''] The rebels also asked for what they called ''constructive cooperation'' from the Bush Administration during the course of the negotiations and urged the United States Congress to become involved in the process.

HEADLINE: Teacher Union Faults History Books

BYLINE: By JULIE JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The five most commonly used high school history textbooks barely touch on such major figures as Washington and Lincoln and they largely ignore the passion and political significance of religion and economics in American history, according to a new study by the American Federation of Teachers.
The study, released here today, said the books are bland and sacrifice details for graphics and color pictures. It also said that despite attempts to integrate the roles of women and minorities in history, the texts too often leave those groups ''cordoned off into special boxes and features.''
''It's not a condemnation of the texts,'' said Paul Gagnon, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, who spent two years compiling the report on the five history textbooks. ''They're not awful. They're not wrong. But they just don't offer enough help to teachers when we're facing increasingly complex problems in a diverse world.'' 
 
Teaching Being Criticized
The report comes amid debate over how social studies should be taught. The teaching of social studies has been criticized because high school students today generally know little about American and world history and geography. In May, the New York-Based Council on Interracial Books for Children, a smaller and more narrowly focused organization than the 710,000-member teachers' union, released a study on bias or ommissions in commonly used history books that reached conclusions similar to those in the A.F.T. report.
Professor Gagnon's report studied five textbooks: ''Triumph of the American Nation'' by Lewis Paul Todd and Merle Curtie, published by Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich in 1986; ''People and Our Country'' by Norman K. Risjord and Terry L. Haywoode, published by Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1982; ''The United States: A History of the Republic'' by James West Davidson and Mark H. Lytle, published by Prentice-Hall, a division of Gulf and Western, in 1981; ''History of a Free People'' by Henry W. Bragdon and Samuel P. McCutchen, published in 1981 by the Macmillan Publishing Company; and ''A History of the United States'' by Daniel J. Boorstin and Brooks M. Kelley, published by Ginn & Company in 1986.
Professor Gagnon said the books, generally used in the 11th grade, are read by two-thirds of the approximately five million students in American high schools.
 
Sympathy for Writers
While Professor Gagnon took the books to task, he expressed sympathy for textbook writers, who he said were often forced to condense details to fit the space allocated by the publishers.
Robert A. Richards, executive vice president of Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, who is director of the publisher's elementary and secondary programs, acknowledged that publishers were ''bound by space limitations.'' But he said they assume that many of the historical details left out of the high school texts have been covered in fifth grade textbooks as well as in textbooks for the eighth or ninth grades.
''The challenge to the publisher is to have as much coverage and be able to go into as much depth as possible and still offer a manageable textbook,'' Mr. Richards said. He noted that ''Triumph of the American Nation'' is 1,000 pages. ''Also part of this challenge is to provide a textbook that will satisfy a wide variety of state or city curriculum requirements and a wide variety of teachers.''
But Professor Gagnon's report asserted that the ''primary purpose of the American history course and its textbooks must be to help students understand what undergirds democracy.'' These were among the reports other conclusions:
* One textbook that offers no biography of Lincoln devotes 24 of 43 pages about the Civil War to pictures, maps and special features. The longest profile of the 16th President in any of the volumes is six paragraphs.
* Religious ideology from the Puritans to contemporary fundamentalist Christians is not dealt with adequately as a political influence.
* Little attention is paid to military strategy and practice from the Civil War to Vietnam.
''They have a format which reminds you of USA Today,'' the professor said. ''It's all graphics and colors and special features and little boxes inserted here and there.''
Rather than provide historical details that would augment intellectual discussion, he said the books ''are over-stuffed with features'' that help publishers sell the books to school districts, like the maps and charts.
 
Two-Year Courses Suggested
He recommended American history be taught over two years rather than one and that the subject be more tightly focused on the themes of democracy, economics and the nation's multicultural population.
The study was the third major report of the A.F.T.'s Education for Democracy Project, a joint venture between the union, the Educational Excellence Network, a private group of educators, parents and former goverment officials, and Freedom House, a human rights organization.
Mr. Gagnon's analysis raised questions about publishers who omit details on Lincoln or Washington while printing boxed ''mini-biographies'' of the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca, Blackbeard the Pirate, Noah Webster and Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief who tried to unite the Indian tribes of the West.
Mr. Richards defended the approach. ''We feel that at the 11th grade most students know who Abraham Lincoln and George Washington is,'' he said. ''It's a matter of space in some cases. It's a matter of emphasis in others.''
Albert Shanker, the A.F.T. president, said the report brings to the light what may be a larger problem.
''That is that within the community there is not agreement on the issue of teaching history and democracy,'' Mr. Shanker said. ''There are still a lot of people who take the view that we're being too chauvinistic if we say democracy is superior.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Widens Inquiry on College Price Fixing

BYLINE: By JULIE JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
A Justice Department inquiry into whether prestigious colleges and universities may have violated Federal antitrust laws in tuition and scholarship practices has been broadened to include six more schools, officials at the institutions said today.
The addition of Princeton, Brown, Cornell, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley and the University of Pennsylvania indicates that the inquiry now includes nearly 30 schools. The department is investigating whether elite institutions engage in a form of price-fixing by setting tuition, fees and financial aid at similar levels.
Amy Brown, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment today on the inquiry, other than to say, ''The antitrust division's investigation is continuing, and we are continuing to ask for information from schools.'' 
Ms. Brown would not say which institutions or how many are involved in the investigation. When the inquiry was announced last month, about two dozen schools were reported to be under scrutiny. Some of those that confirmed that they were questioned by the Justice Department were Harvard, Tufts, the University of Chicago, Williams, Bowdoin and Amherst. Officials at Princeton, Brown, Cornell, Penn, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley said in interviews today that each had received a confidential inquiry from the Justice Department on Monday.
The Government requested written answers to five questions on how they set tuition and scholarship levels. Schools were also asked to collect information on travel, expense accounts, telephone records and salaries, as well as planning documents reflecting the activities of officials who help set tuition and financial aid levels.
Since the inquiry was disclosed last month, college officials have acknowledged that it is a common practice to meet among themselves to discuss students accepted by more than one of them. The officers compare notes on how much the students can pay toward their tuition, room and board. As a result, some students receive almost identical aid offers from competing institutions.
But the colleges say there is nothing wrong with this practice. By avoiding bidding wars for the most desirable students, the officials say, they enable the students to choose their college on academic grounds alone. In a statement today, John F. Burness, vice president for university relations at Cornell, said, ''We believe Cornell's policies and practices are legal,'' and added that the university would take ''appropriate action'' if the Justice Department determines that they should be revised. Robert K. Durkee, Princeton's vice president for public affairs, said the Justice Department's inquiry ''covers a lot of ground'' and estimated that the material requested could fill boxes and boxes, if not buildings. ''All of us are a bit overwhelmed about how much is being requested and on how short a timetable,'' he said. The Justice Department has asked that the schools comply by Sept. 28.
Also today, an organization of private colleges issued a study intended to counter ''popular misconceptions'' that private colleges primarily serve the rich. The study, by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, was begun well before the Justice Department inquiry became known, It reported that the number of independent colleges charging less than $5,000 a year in tuition and fees is three times the number charging more than $10,000.
The report, based on statistics from the Government and the College Board, provides an economic and demographic profile of private college students.
It places the median income of the families of private college students at $34,000, $2,000 less than for students at state colleges. In 1988, it says, 32 percent of all freshmen in the study were the first in their families to attend college. That figure was 39 percent at Catholic colleges and 52 percent at historically black colleges.
Mr. Rosser, whose organization represents 850 institutions, including the Ivy League schools, noted that in 1988-89 private college tuition and fees ranged from less than $100 to $16,495.

HEADLINE: SENATE WEIGHS BAN ON FLIGHT SMOKING

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Temporarily frustrated by the parliamentary maneuvers of tobacco-state lawmakers, who are outnumbered but determined, the Senate today debated but did not vote on a measure that would permanently ban smoking on all domestic airline flights.
Passage is considered likely if a vote occurs, but Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, today began to filibuster. The bill's proponents responded by filing a motion to shut off debate. A two-thirds majority is needed for cloture; the vote may occur on Thursday. 
''We won't succumb to threats,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, the sponsor of the smoking ban.
A ban on smoking on flights, while far from the ultimate taboo against tobacco, would carry both symbolic and practical significance, outlawing smoking in one of the places where smokers' rights conflict most directly with those of nonsmokers, to the irritation of both groups. Smoking is already prohibited on flights lasting less than two hours, or about four out of every five flights.
If the Senate passes the smoking ban as part of its transportation spending bill, it could become law when House and Senate conferees meet to write a final bill. In August, the House retained the two-hour rule in its version of the spending bill, but it did so without taking a separate vote on the question, because the tobacco lobby was afraid that a floor fight might lead to tougher restrictions.
The delaying tactic today suggests that the lobby is aiming for the same result in the Senate, in the hope that senators would tire of the prolonged debate.
 
Union Optimistic on Bill
But Jo Ellen Deutsch, a lobbyist for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union that supports the ban because its members suffer prolonged and repeated exposure to the smoke of passengers, said ''it still looks good'' for eventual passage of the bill.
She said her count indicated that the bill's backers had a big enough margin to guarantee defeat for a filibuster or an attempt to kill the proposal through other parliamentary objections.
Airlines do not take a public position on the smoking issue, but several airline officials have said privately that they hope the Government will ban smoking.
The airline officials said their companies would save substantial sums of money if smoking were banned from all flights. For example, the expenses of cleaning and repairing airplanes would be lower, and there would be added flexibility in making reservations and assigning seats to passengers.
The comprehensive ban on smoking would take effect 90 days after the transportation bill is signed by President Bush. Violations of the new rule would result in a $1,000 fine, and tampering with smoke detectors in airplane lavatories would be punishable by a $2,000 fine, as is already the case with the limited ban.
Although all the familiar arguments about the health, safety and economic repercussions of the smoking question were discussed in two days of debate, the issue boiled down to the question of one group's right to impose its preferences on another.
 
Conservatives Disagree
''People choose to smoke, but there is no choice about breathing,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Republican from Utah.
''People who smoke cigarettes have a right, too,'' said Senator Helms, another conservative, whose state is a prime tobacco producer. ''But they are going to have no choice.''
But the tone of the debate suggested that this fundamental issue has already been laid to rest with the partial ban on smoking, just as the national consensus supports the idea that secondary exposure to smoke is, like active smoking, a health hazard.
A series of scientific studies, while not conclusive, have lent plenty of weight to the conclusion that breathing in somebody else's smoke can be hazardous to health.
For example, reports issued in 1986 by the Surgeon General of the United States and by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that ''passive smoking'' caused disease, including lung cancer, in otherwise healthy nonsmokers, and increased the frequency of respiratory illness in children while impairing the development of their lungs.
Also in 1986, the National Academy of Sciences issued a second report on air quality inside aircraft cabins, which recommended a total ban on smoking in aircraft.
Last year, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop asked the National Cancer Institute to further study the issue, and based on results published this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association, he renewed the call for a total ban on airline smoking.

HEADLINE: Go After Companies That Abuse Pension Funds;
Look to Savings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''How About Taxing Pension Fund Profits?'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 30), Nancy L. Kassebaum diagnoses one of our nation's major long-term economic weaknesses, but suggests an incorrect, even a counterproductive solution. The weakness is our apparent inability to save - the proposed solution would only discourage savings to a greater degree.
National savings provide the ultimate fuel for real economic growth. It is hardly a coincidence that Asia has been growing more than twice as fast as the United States for the last 10 years. 
The average savings rate of the Asian nations is in excess of 30 percent, compared to a pathetic 5.3 percent for the United States. For the average American, only real estate equity and pensions represent true savings. To tax either would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs of future economic growth.
Senator Kassebaum suggests that institutional investment managers have a ''short-term mentality'' toward portfolio investment, partly because they are ''increasingly hired and fired on the basis of their quarterly performance.''
I would argue first that it is the fiduciaries of those assets, rather than the investment professionals, who have the short-term perspective and, second, that the taxing of short-term gains would only serve to discourage additional savings - as it would add to the ultimate riskiness of the institutional investment process.
Had our legislators truly understood the severity of our savings problem, they never would have passed the provisions in the 1986 Tax Reform Act that reduced the American worker's ability to make annual contributions to pensions in pretax dollars from $30,000 to $7,500. It would appear that once again one of our elected officials is looking for a quick fix at the taxpayer's expense for Washington's inability to live within its means.
Senator Kassebaum inadvertently shows her true colors in her last paragraph, where her last sentence begins, ''In a time of budget deficit.'' I'm not the first, and I know I won't be the last, to suggest that our Federal Government should try to do a little saving as well. It just might set an example for the rest of us to follow.

HEADLINE: Destruction of Our Schools and Fear in the Streets Are Connected

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Devin S. Standard, a young black man, writes about his growing fear that he might be killed, for no other reason than that he is black (Op-Ed, Sept. 2). On the same page, an older white man, Felix G. Rohatyn, writes about the urgent need to improve the New York City school system.
All decent and responsible people share Mr. Standard's outrage at the murder of Yusuf K. Hawkins and the growing danger to other blacks. Unfortunately, he seems to be making the same kinds of generalizations about whites that the whites who commit racial murders of blacks make. We are at even greater risk of being murdered by so-called ''common'' criminals in search of our money or even of thrills than we are of being murdered because of race. 
That people of color are more likely than whites to suffer from the social ills associated with poverty is the fundamental reason people of color most often commit crimes, against whites and other people of color. Until we address the social causes of crime and the need for prompt and assured consequences for crime, we will all remain in danger from the antisocial behavior of fellow citizens of all racial groups.
While the educational reforms listed by Mr. Rohatyn will not alone solve the social problems of poverty, whites and people of color have yet to demonstrate understanding of the extent to which the Reagan-era destruction of social programs has increased the numbers of the poor and the disparity in conditions between them and the affluent.
Most critics have also failed to understand the extent to which public education in the inner cities was stripped of resources in the fiscal crises of the 1970's, only to be virtually destroyed by the Federal withdrawal of support that followed.
I write to point a finger at all those who have presided over education budgets whose increases have not kept pace with inflation and all those who fail to acknowledge that our city contains far more children at risk of failure and children with special needs than state aid to city schools reflects. I write also to make the connection between these needs and the climate of fear in which Mr. Standard and all of us are doomed to remain, so long as we fail to support an educational system capable of providing equal opportunity to all of our children.

HEADLINE: The New York Primary;
For Koch, Sigh of Relief; For Aides, Tight Smiles

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
For a last hurrah, it sounded distinctly like a sigh of relief.
''I feel as though a burden has been lifted from my shoulders,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch yesterday, after he stood on the steps of City Hall with the man who ended his bid for an unprecedented fourth term and pledged to do whatever he could to insure that David N. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, would succeed him.
As he made his way through the corridor toward his office in the West Wing, Mr. Koch stopped to shake hands and embrace some of the people who have worked for him during his nearly 12-year tenure. The Mayor's relief - if it was just relief and not shock or even a desire to find some good in Tuesday's bad news - was shared by some at City Hall. But for many who work in or around the municipal government's jewel box of a headquarters, it was a day of tight smiles, forced laughs, gallows humor and hallway post-mortems. 
For the first time in a dozen years, New York City would have a new government, and many of them knew they would not be part of it.
''It's just strange having things that are beyond your control,'' said Frederick P. Schaffer, who left the office of the city's Corporation Counsel to become the Mayor's counsel this year. ''Not necessarily bad, just strange.''
Asked about his future, John LoCicero, the mayor's political adviser, said, ''I haven't even thought about it.''
One city commissioner simply waved a reporter away, saying, ''Let's just let it be.''
Robert W. Linn, the Director of Personnel and Labor Relations, said that in previous transitions a minimum of 300 to 400 high-level appointees, like commissioners and their deputies, have been replaced. Another 1,000 to 3,000 city officials, Mr. Linn said, ''are within the range of people who could well turn over.''
He added that while it was technically possible that the jobs of 10,000 to 20,000 city employees could be in jeopardy, such wholesale personnel bloodletting has not been a tradition.
 
'I'm Ready to Move On'
''I don't see what you gain unless you have people to fill the positions,'' said Stanley Brezenoff, the First Deputy Mayor.
Mr. Linn himself was in ''active discussions'' earlier in the year with a law firm, but decided to stay on in government to consolidate the city's labor relations and personnel departments. He said he did not regret his decision, though the fate of his work, like other Koch administration initiatives, is uncertain.
Mr. Brezenoff said he did not think there was a chance he would be asked to stay, adding, ''I'm ready to move on.''
Harrison J. Goldin, the City Comptroller, who finished fourth in the Democratic mayoral primary, will also be out of a job. Mr. Goldin said he would look for a position in the private sector, though he declined to elaborate. Asked if he thought he would be making more than his $105,000 annual salary, he said, ''That clearly is an option, a rather attractive option.''
Mr. Goldin said he was looking forward to the privacy accorded people who are not in government. For example, he said, releasing his tax records was the ''ultimate indignity.''
 
'I've Never Felt Better'
As for Mr. Koch, he categorically ruled out ''another run for anything.''
''I really don't know,'' the Mayor said, when asked what he would do come January. ''I don't think I'll be unemployed.''
Mr. Koch looked rested, if not yet completely recovered, from a grueling campaign and an anxious and disappointing Tuesday, his 4,237th day in office.
''In fact, I believe that I've never felt better,'' he said. ''I mean I wanted to be the mayor for the next four years, but I also believe that it is an enormous, wrenching job. Anyone who runs for it will only find out when they hold that job how difficult it is. So while I would have liked to be the mayor, I'm not upset that I'm relieved of the responsibilities.''
 
Comparing Last Defeat
It is impossible to know whether he was being candid, putting a good face on a defeat that ended an extraordinary political career or was in what one aide called a ''denial of depression'' phase. Or maybe Tuesday's returns had not yet sunk in.
After his concession speech, Mr. Koch went home to Gracie Mansion for coffee with several aides and advisers and soon had a visitor - John Cardinal O'Connor.
The Mayor began the morning after by attending the 7:45 A.M. service at the Park East Synagogue on 67th Street in Manhattan, then went to his ''lucky'' subway stop, at 77th Street and Lexington Avenue, to talk to New Yorkers.
Mr. Koch spent a lot of time during the past two days on the phone. With Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, he compared his last defeat, in the gubernatorial primary of 1982, with this one. ''You know when you beat me I was distressed, depressed, angry,'' Mr. Koch recalled telling him. ''I'm not distressed, I'm not depressed, I'm not angry.''
An aide said the Mayor told Richard Ravitch, former head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who finished third in the primary: ''Dick, from one loser to another, you'll get over it.''
 
A Chat With the President
Mr. Koch also received a call from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a man who he attacked harshly last year. ''He said that he was very admiring, appreciative of my comments,'' the Mayor said, referring to his speech Tuesday night. ''He thought they were extremely helpful, said they established a moral tone which he was very supportive of. He said he was looking forward to coming in, sitting down and re-establishing our relationship, working together in support of David Dinkins.''
And about 3 P.M. yesterday, the Mayor chatted with President Bush, who invited him to lunch at the White House and complimented him on his graciousness in defeat.
There were varying opinions on when the Mayor and his advisers had concluded the cause was lost. Some thought it was not until the first results of exit polls started circulating on Tuesday afternoon. But others thought the situation looked bleak after the racial slaying in Bensonhurst and its aftermath.
The Mayor stressed a new message in the last week of the campaign, and especially its final days, when he began to talk about healing and reconciliation, themes Mr. Dinkins had emphasized. And then there was Mr. Koch's surprise proposal to Mr. Dinkins to hold a unity rally, a suggestion that resulted in yesterday's ceremony, which was attended by all four Democratic rivals. While no doubt meant to further that message, and his own political prospects, it also helped pave the way for Mr. Koch's harmonious exit from the race.
''I wanted to win,'' the Mayor said yesterday. ''I don't want to tell you that I did it for the game. Not at all. But I'm not - I don't want to stress this too much - I'm not, as people would expect, sad or depressed.
''I hope I'm remembered for all the good things that I did, not just the last few days,'' he said at another point. ''I've been a mayor for 12 years, in very difficult times. I hope that the span of memory covers 12 years and not just a week.''

HEADLINE: City Opera Is Struck; Fall Season Halted

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
The New York City Opera orchestra, unhappy with the company's proposals on wages and guaranteed work, struck the opera last night before the beginning of the company's fall season, which was to have been a performance of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia.'' The strike imperils the rest of the City Opera's season, which is scheduled to run through Nov. 19.
The ensemble voted 53 to 4 Tuesday night at the New York State Theater to proceed with the strike (12 of the 69 members did not vote, but union officials said that was because the musicians knew the result was a foregone conclusion). The decision was tallied yesterday afternoon and announced at a news conference at Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents the players.
The union set up its formally clad picket line an hour before yesterday's scheduled performance. Although no other unions representing opera employees have officially joined the strike, they did not cross the musicians' picket line. 
 
Discussion on March Sites
The picketing proceeded peacefully, apart from some squabbling with police and Lincoln Center security officers over where the marchers were allowed to promenade. In the end, some 45 musicians divided their time between the east side of the State Theater, the sidewalk along Columbus Avenue, and Dante Park between Broadway and Columbus Avenue, where a wind-and-brass group tootled operatic arrangements. After the 8 P.M. scheduled curtain time, a token number of marchers were allowed to picket briefly in front of the lobby entrance.
In the meantime, disappointed but resigned operagoers perused City Opera announcements on the doors of the theater lobby, which offered refund and exchange instructions, and considered their options for the rest of the evening.
The strike came after a summer in which the federation and the other principal performers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, had worked without contracts. Both unions' pacts had expired on May 30.
Sanford I. Wolff, the guild's national executive secretary, said yesterday that he was meeting daily with his fellow union officials, but that a formal decision to join the strike could not come before a meeting of the City Opera guild members set for Sept. 25. The guild represents soloists, the chorus, dancers and stage directors.
 
Informal Proposals
On Sept. 6, the federation gave the opera seven days' formal strike notice. Both sides conceded yesterday that the warning had galvanized the negotiations, which had stagnated over the summer. But although some informal proposals were made in intensive talks lasting over the weekend, the union felt by the last session, Monday night, that insufficent progress had been achieved, and continued with its strike vote.
At present, no new sessions are scheduled. Timothy Germany of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service has been in touch with the parties, but has not participated in the negotiations.
Both sides expressed regrets. ''I believe this is an unnecessary strike,'' said Martin J. Oppenheimer, the vice chairman of the City Opera board and its chief labor negotiator. ''With hard bargaining, the principals should be able to come to an agreement. I hope it will be a short strike.''
 
'It Seemed Hopeless'
''No one wants a strike'' said Frank Morelli, the orchestra's principal bassoonist and head of its negotiating committee. But, added John Palanchian, the vice president of Local 802 and for 22 years a City Opera violinist, ''We were so far apart it seemed hopeless.''
Christopher Keene, the newly appointed general director of the City Opera, would not discuss the dispute, but said in a statement: ''This strike is a difficult time for all of us - company members as well as the opera-loving public of New York. I hope we can reach an equitable solution and return to performing very shortly.''
Beverly Sills, Mr. Keene's predecessor, expressed regret through a City Opera spokeswoman, and Robert W. Wilson, the City Opera chairman, declined to comment.
The orchestra is seeking raises that far exceed the customary 5 percent to 6 percent increases of recent years. In the third and last year of its old contract, the minimum weekly base pay for five and a half performances was $755.25, with rehearsals compensated at an additional $22.59 an hour for most players. The orchestra has stated that its goal is per-performance parity with the orchestras of the San Francisco Opera and the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which would mean a raise of some 20 percent.
Mr. Oppenheimer has rejected that standard of comparison, pointing out that those companies' ticket prices are roughly double those of the popularly priced City Opera. ''We don't want to get into an exercise in which we compare ourselves with anybody else,'' he said.
 
Annual Raises and Workweeks
The company's last formal proposal in July offered annual raises of 4 percent in each year of a new three-year contract. But higher figures have since been discussed informally, both sides said.
The other major issue involves work weeks. Last season, orchestra members were guaranteed 23 weeks of full-pay work and six more weeks in which they would be employed or would be paid ''supplemental unemployment benefits'' amounting to one half their wages.
The company, faced with the expiration next spring of a five-year, $5 million grant by the philanthropist Lawrence Wien to produce spring seasons of ''classic musicals,'' is unwilling to offer guarantees for work it is not sure it can provide. The union takes the position that the company offered such guarantees before without sure knowledge of how it would provide for work - including the settlement in 1983, after a 54-day strike. Indeed, the union has argued, the presence of a guarantee sometimes stimulates companies into seeking additional engagements and financing.
 
Bolshoi Visit Questioned
Another issue is the proposed visit of the Bolshoi Ballet next summer to the City Opera's home, the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center, which Mr. Oppenheimer called ''99 and 44-hundredths percent sure.'' That would mean a curtailment of the opera season by three weeks. But Mr. Oppenheimer indicated that the company was willing to guarantee that the City Opera orchestra would be engaged for the Bolshoi, and that the visit from the Bolshoi was not part of a plan for regular curtailments of the opera season.
Both sides suggested yesterday that compromises were possible. Mr. Morelli said the orchestra had already broached the possibility of an elimination of its supplemental benefits, if they were compensated by higher wages and some additional workweeks. Mr. Oppenheimer indicated that the company's opposition to guaranteeing more weeks was negotiable.
Although summer attendance was ''a few percentage points under budget,'' according to Susan Woelzl, a City Opera spokeswoman, neither side suggested that the company was in any way encouraging a strike, or planned far-reaching reorganizations that would affect its union contracts.
 
No Pact Without Stoppage
This strike is part of a long history of City Opera labor turbulence. Except for 1986, no contract with the orchestra since 1962 was achieved without some sort of work stoppage. The 1983 strike came on the heels of Miss Sills's decision to combine the former spring and fall seasons into a single summer-fall season, thus shrinking the number of company workweeks. The dispute was settled after the other company unions put pressure on the orchestra.
Both sides recognized that a prolonged strike would threaten the entire fall season. After the scheduled end of the fall season, on Nov. 19, the company is not set to perform again until the final subsidized season of musicals in April 1990.
The musicians will receive an immediate $125 weekly from Local 802 strike funds, and an additional $100 in federation funds starting next week. The federation funds last for 15 weeks. The local funds end after seven weeks, when the musicians become eligible for $245 in unemployment benefits.
Ms. Woelzl said that ticket-holders could eventually exchange their seats for future performances, obtain refunds when the strike is over, or donate the tickets to the City Opera.

HEADLINE: Panel Votes Today on Gains Tax

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, today exhausted his options for compromise on capital gains taxes and scheduled a vote for Thursday on a cut in the tax rate. The cut is backed by the Bush Administration and supported by a majority of committee members.
The proposal, sponsored by Representative Ed Jenkins, Democrat of Georgia, would reduce the tax rate on capital gains to 19.6 percent for two years, from the current 28 percent rate. The rate would then return to 28 percent, but under an arrangement known as indexing, investors would then be allowed to exclude from taxation the portion of their profits solely attributable to inflation. 
Mr. Rostenkowski, caught between liberal Democrats who oppose any reduction and conservative Democrats who have sided with Republicans to support the Jenkins plan, has delayed a vote on it for weeks, hoping to reach a consensus on a more limited alternative.
 
Deal That Collapsed
Mr. Jenkins said that he and his allies agreed late Tuesday night to an alternative Rostenkowski plan but that the deal collapsed this morning. The chairman's plan would have permitted indexing of capital assets and more generous tax breaks for assets held 5 or 10 years. But liberals on the committee told the chairman the evolving plan had become politically indistinguishable from an outright rate cut.
Several who attended the closed meeting said they had argued that the Democratic Party should not be in the position of supporting a tax-rate reduction that provided its greatest benefit to the wealthiest taxpayers. They said a clean yes or no vote on the Jenkins plan, regardless of the outcome, was preferable to a vote on a compromise.
 
Sentiment Among Liberals
Representative Tom Downey, Democrat of Long Island, a member of the committee, said the sentiment among liberals had nothing to do with a proposal made Tuesday by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas to restore tax deductions for individual retirement accounts as an alternative to a capital gains cut. Mr. Bentsen, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, has generally supported capital gains reduction but said his plan was a more equitable and fiscally responsible way to stimulate capital investment.
Earlier today, the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said that he supported I.R.A.'s and that it had been unfortunate that the deduction for contributions to the retirement accounts had been curtailed as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. ''If there is a way to restore the I.R.A.'s and finance the restoration of the I.R.A.'s, I would be glad to do it,'' Mr. Foley said.
Mr. Foley reiterated his opposition to a cut in the capital gains tax and said he would remain opposed regardless of whether I.R.A. deductions are restored. ''It can't be justified in terms of any value that we, the two parties, share in terms of economic growth or investment, and it's simply a tax break mostly for people in the highest income brackets who need it least,'' he said of a capital gains rate reduction.
Mr. Rostenkowski's decision to allow a committee vote, made after consultation with the Mr. Foley means the capital gains fight will eventually be waged on the House floor, where the tax panel chairman and House Democratic leaders will attempt to scuttle the Jenkins plan. Both sides have said a floor vote on capital gains reduction will be close, and Democratic leaders have acknowledged that they can lose it.
If the Jenkins proposal is adopted by the Ways and Means Committee, it will become part of a broader tax bill that raises $5.3 billion needed to meet the committee's contribution to a deficit reduction package for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The panel has already agreed on provisions to raise the $5.3 billion, and for a time today Mr. Rostenkowski tried to convince one or more of the Democrats allied with Mr. Jenkins to agree to send only this ''bare bones'' tax bill out of the committee.
In exchange, Mr. Rostenkowski offered to permit a floor vote on the Jenkins proposal, but none of the Jenkins forces would agree.
Liberal Democrats on the panel are expected to try to weaken the Jenkins plan or amend it with provisions that would make it unpalatable to Republican supporters. But Mr. Jenkins said he was confident that he has the solid support of the 19 votes to win approval of the capital gains cut in committee.

HEADLINE: Senate Sustains Bush Veto Of Limits on Japan Jet Deal

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Senate failed today by one vote to override President Bush's veto of Congressional restrictions on the joint American-Japanese production of an advanced jet fighter.
Lawmakers on both sides of the issue had anticipated that the vote would be close. But the 66-to-34 vote in favor of the override - just short of the needed two-thirds majority -was a measure of the growing tension between Congress and the White House over the direction and control of trade policy.
In the first test of a Bush veto, the Senate's failure to override narrowly averted what the President had portrayed as a serious encroachment on his constitutional powers, as well as a potentially embarrassing dispute with Japan at a time of heightened sensitivity over the huge American trade deficit with that country. 
The Congressional restrictions vetoed by Mr. Bush were the outgrowth of an agreement last year between the United States and Japan to cooperate in the development of Japan's next generation of fighter aircraft, a deal projected to be worth $6 billion. Instead of buying a new plane from the United States, Japan sought to develop its own fighter, based on the design of the highly successful F-16 but modified by the addition of its own components and technology.
After failing in May to block that agreement and thus the start of development work, the Senate approved a set of restrictions that would apply to any future agreement on the actual production of the new aircraft, called the FSX. The House adopted the same restrictions in June, and President Bush vetoed the measure on July 31.
Both the original FSX debate and today's debate on the veto override were laced with emotional rhetoric about the American trade deficit with Japan and how the joint venture might worsen it. At the heart of the controversy, however, is a more fundamental battle over turf as Congress seeks to exert new influence on trade and national security issues.
Indeed, many lawmakers have viewed the FSX fight as less a struggle over a single international transaction than a far-reaching example of how national security concerns have come to encompass economic issues. They point to the development and sale of high-definition television and other revolutionary telecommunications technologies as further arenas in which they hope Congress will be able to play a greater role.
Some senators, however, said Congress was going too far in its efforts.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, told his colleagues today that the FSX production restrictions were an interference with the executive authority of the President. ''What this resolution does is wrap a straitjacket around the President,'' he said. ''This resolution would set a dangerous precedent. It is a meddling micro-managing mistake.''
But Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who was the principal author of the restrictions, said the resolution in which they are spelled out would improve the terms of the deal for the United States. ''The Japanese have proven adept at finding opportunites to deviate from agreements signed with the United States, and on several occasions simply violated those agreements,'' he said, citing deals on semiconductors and telecommunications.
The restrictions vetoed by Mr. Bush would have required the President to insure that all technology, military articles and military services provided to Japan in the development of the FSX be subject to arms export control laws. In addition, they would have required that any future agreement between the United States and Japan on production of the aircraft prohibit transfer of critical jet engine technologies to Japan and bar Japan from selling to other countries the FSX or any of its major subcomponents that were jointly developed with the United States.
The restrictions also included a nonbinding ''sense of Congress'' directive that any production agreement specify that American manufacturers receive at least 40 percent of the work.
Other provisions would have stipulated an advisory role for the Commerce Department in negotiating and implementing future agreements on the FSX program.
Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, one of 12 Republicans who voted to override the veto, said the restrictions would not derail the agreement as some of Mr. Bush's supporters charged. ''This debate is about the drawing of lines between the President and the Congress on international trade issues,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pilots' Offer for UAL Is Said to Be Ready

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The $300-a-share offer for the UAL Corporation by the pilots' union and the company's top management is to be presented to a meeting of UAL's independent directors in Chicago today, people close to those making the bid said yesterday.
The sources said the board is expected to press Marvin Davis, the Los Angeles investor, to declare whether he wants to stay in the bidding. If he drops out, the board might decide to approve the pilot-management bid or it might delay final action for a short period to give other bidders a last chance to make an offer. 
Someone close to the bidding said yesterday that Mr. Davis or any other outside bidder would be at a disadvantage because they could not match the no-strike guarantees and cuts in wages and benefits that the union, the Air Line Pilots Association, has offered in its effort to win control of the airline.
Therefore, this source said, it is unlikely that Mr. Davis would try to top the $300-a-share bid.
 
Big Stake for Employees
Under the pilot-management proposal, United's 70,000 employees could end up controlling as much as 75 percent of the airline, making it by far the largest employee-owned company in the nation.
Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman and chief executive of UAL, sent a letter to employees yesterday explaining the advantages of an employee stock ownership plan.
''My personal opinion is that there is great cause for hope and optimism,'' he said. ''While, on one hand, I have been strongly against leveraging the balance sheet, once it became an inescapable end, the only question for me was who should own our company. Again for me, the only acceptable answer is our employees.''
 
Another Union May Join
A person close to the pilots' union said that another important union, the Association of Flight Attendants, had shown an interest in being part of the buyout plan.
Carol Holmes, the vice president of the union, which represents 13,500 flight attendants, said that the union had not yet acted but that on Tuesday the company had presented a proposal to join the buyout to the union's governing body.
A person close to the pilots' union said that Jack Pope, the chief financial officer of UAL, has arranged financing for the bid, which would total about $6.8 billion. Mr. Pope persuaded bank lenders to allow a reopening of some of the terms of the financing if United should find itself in a severe recession like the one that hit the industry in 1980 and 1981, the source said.
Also, the source said, the pilots' union would reopen parts of its seven-year contract under certain conditions, if the bid was approved.
On the other hand, the source said, if the airline does well and is able to repay debt much faster than expected, then some of the cuts in wages and benefits might be shortened or modified.
 
Some Possible Advantages
The airline could end up with an operating cost advantage over other airlines. The pilots, under a new contract, would take 10 percent cuts in pay. Also, rather than being paid for some hours worked, the pilots would get credit toward company stock.
The union would also be committed to a seven-year contract. It would not strike during that period and its members would be obliged to cross any picket lines put up by other unions.
The other major union at United. the International Assocication of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, remains unwilling to participate in the offer. It was, however, holding talks with parties who were part of the buyout effort.

HEADLINE: U.S. and India Sign Tax Pact

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 13

 BODY:
After 30 years of negotiations, India and the United States signed an agreement yesterday to avoid double taxation, and American officials said today that the accord could set a precedent for tax relations between the United States and other developing nations.
Officials from both countries said they expected bilateral trade and American investment in India to increase substantially as a result of the agreement. They especially cited the transfer of high technology from the United States to India.
Parts of the treaty, especially the provisions dealing with royalties, make important changes from ''standard U.S. treaty policy,'' said American officials and diplomats involved in the negotiations. The only other country with which the United States shares such a treaty is China.
 
'A Legal Platform'
''What The treaty does is establish a legal platform for companies, citizens and permanent residents of both countries to define how much taxes they owe and to which Government,'' an official said. Thus American companies will no longer be subject to strict Indian rules that put a 30 percent tax on office revenues even if the business office functions here for only 15 days.
After Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi expressed an interest in the taxation issue during a visit to Washington in 1987, the negotiations were speeded up. The treaty was signed here Tuesday by the American Ambassador, John R. Hubbard, and India's Revenue Secretary, Nitish Sengupta.
''There have been rocky moments in Indo-U.S. relations, and the tax treaty is a very welcome piece of good news,'' said Louis Warren, the economic counselor at the American Embassy here. The United States is the largest foreign investor in India, with investments worth more than $600 million, and is also New Delhi's largest trading partner.

HEADLINE: Mexico and Banks Agree On Debt Accord Language

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Mexican Government and a committee of banks announced an agreement today on detailed language covering the debt-reduction plan reached between that nation and the bank group in July.
The language, called a term sheet, will be sent to the more than 500 banks owed money by Mexico, officials said. The term sheet provides a list of options the banks may exercise to reduce the amount of Mexican debt on their books. 
The agreement also opens the way for Mexico to use a $2 billion bridge loan from the United States and other sources to help it meet its needs until the relief from the proposal becomes available.
''The agreement on the term sheet concludes the second stage of the process,'' said Angel Gurria, Under Secretary of the Mexican Ministry of Finance.
''As expected, it has taken several weeks since we reached agreement in principle in July, but the issues we confronted were new, extremely complex and economically of great importance, both to Mexico and the banks,'' he said in a statement released in New York, where the bank panel and Mexican officials met.
''After a period for review, we will visit financial centers around the world to explain the package and answer the banks' questions,'' Mr. Gurria said.
Mexico's agreement in principle with the steering committee of 15 creditor banks, reached July 24, was seen as a test of the policy of the Bush Administration for reducing third world debt and as a milestone for other debtor countries.
It represents the first significant reduction in a government's debt to commercial banks.
Under the agreement, each bank will have three options: a 35 percent reduction in principal, reduction of the interest rate on its loans to 6.25 percent from the current average of about 10 percent, or providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what Mexico owes the bank.
The deal applies to about $53 billion of Mexico's foreign debt, which is a total of $107 billion, second in the developing world to the $120 billion owed by Brazil.
 
Bank Accounting Rule
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission removed a potential obstacle to Mexico's debt-reduction plan today by confirming that banks in the United States that swap their loans for lower-value bonds would not have to record a loss.
An S.E.C. staff memorandum released today was in line with a ruling that governed a prototype bonds-for-loans swap that Mexico arranged last year. Under the ruling banks do not record a loss if the total receipts from repaying the loan under the renegotiated terms are equal to receipts under the old payment schedule.

HEADLINE: Foreign Exchange Trading Is Near $500 Billion a Day

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The world's foreign exchange market is growing rapidly, according to reports released by central banks yesterday. London is still the largest foreign exchange market in the world, but the United States and Japan are catching up.
The worldwide market is nearing $500 billion in total transactions. And as foreign exchange trading grows, it is playing a larger role in reflecting worldwide reaction to economic news and to American economic policy. 
Far more than just several years ago, the movement of the dollar on any day tends to influence the moods of the bond and stock markets.
The foreign exchange market in the United States, which is No. 2, grew by 120 percent over the last three years, the reports said. At $128.9 billion, it now rivals the size of the government securities market, where daily trading is at $125 billion to $150 billion.
In London, trading volume was $187 billion, up by 107 percent from $90 billion in March 1986. In Tokyo, where the growth was the sharpest, the average volume was reported to be $115.2 billion, up by 140 percent from $48 billion in March 1986.
The trading figures are from reports by the central banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The last survey was conducted three years ago. The reports are the broadest and most coordinated effort to measure foreign exchange activity.
The market has grown as world economies have become more interrelated and capital markets more integrated, said Gretchen Greene, the senior vice president in charge of foreign exchange at the New York Fed, which did the American survey. This internationalization of the economy has led to easier capital flows and has opened the opportunity for people and companies to invest abroad, which has increased the need for swapping currencies.
 
Looking to Hedge Risk
The volume of trading has also risen, she said, because more commercial banks and investment banks are getting into the business, partly because it is seen as a new avenue for profits. And more companies are using the market to hedge their risk in doing business in other countries.
The Federal Reserve report does not detail the specific nature of the trading - that is, whether it is mostly by speculators. But Ms. Greene said the survey showed that only about 12 percent of the trades reported were with customers not involved in regular foreign exchange trading.
The New York Fed said that average daily trading in April totaled $128.9 billion, up from $58.5 billion in March 1986 and from $18 billion in 1980. This combines the trading completed by banks and other institutions, mostly investment banks based in the United States. Of the total, 40 percent was done by subsidiaries of foreign banks.
The figures are adjusted to remove double counting of trades between institutions in the United States. But the totals reported for each country are not adjusted for this double counting, so adding the individual figures do not give a precise amount for worldwide volume.
 
Plenty of Movement
The Fed's report does not disclose the volume of trading by institution, but it does show that it is a volatile business and that a lot of movement exists among the leaders. Ms. Greene said that four of the top five institutions in 1986 fell to the bottom of the Top 10 list this year and that two institutions fell off the list this year.
The West German mark is still the leading currency traded against the dollar, but the Japanese yen is gaining. This year, 32.1 percent of the volume was in marks, down from 33.7 percent in 1986, while the volume of yen trades was 26.4 percent, up from 23.7 percent in 1986.
Almost two-thirds of the trading is direct, or spot-currency trades, the same proportion as in 1986. But currency options, a tool used to limit risk, have grown to 4.3 percent of the volume this year, from nine-tenths of 1 percent in 1986.
Other countries reporting yesterday included France, Canada and the Netherlands, where the trading volume was much lower. It was $26 billion in France, $16 billion in the Netherlands - with the double counting of trades - and $15 billion in Canada.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Off 2.8% on Low Supplies

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Sales of American-built cars dropped by 2.8 percent in early September as consumers found that some 1989 models were in short supply at dealers after two months of brisk sales that had surprised some analysts.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the domestic industry sold vehicles at an annual rate of 6.8 million units in the Sept. 1-10 period, compared with the 7.4 million average rate since the start of the year.
Analysts said the Ford Motor Company's inventory of new cars was the thinnest, contributing to the company's 6.6 percent drop in sales, to 37,044, for the latest period. The General Motors Corporation posted sales of 66,445, or 1.7 percent higher, and the Chrysler Corporation reported sales of 19,007, a 6.7 percent increase. 
 
Overall Sales Down
Over all, the eight domestic manufacturers, including the four Japanese auto makers that build cars in this country, posted sales of 132,004, compared with 155,131 in the 1988 selling period. The percentage decline is adjusted to account for seven selling days during the latest period, compared with eight selling days in the corresponding period last year.
Earlier in the summer, many of the analysts said that auto makers were producing too many cars in light of some forecasts that the economy and sales would slump, but that had not been the case.
''In retrospect, the companies gave rebates that were more generous than necessary,'' said Scott Merlis, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. ''The problem has switched from the demand side to the supply side.''
Mr. Merlis said inventories of 1989 Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta, Ford Taurus, Buick LeSabre and Chrysler's Sundance and Shadow models were all lower than normal, which probably meant that certain models were not available at some dealerships.
''Generous rebates are still in effect,'' said Charles Brady of Oppenheimer & Company in New York. ''But when the only car left out there in the dealer's lot is orange with a burgundy interior, they don't work.''
 
Other Factors
David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., also in New York, who has been pessimistic about car sales for most of the year, said low inventories were only part of the reason for lower sales. ''That's some of the reason for the beginning of the fall collapse,'' he said. ''I think there is a lot more demand for the 1989's than there is going to be for the 1990's.''
In two weeks, the domestic companies officially begin selling their 1990 models, with retail prices that promise to be significantly higher than those for 1989. But executives of the Big Three auto makers have declined to speculate whether they will continue the rebates, and if so, how large they will be.
''I think the companies are going to go eyeball-to-eyeball with the consumer for 20 to 30 days'' without rebates to test demand, Mr. Brady said. ''With fourth-quarter production schedules so low, they're not running a big risk of getting stuck with many cars.''

HEADLINE: Dow Loses 27.74 Points to Close at 2,679.52

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks dropped sharply yesterday, as weaker bond and dollar prices prompted a late round of program trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended 27.74 points lower, at 2,679.52, after being down only 7 points an hour before the close. Yesterday's close was the first time in three weeks that the Dow ended a day trading below 2,700.
In the broader market, declines on the New York Stock Exchange far exceeded advances, by 912 to 555.
By late in the day, the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue was off about half a point, while the dollar was moderately lower against most leading currencies. 
 
Volume Increases
Volume on the Big Board increased to 175.3 million shares, from 142.1 million on Tuesday. Many investors moved from the sidelines, puting aside any inclination to remain inactive while awaiting several economic reports scheduled for release tomorrow.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 3.24, to 345.46, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.59, to 192.29.
''What we saw today was a roller-coaster session triggered by traders' vacillating perceptions about the economic outlook,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
''In the last hour, when the Dow failed to cross above 2,700, selling programs jumped in to push the market down,'' Mr. Peroni added. He said the market is ''exhibiting visible signs of wear and tear as investors grow impatient with the Dow's inability to make any decisive headway since setting a new peak.''
Analysts said the market was also adversely affected by rumors that Merrill Lynch faced large losses from its dealings in high-yield ''junk bonds.'' The rumors were quickly denied by Merrill, but Merrill's shares ended the day off 1 3/8, to 32 7/8.
Traders said there were rumors that Merrill held a large position in junk bonds. The junk bond market has been jittery in recent days, partly because of the cash-flow problems of the Campeau Corporation, a large issuer of junk bonds. A Merrill Lynch spokesman said of the rumors that the firm had suffered big losses, ''They're all false.''
National Semiconductor was the most active stock on the Big Board, rising 3/8, to 7 7/8, on a volume of nearly 3.5 million shares. Thomas Kurlak, a Merrill Lynch analyst, made favorable comments on the semiconductor group.
Circle K dropped 1 3/4, to 7 3/4, and was the biggest percentage loser. The company said it had terminated solicitation of proposals to acquire it and had suspended its dividend.
 
Possible Takeover Seen
Burlington Resources rose 3/4, to 47 1/2, on 1.75 million shares. The company said it knew of no reason for the activity, but traders said there were rumors that the company might be an acquisition target.
MGM/UA Communications was up 1 1/2, to 21 1/4. The company said it had received a takeover bid from a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but did not identify the company.
Active blue chips included A.T.&T., which dropped 1/2, to 40; Exxon, off 7/8, to 44 1/2; General Electric, down 1 3/8, to 55 1/2; and I.B.M., off 1 1/2, to 115 3/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market-value index slipped 0.77, to 383.77. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading dipped 0.03, to 471.83.
In over-the-counter trading, MCI Communications rose 1 3/8, to 42 1/2, after a Salomon Brothers analyst, Lap Y. Lee, reiterated a ''buy'' recommendation on the stock, traders said.
Mack Trucks dropped 1/2, to 11 1/8. The company said it expected to report a net loss of about $50 million for the third quarter and substantial losses for the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in a Broad Decline; Gold Prices Up on Comex

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against all key foreign currencies in quiet trading yesteday.
Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $359.90 an ounce, up 40 cents from Tuesday. 
Linda McLaughlin, a currency trader for Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, attributed the dollar's decline largely to renewed concerns that West Germany and Japan might soon raise their interest rates, helping to strengthen the yen and mark.
 
Economic Data Awaited
But she said yesterday's trading was relatively light as many dealers preferred to keep a low profile in anticipation of a spate of economic data.
Today the Government is scheduled to release its report on August retail sales. Tomorrow reports on August producer prices, industrial production and July merchandise trade are due out.
In New York, the dollar finished at 146.40 yen, down from 146.91. And sterling fetched $1.5585 in New York, up from $1.5485.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.9725 West German marks, down from 1.9865; 1.6990 Swiss francs, down from 1.7140; 6.6525 French francs, down from 6.6915; 1.18405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18725, and 1,415.00 Italian lire, down from 1,422.125.
Gold traded at $358.50 an ounce in London late yesterday, down from $358.75 bid Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $358.25 an ounce from $358.55. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $359.93 an ounce, unchanged from Tuesday.
Silver prices were little changed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.07 an ounce, from $5.07 Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Detroit Mayor Easily Wins Primary but Faces Runoff

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Mayor Coleman A. Young, one of the first blacks to lead a major American city, won a big victory Tuesday over a dozen challengers, with Representative John Conyers Jr. coming in third in the city's nonpartisan primary.
Mr. Young will face Tom Barrow, an accountant who is a nephew of the prizefighter Joe Louis, in a runoff election in November. Mr. Barrow ran against the Mayor in 1985, Mr. Young received 103,827 votes, or 51 percent, and Mr. Barrow received 48,695, or 24 percent. Mr. Conyers, a 13-term Congressman, received 36,247 votes, or 18 percent. Ten other candidates shared the rest of the vote, with City Council President Erma Henderson taking a distant fourth place.
Mr. Young, 71 years old, celebrated his success at a reception where music from Michael Jackson's ''Bad'' album boomed over a sound system. 
 
'The War Is Not Over'
''Don't celebrate too long, because the war is not over,'' he said. ''The victory is not won.''
Mr. Conyers, who entered the race a day before the filing deadline in May, refused to concede during a brief appearance at a reception Tuesday night. At a news conference today, Mr. Conyers conceded the election but defended his strategy, saying, ''Campaigns by their nature are disorganized.'' Asked what he would have done differently, he said, ''I would have started earlier.''
Mr. Barrow, 40, has campaigned virtually since losing the 1985 race 39 percent to Mr. Young's 61 percent. But he has never held office and does not have a well-financed political machine to match Mr. Young's.
''I think Barrow unfortunately is not going to be able to mobilize the kind of organizational structure necessary to unseat the Mayor,'' said Wilbur Rich, an associate professor of political science at Wayne State University who has written a biography of Mr. Young. ''I think he'll try to replay the 1985 election, which is not going to be enough to give the Mayor serious competition.''
Mr. Barrow campaigned on what he called Mr. Young's favoritism of development over neighborhood renewal. Mr. Young, meanwhile, emphasized jobs and riverfront development created during his 16 years in office. $5 Million Raised Mr. Young reported raising $5 million for what he said would be his last election, to be the first five-term Detroit Mayor.
The manager of the Barrow campaign, Geoffrey Garfield, said Mr. Barrow's grass-roots approach could match Mr. Young's media barrage.
''Now that people know that Coleman can be beaten, we expect fund raising will pick up,'' Mr. Garfield said. ''We got this far against a 25-year Congressman that everyone thought was going to wipe us out. It was the most organized campaign this city has seen in 20 years.''
Mr. Conyers, whose campaign appeared unfocused, had been given a slight edge over Mr. Barrow in pre-election polls because of his quarter-century in Congress representing Detroit's west side.
In other mayoral elections Tuesday, Mayor Don Fraser of Minneapolis easily topped a field of seven candidates in a nonpartisan primary, but still must face his leading challenger, Jens Peterson, a firefighter, in November. Both are running on the Democratic Farmer Labor Party label.
In neighboring St. Paul, where Mayor George Latimer is retiring, City Council President Jim Schneibel, also of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party, led a field of nine candidates. Former City Councilman Bob Fletcher finished second and will face Mr. Schneibel in November.
 
Mobile Mayor Is Unseated
In Mobile, Ala., Mike Dow unseated Mayor Arthur Outlaw in a bitter mayoral election in Alabama's second-largest city. Mr. Dow had 30,444 votes, or 56 percent, to 23,715, or 44 percent, for Mr. Outlaw, who is chairman of the State Republican Party, in the nonpartisan race.
Some viewed the race as an early test of Gov. Guy Hunt's strength for a 1990 re-election. The Mobile area strongly supported Mr. Hunt, who is a Republican, in 1986 and is considered Republican territory. Some of Mr. Dow's supporters were aligned with Attorney General Don Siegelman, who is considered one of Mr. Hunt's potential Democratic opponents.

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK PRIMARY;
The Candidates on the Issues

 BODY:
In separate interviews last month with The New York Times, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani discussed their views on major issues facing New Yorkers. Here are excerpts from their responses:
Q. What can you, as mayor, do to restore civility and reduce racial tension?
DINKINS: I think much of it can be by example. He can set a tone, an atmosphere. High on my agenda is to try to improve the climate in race relations generally. 
GIULIANI: We need to restore a sense of unity and we need to restore a sense of common purpose in the city. And the way a mayor does it is by talking decently and in a way that emphasizes all our similarities.Every time I talk to a group of people, whether it's a black group or a white group or a Latino group, I get the same questions. People are concerned about the same things. I think a mayor has to let people know that.
Q. How many more police officers does the city need?
DINKINS: I've committed right now to doubling the number of community patrol officers in the first four years. Im talking about something in the neighborhood of 800. But I would also like to see officers on top of that, 2,000, 1,500, 2,500. If you ask people what they want, they will tell you a cop on the beat.
GIULIANI: I'm certain we need somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 police officers over the next three to four years. Beyond that, it's really a question of what happens to the crime rates.
Q. How would you perk up the New York City economy and create jobs?
DINKINS: We need to diversify our economy. We need not to be at the mercy of an October in Wall Street. We need to assist the garment industry and graphic arts. We need to think of incubators which would assist small businesses with the struggle to get started. You give them different kinds of assistance.
GIULIANI: What the city is going to do, it's going to have to show progress to business leaders here. We're going to have to show progress in rolling back the crime problem, rolling back the drug problem. The mayor taking charge of our school system and leading a radical reform of the system.
Q. What would you do about New York City's health-care crisis?
DINKINS: We've got to recognize the need to pay home health care workers, for instance, decent salaries. Because the failure to do so keeps some people in the hospitals at $500 to $1,000 a day, whereas peanuts would permit them to go home because there was somebody to care for them.
GIULIANI: The mayor should assume the role as leader of the hospital health system in New York, which is both a private and a public system. The mayor should become a spokesman, with them, for getting the kind of additional subsidies and help that they're going to need, and increases in the rates from Albany, which is something that is being considered right now.
Q. What can a mayor do about homeless and mentally ill people living in the streets?
DINKINS: If we want to get the people off the street, we have to provide an alternative that is viable. It costs us about $33 to $36 a day for folks at a place like the Fort Washington shelter. It costs under $25 a day, a person, with services, with supportive services, in a decent S.R.O. So, in other words, it is not us saying 'Oh, we can't afford that.' We're spending the money wrong.
GIULIANI: You have to develop a system of rescue centers around the city to replace the barrack-like shelters and supported S.R.O.'s for people who have more substantial problems than just not being able to afford a place to live. And I dont believe that would be any more expensive than the barrack like shelters that we now have.

HEADLINE: Rules Passed by Metro-North Could Help to Rout Homeless

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
The Metro-North Commuter Railroad adopted draft rule yesterday intended to regulate public conduct aboard trains and in passenger stations in New York State, including Grand Central Station.
Although the proposed rules would prohibit everything from smoking and littering to spitting and specific forms of sexual conduct, some appeared aimed specifically at the homeless, who are especially numerous in Grand Central.
The draft rules would also forbid such acts as washing oneself at a drinking fountain; washing ''clothing or other personal belongings'' in restrooms or at any other sources of water; changing clothes or ''remaining undressed'' in any Metro-North site; lying on ''floors, platforms, stairs or landings''; occupying more than one seat, and creating ''unreasonable noise.'' 
The proposals were approved unanimously and virtually without discussion at a monthly meeting of the railroad's board.
 
Harassment Is Charged
The would also prohibit the dispensing of ''food or commercial merchandise with or without charge'' except ''pursuant to the terms of a lease, license, operation agreement or concession'' granted by the railroad or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Advocated for the homeless and civil rights lawyers immediately denounced the proposed regulations as illogical and mean-spirited, saying they appeared to be part of barely disguised effort to displace the homeless through police harassment.
A staff report by a Metro-North lawyer, Robert Bergen, said the proposed rules were intended ''to codify in a single document standards of conduct for Metro-North's customers and employees and for the public at large.''
Peter Stangl, the Metro-North president, described the proposals as part of a continuing effort by the M.T.A. to make all of its agencies codify ''quality of life'' regulations.
''But,'' he said ''there are also people pretending to be homeless who are selling crack and committing other crimes in Grand Central, and we want them out of there.''
 
Now a Criminal Problem
Asked whether the rules might create unnecessary confrontations between the Metro-North police and homeless people, he said: ''I don't think they will do that. The purpose of these ules is not to increase confrontation.''
But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said, ''It's inevitable that there will be confrontations.''
These rules would transform a social and economic problem into a criminal problem,'' he said. ''If Metro-North would just continue its work with the city agencies and homeless advocates,'' Mr. Siegel said, ''The might be able to accomplish the same thing.''
Last month, the railroad helped coordinate a five-day program in Grand Central intended to coax the homeless to shelters or into drug or alcohol treatment programs. Official hope the program, involving the city's Human Resources Administration and private agencies, will eventually be put into effect throughout the M.T.A. system.
Under the proposed rules, violators would be issued summonses, ejected, or both. They would also be subject to fines of up to $50 and 30 days in jail.
''Obviously, things like spitting, littering and urinating in public are not acceptable behavior,'' said Fred Griesbach, director of the New York State Coalition for the Homeless. ''But these are things that are going to happen when people don't have bathrooms of their own.
''I've never considered people who are trying to keep themselves clean as people committing a criminal offense,'' Mr. Griesbach said.
The proposals must still be discussed at a formal public hearing and will ultimately require action by the full M.T.A. board.

HEADLINE: Bush Doubles Food Aid to Poland After Being Pressed by Congress

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
In a reversal apparently prompted by pressure from Congress, President Bush announced today that the United States would double food aid for Poland to $100 million in the next fiscal year.
The President said in a White House statement that the new assistance, which would supplement aid from the European Community and is intended to reach Poland before winter, ''underscores our continuing commitment to assist the Polish Government and people.''
At a National Security Council meeting last week, Administration officials reportedly ruled out an immediate, major increase in aid. But leading members of Congress of both parties told the President he needed a high visibility program to demonstrate support for the new Polish Government, the first since the 1940's that is not dominated by the Communists. 
 
Dole Pressed for Increase
A White House official acknowledged this afternoon that the program ''comes out of discussions we had with people on the Hill.''
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, who met with top Polish leaders last month, told Mr. Bush that there was a limited time for action to help the fledgling Government. A spokesman said the Kansas Republican had been told by Poland's new Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, that ''anyone who gives now, gives twice.''
Lawmakers welcomed the President's action, but several said it did not go far enough.
 
'Stopgap Effort' Seen
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, called it a ''stopgap effort that fails to give Poland the long-term help it needs to restructure its agricultural economy and to sustain the world's newest democracy.''
The Vermont Democrat has proposed a program of forgiveness of Poland's $2 billion of agricultural debt to the United States, as well as financial aid and a broad range of technical assistance.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to draft a financial aid package for Poland next week. ''The White House was starting to feel a general sense of political pressure to do more than they have,'' a committee staff member said.
At a National Security Council meeting last week, Administration officials concluded that because of continued economic disorder in Poland - with raging inflation, strikes for large wage increases and uncertainty about the Communist Party's willingness to let the new Government succeed - it was not realistic to proceed with any large-scale aid.
The additional assistance announced today will come from an existing budget authorization under the Food Assistance Program, a standing program to provide food aid, and requires no legislation.
The first $50 million, announced on Aug. 1 as part of a total $119 million package for Poland, was a grant. The new $50 million represents a combination of grants of surplus foods, concessionary loans and subsidized sales.
Together with $8.4 million in emergency food aid in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the new program brings to $108.4 million the total food assistance for the two years - offered in such commodities as meat, corn, butter, butter oil, cottonseed, sunflower oil, cotton and rice.
The effort is in tandem with the $140 million that the European Community has pledged in food aid as part of a coordinated effort called for by Mr. Bush at an economic summit meeting in Paris in July.
The precise allocations still have to be worked out with the Polish Government. One danger is that the sudden supply of commodities, competing with similar Polish products, could depress domestic production.
It was not clear whether all the food would stay in Poland or whether export would be authorized to give the Poles some needed foreign exchange.
Mr. Bush said it was his intention that the food aid ''support long-term reform of the Polish agricultural system by providing much needed commodities during a transitional period toward a market economy.''
Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader whose non-Communist trade union movement has a dominant role in the Warsaw Government, is expected to visit Washington in November.
Mr. Walesa has called for $10 billion of emergency aid.

HEADLINE: House Committee Votes 19 to 17 To Reduce Tax on Capital Gains

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
A divided House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation today to cut the tax on capital gains, handing President Bush an important political victory and setting the stage for a bruising fight on the House floor later this month.
The committee's 19-to-17 vote was an embarrassing defeat for one of the most powerful members of the House, Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the committee. Mr. Rostenkowski hoped until the end to fracture an alliance between six conservative Democrats and all 13 Republicans on the panel. He repeatedly delayed a vote to avoid a floor battle that would pit Democrats against one another as well as against the Republicans and the Administration.
Those who want a lower tax rate on capital gains, as the nation had before the Tax Reform Act of 1986, assert that the lower rates encourage investors to trade assets like stocks, bonds and real estate more frequently. That makes more capital available to business for expansion or new ventures, they say. 
 
No Guarantee
Opponents contend that there is no guarantee that such capital will be productive and that the lower rates benefit the rich at the expense of the working classes.
Although the capital gains cut has Administration backing, it differs somewhat from the proposal first advanced by Mr. Bush in his 1988 election campaign. At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said, ''We are pleased by the vote, and we will be working hard to sustain it on the floor.''
The measure adopted today was written by a Democrat, Representative Ed Jenkins of Georgia. Democrats who opposed the cut, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, directed their criticism at the President rather than members of their own party.
''This is Bush's folly,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''This was George Bush's idea to help out his wealthy friends, and it was George Bush's efforts that made this happen today.''
 
'Better Paying Jobs'
But Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the committee's senior Republican, praised the committee action, say-ing it would ''mean better paying jobs for more Americans.'' He disputed Democratic contentions that it was a boon for the wealthy. ''This cut will benefit family farmers, small businesses, timber interests and it will not add to the deficit,'' he said.
Earlier this week, Mr. Rostenkowski won agreement from the supporters of a capital gains cut for a limited alternative, but the liberals on the committee rejected the plan. They insisted that Democrats had no business supporting tax breaks that primarily benefited the wealthy.
That message became today's rallying cry for the House Democratic leaders, who pledged to seek defeat of the capital gains tax cut and to come up with an alternative that a majority of the party could support.
''What we did here is something for the wealthiest Americans that will eventually be paid for out of the pocketbooks of middle- and low-income workers,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''It will raise the budget deficit, it will not help the economy, and it is not good tax policy.''
The Jenkins measure would allow investors to ignore 30 percent of their profit on sales of assets in calculating their taxes, if those assets are held more than one year and sold between Sept. 14, 1989, and Dec. 31, 1991. Capital gains are currently taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, which is 28 percent for most taxpayers. The exclusion would temporarily have the effect of reducing their capital gains rate to 19.6 percent.
 
Adjusting for Inflation
Once the tax break expires, investors who sell assets acquired after Dec. 31, 1991, would not be taxed on the portion of any profits attributable solely to inflation. This procedure, known as indexing, was part of Mr. Rostenkowski's compromise plan, and committee Democrats said it might well be incorporated in the alternative Democratic leaders present on the House floor.
The cut in the capital gains rate is part of a larger tax bill that is expected to raise $6.9 billion in the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, more than enough to satisfy the tax committee's obligation for the deficit reduction package that Congress must pass in the next month.
The tax bill includes enhanced tax credits for child care, reductions in the surtax that Medicare recipients pay for insurance against the catastrophic costs of serious illness, and extension of a variety of popular tax breaks that have expired or are due to expire at the end of the year. It effectively repeals a much-disputed requirement that employers not discriminate against lower-paid employees and retirees in health-care plans, and it restricts the tax advantages of some leveraged buyouts.
To offset the bill's revenue losing measures, the bill includes higher benefit premiums for Medicare recipients, a new excise tax on ozone depleting chemicals, extension of the telephone excise tax and a speedup in the collection of payroll taxes for large companies.
Crafting an alternative to the committee measure that is acceptable to an array of Democrats and at the same time is attractive enough to scuttle the capital gains cut will be no easy task. Perhaps a third of the House Democrats favors some cut in the capital gains tax, including traditionally liberal lawmakers from states with sizable timber interests and family farms. People in these enterprises would stand to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
In a rehearsal of the intraparty bargaining to come, committee Democrats today offered a series of amendments to the Jenkins plan. These measures, all defeated, would have aided lower-income taxpayers and restored the right, in general, to deduct contributions to individual retirement accounts from taxable income. They would also have raised the top tax rate on the wealthiest Americans to 33 percent from 28 percent. The intention was to match the rates paid by some upper-middle-income taxpayers, who are caught in what is known as the ''33 percent bubble'' because of a 5 percent surcharge.
 
'Middle-Class Massacre'
''It was a middle-class massacre,'' said Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, as he emerged from the closed session in which votes were taken today. Mr. Rostenkowski was equally angry.
''Amendments dedicating some of the proceeds of this plan to drug enforcement and deficit reductions were rejected,'' he said. ''Over and over again, sometimes through tie votes, a bare majority of the committee decided that a tax cut for the wealthiest of Americans is more important than any other economic issue.''
Mr. Rostenkowski, who avoided reporters and issued a written statement after the vote, said it would be ''a financial disaster to this country.''
''Today's action, which could be a first step in the unraveling of tax reform, is the ultimate expression of feel-good economics,'' he said. ''The President and his supporters want the American people to believe that there is no price to pay for this tax giveaway. In just a few years, the people will find out just how misguided this plan is.''
The six Democrats who sided with the Republicans in support of the capital gains tax cut were Mr. Jenkins, J. J. Pickle of Texas, Mike Andrews of Texas, Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, Andrew Jacobs of Indiana and Ronnie Flippo of Alabama.
 
Renewed I.R.A.'s
Among the alternatives, the proposal that seems to be gathering the greatest momentum is to restore the deduction for contributions to I.R.A.'s. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, advanced the idea earlier this week, arguing that it would encourage the saving needed to assist capital formation in the United States while conferring a tax benefit on a far broader segment of Americans than a capital gains tax cut.
''The Bentsen proposal is popular among Democratic members because it is the kind of political cover that everybody needs,'' one Ways and Means Committee aide said. ''You can be against capital gains and for the middle class, and that is the perfect place to be.''
 
Highly Charged Debate
The highly charged political debate over the capital gains cut has largely obscured the longstanding economic arguments on the issue. Proponents of a cut contend that taxing profits from investments at a lower rate than ordinary income encourages people to buy stocks, bonds, real estate and the like, thereby making more capital available to business, so that it can expand or develop new products.
In a statement issued after the capital gains vote, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady touched on those themes, praising the committee action as ''a major step forward in providing incentives for long-term investment in the United States.''
Opponents of the capital gains cut argue that without impossibly complicated regulations and restrictions, there is no guarantee that investment money will flow to productive businesses or high risk ventures, where capital is most needed. The two sides also differ over the long-term impact of a capital gains cut on the Federal budget deficit.
While there is general agreement that the initial wave of buying and selling by investors to take advantage of the lower rate will bring money in to the Treasury, there is considerable disagreement about whether the lower tax rate will eventually mean lower or higher revenues.
 
By AGIS SALPUKAS
After a two-week battle, a $6.75 billion bid that would make United Airlines the nation's largest employee-owned company was approved last night by the parent company's board.
The directors of the UAL Corporation accepted the $300-a-share offer from a group that includes pilots and top executives at the airline, the nation's second largest, and British Airways. A rival bidder, the investor Marvin Davis, apparently dropped out earlier, people familiar with the bidding said.
The deal still needs the approval of shareholders and the Department of Transportation. Little resistance is expected, but the Transportation Department has in the past raised concerns about foreign carriers buying into American airlines.
 
'The American Perestroika'
Under the proposal, British Airways would end up owning 15 percent of the company, the management group 10 percent and the other employees 75 percent.
Analysts said the buyout would be a milestone in relations between American labor and management.
''This is the American perestroika,'' said Gene Keilin, a general partner at the investment banking firm Lazard Freres & Company who helped assemble the deal, comparing it to the economic reorganization in the Soviet Union.
Analysts predicted yesterday that other airlines and big companies might become candidates for buyouts led by unions and management to prevent outside investors from gaining control.
 
Employees Not All Owners
But experts on employee-owned companies said that teaming up on a buyout might be the easy part. They predicted that conflicts and problems would come not only at the management level, where executives and union leaders will have to work together, but also at lower levels, where attempts would be made to motivate the pilots and possibly other workers involved in the deal to improve productivity and involve them more in running the company. [Page D5.] One of the biggest problems facing the new company may be that not all employees will become owners. Stephen M. Wolf, chairman and president of UAL and a member of the group whose bid was accepted, said all of the more than 60,000 UAL workers would be invited to participate in a stock ownership plan.
But so far, United's more than 20,000 machinists, who have been at odds with its 6,100 pilots over the future of the company, have refused to participate in the takeover. United's unionized flight attendants opened negotiations yesterday about entering the buyout.
After the deal, the company's 15-member board would reflect the diverse ownership. At least eight members would be independent of any of the buyout groups. Management would appoint three directors, the participating unions would choose three and British Airways would appoint one.
Unlike other companies in which employees gained ownership, UAL is not struggling and does not need such a buyout as a last resort. Instead, UAL is a strong, profitable company, and it had an offer from a wealthy investor in Mr. Davis.
''This is by far the largest deal in which employees are buying a highly profitable company,'' Mr. Keilin said.
Mr. Davis started the bidding for the company, and his most recent offer was for $275 a share. But he could not win concessions from other unions to match those the pilots had offered in their proposal for the company.
The stake that would be held by British Airways reflects the rising number of international agreements in the airline industry and the trend toward creating airlines without national identities.
The buyout would also make United Airlines more competitive, because of concessions on wages and benefits by United's pilots. Other carriers may be forced to lower their own costs.
The takeover group has obtained $3 billion in financing from banks led by Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Bank. The group must still raise another $4.2 billion to meet the buyout sum and cover debt. But both Citicorp and Chase said they would be able to raise the rest of the money.
Sharon Kalin, an arbitrager who has followed the deal closely, said the group would have no problem getting the rest of the money because banks are eager to lend in a takeover of a profitable American company whose cash flow comes mostly from the United States.
UAL said it would begin a tender offer for all the outstanding common shares of the company at $300 a share in cash beginning Sept. 21.
The company also said its managers and advisers would be available for inquiries by other investors who may want to bid for UAL, but as of last night no other bids were expected.
Mr. Davis, who had indicated earlier that he might want to raise his bid, was considered to be unlikely to stay in the bidding after the board's action yesterday.
Jim Fingerorth, a spokesman for Mr. Davis, said the investor would not have any comment on the UAL board's action but would make a statement today.
 
British Airways Meeting Set
Colin Marshall, president and chief executive of British Airways, which is participating in the pilot-management group offer, met with analysts in New York yesterday and outlined the advantages that an alliance with United would provide for both carriers.
British Airways has agreed to put up $750 million of the $1 billion of equity in the proposal. In addition to getting a 15 percent interest in UAL, it hopes to find other ways for the two carriers to cooperate - in maintenance and flight scheduling, for example.
A spokesman for British Airways said Mr. Marshall had told analysts that the carrier would hold a special shareholders' meeting in the first half of October to vote on the buyout.

HEADLINE: House Panel Assails U.S. Policy on Khmer Rouge

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The Administration's policy of supporting a settlement in Cambodia that would bring the Khmer Rouge guerrillas into a transitional government came under stinging attack today in Congress.
The Administration's position on the Khmer Rouge was known before, but it has become a more contentious issue with the approach of a Vietnamese withdrawal from the country, which is to be completed this month. The Vietnamese have backed Cambodia's Communist Government for the last decade in its fight against the Khmer Rouge and its non-Communist allies, including Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
A peace conference of the competing factions ended last month in Paris without agreement on a power-sharing arrangement, and continued fighting appears likely. Doubts are being raised among lawmakers about whether the United States should continue backing Prince Sihanouk, with either lethal or nonlethal aid, especially considering his alliance with the Khmer Rouge. 
 
Resistance to Pol Pot
''The United States of America does not have the luxury of recusing itself from moral judgments,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. ''In this regard there is a view of many, including this member, that Pol Pot should be brought before an international tribunal for war crimes.''
The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, is blamed for the death of more than a million Cambodians under their rule between 1975 and 1978, when Vietnam invaded.
In the Administration's first Congressional testimony on Cambodia since the Paris talks, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Richard H. Solomon, appeared today before the House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.
Mr. Solomon said that while on the surface the Administration's position in Paris of allowing the Khmer Rouge to be part of a transitional power-sharing arrangement in Cambodia might not seem ''particularly morally impressive,'' it was the only policy that was realistic and held out a possibility of ultimately undermining the Khmer Rouge through political means.
The major question before the Administration as it considers Cambodia policy today, Mr. Solomon said in prepared remarks, is this: ''Should the Khmer Rouge, responsible for genocidal violence of the 1970's, be totally excluded from the political process with only a military option? Or, should it -less its top leadership - be given a limited stake in a transitional political coalition that would, under international supervision,'' face the test of Cambodian elections?
''From an American perspective,'' he said, ''we want no role for the Khmer Rouge in a future Cambodian government.'' But he said Prince Sihanouk, China and the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations felt that the chances of peace would be better if the Khmer Rouge took part in an interim coalition. Such a coalition would also include Prince Sihanouk, the Hanoi-backed Hun Sen regime, and followers of former Prime Minister Son Sann.
''We are not schoolchildren in this business,'' said Mr. Solomon, alluding to the history of Khmer Rouge brutality. ''The chances of avoiding continuing conflict are not very good. But we firmly believe that the chances are much better to get this problem under control if you have a structured political settlement than if you just leave a situation that is totally unstructured or unconstrained, where civil conflict is almost a certainty.''
Representative Chester G. Atkins, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Mr. Solomon there was ''every indication from people that the Khmer Rouge will continue to fight whether they are part of a settlement or not.''
''It would seem to me that there is no reason we would want to insist that the Khmer Rouge be part of a settlement other than the fact that Sihanouk wants it,'' Mr. Atkins said. ''It would seem that in light of the outcome in Paris that Sihanouk is increasingly playing a personal agenda which relates to his own political aggrandizement and less and less of a nationalist Cambodian agenda.''

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Barney Frank's Public and Private Lives: Lonely Struggle for Coexistence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
When he was first elected to the State Legislature from the Back Bay of Boston in 1973, Barney Frank's friends told him that if he was going to be a politician he would have to spruce up. His hair was a mess, his shoes were unpolished, and, to be blunt, he was fat.
Barney Frank, aggressive to the point of irritating, brilliant to the point of arrogant, responded in a classically Barney Frank manner. Instead of losing weight, cutting his hair or polishing his shoes, he produced a campaign poster. Above a huge picture of a bloated Barney, his black hair tousled (but his shoes at least unseen), was the headline ''Neatness isn't everything. Re-elect Barney.''
Today that poster has the most prominent spot on the wall in the Washington office of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts. 
Mr. Frank points up at the poster as he explains what was wrong with his life back then - how he tried to divide his public from his private life, how he could not handle the strain of this and, finally, how he made a personal blunder that threatens now to wreck a political career more successful than he ever imagined possible as a boy growing up in Bayonne, N.J.
Mr. Frank is a homosexual. In 1987, he became the first member of Congress to voluntarily acknowledge this, answering honestly a question that he had instructed a reporter to ask him. That moment, he said, was the end of a long struggle for him to stop ''conceding on the private side and having people judge me wholly on the public side.''
 
Looking Back Over a Lifetime
In a political time when things that were once nobody's business have now become everybody's business, the exploration of the Massachusetts Democrat's private life, now under way on the front pages of newspapers and in the House ethics committee because of his relationship with a male prostitute, is singular, forcing not just the public but Barney Frank himself to delve back over his life. ''I'd always been interested in public policy,'' he said in his office this week, ''I had not thought growing up that I was likely to be an elected official. I was Jewish and gay and I knew that.''
He pumped gas at his father's truck stop in Jersey City. He went to Harvard. He took every politics course there was. He tried to write a doctoral thesis, but did not have the patience. He went to work in Kevin White's victorious mayoral campaign and then went with him as executive assistant to Boston's City Hall. With the encouragement of friends, he won a seat in the Legislature.
Through these years, and on to Congress in 1980, Mr. Frank did not so much conceal his private life as abandon even trying to have one, he said. Mr. Frank, who is approaching 50, says he thinks younger gay men understand better how to make a life than he did. ''In my case it was compounded by the fact that I was overweight,'' he said. ''My sense of personal self-esteem was pretty low. My estimate of my social skills was pretty low.''
Publicly, success followed success. In 1979, the Rev. Robert F. Drinan was told by the Pope to leave Congress. Mr. Frank ran for the seat and won. ''I was enjoying my public life a lot,'' Mr. Frank recalls, but felt ''a sense of desperation at the state of my personal life.
 
Facing a Long-Delayed Issue
So in 1983, after winning election to a second term in the House, he said, ''I began to think about how I would deal with the personal side and tried various combinations and permutations.'' But he had waited so long to seek a private life, that when he finally tried, he said, he did not really know how.
''It wasn't just being gay,'' he said. ''It was having this sense of being awkward, of being an outsider of being a minority in so many ways.''
So, he said, his efforts were tentative and, in one case, disastrous - his involvement with Stephen L. Gobie, a male prostitute who then conducted his business from Mr. Frank's Capitol Hill apartment. Many supporters of Mr. Frank are trying to understand why, as one of them put it, a man as smart as Barney is did something so dumb.
''It is generally not understood that gay people often have a prolonged social adolescence,'' said Mr. Frank's friend and supporter, Thomas Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the oldest national gay rights group in the country. ''They have to deal with questions of dating and sexual adolescence at a later stage. This was part of Barney discovering who he was. Most people understand when it happens to an 18-year-old heterosexual male. It's the same phenomenon.''
Barney Frank has outgrown the man of the campaign poster. As part of his effort to put his personal life together he has slimmed down, is neater. His suits are better. His hair, now graying, is somewhat neater, although his shoes could still use some polish. He lives in a stable relationship with another man.
 
Haunting Experience
But the personal struggles of the old Barney Frank have come back to haunt him, particularly the day in 1985 when he answered an ad in a gay newspaper. At the other end of the telephone was one Stephen L. Gobie, young, strapping, smooth-talking. Mr. Frank, by his own account, paid him $80 for sex, and then befriended him, hoping he could turn Mr. Gobie away from drugs and prostitution. He wrote letters on behalf of Mr. Gobie to his probation officer. Mr. Gobie called Mr. Frank ''sweet and low''-sweet guy, low on cash.
Two years after the two men parted company, Mr. Gobie has decided to tell his tale, mostly in a series of interviews with The Washington Times. Each time the story begins to lag, he adds new details. Not only did he use Mr. Frank's Capitol Hill apartment for prostitution, which Mr. Frank says he did not know. but Mr. Gobie also serviced Congressional wives, he says. He said he used Mr. Frank's car for trysts and that Mr. Frank quashed the parking tickets by sending them to the House clerk; Mr. Frank says he is gathering up all his canceled checks to the District of Columbia parking bureau to disprove this. It is ironic that Mr. Frank's sexual orientation - or at least the public acknowldgment of it - would have kept him from office in earlier days, because as a politician he is something of a throwback. He can walk out on the floor of the House and debate ideas, live and in person, with wit and intelligence. He does not read speeches.
''He is about the quickest mind I've ever met,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn.
His ability to synthesis situations or ideas made him a prominent spokesman for the liberal wing of his party. In a debate over abortion, he accused the anti-abortion forces of believing that life begins at conception, and ends at birth.
 
Fond Memories of Childhood
He draws his oratorical inspiration not from Clay or Webster but from Shemp Howard, who was one of the Three Stooges and the husband of his father's cousin. Some of his fondest memories of childhood, he said, were when his mother took him to the comedy movies in Newark where they would laugh together at Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and Moe, Larry and Curly.
''It's precisely because things that we talk about are so deadly serious that humor is essential,'' Mr. Frank said.
Once, he asked Mr. Stoddard if he would like to come as his date to a White House dinner, where perhaps Senator Bob Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, one of Washington's most prominent couples, would also be attending. ''We'll be the gay Doles,'' Mr. Frank said. Mr. Frank can be a little too sharp-edged, however. ''I am impatient,'' he said. ''The impatience has come across as arrogance.'' Even Mr. Frank's explanation has that edge as he says he sometimes feels that in Washington ''there are hundreds of people and part of what they get paid for is to waste my time.''
Arrogance, even a streak of hubris, is what some of his colleagues perceive when Mr. Frank does things like filing an ethics complaint against Representative Gus Savage, Democrat of Illinois, asking that the committee investigte charges that Mr. Savage accosted a woman in the back seat of a Government car while he was on an offical visit to Africa just a few weeks before Mr. Frank's own troubles started.
Mr. Frank draws a strict distinction between public and private activity, maintaining none of his problems ever affected his work. ''People are capable of having messed up careers and wonderfully successful private private lives and vice versa,'' he said. ''It may be that you would have bad judgment that would negatively affect both. But my answer would be that during the period I was feeling weakest about my private life, people were saying nice things about my public life.''
 
Friends See Improvements
Actually, friends say, they have noticed improvements since he came to Congress. At first, they recall, he bounced from issue to issue. Now he focuses more, in the last few years, helping to usher through the 1987 housing act and playing an important role in the debate on last year's immigration law.
Mr. Frank's usual buoyancy was missing as he sat in his office the other day trying to talk. He rubbed his hands together and often held them over his mouth as he spoke, like an insecure boy. The intercom buzzed. ''Take a message and hold the calls,'' he says, ''unless it's Herb or Ann.''
Ann is his sister, Ann Lewis, the Democratic consultant. Herb is Herb Moses, his companion, who is an economist. Things would be much worse without him, Mr. Frank said.
''One of the things that happens when you are public and you are dealing with it is you can get to meet people,'' Mr. Frank said. ''I met somebody who is a throughly thoughtful and sensible guy. He's younger than I am, but he's more mature. He's been a wholly positve influence. I thought I'd managed by '87 to put some of that personal crazyness behind me. I guess I didn't fully do that.''

HEADLINE: REAGAN TO LEAVE HOSPITAL TODAY

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Minn., Sept. 14

 BODY:
Former President Ronald Reagan is to leave for his Los Angeles home Friday from a hospital here where he underwent brain surgery last week, a spokesman for Mr. Reagan said today.
Physicians caring for the 78-year-old Mr. Reagan ''are completely satisfied with his recuperation,'' the spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said in a daily briefing for reporters.
Mr. Reagan's surgery last Friday entailed the drilling of a hole in his skull to drain a blood clot on the right side of his brain. The subdural hematoma resulted from a fall from a horse during a vacation two months ago. 
The blood clot was Mr. Reagan's second from the horseriding accident and was detected in a routine medical checkup at the Mayo Clinic here last week. Mr. Reagan faces a small but significant risk of the formation of another subdural hematoma, doctors not connected with his case have said.
 
Trips to 6 States Canceled
Mr. Weinberg said the Mayo medical team had ''not yet addressed'' plans for Mr. Reagan's care in California. But he said the former President had canceled a trip to New York and five other states that was to begin next Monday. Mr. Reagan had been scheduled to visit New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, Virginia and Arizona to receive awards and give speeches.
Today, Mr. Reagan paid calls on children who are patients in St. Marys Hospital, which is part of the Mayo Foundation. He also had two prominent visitors - Secretary of Labor Elizabeth H. Dole and Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick Soviet politician, with whom he met for the first time.
After a 20-minute meeting with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Yeltsin said, ''It seemed as if he feels pretty good.''
Mr. Yeltsin, the 58-year-old former Moscow party chief, said he had asked for the visit because of his ''very high regard'' for Mr. Reagan's contributions in improving Soviet-American relations.
Both countries have to work to solve mutual economic, social, ethical and moral problems, Mr. Yeltsin said.
Mr. Yeltsin, who is on an eight-day tour of this country, said he and Mr. Reagan talked about ''a fair number of things,'' including life in the two countries.

HEADLINE: Soak the Poor! Trash the Economy!

 BODY:
Misleading. Deceptive. Faithless. Such was the decision yesterday by six Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee to break rank and vote with the Republicans to lower the capital gains tax for two and a half years. The Democratic leadership now confronts the huge task of reversing the committee's vote on the floor of the House.
The decision was misleading because the Gang of Six promises that the vote will raise tax revenues, thereby preserving valuable tax preferences that would otherwise end. But the revenue increase would last only a year or two, as the country's wealthiest families rush to sell appreciated assets before the tax holiday ends. 
After this initial orgy, revenues would fall steadily and sizably. Congress would then be forced to raise someone else's taxes, or cut even more Federal programs. It's a sure bet that the ultimate losers will be poorer than the families enriched by the Gang of Six.
The decision was deceptive because the Gang of Six, led by Ed Jenkins of Georgia, claims the vote will promote long-term productive investment. Yet the cut is temporary, and would mainly reward old investments. Does the Gang of Six really believe that a windfall profit on past investments affects decisions about future investment? Moreover, most money for venture capital now comes from pension and other tax-exempt funds. Tax cuts for individuals cannot possibly affect the investment decisions of tax-exempt organizations.
The decision is faithless because it violates the bargain struck in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Marginal tax rates for the rich were reduced from 50 percent to 28 in exchange for full taxation of capital gains and closing other tax loopholes. Now the Gang of Six wants to retract a big part of the bargain.
If earned and unearned income are taxed unequally, investors will put their money where taxes are low, not where productivity is high. The 1986 tax reform equalized the rates and eliminated this perversion. Yesterday, the Gang of Six voted to unravel this victory.
Rather than ruin the tax code, the Democrats and their Republican allies on the committee could have proposed constructive improvements. They didn't. But the full House and Senate still can. Here's how. Index capital gains. Capital gains are unfairly taxed in one respect. The increased value of long-held asssets reflects some inflation and some real profit. Indexing capital gains is warranted, so inflationary increases in price are not taxed.
The committee did provide for indexation. But it made two mistakes. First, the bill allows for indexation of past investments. Investors deserve no belated gift. And giving a tax break on past investment does nothing to spur future investment. Second, the committee would index nearly all assets. This is ill advised. Indexation of corporate equity is justified. Indexation of real estate, which is already tax-advantaged, is not.
Restore I.R.A.'s. Recent research shows that tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts boosted the nation's savings rate. This is one tax shelter that is worth resurrecting, as Senator Lloyd Bentsen has proposed. But the House committee rejected the idea.
Ease taxation of dividends. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady recently recommended reducing the tax on corporate dividends. Currently, when firms borrow, they can deduct the interest. But they pay tax on dividends to shareholders. This inequality encourages excessive borrowing. To correct it by making all dividends exempt from taxation would mean an intolerable revenue loss. That's why Mr. Brady wants only a partial exemption. But Professor Lawrence Summers of Harvard has a better way to limit the cost: exempt only dividends on new issues of stock.
Repeal Section 89. Pressure from small business forced the committee to gut Section 89 of the tax code. This law says that if a company offers tax-free health plans to well-paid employees, it must offer comparable plans to lower-paid workers. Section 89 is notoriously complex and unworkable, and eviscerating it would be a blessing - but only if Congress then aims at the right target: setting a limit on how lavish any health plan can be and still be tax-exempt.
The Ways and Means Committee acted recklessly yesterday. That puts heavy responsibility on the House leadership to defeat the bill on the floor. If that fails, then the Senate becomes the last line of defense against a shameless effort to reward the rich and pervert the tax code.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Sssh! And Scram! A Library Fights The Homeless

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J.

 BODY:
At the front desk of the public library, there is a spiral notebook for patrons to jot down comments. Usually, people write to complain about things like dim reading lights or not enough books on rock climbing.
Over the last several months, though, a different kind of concern has crept into the book. Most are unsigned. Here are a few: ''Please do not allow bums to sit here all day long.'' 
''This is not a bus terminal or a homeless shelter or a sanitarium.''
''These bums sitting near the books make me nervous.''
''I'm going around Robin Hood's bend trying to avoid with displeasure these smelly people who don't even pay taxes.''
In this prosperous suburb 35 miles west of New York City, the growing ranks of homeless people have stepped into the public eye from their unseen shelters in wooded areas, abandoned cars and shopping-mall parking lots. And a lot of people do not like what they see. ''It's brought out a lot of emotions that haven't been vented,'' said Eunice Jadlocki, director of a soup kitchen in St. Peter's Episcopal Church, across the street from the library.
About 20 homeless men and women usually wait in the library until the soup kitchen opens for lunch at noon. Many sit quietly and read.
Even so, some librarygoers complain, they sometimes stare at people or just smell awful. ''The haves don't want to look at the have-nots,'' said Richard Kreimer, a 40-year-old homeless man who grew up in this town of 17,000 people. Mr. Kreimer has been ordered to leave the library on several occasions because of his body odor and disheveled appearance.
Dressing well is not an immediate concern of the homeless, said Anne Hartman, a real-estate agent who is past president of the soup kitchen board. Most worry more about their next meal and a place to sleep than a bath or change of clothes.
''It's a very hard problem,'' the library director, Barbara Rice, said. ''We want to serve everyone in the community. But we're not social workers.''
This year the library banned ''unnecessary staring'' and required patrons to have dress and personal hygiene that conformed to the ''standard of the community for public places.''
The American Civil Liberties Union in Newark, fearing the regulations might discriminate against homeless people, intervened on Mr. Kreimer's behalf.
In July, the library modified its policy, prohibiting staring with the ''intent to annoy'' another person and offensive hygiene when it was a ''nuisance.''
''Morristown is a quiet middle-class community that, until recently, has been insulated from the problems of homelessness,'' said Elizabeth J. Miller, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U. in Newark who is representing Mr. Kreimer.
Add Morristown to the list of hundreds of other suburban towns and villages in the New York metropolitan region struggling to deal with homelessness and its causes - alcoholism, mental illness, soaring housing prices.
In this town, the library offers the most public glimpse of the community's ambivalance in addressing the problem. It is a problem that is growing worse.
The soup kitchen at St. Peter's served 17,100 meals last year, compared to 11,166 in 1986. Two years ago, the Morris Shelter moved, to a 45-bed site from a 14-bed site, to meet the demand from homeless men and women and their families across the county.
About 30 percent of the people at the shelter have jobs, but cannot afford to rent, at $700 a month and up, or buy, $200,000 and up, a place to live.
Many are the sons and daughters of county residents caught in a housing squeeze caused in part by economic growth. Lawyers and doctors' offices occupy many older houses. ''Homeless people don't have a chance,'' said Deborah Smith, 32, a mother of three who grew up in nearby Dover and stayed at the Morris Shelter for five months recently, until she found a house she could afford to rent.
Morristown, as the county seat and most urban place in Morris, also attracts a large number of troubled people.
Besides the soup kitchen and shelter, there are a state mental hospital, a county jail, drug-rehabilitation centers and a shelter for teen-age girls.
''We're torn,'' Mayor David V. Manahan said, ''between being a good neighbor and being taken advantage of.''

Dr. Fabricant was a professor emeritus of economics at New York University, where he had taught since 1946. He was also director emeritus of the National Bureau of Economics Research, where he was associated with Dr. Arthur F. Burns, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's chief economic adviser. 
Dr. Fabricant did extensive research on productivity and economic growth and was considered the foremost authority on what constitutes a recession. He was also a prolific writer on topics like productivity, economic principles, economic growth, war and defense economics and income and philanthropy.
''He was a great research leader during his entire career,'' said Dr. Geoffry Moore, director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. ''He helped guide the research activities of several generations of economists.''
 
Joined University in 1946
Dr. Fabricant was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 15, 1906.

HEADLINE: Arts Endowment Official to Run Met Opera

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Opera announced yesterday that Hugh Southern, the acting chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts and the man who brought the half-priced TKTS booth to Duffy Square, would become its new general manager.
Mr. Southern, a 57-year-old British citizen who has been a United States resident since 1956, will succeed Bruce Crawford, who resigned in November to become chairman of the Omnicom Group, an advertising agency. Mr. Crawford remained at the Met until April 1; Mr. Southern will assume the position on Nov. 1.
His appointment as the Met's chief administrative officer will not directly affect the responsibilities and prerogatives of James Levine, who remains the company's artistic director but who will naturally work closely with Mr. Southern in shaping Met policy.
The new general manager's background is in arts administration with an emphasis on theater and audience development, rather than on artistic creation or decision-making. He was a management associate of the San Francisco Opera in the mid-1960's and was acting manager of its touring Western Opera Theater. 
 
Role in New York City
But he is best known for his role at the National Endowment, where he has overseen that agency's programs as its No. 2 executive since 1982. For 14 years before that Mr. Southern was the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, a New York organization originally intended to encourage the production of quality plays on Broadway and off. Its most visible function, however, is its program, at the TKTS booths and through other means, of providing reduced-priced tickets to theatrical and dance events. On Broadway alone, the fund's ticket sales now account for 12 percent of revenues and 18 percent of attendance.
Mr. Southern was selected for the Met job after a 10-month search. Mrs. Gilbert W. Humphrey, president and chief executive officer of the Met and head of the search committee, said 420 candidates were considered.
''I am thrilled about the appointment,'' Mrs. Humphrey said yesterday. ''Of all the candidates, Hugh Southern was the one who everybody said was the most diplomatic and good with people.''
Asked about Mr. Southern's relative lack of operatic qualifications, Mrs. Humphrey said: ''That did concern us. But with all the candidates, we put down the pluses and the minuses in columns, and we felt that his attributes outweighed his liabilities - his administrative experience, his way of getting along with people, his relation with the board and his ability to help with fund-raising.''
 
'My Primary Qualification'
She added, ''He's had to use his diplomacy with all this 'gafuffel' with Senator Helms.'' Mr. Southern has been had a calming role in conferences with members of the Senate and House during the recent debate over Senator Jesse Helms's effort to restrict Federal money for art deemed ''obscene or indecent.''
Mr. Southern agreed. ''I don't think my primary qualification for the position is a knowledge of opera,'' he said. ''But I do bring a sensitivity to artistic matters and certain managerial skills.'' He added that he had been ''an enthusiastic amateur member of the opera audience for a long time,'' and had been active in the deliberations of the opera-musical theater program of the endowment.
A key consideration in the search was finding a candidate with ample arts-administration experience who would nonetheless work well with Mr. Levine. It was felt that the conductor's role in defining artistic policy would compensate for Mr. Southern's operatic inexperience.
''I've had only one meeting with him, so it would be premature to try to spell out our responsibilities,'' Mr. Levine said yesterday, in between rehearsals for Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess'' and Puccini's ''Trittico.'' ''But when I met the man, I felt confident I could work with him.''
Mr. Levine added that he was consulted throughout the search process by the board committee. #2 Special Interests Mr. Southern reported a cordial first impression of Mr. Levine: ''We've met and we've talked, and I'd say there are very good omens for a collaborative, constructive relationship.'' He said he had not met with Joseph Volpe and Marilyn Shapiro, the Met's two assistant general managers, but would next week.
While Mr. Southern said it was premature to discuss his long-range plans for the Met, he has long been interested in theatrical innovation and - through his work with the Theater Development Fund - the opening of fine arts to wider audiences.
Yesterday he said he considered it his mandate to insure that ''this remarkable, unique institution will continue to make the kind of cultural contribution it has throughout its history.''
''But,'' he added, ''I do think it important that the Met use its prestige and position to exert and express leadership in the operatic world.''
He said he was a strong supporter of an innovative ancillary company, or ''mini-Met'' (the Met is planning three seasons of venturesome fare at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater starting in 1991). But he doubtd the economic feasibility of new opera in as large and expensive a theater as the 4,000-seat Metropolitan Opera House.
 
A Trend at the Met
The appointment of Mr. Southern continues a trend in the selection of recent Met general managers away from the professional opera administrator typified by Sir Rudolf Bing and toward people with close connections to the board and to sources of money.
Mr. Southern's immediate predecessors, Mr. Crawford and Anthony A. Bliss, both came from the inner circles of the board. Thus as general managers, they were a direct link to the board of what has long been the performing arts institution with the largest budget in the United States. The Met's projected budget this season is between $90 million and $100 million.
By picking a general manager with strong ties to public arts support -Mr. Southern also had two temporary jobs with the New York State Council on the Arts in the 1970's and was on the Mayor's Committee for Cultural Policy for New York - the Met board has continued its new policy of tapping people with strong managerial and fund-raising connections.
Mr. Crawford is expected to continue to have a leading role at the Met. He remains a member of the board's executive committee and chairman of its finance committee. And his belated joining of the search committee early ths summer appears to have galvanized its energies.
Mr. Southern was born in 1932 in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, and graduated from Cambridge University, where he directed plays. His mother was stage manager of London's Lyric Theater Hammersmith in the 1920's. He is married to Kathy L. Dwyer, deputy executive director for programs and policy at the American Association of Museums in Washington.
In assuming his post at the Met, Mr. Southern will receive a considerable raise. His salary at the endowment is $78,500. While the Met has declined to reveal its executive salaries, it has not denied reports that Mr. Crawford's salary was close to $300,000.

HEADLINE: G.M. Idles Plant in Atlanta And Stirs U.A.W.'s Anger

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it was idling its Lakewood assembly plant in Atlanta, prompting an angry charge of hypocrisy by the United Automobile Workers' new executive in charge of relations with G.M.
The No. 1 auto maker, which has been saddled with too much plant capacity throughout the 1980's for the number of vehicles it has been selling, said it did not have a vehicle program to replace the current production at Lakewood of Chevrolet Caprices and Buick Estate Wagons, which will cease in March.
G.M. said 2,200 salaried and hourly workers are currently employed at the plant, although about 1,000 already are on temporary layoff.
A Buick spokesman, meanwhile, declined to comment on the future of the Estate Wagon. The Chevrolet Caprice is also built in G.M.'s assembly plant in Arlington, Tex., but both vehicles might be built at Arlington as part of a new generation of rear-wheel-drive full-size cars. 
The union's angry blast came from Stephen P. Yokich, U.A.W. vice president, who assumed his current post two months ago. His anger was an indication of a worsening climate of labor relations between the company and the union. Moreover, Mr. Yokich said some ''cooperative programs'' between G.M. managers and hourly workers were not working well.
 
Cooperative Programs
Mr. Yokich replaced Donald Ephlin, who was an outspoken proponent of the auto maker's cooperative programs, which sought to formalize worker involvement in management issues like quality and productivity improvements. Mr. Ephlin's criticism of recent G.M. plant closings had been somewhat muted; many G.M. managers and executives have been saying they are anxious to find out if Mr. Yokich is as enthusiastic about cooperative programs as Mr. Ephlin was.
''We are tired of the hypocrisy of congratulating workers for a job well done and rewarding them with layoffs,'' Mr. Yokich said in a statement, noting that the G.M. announcement had praised Lakewood workers for 60 years of ''building fine products.''
Technically, the Lakewood plant could be reopened at some future date if General Motors decided to locate a vehicle program there, a company spokesman said. But Lakewood is the fourth G.M. assembly plant to be idled since ratification of the 1987 labor agreement with the U.A.W. that barred permanent plant shutdowns. The other idled plants are in Leeds, Mo.; Pontiac, Mich., and Framingham, Mass., and G.M. unofficially acknowledges it is unlikely they all will reopen.
Under the terms of the 1987 agreement, G.M. was permitted to idle plants if it was forced to do so by falling sales. But Mr. Yokich said, ''G.M. management is not trying nearly hard enough to fulfill its obligations under the national agreement and to source offshore production back into domestic plants if necessary to maintain employment here.''
 
'Short-Sighted Decisions'
Mr. Yokich also said G.M. senior management ''continues to make short-sighted decisions that shatter morale and suggest that the near-term bottom line is still what matters most'' at G.M. headquarters.
''There's still time for G.M. to demonstrate that it truly wants a new relationship with the union and union workers,'' he added, ''but episodes like this aren't helping at all.''
G.M. said both hourly and salaried workers would be eligible for a variety of unemployment benefits, but a U.A.W. spokesman said some of the benefit programs do not have much money left in them because of the number of layoffs at G.M. in the last two years.

HEADLINE: 'Junk' Market Nervous As Selling Continues

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
In an attempt to ease the fear and uncertainty that has gripped the ''junk bond'' market in recent days, Goldman, Sachs & Company yesterday told its institutional customers that the investment firm stood ready to provide trading liquidity and buy junk bonds ''across the board.''
The statement was similar to one it made on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after the stock market crash.
Nevertheless, prices for the high-risk, high-yield bonds drifted lower during the day, market participants said. An official of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said the average issue declined $15 per $1,000 of face value. 
Traders said the unsettled conditions could last for several weeks or even months. More than $10 billion in new issues are slated to be sold in the coming months, officials at First Boston said. But at the same time traders and portfolio managers are bracing for more forced selling by savings and loan associations, mutual funds and Wall Street firms that have accumulated large inventories of junk bonds and want to limit their losses.
''It's pretty ugly out there,'' said Zane E. Brown, executive vice president of Equitable Capital Management, a subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, which has $1.9 billion invested in junk bonds. ''I'm not sure it's prudent to spend your cash today.''
During the day, the RJR Holdings issue lost $12.50 per $1,000 valuation while Macy's bonds declined $7.50, dealers said.
Late yesterday afternoon, however, investors bought $300 million of notes offered by the Johnson Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Portfolio managers said the issue was picked up because the company has unusually strong cash flow even though it carries a junk bond rating. [D12.] Many professional and individual investors appeared to agree with Mr. Brown's assessment of the junk bond market. Yesterday, Fidelity Investments in Boston reported it had received almost 1,000 telephone calls from nervous holders of its $1.8 billion High Income Mutual Fund. Investors switched more than $16 million out of the fund, almost triple the average daily amount of money that moves into or out of the fund, said Neal Litvack, vice president of marketing for the mutual fund company.
 
A Structural Shift
While many traders and analysts acknowledge that the supply-and-demand characteristics of the junk market are undergoing a significant structural shift - the supply of new bonds from companies like the Bibb Company and Petrolane Inc. is increasing while demand for bonds from regular buyers is contracting -few are willing to say that this is the end of the junk market.
''I think the junk market is a legitimate part of capital markets,'' said Michael F. Holland, president of Salomon Brothers Asset Management. ''But it will be less of a factor in financing takeovers.''
Some analysts say stock prices -which have often risen on takeover speculation - could be hurt by the weakness in the junk bond market. As a result of this fear, stocks of rumored takeover targets like Woolworth and Armstrong World Industries fell sharply yesterday.
''The hot-money takeover game is over,'' said Michael Metz, an investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. ''The whole network is being disassembled.'' He said that takeovers would continue but that acquirers would use cash or stock instead of junk bonds to finance deals.
If merger and acquisition activity declined, the implications could be serious for many Wall Street brokerage firms. Almost one-third of their profits in recent years have come from acquisition-related fees, said Michael L. Goldstein, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York.
 
'Tip of the Iceberg'
Moreover, the weakness in the junk market could hurt the Wall Street firms' trading desks. The firms that make secondary markets in junk bonds typically hold approximately $200 million of bonds as inventory, Mr. Goldstein estimated. Those bonds have been falling in value almost all year, he said, so several firms could have large trading losses. ''We might be at the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch & Company denied that it had suffered large trading losses in junk bonds.
Even though Wall Street firms have abandoned certain markets in recent years, Mr. Goldstein said he would be surprised if any of these firms decided to halt their junk bond operations. The practice is too closely connected to the profitable merger and acquisitions business.
Despite recent defaults on junk bonds, Michael Milken, the former Drexel executive who is credited with developing the junk market, said yesterday that there was still ''tremendous opportunity'' for high-yield securities. The Associated Press reported that Mr. Milken, speaking to an investment group in New York, urged investors and traders to evaluate securities on a company-by-company basis, because not all companies in a given industry would fare badly in a recession.
 
More Difficulties Are Seen
Still, several professional investors said the junk bond market was likely to experience more difficulties as large investors try to sell their holdings and other highly leveraged companies find themselves unable to make their debt payments. They said large investors like savings and loans and mutual funds could drive down prices of actively traded issues like RJR Holdings, Duracell, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and Safeway if they needed to raise cash quickly.
''I'm worried about the junk market,'' said Peter Nadosy, a managing director of Morgan Stanley & Company and portfolio manager in its investment management division. ''I think it's cracking up.''
Mr. Nadosy and others noted that the problems encountered by companies like Campeau, Seaman Furniture and Resorts International were being reported during good economic times.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
How Has Bush Done So Far?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Bush Administration this month released a report on its ''initiatives and accomplishments.'' So far, how does its record stack up?
The economic expansion is still rolling, but at a slower pace. The recovery that began under President Reagan, after the deep 1981-82 recession, is now in its 82d month. The Bush Administration intends to keep the expansion going indefinitely; it has warned the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates, lest tight money produce a recession. 
The White House says consumer price inflation has ''remained under 5 percent for the past seven years.'' But the inflation rate has oscillated. After averaging 3.8 percent from 1982 through 1985, it fell to 1.1 percent in 1986, and then rose to 4.4 percent in 1987 and 1988. The Consumer Price Index rose at a 6.4 percent rate in the first half of 1989, but most economists expect it to average just a little above 5 percent for the entire year as economic growth slows.
The President's budget strategy is to approach balance gradually by restraining spending growth and not raising taxes. Mr. Bush is determined to cut the capital gains tax to stimulate savings and investment. Yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a cut despite strong Democratic opposition.
Mr. Bush's white paper hails the April 14 agreement with Congress to meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit target of $100 billion for the fiscal year 1990, ''with no new taxes.''
The 1989 budget year will wind up with a $161 billion deficit, $25 billion beyond the $136 billion target, according to estimates of the Congressional Budget Office. That office forecasts that the ''baseline'' budget deficit, if present policies continue, will be $141 billion in 1990, well above the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman target. And it projects a budget deficit higher than $140 billion every year through 1993, even without ''off-budget'' measures.
The Administration has shallow pockets, and looks for others to spend or lend money for programs it wants. The President's ''strong support'' for Poland and Hungary, as they move toward ''pluralism, democracy and market economic policies,'' calls for $115 million for Poland and $25 million for Hungary. His war on drugs seeks an extra $176 million, to bring 1990 up to $7.9 billion; his goal is to halve the supply of illegal drugs in 10 years.
On Aug. 9 Mr. Bush signed the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, to rescue the failed or failing savings and loans; it is expected to cost taxpayers at least $100 billion, and possibly double or triple that amount. The White House says ''the President's plan'' calls for ''tough standards to help insure such a crisis never happens again.''
L. William Seidman, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who is gearing up for a $300 billion auction of ailing savings institutions, said, ''My guess is that between 30 and 50 percent of the failures are directly due to fraud, insider abuse, or just plain mismanagement - but these factors probably contributed to the demise of over 75 percent of the failed institutions.''
Other financial debacles may lie ahead. The Federal Housing Administration insurance fund, which covers $277 billion worth of mortgages, has only $1.2 billion in reserves. The F.H.A. is losing well over $1 million a day - it lost more than $450 million in 1988 - and its next audit is expected to show greater losses this year.
Legislation before the House and Senate to lower the down payment home buyers must pay to qualify for F.H.A. insurance and raise the maximum size of an F.H.A.-insured loan would exacerbate risks of another financial disaster.
With feeble resistance from the Bush Administration, the dollar has risen more than 20 percent against foreign currencies since the start of the year; this may worsen the trade deficit.
The Bush Administration is already very hard up when it comes to making loans or grants overseas. Under the so-called Brady plan, it has ''taken the lead in encouraging commercial banks to reduce the debt and debt service burdens of developing countries,'' and urged the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to do the same.
Agreement has been reached between Mexico and the commercial banks, proving, the White House says, that the Brady plan is ''viable.'' But tougher cases lie ahead in Brazil, Argentina, Peru and other developing countries.
The President has vetoed what he considered an excessive increase in the minimum wage by Congress. He has initiated a program to phase out steel import quotas over two and a half years, announced additional deficiency payments of 10 percent to producers of wheat, feed grains, rice and upland cotton, and directed the Secretary of Energy to develop a ''comprehensive energy strategy for the nation.''
No slogan has yet been attached to the overall Bush program. Its new paper on accomplishments carries Mr. Bush's ''kinder, gentler America'' over from the campaign, but a White House spokesman cautioned, in an interview, that this phrase applies only to domestic affairs like child care and aid to the homeless, not to military and foreign policy.

HEADLINE: Mosbacher in Japan: Little Progress Seen

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, ending a three-day trip to Japan today, made little apparent progress on trade questions. He left many Japanese and Americans here wondering about the Bush Administration's goals.
During his visit, Mr. Mosbacher met with Japan's new Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, as well as a number of Cabinet ministers and business leaders who were taking the measure of the Commerce Secretary for the first time.
In this visit, largely ceremonial, Mr. Mosbacher struck two themes: the need for agreements that will start a flow of Japanese technology to the United States, and the need for structural change in the Japanese economy to reduce prices and spur consumer demand for imports. 
 
One Agreement
Mr. Mosbacher did reach one agreement, to extend a cooperative research pact between the United States and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation in semiconductors, telecommunications, computers and computer networking and time and frequency measurements. The accord, first signed in 1984, was only slightly enlarged.
But Mr. Mosbacher got off to a bad start when, while visiting South Korea, he declared that the Korean market was more open than Japan's. Few foreigners in the business community agree with that view because of Korea's outright ban on many types of imports.
In Tokyo, where many American business executives waited to hear about specific goals and more sophisticated strategies to open Japan's markets, Mr. Mosbacher said little about either, at least in public.
 
Carrot and Stick
Instead, he said the United States would ''balance the carrot and the stick'' and declared himself a ''bottom line kind of guy'' who left the ''esoterics'' of curing America's $50 billion-a-year deficit to others.
''I feel like we are back eight years to the start of the Reagan Administration,'' said the top official of a major American corporation's Japan subsidiary after Mr. Mosbacher gave an off-the-record speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. ''We keep changing teams and bringing them up to speed, and the Japanese keep the veterans around. Another executive, from a major computer concern involved in disputes with Japan, said after the speech, ''We were waiting for a real plan of action, and it never came.''
Meanwhile, Mr. Mosbacher and his staff appeared to be backpedaling on American plans to rush into high-definition television research. Although he originally supported a major initiative, Mr. Mosbacher said here this week that while ''HDTV is important, you can't look at it in a void,'' and added that its role in other technologies, from digital switching to fiber optics, needed study. He said the United States had time because ''HDTV won't be used until the U.S. market is ready to accept it.''
Japan seems to take the opposite view. It has already spent $900 million or more in research and has begun experimental broadcasts of HDTV signals for an hour or so a day. Japan hopes to begin regular broadcasts in a few years, and today NHK, Japan's Government network, said it had licensed Texas Instruments to make semiconductors for HDTV receivers, mostly in Japan.
 
Disagrees With Verity
Mr. Mosbacher said little about some recurring irritants in trade relations. But he expressed clear disagreement with his predecessor, C. William Verity Jr., who said on a visit to Japan last fall that American construction companies were not putting enough effort or money into cracking the Japanese market. ''We don't agree with Verity's perception,'' Mr. Mosbacher said, complaining that American companies have still landed few contracts.
Mr. Mosbacher also became entangled in one of Japan's thorniest debates: whether the high prices here give American companies a chance to compete.
''The cost of doing business in Japan does ultimately constitute a trade barrier,'' Mr. Mosbacher said.
Sounding a theme from the newly started ''structural initiative'' talks to eliminate fundamental trade barriers, Mr. Mosbacher pressed Japan to allow ''Japanese consumers to enjoy the same freedom of choice and benefits'' as American consumers do. He complained that Japan paid $600 million more than it should have for domestically made satellites, and that it costs three times as much to buy a Sanyo cordless telephone in Tokyo as it does in New York.
But Mr. Mosbacher said he was ''optimistic'' about the outcome of the current dialogue with Japan on the removal of structural impediments to trade. ''My idea of measurable progress,'' he said, ''is something I can show to Congress.''

HEADLINE: Bank Profits at Record High

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Commercial banks reported their most profitable six months ever in the first half of the year, the Government said Wednesday.
Although profits of $7 billion in the second quarter at 12,944 commercial banks were down from the record $7.3 billion earned in the first quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that the $14.3 billion total in the first half was more than in any previous six-month period. 
''I think the industry has a chance to beat last year's all-time record earnings,'' the F.D.I.C. chairman, L. William Seidman, said at a briefing. Banks posted profits of $25.1 billion in 1988. But he said the year's earnings figures could be affected adversely by troubles involving third world debtor nations, real estate loans or the direction of the economy.
Second-quarter 1989 profits rose in 39 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and declined in 11 states, John J. Quinn 3d, senior banking analyst for the F.D.I.C., said.
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island all reported declines in earnings in the second quarter, and the Northeast was the only region to show a year-to-year increase in the proportion of banks losing money, the F.D.I.C. report said.

HEADLINE: A Milestone for Labor But No Silver Lining

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The pending takeover of the UAL Corporation by a group including its pilots' union and its management is a coup for the labor movement. But experts on employee-owned companies say that difficulties even more trying than winning control of the company may lie ahead.
These experts predicted that conflicts and problems would come not only at the management level, where executives and union leaders would have to work together, but at lower levels, where attempts would be made to motivate workers to improve productivity and involve them more in running the company.
But the experts also said that employees who own a company could look at problems more as management does. 
 
Machinists' Position
Another big challenge for the management and pilots of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, would be how to handle the 20,000-plus members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the airline, who have so far refused to participate in the buyout.
Louis R. Schroeder, the president of District 141 of the machinists' union, had urged the UAL board to reject the pilot-management offer because it ''jeopardizes the livelihoods of the work force and the long-term viability of the carrier.''
If the buyout is approved by shareholders and regulators, the employees at United who participate in the deal would end up owning 75 percent of the company. To translate that sense of ownership into higher productivity has often proved to be a painstaking task that leads to only small results, said Peter Cappelli, an expert on labor relations in the airline industry.
 
Risks Seen for Unions
Mr. Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, also warned that there were risks for the unions, whose role would be redefined.
''They can't continue to act as adversaries of management as in the past,'' he added. ''The long-range question for the union is: why would its members want to continue to have it around?''
Under the contract to which the pilots agreed as part of the $6.75 billion takeover deal, the union, the Air Line Pilots Association, has agreed to huge changes in its relationship with management.
That management would be made up mostly of UAL executives like Stephen M. Wolf, the current chairman, who would be president, and John C. Pope, who would remain the chief financial officer.
 
No Strike for 7 Years
The pilots have promised to give up their ultimate weapon, the strike, for the duration of a seven-year contract, whose length is itself unusual in American industry. The 6,100 pilots at United would also be committed to resolve disputes with the company through binding arbitration.
Layoffs would also be on hold for seven years. So if a recession were to hurt the industry, United might find it difficult to cut back to ride out hard times. On the other hand, the pilots have agreed to a 10 percent cut in pay and cuts in other benefits.
Some analysts said it would make little sense for the pilots to strike because they would in effect be striking against themselves.
The pilots have also promised to cross the lines of other unions, including the machinists, who could continue to play their historical adversarial role.
 
Seemingly Strange Position
The pilots' and the machinists' unions have been rivals, having fought bitterly in the courts for the three years it took the pilots to get to the stage of board approval of the deal. The machinists' leaders have said that the added debt would weaken the airline and that its members had no interest in becoming owners.
Thus the new company could find itself in the strange position of having the pilots, and possibly even the flight attendants as well, becoming owners, while the machinists could end up even more alienated.
To persuade UAL's independent directors to support the bid and to assure that management would not be just a creature of the unions, the pilots' union agreed to a 15-member board on which eight members, a majority, would be independent.
These members are expected to be business people and professors and may also be drawn from government.
The pilots would be able to elect at least one of their leaders to the board - expected to be F. C. (Rick) Dubinsky, the chairman of the Master Executive Council, the governing body of the Air Line Pilots Association at United.
Joseph Blasi, whose specialty has been labor relations at employee-owned companies, said that only when ownership is combined with committees made up of workers and management can productivity be increased.
''It will be hard, but Stephen Wolf must come forward with detailed plans to radically increase employee involvement,'' he said.
Mr. Blasi, a professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers who has acted as a consultant for the pilots' union, said the union and Mr. Wolf had already run into differences on how labor-management committees would function at United.
Setting up the structure for joint cooperation has also often proved simpler than persuading workers and middle managers to participate.
 
The Experience of Avis
Joseph V. Vittoria, chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc., which has been owned by its employees under an employee stock ownership plan for two years, said that one of the most exhausting parts of his job has been to travel to the widely scattered stations of Avis and explain to employees how they can participate in managing the company.
Mr. Vittoria has attended hundreds of meetings with small groups of employees and said he has had many instances of success. He recalled that one shop steward, an 18-year union employee, went back to his work area and began to tell workers that certain slack practices would no longer be tolerated.
Mr. Vittoria said the shop steward told them, ''Either get up to speed or you're gone.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Major 'Junk Bond' Sells Quickly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The high-yield ''junk bond'' market, reeling from financial problems at a broad range of companies, got something of a boost late yesterday, when Salomon Brothers successfully priced a $300 million issue for a major Coca-Cola bottler.
The issue from the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc. in Tennessee was so strongly in demand that underwriters had firm commitments for the $300 million before it was priced.
''It just shows that deals for high-quality names can still get done,'' one investment banker close to the transaction said.
That view was reiterated by portfolio managers, who said that despite the deterioration in the financial health of other junk bond-issuing companies like the Southland Corporation, Lomas & Nettleton and retailers like Federated Stores and Allied Stores, a large part of the market remained healthy. 
 
Demand for High-Quality Names
''There is still a lot of demand for high-quality names because they are selling at yield spreads of between 4 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points above 10-year Treasuries,'' said Mark Vaselkiv, a vice president at the $1.15 billion T. Rowe Price High-Yield Fund. ''We haven't begun to see any deterioration in credit quality or cash flow in these types of issues.''
Still, prices of secondary high-yield issues continued to slide yesterday, if not so sharply as on Wednesday.
By late in the day, prices of most high-yield issues were down by about 1/2 point. And while a degree of calm returned to a market jolted on Wednesday by the severity of the problems confronting the Campeau Corporation, the parent of Federated and Allied, deep concerns remain.
''It may be foolhardy to dismiss the possibility of more Campeau-like incidents, even if the economy averts recession and instead enjoys a disinflationary soft landing,'' said John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service.
''But until the still considerable threat of recession has passed, the performance of high-yield bonds may be hindered by one of the most crippling forms of uncertainty - fear of the unknown.''
 
Retail Sales Report Cheered
A report suggesting the economy may indeed have moved to a slower, less-inflationary rate of growth cheered participants in the market for Treasury securities, where prices of notes and bonds rose.
A burst of buying in the Treasury markets followed the release of retail sales figures for August that were being interpreted as showing some signs of weakness.
Over all, the sales figures, aided by robust auto purchases, rose by seven-tenths of a percentage point. But the gains once those sales were factored out were a much more modest two-tenths of a percentage point. And gains recorded for July were revised downward.
The figures prompted buying that was later tempered by the Federal Reserve Board, which drained reserves from the banking system around midday. The sales of Government securities by the Fed came as the open-market rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market was trading at 8 7/8 percent.
 
Long-Term Bond at 8.11%
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 100 3/32, up 7/32, to yield 8.11 percent. The 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 27/32, up 7/32, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 8 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.05 percent.
Treasury bill rates were mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.56 percent late yesterday, up seven basis points, or hundredths of a point. Meanwhile, six-month bill rates were unchanged, at a late offered rate of 7.55 percent.
The Johnston Coca-Cola high-yield deal priced late yesterday was a two-part offering consisting of $100 million worth of senior notes and $200 million of subordinated debentures.
The 10 1/4 percent senior notes were priced at par, or $100, and mature Sept. 15, 1999. The 11 3/8 percent subordinated notes were also priced at par, and mature Sept. 15, 2001. The senior notes are rated Ba-2 by Moody's and BBB- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The subordinated notes carry a B-1 rating from Moody's and a BB+ rating from S.&P.
Elsewhere, activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate issues was volatile again yesterday, as prices moved erratically in response to developments in the high-yield and Treasury markets. By late in the day, dealers said that prices of long-term and intermediate securities had moved higher by about 1/8 point. In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices dipped by 1/8 point to 1/4 point, according to participants.
Among the new tax-exempt issues priced yesterday was a $200 million issue from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The issue, which was sold at competitive bid, consisted of two parts. A group led by Paine Webber bought $100 million of the bonds, which are not subject to provisions of the alternative minimum tax. This part of the issue consisted of serial bonds with maturities from 2004 to 2010, and a term bond that matures in 2024.
The serial bonds carry coupons ranging from 7 percent in 2004 to 7.15 percent in 2010. The term bonds were priced to yield 7.25 percent.
A group led by Prudential-Bache Securities bought the second $100 million part, which is subject to alternative minimum tax provisions.
The serial bonds in this part also carry maturities from 2004 to 2010. The issue also includes a term bond maturing in 2024. Coupons on the serial bonds range from 7.25 percent in 2004 to 7.40 percent in 2010. The term bonds carry a coupon of 7.25 percent.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Spot Contracts for Copper Surge to a 4 1/2-Month Peak

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper for spot delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange surged to a four-and-a-half-month high yesterday as the market ignored news of a settlement of a miners' strike in Chile and focused on continuing supply disruptions in other parts of the world.
Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 4.9 cents higher, with the spot contract for delivery in September at $1.373 a pound, the highest settlement for a spot copper contract on the Comex since April 28.
The settlement of a two-week-old strike at the Chilean Copper Company's El Salvador mine had been expected and caused little market reaction. The mine, which produces about 100,000 tons of copper annually, is the smallest of six major copper mines worldwide that have suffered recent supply disruptions, and at least three of those remain shut down. 
Others still shut are the Bouganville mine in Papua New Guinea, closed since mid-July by terrorism; Mexico's Cananea mine, which went bankrupt on Aug. 20, and a mine owned by the Highland Valley Copper Company in British Columbia that has been shut down by a strike since July 6.
 
Other Supply Jitters
Weather-related problems at another mine in Papua New Guinea and a recent strike by Zambian copper miners have also contributed to the supply jitters, analysts said.
''There's still about 600,000 tons of capacity shut down and that's a substantial tonnage,'' said Fred Demler, a metals economist in New York with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''I think the market realizes that even if all the problems were resolved today, there would still be tightness in refined supply for several months.''
In Chicago, meat and grain futures were bolstered by the announcement of new food aid from the United States to Poland.
President Bush announced a $50 million increase in the aid and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, proposed a Polish food-aid package that includes 500,000 metric tons of corn, 100,000 metric tons of wheat and 20 million to 30 million pounds of pork.
Energy futures succumbed to a spate of profit taking on the New York Mercantile Exchange. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 15 cents lower, with October at $19.72 a barrel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rebounds in the U.S.; Gold Prices Are Also Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
After closing lower overseas, the dollar rebounded to finish higher in choppy domestic trading yesterday.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $360.50 an ounce, up 60 cents from Wednesday. 
Traders said the Bank of Japan entered the market overnight to sell a large amount of dollars, which pushed the dollar lower overseas. Then dealers in Europe moved to trim their dollar holdings ahead of today's release of United States merchandise trade figures for July.
But dealers at home used the impending Commerce Department report as a reason to buy dollars, pushing the currency higher in a seesaw session.
''We don't want to be stuck short of dollars if it's a good number,'' Michael McDonald, a trader at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said of the trade deficit figure.
Economists are projecting a trade deficit of $7 billion to $9 billion for July. The Government is also scheduled to release the Producer Price Index for August, a figure that can ultimately influence the dollar.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar closed at 146.85 yen, up from 146.40 yen on Wednesday. And 1 cost $1.5540, cheaper than $1.5585 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.9750 West German marks, up from 1.9725; 1.7040 Swiss francs, up from 1.6990; 6.6605 French francs, up from 6.6525; 1,418.50 Italian lire, up from 1,415.00, and 1.1850 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1841.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery slipped to $5.055, from $5.067 Wednesday.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Nominee Says 'Junk Bond' Market Seems Sound

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
President Bush's nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission said today that the market for high-yield ''junk bonds'' still seemed sound despite tremors touched off by the cash binds of some debt-laden issuers, most recently the Campeau Corporation.
Richard C. Breeden, the nominee, told senators at his confirmation hearing today that while junk bonds were subject to liquidity risks - their ready marketability might be in question - they so far posed no special danger.
''I'm not suggesting that there is any particular problem in the marketplace today,'' said Mr. Breeden, the White House policy assistant and former Wall Street securities lawyer. 
 
Effects of Savings Rescue
Mr. Breeden added that while the savings-industry rescue legislation, of which he was a main architect, would mean much less investment in junk bonds by savings and loan associations, the insurance companies and others have been entering the market and would take up the slack. Over all, Mr. Breeden contended, liquidity in junk bonds is greater now than it was three or four years ago.
The liquidity risk in junk bonds is in addition to the other two significant categories of risk applying to a greater or lesser degree to nearly all bonds - the market risk of a rise in interest rates and the credit risk that the principal might not be repaid.
But Mr. Breeden's views on various other topics remained largely unexplored because the Senate Banking Committee treated him deferentially and did not ask pointed questions. And despite expectations of the staffs of both the committee and the commission, the President's 39-year-old nominee was not questioned at all about his relative inexperience.
 
Vote Is Expected Soon
No discernible opposition appeared, and after the three-hour session the committee's chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr., said the panel would vote soon, presumably to recommend confirmation to the full Senate.
An example of the committee's careful treatment of Mr. Breeden came when Senator Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, asked him whether it was true that the securities markets were close to being shut down by the authorities during the 1987 crash. Mr. Breeden responded that he did not know because he was not ''in the loop.'' Mr. Riegle did not ask how Mr. Breeden would approach this subject as S.E.C. chief.
David S. Ruder, the current chairman, came in for heavy criticism two years ago when word circulated that he had discussed, in general terms, a brief trading halt.
 
Advice Sought on Takeovers
Senator Terry Sanford asked Mr. Breeden whether he would be willing to advise Congress on anti-takeover legislation. But the North Carolina Democrat, who has expressed keen interest in the subject after takeovers of RJR Nabisco and Burlington Industries, did not ask whether Mr. Breeden favored such an idea or opposed it.
When Senator Riegle asked Mr. Breeden whether he considered the economy to be overleveraged, the nominee called this a ''complex'' issue that he did not want to address ''with a hip shot.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased 0.7% in August

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Retail sales rose a moderate seven-tenths of 1 percent in August because of strong automobile sales, but analysts foresee growing sluggishness in the remainder of the year.
The Commerce Department said today that retail sales increased to a seasonally adjusted $144.3 billion in August after a five-tenths of 1 percent gain in July. Sales had remained flat in June after rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in May. 
Analysts said the report was consistent with the ''soft landing'' scenario sought by the Federal Reserve as it moves to keep inflation under control while permitting continued, but slower, economic growth.
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the August figure was ''an indication of continued but slow growth in the current economic expansion, which is now in its 82d month, so it's good news.''
Auto sales, which represent about 20 percent of retail sales, advanced 2.6 percent last month, driven by end-of-model-year sales incentives and the threat of steep price increases for 1990 models. Those sales had risen 1.7 percent in July.
 
'Outlook Is Poor' for Auto Sales
But Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm, said the outlook was poor for automobile sales, which slipped in early September. ''Auto sales have peaked,'' he said. ''October will be way down. So total retail sales will be down.''
Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company, agreed, saying, ''I think we will see a decided weakness in auto spending in the fourth quarter.''
Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up only two-tenths of 1 percent in August.
Sales of durable goods, big-ticket items that are expected to last more than three years, rose 2.4 percent on top of an eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in July. On the other hand, sales of nondurable goods fell four-tenths of 1 percent after rising that amount a month earlier.
Among durable goods. building materials advanced 2.2 percent and furniture and other home furnishing sales gained 1.6 percent, reflecting in part, analysts said, both increased home sales and remodeling.
 
Apparel Sales Up
The only advances in the nondurable goods category were apparel sales, up 1.1 percent in part because of back-to-school clothes shopping, and drugstores, up 1.4 percent.
But general merchandise sales, including department stores, did not benefit as much from the back-to-school spending, analysts said, and fell nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Other declines in the nondurable categories included food stores, down two-tenths of 1 percent; service stations, down 1.5 percent, reflecting falling gasoline prices, and restaurants and bars, down 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Debate Over Drug War Focuses on Financing It

BYLINE: By DAVID ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The debate between the Bush Administration and Congress over drug policy involves not only how much money to spend and where to spend it but also how to raise the money without breaking the budget agreement reached last spring.
These disagreements over money set off another debate on Capitol Hill today between William J. Bennett, the Federal drug policy director, and members of a House Government Operations subcommittee. After more than a week of relatively tame hearings, today's was clearly the most contentious, with members scolding Mr. Bennett and the drug director firing back at them.
''I think this is the phoniest war that I've ever seen launched,'' Representative Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, told Mr. Bennett at one point. 
 
'Petty and Micromanagement'
Moments later, Ms. Boxer opened a line of questioning on how best to finance the drug effort. ''If we're critical,'' she said, ''it's because there are some problem areas here that have to be discussed, and I think if it's healthy dialogue and debate today, maybe we can resolve some of the problems.''
''It hasn't been healthy so far,'' Mr. Bennett shot back. ''It has been petty and micromanagement. I don't appreciate it.''
''In this committee, sir, or do you mean generally?'' interjected the committee chairman, John Conyers of Michigan.
Mr. Bennett said he was referring to the questioning of his chief of staff, John Walters, by Representative Glenn English, Democrat of Oklahoma, about using radar planes over Colombia to detect airborne smugglers.
''I'm sorry you feel that way about it, Mr. Bennett,'' Mr. English said.
While the debate went on, lawmakers in both parties held caucuses to figure out how best to work out financing of a drug plan. There was disagreement on both sides, particularly among Democrats, who offered different ideas about how to raise the money, with some favoring specific cuts in other Government programs, others pushing an across-the-board approach and still others wanting new taxes.
 
What Bush Wants
The President has called his proposal a $7.9 billion plan, but that figure is much higher than the amount that would be spent in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
The budget agreement for fiscal 1990, which set the outline for lowering the budget deficit to $100 billion, contemplated spending $4.1 billion on drug programs. Since then, President Bush has recommended spending an additional $500 million, and the money must come from somewhere.
The President wants to take it from specific Government programs that have strong support in Congress. They include the Economic Development Administration, juvenile justice and state grants for refugee assistance.
Democrats in the Senate, who must carry the brunt of the debate for the party, want to spend $1.2 billion more than the President recommended and propose that the financing come from lowering spending for nearly all Government programs by a fraction of a percentage point. That would mean a larger reduction at the Pentagon than the Administration has been willing to accept.
The issue is complicated by the distinction between budget authority, also called appropriations, and outlays, or spending.
 
Like Buying a Car
Budget authority is the permission granted a Government agency to make commitments to spend money - for salaries, construction of prisons, police equipment or whatever - and the money may be spent over several years.
Outlays are the actual dollars spent in a particular fiscal year for the specific activities.
Stanley E. Collender, a budget specialist at Price Waterhouse, uses the analogy of the purchase of a $10,000 car with a three-year loan. When the contract is signed to purchase the car, it is comparable to budget authority for the full $10,000. But actual outlays are only the down payment and the monthly payments in the first year, significantly less than $10,000.
One of the reasons budget authority for the drug program is much higher than outlays is that funds for prison construction would be spent over several years.
 
Outlays Are What Matters
While budget authority is more important in the long run because it represents the eventual scope of the drug programs, outlays are all that matters in meeting the deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law and the urgent issue Congress and the President must confront now, barely two weeks before the beginning of the fiscal year.
In his budget message last February, Mr. Bush proposed $6.4 billion in budget authority for drugs and $4.1 billion in outlays. The agreement he reached with Congress in April included these outlays.
In his crime proposals in May he sought additional budget authority of $700 million for drug programs, and in his drug control speech last week, he asked for $716 million more. Those two requests would lead to a total of $500 million in new outlays in the next fiscal year that were not included in the budget agreement. The total budget authority would be $7.9 billion.
The House of Representatives has approved appropriations bills considering the funds for drugs sought in the President's February budget request. That leaves it to the Senate to find the money to accommodate the President's requests made since then.
Many Senate Democrats have argued that the President's proposals are not sufficient to meet the country's drug problem. This week, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, suggested $2.2 billion more than the President wants in budget authority. An analyst at the Congressional Budget Office said the additional outlays under the Byrd proposals would be $1.2 billion.
 
Conciliatory Signal
That amount of money could be raised, Mr. Byrd calculated, by a 0.575 percent across-the-board cut in budget authority in most Government programs. Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, objected to the Byrd plan, in part because of the cost to the Pentagon.
But Mr. Darman said he could accept a more modest .225 percent cutback proposed by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina. The Congressional budget analyst said the Hollings plan would raise more than enough to pay for the $500 million in new spending proposed by Mr. Bush but not nearly enough to pay for all Mr. Byrd suggested.
The White House, sending a conciliatory signal to Congressional Democrats, said today it was willing to compromise on the Bush proposal, even if it meant spending more money.
''We have always said from the very beginning that we're willing to be flexible on financing,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman. ''The best way to do that is to sit down and talk about it.''

HEADLINE: Jets Wonder if Absences Make the Players Grow Softer

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Sept. 14

 BODY:
Barely three weeks after the Jets signed three important veterans for a total of $2.5 million this season, the club will face the Cleveland Browns on Sunday with one missing, one returning from an injury and one out of shape.
Beyond this week, though, runs a deeper current. The front office and Coach Joe Walton wonder what effect the players' summerlong absences had on their physical condition, especially after two of them were hurt on the first passes thrown to them.
Walton barely hides his bitterness over the ankle injury that has sidelined Wesley Walker for at least the next six games. And Walton's best player, Al Toon, missed the season opener and is not completely healed from a shoulder injury. And Johnny Hector, who went through only his second workout today, was so out of shape after reporting on Wednesday that he suffered leg cramps. 
''You've got to write about history,'' said Walton, referring to players who had been locked in long contract disputes, then came back and were injured. ''Look what happened to the Giants last year: Banks, Bavaro, Landeta. Look what happened to the tight end on Minnesota this year, Jordan. We must have training camp for some reason.''
 
'Injuries Speak for Themselves'
Steve Gutman, the club president who signed the three Jets in recent days, today stopped barely short of blaming the absences for the injuries. But he is not ruling that factor out. ''Statistically, the injuries speak for themselves,'' Gutman said. ''Look at what happened to the Giants last year. We've had other players in the past come in late and suffer injuries. So far, two have been injured this year.
''I don't think there's any question that we were disappointed that Wesley and Johnny and Al - and Reggie McElroy, as well - took the way they did. All could have used camp. But you stay with the negotiations until they're successful.''
Walker, the deep-threat wide receiver, missed his first pass in the second quarter against the Patriots last Sunday and twisted an ankle.
 
Toon Moving Well
Toon was injured when he went over the middle for a pass in the final exhibition game at Kansas City, muffed it, fell, and hurt his shoulder when the Chiefs' Kevin Ross landed on him. But Toon was able to move well today, enhancing his chances for a return.
''The way Al was hurt could have happened at any time,'' said the Jets' trainer, Bob Reese. ''But there was a feeling among the coaches that if he was in football condition he would have made the catch. If he made the catch, he might not have fallen.''
''I don't want to talk about the injury,'' Toon said. ''It's a controversial issue and I don't want to create controversy.''
Reese conceded that trying to make a correlation between missing training camp and getting injured is ''all anecdotal, even though you wonder about it.''
''We tend to remember the ones who get hurt,'' he said.
He described Walker's injury as happening ''after he missed the ball, and then relaxed.''
''That's when he got hit,'' Reese said. ''But maybe if his timing had been better, he might have caught the ball and then the injury wouldn't have happened. But scientifically, you can't say cause and effect.''
Walker disputed that the catch had a role in his injury.
''There's people who come to camp on time and get a foot caught, too,'' he said. ''It was just weird.''
In any event, Gutman sounded frustrated today at the turn of events.
''I would have to think the players are smart enough to think training camp is essential to their performance and their career and they gain little or no economic advantage by holding out,'' he said. ''In fact, it cost one player a great deal of money.''
Toon signed for about $1.1 million for this year, while Walker agreed to $770,000 and Hector $650,000. But Hector lost about $40,000 for missing the opening game.
Brian Washington was a Jet for a day, then suddenly quit. The club picked the safety up on Wednesday after he was cut by the Browns. A Jets official said Washington told the club, ''I don't want to play football anymore.'' . . . Jeff Lageman, the No. 1 draft choice, is a likely starter at outside right linebacker because of Tim Cofield's groin injury.

HEADLINE: Fear Grows Over Effects of a New Smokable Drug

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The use of smokable methamphetamine, which produces a much longer period of euphoria than crack and is followed by a more disturbing psychological reaction, has reached major proportions here and has begun to appear in several cities on the mainland as well.
Experts on substance abuse fear that use of the drug, called ice, could grow to devastating proportions among many of the nation's addicts, especially if efforts are successful to halt the smuggling of cocaine from abroad. The drug can be made cheaply and easily in this country in the same clandestine laboratories that are now used to make speed, the powdered form of methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant of the nervous system that is a form of amphetamine.
''There is an urgent need to stop the flow of cocaine from overseas, but there are plenty of dangerous drugs that are made in the U.S.A.,'' said Donald Hamilton, a spokesman for William J. Bennett, the Federal drug policy director. ''Experts are warning us that smokable methamphetamine will be the drug plague of the 1990's.'' 
And James N. Hall, the executive director of Up Front Drug Information Center in Miami, a nonprofit research foundation, agreed, saying: ''Drugs from clandestine labs will demand attention because the United States is becoming a big producer of drugs. In the 1990's, most drugs used in America will be made in America.''
At present, most of the smokable crystals of methamphetamine are made in Hong Kong, Korea and the Philippines and smuggled here by Asian drug gangs.
Law-enforcement officials say that ice, which was virtually nonexistent in Hawaii only 18 months ago, has already become its most serious drug-related problem. Arrests in Honolulu for the possession or sale of ice have reached 400 this year, more than double the arrests in connection with cocaine and crack, its smokable derivative.
In addition, the arrests of sellers and users of ice are now being reported by the police in the areas of San Francisco Bay, Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix and in parts of central Florida, though the numbers are not high. Law-enforcement authorities and those working in drug treatment centers say there have been no reports of the use of ice in New York City.
In Honolulu, as in cities on the mainland where crack is epidemic, medical and mental health centers are beginning to show the strain of treating ice users.
 
'They Go Absolutely Crazy'
Alma Y. Takata, the chief of the mental health division of the Hawaii State Department of Health, said Honolulu is averaging six hospital emergency room admissions a night for people being treated for symptoms caused by smoking crystal methamphetamine.
''They go absolutely crazy,'' Mrs. Takata said. ''They are bouncing off the walls. You've never seen anything like it. They're much more belligerent than those on crack.''
She said a survey of the 700 people who appeared for emergency treatment in the last six months showed that 50 percent had been using the drug by itself or in conjunction with another drug like alcohol.
Although ice creates feelings of euphoria followed by severe depression just as crack does, its effects differ significantly.
Instead of the 15-minute high with crack, the high from ice may last as long as 24 hours, and the psychological crash is much worse. In addition to euphoria, crack, which is a stimulant, may produce highly excitable and agitated behavior and severe but short-lived depression. With ice, along with depression, are symptoms of acute psychosis not normally associated with crack that last up to 48 hours. Severe paranoia, hallucinations, delusions and an impaired ability to speak coherently make its addicts temporarily indistinguishable from paranoid schizophrenics.
 
Weight Loss and Insomnia
Like those abusing crack, ice users initially suffer weight loss and insomnia because of the stimulation from the drug. On a physical level, the drug can produce irregular heartbeat, convulsions and cause body temperature to rise as high as 108 degrees, which can bring kidney failure.
Of special concern to those trying to treat users are studies demonstrating that addiction to amphetamines is as severe as addiction to cocaine. Research surveyed by Dr. Louis Harris of the Medical College of Virginia showed that monkeys taught to press a lever to receive an injection of either amphetamines, cocaine or nicotine would press the lever until they died rather than stop to eat or sleep. Heroin and alcohol were found to be less addictive.
Mrs. Takata said her office is planning to ask the State Legislature for money to devise a plan for comprehensive short- and long-term treatment of ice addicts. The obstacle is not in devising a new method of treatment, but in providing an adequate number of treatment spaces in programs already dealing with addictions to other drugs. Thus far, only a small number of treatment programs exist for ice addicts and those are through private groups that contract with the state.
Karl D. Muller is the director of a crisis response team working for the state that responds to calls of people acting bizarrely on the streets of Honolulu. More and more, those people turn out to have been smoking ice, he said.
 
'An Instant Psychosis'
''Every person on ice I have seen has to be in restraints,'' Mr. Muller said. ''We look upon ice as an instant psychosis.''
Most cases are taken to the emergency room at Queen's Medical Center in downtown Honolulu. Dr. Donald C. Fancher, the director of the emergency department, said that users displayed violent or aggressive behavior toward anyone, necessitating more security guards to restrain them. ''They pound on the walls, threaten - they're out of control,'' Dr. Fancher said.
While the acute toxic affects of the drugs normally dissipate in 48 hours, there is evidence to suggest that patients have ''permanent psychological problems if they abused it a lot,'' Dr. Fancher said.
Synthetic stimulants of the central nervous system from the amphetamine group were first synthesized in Japan in 1919 and have since had prescribed medical uses in the treatment for falling asleep at inappropriate moments, or narcolepsy; for hyperactivity in children, and for obesity. The illegally sold methamphetamine form can be made from a wide variety of heated chemical compounds, some of which are easy to obtain.
Dr. Marvin Snyder of the National Institute on Drug Abuse said that smokable methamphetamine ''produces a higher level of the drug in the brain in a shorter period of time'' than speed, which in powdered form is snorted or can be heated into liquid and injected.
The basic apparatus for making ice already exists in small chemical laboratories, many of them on the West Coast, where speed is now illegally made. The highly volatile cooking procedure is simple to set up in abandoned factories, for example, or in buildings in remote rural areas.
Illegal marijuana cultivation and clandestine production of powder methamphetamine make up the bulk of domestic drug production with the manufacture of LSD and PCP playing a much smaller role. But experts say that ice presents a much more frightening alternative.
 
Enormous Profits for Dealers
Speed has long been called the poor man's cocaine because of its price. But the ice dealers have held the price above that of cocaine, thereby creating enormous profits. They have been able to maintain this high price because of the long-lasting effects of the drug and because of the appeal of its newness, officers here say.
Ice is being sold in one-gram sealed plastic bags for about $400. It is also sold in $50 bags of one-tenth of a gram, the amount normally used for a high. Experts say that it only cost a few hundred dollars for the chemicals to produce a pound of nearly pure methamphetamine that can be dissolved in water or acid and cooked to produce large crystals.
The police report that cocaine, from which crack is derived, sells for about $110 a gram here.
Maj. Mike Carvalho of the Honolulu Police Department's narcotics unit said that the arrest this week of a street dealer is typical. The suspect was found to be in possession of 10 grams of ice, $55,000 in cash and a pistol.
The authorities say that abuse of ice at this stage of its evolution cuts across all social, economic racial and ethnic lines, but tends to be concentrated among people in their late teens and early 20's. The experts say that most ice users have not yet fully realized the extent of the suffering that takes place once the euphoria subsides and the experts believe that once the side-effects are known, the drug will lose its cachet.
 
'Nice for the Middle Class'
One Honolulu doctor who has treated many users of the drug said his patients often look like the girl next door.
''It seems clean because you don't have to use a needle or go to a crack house and it's available,'' said the doctor, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''It has the panache of cocaine when it first came out - something nice for the middle class.''
A special group of state, local and Federal authorities has resulted in the prosecution of 21 dealers involved in larger smuggling activities. In one such case, 13 pounds of ice sent from Hong Kong were seized.
Although the drug is normally shipped here from Asia, one recent seizure netted ice that had first been shipped to Portland, Ore., and then brought into Honolulu, in an attempt to avoid customs inspection.
In San Francisco, spokesmen for the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic and the Larkin Street Center report that speed is the drug most used by young people living on the streets in these areas. Both clinics are concerned that ice will take its place.
''We've been hearing about it from kids with a real sense of excitement,'' said Michael Shriver, a substance abuse counsellor at Larkin Street. Young people report that the drug is showing up on the streets and it's believed to come from Los Angeles and is known as L.A. crystal. ''They think it's a drug from heaven because of the long duration of the high. We're really scared about what will happen.''

HEADLINE: U.S. VOICING FEARS THAT GORBACHEV WILL DIVIDE WEST

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
In advance of new high-level Soviet-American talks, top officials of the Bush Administration are expressing concern that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies could lead to the breakup of the Western alliance and the disintegration of the postwar European order.
While in the past Bush Administration officials justified their cautious approach toward Mr. Gorbachev by citing doubts about his sincerity, remarks today by President Bush and on Wednesday by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger put on the record additional reasons that until now had been largely stated in private. The argument is that Mr. Gorbachev's loosening of the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe and the Baltic republics could bring about damaging instability in Europe and delude many Western nations into rushing to Moscow's assistance without regard to NATO's long-term interests.
 
Meetings Due Next Week
The comments by Mr. Bush and his top aides have been driven by the Administration's perceived need to outline its views in advance of meetings next week between Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union and Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. In addition, the Administration is gearing up for calls in Congress for further cuts in the military budget and a new Soviet public relations offensive at the United Nations General Assembly, which also opens next week. 
There has been some ambiguity in the Administration's position. It has welcomed the new Soviet openness in dealing with the outside world and the less repressive atmosphere in the Soviet Union. And Washington has also not been unhappy with Moscow's faltering economy and political problems at home, which have reduced Moscow's military threat.
 
Pressure for Concessions
But the Administration has been concerned that sympathy for Mr. Gorbachev could bring about pressure for unneeded concessions from the West, leading to unforeseen problems in Europe and to a more unstable and dangerous situation than the more familiar East-West split that has dominated the political map of Europe in the postwar years.
In a speech Wednesday at Georgetown University that clearly reflected Administration thinking, Mr. Eagleburger said, ''The process of reform in the Soviet bloc and the relaxation of Soviet control over Eastern Europe are bringing long-suppressed ethnic antagonisms and national rivalries to the surface, and putting the German question back on the international agenda.''
Saying the American-Soviet domination of world politics since the end of the World War II had suppressed many of these antagonisms, Mr. Eagleburger added, ''We are now moving into, or I should say back into - for such has been the nature of international affairs since time immemorial - a world in which power and influence is diffused among a multiplicity of states.''
This multipolar world, he said, is not ''necessarily going to be a safer place than the cold war era from which we are emerging, given the existence and indeed proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
''For all its risks and uncertainties, the cold war was characterized by a remarkably stable and predictable set of relations among the great powers,'' he went on. ''A brief look at the history books will tell us that we cannot say as much about the period leading from the birth of the European nation states up through the outbreak of the Second World War.''
 
Destabilization Feared
While not advocating a return to the rigid divisions of the cold war, he said nevertheless that there is ''the danger that change in the East will prove too destabilizing to be sustained.''
In comments to reporters from regional publications, Mr. Bush said today that while he welcomed changes taking place in the Soviet Union, he took the attitude President Truman took. ''I'm like the guy from Missouri - 'show me' - and take your time and do it right,'' he said.
''Europe has had peace for some 40 years now,'' the President said, ''and if you look at your textbooks, why you'll see that that's a long time in an area of the world that has been troubled by conflict, in an area of the world that has involved us in this century in two massive wars.''
Interviews with senior Administration officials indicate that these statements have been prompted by the events in Eastern Europe and the Baltic republics over the summer, as well as Mr. Gorbachev's declarations last week about potential instability in the Soviet Union. The pressure by Soviet nationalities for greater autonomy and the threat of a crackdown from Moscow brought into stark relief for Administration officials the explosiveness of Mr. Gorbachev's program.
The publicly stated concerns coming out of the Administration about those difficulties have been clearly noted in Moscow, and with obvious distress.
 
Cold War 'Inertia' Feared
''Are these statements consistent with the concept of breaking out of the policy of containment, or do they reflect the inertia of the cold war period?'' the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, said at a news conference in Moscow.
Mr. Eagleburger's remarks gave a glimpse into why the Bush Administrations still seems to see as many dangers as opportunities in Mr. Gorbachev's efforts. Indeed, the Deputy Secretary began his speech by warning: ''We Americans tend to be much less aware of the dangers inherent in success. We are a confident and optimistic people, and in our approach to international affairs we tend to focus on the challenges of the moment and pay little heed to the long run.''
''Gorbachev is no anti-Communist and he intends to make the Soviet Union as strong as he possibly can,'' Mr. Eagleburger said. ''Nevertheless, it is true that the changes introduced by Gorbachev offer the first realistic hope for a transformation in the nature of the Soviet system and for a qualitative improvement in East-West relations.''
Already, he continued, ''we are hearing it said that we need to take measures to insure the success of Gorbachev's reforms.
''This, however, is not the task of American foreign policy, nor should it be that of our Western partners,'' said Mr. Eagleburger, who in recent years worked as a consultant with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. ''Our task, after all, is to devise policies which will serve our interests, whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds or fails. And our common goal ought to be the maintenance of the security consensus which has served the West so well over the past 40 years until the process of democratic reform in the East has truly become irreversible.''
Mr. Eagleburger warned that as the Soviet Union appears to adopt more soft-line foreign and domestic policies, there will be a real danger that the Western tendency ''toward unilateralism on trade matters'' will be ''matched in the field of security relations'' with the East bloc.

HEADLINE: Wave of Protests Developing On Profits From AIDS Drug

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The prospect of huge profits from the sale of the AIDS drug AZT is bringing a wave of protests against the Burroughs Wellcome Company, the drug's manufacturer.
Advocates for people with AIDS are organizing boycotts of other company products, and Government lawyers are considering whether to invoke a 1910 law that would allow Federal officials to override the company's patents to make larger supplies available.
Recent findings indicate that the number of people who could benefit from taking AZT has increased from about 45,000 people with AIDS to include as many as 600,000 people who are infected with the AIDS virus but have no symptoms.
 
Only Drug Licensed
AZT, or azidothymidine, is the only drug licensed to treat AIDS; its use stops the multiplication of the virus. 
It is among the most expensive drugs ever sold for daily use for a long period. At current prices and in usual doses, the drug costs each patient about $8,000 a year. Its cost, which has long raised protests from doctors and advocates for AIDS patients, may now yield what some analysts are calling astronomical and unconscionable profits.
The company has not said what its costs were in bringing it to market; industry analysts estimate that they range from $80 million to $180 million. Sales for the fiscal year that ended last month were $220 million, and profits before taxes have been estimated at as much as $100 million. With the new wave of patients, sales could reach $1 billion annually by 1992, analysts say.
Burroughs Wellcome officials have maintained that the price is high because the costs of research, development and manufacturing the drug have been high while the number of patients they can sell the drug to has been relatively small. In addition, the company has said it began to research and make the drug when other companies did not want to take the risk. Efforts today to reach officials of Burroughs Wellcome for comment were unsuccessful.
 
National Boycott Being Organized
A national boycott of Burroughs Wellcome products is being organized by more than a dozen groups of advocates for AIDS patients. One measure being considered is sending letters to all doctors in the country asking them to substitute an antibiotic made by another company for one that Burroughs Wellcome makes.
Lawyers for the Public Health Service and for Congressional committees have begun to look into the possibility of using an 80-year-old law under which the Government could ignore the patent rights of Borroughs Wellcome and have the drug manufactured at a far lower cost by another company. The law was last invoked in the 1950's, when military sought a lower price for tetracycline than that offered by drug companies in the United States.
The law provides that the Government may override patent protection when the action is important for the welfare of the nation. The company whose patent was negated cannot sue the Government under normal patent law, but it may recover a ''reasonable compensation'' in the Court of Claims, a special court that considers claims against the Federal Government.
Government lawyers said they were not sure if action under the law would be possible in the case of AZT. Although the Government subsidizes its purchase, it does not actually buy the drug itself.
 
Congressional Hearings Planned
Congressional hearings into the pricing of AZT are being prepared, and an article in The Journal of the American Medical Association today called the high cost unnecessary and the authors of the article said in a press conference that the company is guilty of ''price gouging''.
On Thursday, people in New York, San Francisco and London protested against the manufacturer by beginning a campaign of pasting small stickers that read ''AIDS profiteer'' on its products.
At the New York Stock Exchange, five protesters and two amateur photographers were arrested Thursday when they chained themselves to the balcony overlooking the exchange floor and unfurled a banner that said ''Sell Wellcome.'' Burroughs Wellcome is a subsidiary of Wellcome P.L.C. of England and no stock in it is traded on American exchanges. Stock of the parent corporation is traded on the London exchange. The new wave of people who may take the drug - those who are healthy, but infected, and have signs that their immune system is weakening - may take a dose of 5 capsules per day, considerably less than the dose of 12 capsules a day for people with AIDS.
 
Cost Estimates Vary
Various estimates have been made of the cost of manufacture, from one by Mathilde Krim of the American Foundation for AIDS Research of about 7 to 15 cents per capsule, to industry analysts who say it may cost 33 to 53 cents per capsule. A patient pays about $1.75 a capsule.
An even more important determinant of cost is the size of the market the company is selling to, said Robert Uhl, a pharmaceutical analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York. To cover the cost of manufacture and recover the cost of development, a small market means a far higher price. Mr. Uhl said the company has probably already recovered its cost.
Analysts give different estimates for the profits made by the compnay on the drug, depending largely on how profits are counted. John A. Falkenberg, an analyst with the British investment bank of Barclays Dezoete Wedd, Inc. in New York said a before-tax profit which does not discount many costs would be $100 million on 1989 sales of $220 million. After subtracting other costs, it might be a quarter of that amount, he said.
''But pharmaceutical companies when they look at making a drug, assume all the worst case scenarios -that there will be few patients, the product will have problems, it will have a short market life,'' said Leonard Schifrin, a health care economist at the College of William and Mary in Virginia.
''The company wants to build up a very nice nest egg to recover costs, and so the price of drugs like AZT seems very, very high. Then, when the worst cases do not happen, but instead there are more patients and a longer life in the market, it can turn those worst cases into billion-dollar bonanzas,'' Dr. Schifrin said.
''You might argue about how high the price has been,'' Dr. Schifrin said, ''but this is a very high profit industry. Profits are twice as high as in other industries, and that has become the norm.''
''Now with the larger market it, the price must come down. It would be uconscionable if it did not come down,'' Dr. Schifrin said.

HEADLINE: Polish Finance Minister's Tricky Mix: Hard Times and Free Markets

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Poland's new Finance Minister says he can move the country's badly limping centrally planned economy toward more capitalism only if he can impose budget austerity and create a market economy.
The problem, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said in an interview, is that he is supposed to do both at once.
Mr. Balcerowicz, a 42-year-old economist whose nomination was confirmed by Parliament on Tuesday with the rest of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's new Cabinet, said the quandary is this: only free markets supplying more everyday goods, which do not exist, as well as a capitalist-style safety net of unemployment payments and job-search agencies, which Poland's Communist economy has never known, could sweeten the unemployment and social dislocation that austerity threatens to bring.
Alluding to the belt tightening he is about to prescribe for Poland, he cautioned, ''In no country in the world in which such measures were introduced were there no deflationary effects.'' 
 
Trip to I.M.F. Meeting Weighed
''The problem is we have to act on two fronts at once,'' Mr. Balcerowicz said in the interview Tuesday. ''On the one hand there is the question of stabilization, while at the same time we must undertake institutional changes leading to a market economy.''
As a result, he said the new Government would move quickly to get loans from the International Monetary Fund to help it overhaul the economy. If necessary, he said he would travel to Washington later this month when I.M.F. officials gather for their annual meeting to argue Poland's case.
Certainly, Mr. Balcerowicz (pronounced bal-tser-OH-vich), who earned a doctorate in economics in Warsaw before earning an M.B.A. in economics in 1974 at St. John's University in New York, is aware of the pitfalls. He said Poland would have to quickly introduce ''social safeguards'' like unemployment payments, retraining programs and job-placement agencies to ease the jarring effects of austerity.
Austerity is a touchy issue in Poland, where economic deterioration has set off cycles of social unrest every decade or so since the war, toppling governments in 1956, 1970 and 1980. Recognizing the potential risks for the new Solidarity-led Cabinet, he said, ''I would hope the trade unions would participate'' - a reference to not only the Solidarity union but also the Communist unions, which have said they are not willing to accept a drop in living standards.
 
Split Seen in Economic Team
With that in mind, Mr. Balcerowicz, who was a Communist Party member until he resigned in December 1981 to protest the imposition of martial law in Poland, pledged to work closely with the new Labor Minister, Jacek Kuron, the Solidarity supporter and longtime dissident who is a veteran of 10 years in Polish prisons, and who is often numbered among the ministers with strongest social-democratic leanings.
Indeed, the nomination of ministers like Mr. Kuron has led to speculation that Mr. Mazowiecki's economic team, which is led by Mr. Balcerowicz, is essentially split between ministers oriented toward market economics and others favoring moderate policies aimed at avoiding social dislocation. Mr. Kuron is known as a tough defender of workers' rights whose views on economics are colored more by socialism than any brand of liberal free enterprise.
Mr. Balcerowicz was at pains to deny that there is such a division. ''If there is such a split, we certainly have not noticed it,'' he said of the first meetings of ministers responsible for the economy.
Developing a private sector will be no easy task. To make privatization work, Mr. Balcerowicz said, Poland must overhaul the way the economy keeps its books, to obtain fair values, and create institutions or build up those so underdeveloped as to be incapable of making a market economy work, such as banks, securities exchanges and, perhaps most urgently, a convertible currency.
Under the proposals outlined by Mr. Balcerowicz, the new Government would waste no time in imposing budget austerity and cracking down on tax evaders among the huge nationalized enterprises.
Asked whether there was fear of widespread bankruptcies among the dinosaurs of Poland's rust belt, he replied that Poland could draw on examples from Western Europe, ''aimed at making the program as painless as possible.''
''But we have to see declining industries disappear,'' he said. ''There is no hesitation as far as direction is concerned.''

HEADLINE: Drought-Stricken Areas Find Relief After Rains

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRANT CITY, Mo., Sept. 14

 BODY:
They came too late to do much for this year's crops, but bountiful, soaking rains over the last few weeks have brought relief from the drought that has persisted for more than a year across much of the Farm Belt.
Experts disagree on whether the drought is over or merely eased. It began in 1988 and devastated crops from Ohio to Texas and Montana and prompted Congress to spend almost $5 billion for relief to farmers.
But the rains, saturating topsoil and seeping deep into the subsoil, are nurturing lush new growth of pasture grasses, refilling long-dry cattle ponds and bringing new hope for new crops, especially winter wheat, which some Middle Western growers are planting for next summer's harvest. 
''These rains have virtually eliminated the long-term drought,'' said Douglas LeComte, chief of the agricultural weather section of a division run by the Agriculture Department and the National Weather Service.
 
'Reluctant to Sound All Clear'
Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of the Weather Services Corporation, a private consultant in Bedford, Mass., agreed up to a point. ''From the standpoint of the Midwest, it's fair to say the drought is over,'' Mr. Leavitt said this week. ''But I'm a little reluctant to sound the all-clear. This doesn't relieve nature of the responsibility of being beneficent next year. We always want to put borders on things, but nature doesn't let you do that. It wants to be a continuum.''
Mr. Leavitt said the rains had followed a pattern much like that of the drought itself, which persisted for some time in the East and then expanded westward last year, through corn-growing areas of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana and lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, a drought that had persisted in the Northwest expanded eastward, into the western Corn Belt of Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and Missouri.
''We still had the drought this year in the western Corn Belt,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''We just didn't have the heat. In the absence of heat, a little moisture went a long way.''
Some of the most generous relief came to Kansas, a state so severely stricken that it produced little more than half its normal crop of winter wheat this year. But now, as the fall planting time for the next crop approaches, Kansas has just enjoyed its rainiest week of the year. David Salmon of Global Weather Services, a division of Knight-Ridder Financial News, said this was Kansas' fourth week in a row of above-normal rainfall, and its 11th out of the last 16.
 
Areas Still Getting Relief
Among the last places to get relief have been southwestern Iowa, where National Guard trucks are still hauling water to nine towns; most of Nebraska, and several counties here in northwestern Missouri.
In those areas many farmers, like Eddie Costin of Grant City, had seen their ponds and pastures dry up, had watched their crops shrivel and had been forced to sell off many of their breeding cattle.
But now at least six inches of rain has fallen in some of the hardest-hit parts of Iowa over the last few weeks, four to six inches in Nebraska and more than six inches in this part of Missouri, delighting many like Mr. Costin. The rains came in time to bring his pasture grasses back to lushly green new life, refill his ponds and save the remaining 46 cows, he said.
Ken Hubbard, director of the High Plains Climate Center at the University of Nebraska, said the rain ''postponed any drought we were experiencing, at least until next year.''
 
'Too Much Moisture to Plant'
In Ottawa, Kan., Jack Beauchamp was equally pleased, even though the rain had forced him to delay planting his winter wheat. ''Now we've got too much moisture to plant,'' he said. ''That's quite a change from this time last year, but you're not going to hear me complaining.''
The principal area of the Farm Belt that is still dry is the wheat country of the Northern Plains, principally the western Dakotas and eastern Montana.
Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the Weather Service's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., takes a dim view of those who say the drought is over. He notes that even large amounts of rainfall are slow to change moisture in the subsoil, which affects rivers, underground water supplies and deep-rooted plants like trees and corn. Mr. Heim notes that at the end of August, the subsoil was still very dry in parts of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.
All the recent rains are expected to have little immediate effect on food prices; that will have to await next year's harvest. The Agriculture Department continues to predict that food-price inflation for this year will run from 5 to 7 percent. Most of that rise has already occurred.
 
Impact on Corn Harvest
In 1988, because of the drought, American farmers produced 4.9 billion bushels of corn, the most important crop as far as food budgets are concerned because it is the principal ingredient in feed for livestock. That was the smallest corn crop since 1983, another drought year, but it was still larger than earlier forecasts. That, experts say, was largely because the roots reached down into subsoil moisture that lingered despite the absence of rains.
The Agriculture Department's forecast for this year is 7.3 billion bushels, smaller than the averages of recent years and smaller than the department's earlier estimate. Mr. Leavitt said the problem was too little moisture in the subsoil of the western Corn Belt. ''When it came time in midsummer for the corn to go into overdrive, the moisture wasn't there,'' he said.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST GAINS SOME POPULATION

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
After a decade of population decline, the industrialized Northeast and Midwest have experienced modest gains since 1985, but 87 percent of all the nation's growth in the 1980's has been in the South and West, the Census Bureau said today.
The nation's population as a whole has grown by an estimated 19.3 million people from 1980 to 1988, to a total of 245.8 million, the bureau's annual report of state population estimates showed. Of that, 16.8 million was in the states of the South and West. 
Among the fastest growing states, the report said, were Arizona with a 28.4 percent increase since 1980, California with a 19.6 percent increase, Florida with a 26 percent increase, and Nevada, with a 31.7 percent increase.
The report this year covers state population changes in 1987 and 1988, as well as selected figures showing changes since 1980.
In the Northeast, the population has grown by 1.5 percent in the past three years, which is an annual rate in the region that is faster than any year since 1970.
Don Starsinic, a Census Bureau demographer, predicted that the New York metropolitan area, which now has a population of 18,120,200, is likely to increase to 18,200,000 by the end of the decade, bringing it back to its population of 1970.
But Mr. Starsinic added, ''It will be more concentrated in the areas outside New York City, although the city will recoup some of its loss.'' For census purposes, the New York metropolitan region stretches from Ocean County, N.J., on the south to Orange County, N.Y., on the northwest, Danbury, Conn., on the northeast and Suffolk County, L.I., on the east.
The fastest-growing areas in the metropolitan region continue to be the outer counties.
In terms of actual population numbers, California's growth of 4.6 million since 1980 was greatest. The state's total now is 28.3 million.
The Los Angeles metropolitan area grew by 2.3 million people from 1980 to 1988 to a total of 13.8 million, or almost half the state's population, Florida grew fastest in the decade, among states with populations of more than 5 million, climbing 2.6 million to a total of 12.3 million.
If California and Florida were the biggest gainers for the decade, the three biggest losers were Iowa, West Virginia and Wyoming, due to slumps in the farm and energy economies.

HEADLINE: 6 in the Arts Win New $100,000 Prize

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The six winners of a new $100,000 Japanese prize for lifetime achievement in the arts, the Praemium Imperiale, were announced yesterday at Rockefeller Center.
The winners are Pierre Boulez of France, in music; Marcel Carne of France, in theater and film; David Hockney of Britain and Willem de Kooning of the United States, in painting; Umberto Mastroianni of Italy, in sculpture, and I. M. Pei of the United States, in architecture.
The Praemium Imperiale, or Imperial Prize, was created last year by the Japanese Art Association to show Japan's commitment to fostering the arts. It was the idea of Prince Nobuhito Takamatsu, younger brother of Hirohito and governor of the association until his death in 1987. 
''Japan is criticized all over the world for putting too much emphasis on economic development,'' Hiroaki Shikanai, vice chairman of the association, said in an interview before the prizes were announced. ''I believe it should take a course as a nation that puts more emphasis on culture.''
The money for the prizes, he said, came largely from the Fujisankei Communications Group, which he heads. It owns television stations and newspapers in Japan.
Mr. Shikanai said the six winners, each of whom will receive a medal and $100,000, were chosen by the association's board from lists of nominees provided by committees in the United States, France, Italy, Britain and West Germany.
 
The Winners
Schuyler G. Chapin, a member of the American committee, read a short description of each winner at today's ceremony. He said of Mr. Pei, who is 72 years old, ''His major works are, in a word, stunning.'' They include the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art, the Pyramid of the Louvre in Paris and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center that just opened in Dallas.
Mr. de Kooning, 85, the Dutch-born painter, was among the originators of the school of Abstract Expressionism, which dominated painting for much of the postwar era.
Mr. Hockney, 52, was born in Britain, but his paintings of Los Angeles scenes epitomize the highly colorful, figurative painting style associated with the West Coast.
Mr. Mastroianni, who will be 79 on Thursday, is an Italian artist of ''originality, passion, and drama,'' in Mr. Chapin's words. He was known for miniatures for much of his career, but he began creating large abstract sculptures after World War II. He is ''one of the few to reflect the moral habits of our civilization,'' Mr. Chapin said.
 
Only Pei Is Present
Mr. Boulez, 64, the French former conductor of the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras, is a teacher and composer whose life was devoted in large part to interpreting modern classical music. ''Present and future students of music in this century must study Boulez's extraordinary oeuvre to gain any sense of progress in the glorious art of music,'' Mr. Chapin said.
Mr. Carne, 83, the director, has seen his most celebrated works, including ''Hotel du Nord'' and ''The Children of Paradise,'' become some of the century's most popular classics.
Of the winners, only Mr. Pei was present at the announcement yesterday. Afterward, he told a press conference that he was numb.
''It's an excellent idea,'' he said of the new prize. ''But it puts a heavy burden on those who are nominated and eventually get the prize, and I for one feel that burden very much.''
The prize ceremony and awarding of the money will take place Oct. 27 in Japan.
The prize has been widely seen as part of an effort by various Japanese groups to use the wealth gained through its economic success to promote cultural exchanges and other activities. Japanese groups recently have invested in American film companies and given large grants to universities for the study of Asia.
The official name of the award in Japanese is the World Culture Award Established in Honor of Prince Nobuhito Takamatsu. One or two prizes in each category are to be awarded each year, meaning the prize money could be as much as $1 million.
 
Selecting the Winners
Nominations for the prizes were made by committees headed by four former Prime Ministers and David Rockefeller, the investment banker who is the chairman of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The former Prime Minsters are Edward Heath of Britain, Jacques Chirac of France, Amintore Fanfani of Italy and Helmut Schmidt of West Germany.
Mr. Shikanai said the main task of the chairmen is to organize committees of experts in their countries to make nominations. ''They had to be influential enough to form that kind of committee under them,'' he said.
Mr. Rockefeller, who spoke at yesterday's lunch, said his committee had met for a day and a half to consider its nominations. Among the members of the American committee are Mr. Chapin, former dean of the Columbia University School of the Arts, the composer Stephen Sondheim, Kirk Varnedoe, director of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, Lloyd Richards, the head of the Yale Drama School, S. Dillon Ripley, secretary emeritus of the Smithsonian Institution, and Ada Louise Huxtable, a former architecture critic for The New York Times.
''It would be my guess that the awards in five important cultural fields will complement the Nobel Prizes very well,'' Mr. Rockefeller said at the news conference, ''and will come in these fields to have an importance comparable to the Nobels in other fields.''
Mr. Shikanai said that while nominations were made by the international advisory committees, the final choices were made by the trustees of the Japan Art Association. He said most of the 11 trustees were top Japanese business executives, some of whom had connections to museums, and also included Shunichi Suzuki, the Governor of Tokyo, and Jiro Arimitsu, the president of the Japan Art Academy.

HEADLINE: Talk to China - Despite the Chill

 BODY:
The Administration's decision to continue talks with Beijing about closer trade relations reflects the conviction that such talks serve both countries' long-term interests. The violence in Tiananmen Square and the ensuing political oppression have chilled official contacts. But the Administration calculates, correctly, that ending the trade talks would do lasting damage. 
The discussions involve China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international agreement that governs most of the world's imports and exports of manufactured goods. The talks have barely inched along for several years. There is no prospect that the Chinese will gain membership soon, and even talking about it alarms opponents of doing business with a repressive Communist regime.
Anger at the turn of events in China's internal politics is wholly justified. But it should not deter the Western powers from trying to encourage a return to the path of economic liberation that Beijing was pursuing before Tiananmen Square.
Politics aside, there's no easy way to incorporate state-controlled economies into the GATT. It links market economies whose prices are set by market forces. A government like China's can raise or cut prices without regard to cost, making tariffs meaningless. For example, if the U.S. tariff on imported fireworks were 10 percent, Beijing could wipe out the effect by dropping prices 10 percent. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Rumania are GATT members in a limited sense, and China is officially an ''observer'' in the current Uruguay Round of global negotiations to reduce all trade barriers. The Russians want to participate too; in the current atmosphere of encouraging Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, they should be welcome. But America is still proscribed from accepting them as equal trading partners under a 1974 law - the Jackson-Vanik Amendment - that requires freer emigration rights for Soviet Jews. Repeal of that law is overdue, but that's an ideological fight Washington is not yet ready for.
The White House claims that the talks with Beijing are ''low level''; that's a face-saving fabrication. It would be smarter to say that, for the time being, there's no big push for progress. One reason is the post-Tiananmen chill. But another, which applies equally to China and the Soviet Union, is that the Administration will have its hands full persuading Congress to accept the import liberalization that's being negotiated in the Uruguay Round; to raise sensitive East-West trade issues at the same time would make matters only worse.
For now, it's sufficient just to keep talking. In the long run, everyone's best interests will be served by integrating the Communist powers into the Western trading system. Free trade fosters prosperity - and peace.

HEADLINE: End the Artificial Rationing of Taxi Medallions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You reported only one sentence of my testimony at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission hearing Aug. 9 (news story, Aug. 10), giving the impression that I support a fare increase. I do not. As I said in my testimony, taxi fares are too high in relation to the true costs of cab owners and operators, such as gasoline, insurance, amortization of the vehicle and compensation for the driver. Payment that reflects the value of a medallion - the symbol of the artificially limited right to operate a street-hail cab - is not a true cost. 
Current fares cover true costs and generate enough extra revenue to support medallion values of $140,000, evidence that fares are excessive related to real costs.
I also indicated to the commission that, while fares are too high, relative to operation, they are low relative to the publicly borne costs of congestion, air pollution, and wear and tear on the streets. I said that a properly structured fare increase could help reduce these costs, but any such increase should be taxed away by the city to help defray the substantial public costs of maintaining streets and managing congestion. I also stated that, because taxis are relatively efficient users of New York City's streets, the city should take even stronger actions to discourage the use of private cars.
The best taxi policy is to end the artificial limit on the number of medallions and to start managing congestion. Medallion prices on the private market would fall to zero, supply and demand for taxis would be in balance, and more drivers could afford to become owner-operators concerned with providing a service, rather than reaping a windfall on an unproductive financial asset each time the fare is raised.

HEADLINE: Breaking One of South Africa's Barriers

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
Vernon Grigg's application for a Supreme Court clerkship was heavy with conventional credentials. He is a student at Yale Law School. He had an honors degree from the University of Michigan and a year at the London School of Economics. He had also apprenticed at two top law firms, was a licensed glider pilot and had performed in a singing group called Up With People during halftime at Super Bowl XVI.
But this application was different from most. The Supreme Court was the Supreme Court of the Transvaal, a province in South Africa - and Mr. Grigg is black. 
 
First Black Law Clerk
Last week Mr. Grigg, an American, began working for Judge Ronald Goldstone of the Johannesburg Supreme Court, becoming the first black law clerk ever under apartheid. Indeed, he might just be the first black person ever in Judge Goldstone's chambers, aside from the custodian who vacuums the floor. In his new post he will research cases and perform other law-related chores.
The laws of apartheid apply to foreign blacks visiting South Africa. Even were he so inclined, Mr. Grigg could not eat in whites-only restaurants or ride in whites-only buses. But he is permitted to live in a white neighborhood, with the judge's other clerk, a white.
Already he has been mistaken for a houseboy. He has also been the target of confused stares from black and white South Africans alike, who cannot quite figure out where he fits into a society with clearly defined racial niches. It is an eerie experience, yet in a way it is precisely what the 26-year-old from Tucson, Ariz., wanted.
 
Going to Observe
Shortly before he left the United States, Mr. Grigg, who has taken a year's leave of absence from Yale, spoke of why he was headed to South Africa and what he hoped to accomplish there. As he envisions it, his role is to be more that of observer and scholar than political advocate; he is far more anxious to learn about apartheid than to make a point about it.
''If I can be a role model for students in this country or an inspiration for anyone there, that I welcome,'' he said. ''But do I go there intending to attract a tremendous amount of attention, or wanting to become a political Ping-Pong ball? Not at all.''
Before he left, Mr. Grigg read up on the history of the Dutch East India Company and the story of the voortrekkers. He learned a smattering of Afrikaans - words like ''ras'' for ''race'' and ''Kaffir,'' a name for members of the Bantu tribe now used as a derogatory term for blacks, ''volk'' and ''veld.'' He studied the works of W. E .B. DuBois and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and pondered America's own racial past with more than academic interest. ''I've been told to think that going to South Africa is like going back to Selma in 1920,'' he said.
There were other, more practical preparations. He packed the same shirt he wore when he first flew solo, which he figured had already helped him through times of stress. He bought some life and health insurance, as well as a whistle at the Yale Co-op. And, for reasons of self-identity as well as security, he treated himself to a new pair of Nike high-tops. ''If I have to roll, I can,'' he said.
 
'Allegations of Complicity'
Mr. Grigg has taken his share of criticism for accepting the clerkship, particularly from white classmates. With varying degrees of tact, they faulted him for legitimizing apartheid, or, even worse, enforcing its decrees.
''They were all allegations of complicity - that I'm going to be writing the opinions that sentence political activists to hang,'' he said. Were it not for the reassurances of the law school's dean, Guido Calabresi, he might have backed out of the project altogether.
''The importance of Vernon's trip and what he can accomplish far outweighs the risk he'll be used as window dressing for a racist system,'' said R. Scott Greathead, a New York lawyer who helped establish the Orville H. Schell Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale, which is sponsoring Mr. Grigg's clerkship. Mr. Schell, who died in 1987, was a New York lawyer active in international human rights.
The son of a career military officer stationed in places like El Paso, Tex., Charlotte, N.C. and Kearney, Neb., Mr. Grigg encountered discrimination long before reaching South Africa. Always, he says, there were people like a public school teacher, a white man, who warned him that black students had to be twice as good as everyone else, then promptly knocked down his grade to prove his point.
He came to Yale in September 1987, where he hoped to further his interest in children's rights. But like many law students, boredom and frustration set in once the intimidation wore off. The course work struck him as too detached from reality, the career trajectory too corporate.
''The way I want to practice law is going to have to be very tactile, helping people rather than corporate bodies,'' he said. ''I wanted to leave the library, leave the ivy-covered walls and conference rooms and hit the streets, to learn how the things I'm learning can be used to make the world more as I would have it.''
In his second year he took a seminar called ''The Limits of Law as an Instrument of Social Change,'' taught by Professors Burke Marshall and Joseph Goldstein, along with Justice Aharon Barak of the Israeli Supreme Court, then visiting at Yale. That fed his desire for field work and led him to Judge Goldstone, one of South Africa's more liberal jurists. In South Africa, as in New York State, the Supreme Court is the trial-level court, although it hears some appeals.
''I didn't anticipate any problems and I'm sure there won't be any,'' Judge Goldstone said in a telephone interview from his Johannesburg home. ''People are intrigued, but I can't see anybody raising any objections to it.'' He declined to discuss his views on apartheid, though he has implicitly criticized it in speeches abroad.
Mr. Grigg first met the judge in February when he was visiting at Harvard's Center for International Affairs. The checking-out process went both ways. ''He made it clear that he wasn't an apologist for apartheid,'' Mr. Grigg said. ''He convinced me that he's sincere in his convictions, self-critical, constantly reevaluating what he can and cannot, will and will not do.
''I do not intend to consciously avail myself of the privileges I get because I'm American,'' Mr. Grigg continued. ''I resent and reject the notion of being an 'honorary white person' and I don't intend to become one.''

HEADLINE: To Revive Newark, State Shuffles Its Workers

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 14

 BODY:
In the latest attempt to breathe more life into the heart of this city on the mend, the state is moving 2,000 of its employees from offices near Pennsylvania Station into three downtown buildings that are now either unoccupied or largely vacant.
Local and state officials hope the transfer will put more people on Newark's streets and more customers in its stores and restaurants. Although the move is not scheduled to take place till next year, several businesses have opened in the immediate area in response to the plans, suggesting that the officials may be right.
But the plans, completed this month, do not sit well with everyone. Though the state employees union has agreed to cooperate, some state workers resent being used as tools of urban revitalization. 
 
'We Don't Trust You'
''They're putting state employees in an area that's more dangerous and less convenient,'' said Joseph C. O'Hara, chief of the Bureau of Gas Rates in the Board of Public Utilities. ''Forget it.''
Other workers are concerned about security in the new buildings, which are on blocks that are less heavily used than the current offices. They are also worried about parking and access to buses and trains.
Then there is an underlying mistrust that many employees feel toward the state and its promise to provide safe, clean and comfortable offices.
''We told them flat out, 'This sounds good, but we don't trust you,' '' said Michael J. Hopkins, president of Local 1037 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents most non-management state employees in Newark and which has been working without a contract since July.
State employees have been deployed to help the recovery of downtowns in other cities, including New York, where two years ago state offices were moved from the World Trade Center to sites elsewhere in the city, including Gertz Plaza in Jamaica, Queens. The idea has been pending here for more than a decade.
But each previous attempt was derailed by opposition from union leaders, who believed that the deteriorating and overcrowded conditions at the current offices, at 1100 Raymond Boulevard, were preferable to the darkened and deserted streets west of Broad Street to which workers would have been transferred.
 
'High Marks'
This time the picture is different. Although still weak, Newark's downtown as a whole is now recuperating from decades of decline, and most storefronts are occupied. Also, this time the state took extraordinary measures to win the support of labor.
''You've got to give them high marks on this one,'' said Mr. Hopkins of Local 1037.
The block-long building at 1100 Raymond Boulevard is owned by the Newark Center Building Company, a group of New York investors. The state has leased space in it since 1956; today, nearly 2,000 employees in many departments, including Consumer Affairs and Labor, work there.
An additional 1,000 employees will be moved from four other Newark buildings and offices in Bloomfield, East Orange and West Orange.
The Raymond Boulevard building is just down the street from Pennsylvania Station. Once surrounded by derelict old buildings, then by huge parking lots, 1100 Raymond now sits in the middle of Newark's Gateway district, a developing complex of office buildings containing more than 2 million square feet of space, roughly equivalent to the Empire State Building.
 
Bringing In Shoppers
Everett Shaw, who serves as president of Newark's corporate revitalization group, Renaissance Newark, as well as the city's $1-a-year deputy mayor for development, said that the city supports the state relocation because it would have a double effect: bringing thousands of people into the city's shopping district, and freeing a valuable development site.
The building's owners had tried to sign a new lease with the state but are not worried about finding a new tenant. They may try to raze part of the building and replace it with a 20-story tower.
The three buildings into which the employees will be moved are within three blocks of the current offices. They are 707 Broad Street, once occupied by a Two Guys department store; 153 Halsey Street, the former Gibraltar Building, owned by the Prudential Insurance Company of America, and 31 Clinton Street, which once housed Essex County Community College.
The state will lease about half the space in the Halsey Street and Broad Street buildings, and all the office space at 31 Clinton Street, which is substantially smaller. The total lease will be for 674,882 square feet, at $13.7 million a year.
The owners have agreed to renovate the three properties thoroughly, and asbestos removal has begun.
 
In Search of Lunch
Each of the three buildings will have stores or restaurants on the ground floor, but no employees' cafeteria, which will force workers to take to the streets in search of lunch. Planners hope the employees will stroll by the many small shops along Halsey Street as well as the city's only remaining department store, Macy's, which is now half-empty.
For the owners of the office buildings, getting the state as a major tenant is expected to make leasing the remaining space easier. Mr. Shaw said the city would plant trees, build new bus stops and add a new kiosk where city police officers would be stationed 24 hours a day. He said he also expected Macy's to refurbish its store.
Small businesses in the area are looking at the 3,000 new potential customers with relish.
''They are sure going to be a plus,'' said John D. Petrozzino, a Newark high school prinicipal who with two partners opened the Downtown Cafe Thursday across Halsey Street from the old Two Guys building.
Paula T. Saje, business manager for Computer Realty Management, which has just signed leases for three of four vacant stores it owns on Halsey Street, said the state's move has helped tremendously.
While concerns of safety and transportation, which led state employees to vote overwhelmingly against a similar proposal in 1983, still remain, Mr. Hopkins, the union local president, said that a survey last fall found workers to be almost evenly divided over the plan. Possible 'Paradise'? To overcome lingering apprehension, last November the state invited a group of union shop stewards to visit newly renovated offices in Trenton, where a similar plan is proceeding. Nestor Ocampo of Elizabeth was one of those who made the trip, and came back impressed.
''They did a very good job there, and if we have anything like that here it will be paradise,'' said Mr. Ocampo, a disability claims adjudicator within the Department of Labor.
James Sconamilio, an investigator with the Division of Consumer Affairs, said he thought that splitting the bulk of employees into three separate buildings might create inefficiencies, and that parking would be less available for the 52 percent of state workers who drive to work.
As for boosting local businesses, Mr. Sconamilio does not expect to contribute much. ''I only get a half hour for lunch,'' he said. ''Where are you going to go on that?''

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Long-Term Plan Yields Stock Gain

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
If a small investor had spent the last 20 years doing just what Wall Street professionals often say the little guy does - buying high - that person could have more than quadrupled the money invested, a new study from T. Rowe Price shows.
The Baltimore-based mutual fund and investment management firm calculated what would have happened to a portfolio if an investor had put $2,000 a year into equities at the year's peak and reinvested all dividends quarterly.
Right off the bat, the investor would have had a paper loss. Buying at the 1969 peak would have resulted in a Dec. 31 portfolio value of $1,772. And the next year, the investment would still be in the minus column with a value of $3,887. By the third year, however, the portfolio's value would have grown to $6,420 and by 1979, it would have been up to $28,416, a 29.6 percent return over 10 years. And in the second decade, thanks to the bull market of the 1980's, it took off, surging to $171,757 on July 31. 
Of course, past is not necessarily prologue. And the study assumes the investor left the money in through thick and thin, not selling low - the other error that professionals attribute to the little guy. But the study contains a number of lessons for investors, the most important being the value of patiently following a long-term strategy, says Steven E. Norwitz, vice president of T. Rowe Price who directed the study, and other professionals.
''For those with a long-term investment horizon and the discipline to stay the course, the commitment to invest may be more important than the timing of the investment,'' Mr. Norwitz said.
Similarly, Gilbert S. Meem Jr., senior vice president, investments, of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., recommends that people invest in equities only if they can leave at least 85 percent of the portfolio invested for at least three years. ''It will take nine or 10 months to position the account, and it could lose money in the first year and a half, but patience will pay off,'' he said. ''It's not easy because you have to overcome emotionalism and because brokers always want to sell you something.''
Mr. Norwitz cited several reasons for the quadruple returns of the last 20 years. On an annual basis, the average return was 10.1 percent, which well outstripped inflation.
''One reason this 'worst-case scenario' produced such surprisingly good results is that a substantial part of the rise in value reflects shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends,'' he said, noting that dividends of almost $35,000 would have been received. The low prices of the first decade enabled the investor to acquire a great many shares, so that when current payout is compared with the investor's cost basis, there is a high return.
''Another advantage of investing with a long-term view is that volatility and the chances of incurring a loss are substantially mitigated over longer time periods,'' he said.
Mr. Norwitz said that staying fully invested was also crucial to the strong results. Citing a study by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, he noted that from 1979 through 1988, every dollar invested in an index fund mirroring the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have grown to $4.52, while each dollar invested in Treasury bills would have reached $2.39. Had investors been out of the stock market in the five best months of each year, their equity dollar would have reached only $2.68.
''The risk of trying to time the market is not being in the market at critical moments when it counts the most,'' he said.
Tim Kochis, national director of executive financial consulting for Deloitte Haskins & Sells, suggests that investing in index funds is precisely what most individual investors should do with a substantial part of their portfolios. ''If you are going to be in the market for more than 10 years, I don't believe you can outwit it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Inventories Are Up 0.6%; Sales Off 0.9%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Business inventories climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in July, the biggest gain in three months, while business sales fell by nine-tenths of 1 percent, the Government reported today.
A combination of falling sales and rising inventories would normally provoke some recession fears, but analysts for the most part expressed little concern over the report.
''The rise in business inventories is potentially a problem, but when it is taken in context with other data, it is not very worrisome,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. 
Supporting this view, the Federal Reserve reported today that industrial production posted a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in August, the best showing in four months, reflecting a rebound in auto production.
Economists said the rise in industrial output, along with a gain in retail sales in August, was an indication that factories would not be scaling back production to bring output more in line with demand.
Many analysts believe that outside of the auto industry, inventories have been kept at fairly lean levels and they are predicting that overall production will post moderate gains for the rest of the year.
The rise in inventories in July pushed the total stockpile of unsold goods to a seasonally adjusted $785.5 billion. The increase was led by a 1.1 percent rise in inventories held by manufacturers. Inventories at the retail level rose three-tenths of 1 percent, while wholesale inventories were unchanged.
The combination of falling sales and rising inventories put the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.54 in July, meaning that it would take 1.54 months to exhaust inventories at the July sales pace. The June ratio was 1.51.
The drop in total sales matched the decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent reported in February and was the largest sales setback since a 3 percent drop in January 1987. The July decrease left total sales at a seasonally adjusted $511.09 billion. Sales at the manufacturing level fell by 1.8 percent while sales by wholesalers were off eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Retail sales were the only area of strength, rising by five-tenths of 1 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Posts Largest Gain in 4 Months

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Industrial production increased three-tenths of a percent in August, the biggest gain in four months, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
The August gain followed revised increases of one-tenth of a percent in July and two-tenths of a percent in June after remaining flat in May. The Fed had originally reported an increase of two-tenths of a percent in July and declines of one-tenth of a percent in both May and June. 
''That's not only stronger than expected, but the revisions were substantial,'' said Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm. ''The economy never really slowed down,''
 
Manufacturing Called Sluggish
But William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the gain was only 2.8 percent over August of last year, compared with a rise of 5.7 percent in 1988. ''Growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish throughout 1989, falling farther behind the growth in the services sector,'' he said.
The Fed credited almost all the August growth to a rebound in production at automobile factories and a pickup in coal mining after a strike.
''Excluding motor vehicles, output of both consumer goods and business equipment was sluggish during the summer,'' it said.
At the same time, the central bank reported that the operating rate at factories, mines and utilities remained unchanged at 83.8 percent of capacity in August. The operating rate measures not only output, but also changes in productivity levels.
Factory use had declined one-tenth of a percentage point in June, the central bank said. The rate had reached a 10-year high of 84.3 percent in December 1988 and last January. Last month's operating rate was unchanged from August 1988.
''Unchanged capacity utilization in August signals the likelihood that inflationary pressures have declined substantially in the last several months,'' Mr. MacReynolds said.
The closer the nation's industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or more to be an indication of inflationary pressures.
Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose two-tenths of a percent last month after remaining flat in July and increasing three-tenths of a percent in June. Output was up 2.3 percent at mines and oil wells but fell 1 percent at utilities.
The operating rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point, to 84 percent, at manufacturing plants. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
The Fed said its industrial production index in August stood at 142.4 percent of its 1977 base, up from 142 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell 0.4% in August

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Producer prices fell four-tenths of 1 percent in August, the third straight monthly decline, the Labor Department reported today.
As an inflation indicator, the report was somewhat more favorable than expected, and it apparently contributed to a rise in the bond market today. Still analysts noted that the decline in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods resulted from a drop in the price of energy and that oil prices have recently been rising.
They also said that the index would have shown an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent if food and energy, two major components subject to erratic swings, had been excluded. This contrasted with a small decline in that calculation for July. 
 
Worries Over 'Core' Inflation
''I'm concerned about the failure to appreciate the upward drift in this 'core' inflation,'' said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Without food and energy, producer inflation is running more than 25 percent faster in 1989 than last year, he said. ''And I don't think that's something to take lightly,'' he added.
Some other economists agreed. ''It's going to be hard to get these core rates down,'' said Kathryn L. Kobe, a vice president at Joel Popkin & Company, a Washington consulting firm that specializes in price trends. ''We still are somewhat concerned about inflation.''
There was, however, some comfort to be found in the indexes for producer prices at the intermediate and crude stages of production. The intermediate index fell three-tenths of 1 percent, after two straight declines of two-tenths, while the index for crude goods dropped 1.9 percent after showing a slight rise in July.
This suggested that no worrisome surge in inflation is likely in the foreseeable future. That could mean that the Federal Reserve, which seems to have been following an essentially neutral monetary course in recent weeks, would not need to shift to a tighter policy that would push up interest rates.
The subdued price behavior at the intermediate and crude levels ''could portend some good inflation numbers in the next few months,'' said Veronika C. White, an economist at the First Fidelity Bancorporation in Philadelphia.
Finished goods are those that are ready for sale to the ultimate user; an example would be a shirt. Using that example, the intermediate good would be a bolt of cloth and the crude good would be the raw cotton from which the cloth was made.
Price inreases at the producer level were running at an annual rate above 9 percent in the first few months of the year, causing fears of accelerating inflation. But with the recent declines, the rate for the eight months through August now stands at 4.4 percent. For the 12 months through August, producer prices have risen 4.2 percent.
After a lag of several months, producer prices are reflected at the consumer level. Through July the Consumer Price Index for 1989 had risen at an annual rate of 5.5 percent. The consumer price figures for August are to be reported Tuesday, and anlysts expect a modest increase.
 
Big Declines in Energy
The drop in the energy component of the finished goods index was 7.3 percent, more than twice the declines of June and July. Gasoline tumbled another 12.1 percent in August after a 7.2 percent drop in July. Natural gas and home heating oil, which had risen in July, fell 5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, last month.
Consumer foods rose three-tenths of 1 percent as increases accelerated for beef and veal, dairy products and bakery products. The prices of eggs and pork turned up, after having fallen in July. Fish and pasta prices continued to rise. Poultry fell less than in July. Soft drinks, fresh fruits and roasted coffee turned down.
Apart from energy and food, the prices of passenger cars had the most effect on the index. Car prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent in August after dropping 1.9 percent in July.
The capital equipment category, which was unchanged in July, advanced three-tenths of 1 percent.
Among intermediate goods, lower prices for energy and manufacturing materials were the main contributors to the decline, as they were in July. The nondurable manufacturing items that fell in price included plastic resins, paints, papers, fertilizer materials, medicinal and botanical chemicals and inedible fats and oils.
The index of durable manufacturing materials fell for the fifth straight month, with hefty declines for steel mill products, shaped aluminum products and ferrosilicon.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 9.69 Points After Wide Swings

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose moderately yesterday while trading volume increased sharply.
After an up-and-down week, the Dow Jones industrial average finished 9.69 points higher, at 2,674.58, but for the week the Dow was down 34.96 points and closed well below 2,700, a level closely watched by technical analysts.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines by 837 to 651. 
Volume on the Big Board climbed to 234.9 million shares, from 149.3 million on Thursday. This was the biggest turnover in nearly three months.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.90 points, to 345.06, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.64, to 191.59.
 
Dow Variations
The Dow average swung widely during the day. It was up 15 points and down 5 points in early trading, rebounding from Thursday's 14.63-point deficit. Several Government economic reports issued yesterday had less impact than widely expected.
Yesterday the Commerce Department reported that business inventories rose six-tenths of 1 percent in July, up from a revised three-tenths of 1 percent increase in June. At the same time, the Government reported that the July trade deficit narrowed to $7.58 billion, from $8.01 billion, the lowest since December 1984.
In other reports, industrial production gained three-tenths of 1 percent in August, compared with a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in July, while the August Producer Price Index fell four-tenths of 1 percent, the third straight monthly drop.
Analysts said the producer price and industrial production statistics appeared to eliminate the possibility that the Federal Reserve would relax interest rates for the remainder of the year.
 
Lacking Conviction
''The economic releases and the triple witching hour provided a volatile day,'' said Jack Barbanel, portfolio strategist at First Global Asset Management Inc. in Princeton, N.J. ''Volume was impressive but the breadth of the market still lacked conviction.'' The triple witching hour occurs when stock options, options on stock indexes and futures on stock indexes expire at the same time. Stocks tend to vacillate wildly on these days because of the wide use of computer programs to expedite trading.
''Caution still ruled the day,'' Mr. Barbanel said. ''Looking forward, the key is whether the Fed will do something with interest rates, which I don't see.''
He said that the market remained cautious about the validity of fixed-income issues, especially ''junk bonds,'' which offer high yields. ''Until these issues are resolved, the market should remain choppy,'' he said.
 
Airline Stocks
The AMR Corporation dropped 1 3/4, to 75 7/8. The company, along with some other airlines, has recently been considered a takeover candidate.
MGM/UA Communications rose 1 7/8, to 22 1/2. Qintex Ltd. of Australia said that it had agreed to acquire MGM for $25 a share, topping an offer by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
Exxon was the most active issue, up 1/4, to 44 7/8, on 3.4 million shares. A.T.&T. was the second-most-active stock, rising 3/8, to 40 5/8, on nearly 3.3 million shares.
UAL fell 3/4, to 279 3/4. The company announced an agreement to be acquired for $6.75 billion by its pilots, management and British Airways P.L.C.
Actively traded blue chips included General Electric, up 1 3/8, to 57 1/4; I.B.M., off 1/4, to 115 1/2; USX, up 5/8, to 34 1/8, and Eastman Kodak, off 3/8, to 47 3/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market value index slipped 1.30 points, to 379.64, while in over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq composite index dipped 1.21 points, to 467.57.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Gain Strongly After Wild Rumors Arise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices made strong gains yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange after being pulled back from three-year lows by unfounded rumors that President Bush had been shot and that a major United States bank was near collapse.
''From what we can see, it was purely rumor-driven,'' said John Jonat, a metals trader with Deak International Inc.
On other markets, energy futures advanced, grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
Gold futures settled $3.40 higher across the board, with the contract for delivery in October at $365.20 an ounce. Silver futures were 2.7 cents to 2.9 cents higher, with September at $5.084 an ounce.
Analysts said the moves in the metals markets were mainly reactions to the dollar, which strengthened early in the day after positive reports on inflation and the trade deficit, then collapsed in the afternoon amid the wild rumors.
 
'A Complete Reversal'
''We had a complete reversal,'' said Craig Sloane, a metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York.
The market gave more credence to the talk of an impending bank collapse than to the rumors about President Bush, analysts said, because the financial markets were jittery about the credit troubles of the Campeau Corporation, the retailing giant.
For the gold market, which has been weakening gradually for months, the turnaround could mark a turning point, Mr. Sloane said.
''New lows were made, and then you came up with a higher close on the day,'' he said. That could signal the start of a big bull move, he said.
Energy futures also rallied late in the session on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than offsetting the technically inspired losses that had accrued earlier in the week.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 to 26 cents higher, with October at $19.96 a barrel; heating oil was 0.74 to 0.91 cent higher, with October at 55.95 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.74 to 0.90 cent higher, with October at 57.50 cents a gallon.
Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The corn market weakened late in the session when a rumored Soviet corn purchase failed to materialize.
Gerald Zusel, manager of the Balfour Maclaine Corporation's floor operations at the exchange, said the speculation was premature.
''You buy during the harvest, not before the harvest,'' he said.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
Lageman to Be Starter In His First N.F.L. Game

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Sept. 15

 BODY:
Suddenly today, the Jets began to look as they did on paper when training camp started in July.
The linebacker Jeff Lageman, the team's No. 1 draft choice, was announced as a starter for his first professional game when the Jets face the Browns at Cleveland on Sunday. Al Toon, the Pro Bowl wide receiver who missed the Jets' opener, will be able to see action, and Johnny Hector, the versatile runner, has been added to the roster. 
Tim Cofield said he has never heard of Wally Pipp, whose headache kept him from playing first base for the Yankees and gave an opportuity to Lou Gehrig. Gehrig stayed for 2,130 consecutive games. But Cofield may turn out to be a Pipp, with a groin injury. Lageman will step in, although Coach Joe Walton said he believed the rookie, who will be the outside right linebacker, could ''use a couple more weeks.''
 
A Rush Start
It is a rush start for Lageman, who missed the first 33 days of camp in a contract dispute. He has been with the team for only 23 days. Until Cofield was injured, it was too late for the rookie to take the job from the veteran, who won it in Lageman's absence.
Lageman, at 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds one of the biggest linebackers in club history, had been penciled in at outside right linebacker, where he would presumably terrorize quarterbacks and haul down runners. Until now, though, the best he has looked has been wearing the uniform. He seemed almost stoic today in reflecting on his first pro start.
''Before a game I'm not a big rah-rah type,'' said Lageman, who was an economics major at the University of Virginia. ''I'll be high for the game but I can't be worrying about it.''
Lageman is realistic enough to know that Bernie Kosar and the Browns will try to exploit the right side of the Jets' defense. Ron Stallworth, another rookie, is at right end. ''If I were the coach, I would,'' the rookie said matter-of-factly.
 
Light Workouts for Toon
In a perfect Jets world, Toon and Wesley Walker would be at their accustomed wide-receiver positions. And Hector would be replacing Freeman McNeil at running back on short-yardage and teaming with him on passing plays.
Although Toon's injured shoulder has not completely healed, the Jets have apparently avoided the potential disaster of facing the powerful Browns without either starting receiver. Walker is sidelined for at least six games with an ankle injury.
Toon's workouts have been light and he wore a red jersey so his teammates would not bang into him. He will rotate with Michael Harper and JoJo Townsell, bringing in Walton's plays.
Meanwhile, Hector, who agreed to terms this week and is not in game-condition, has been added to the 47-player roster and taken off the exemption list. Walton said he will decide Sunday whether to suit him up.
Lageman, Toon, Walker and Hector all had lengthy contract disputes. Walton believes that Toon's and Walker's absences contributed to their injuries.
 
 One More Sack for Browns
 The Browns have been credited with another sack in their rout of the Steelers last Sunday: they produced seven sacks, eight turnovers (including five fumble recoveries), and positioned 13 points on turnovers. . . . Scott Mersereau, benched during the Jets' game against the Patriots, will return to start at nose tackle. But Paul Frase will also see action there. . . . Marty Lyons, bothered by a sore shoulder, will start at left end.
