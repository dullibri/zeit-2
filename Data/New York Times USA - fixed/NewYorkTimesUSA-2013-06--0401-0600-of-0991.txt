HEADLINE: Texas Comes North to Poach Business

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry, who will visit New York and Connecticut next week in hopes of luring business from the gun, pharmaceutical and financial industries, is spreading his recruitment message on the radio and television. 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
New York radio listeners, give it up for Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
Not to be outdone by a potential rival for the governorship who invited New York gun owners to move to Texas after New York tightened its gun laws in January, Mr. Perry has released a radio ad here comparing Texas's business climate quite favorably to New York's. 
"The new New York sounds a lot like the old New York," Mr. Perry says in a dig at the Cuomo administration's recently unveiled "New New York" economic development campaign. "Higher taxes. Stifling regulations. Bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp."
Mr. Perry explains that things are different in Texas, where there is no income tax, "fair and predictable regulations" (very helpful if you prefer that first responders not know how much explosive ammonium nitrate is on hand at your fertilizer plant), and lawsuit reforms that "keep trial lawyers out of your pockets so you can grow your business."
The ads herald Mr. Perry's five-day job-poaching trip to New York and Connecticut, which begins on Sunday and will include meetings with business leaders in the gun, pharmaceutical and financial industries.
 According to Mr. Perry's office, the ads will run for a week on nine stations in New York City and Albany and cost $50,000. Mr. Perry's recruitment effort also includes spending $1 million on television ads, which began running Monday on cable channels in New York and Connecticut. The ads and the trip are being paid for by TexasOne, a project of the Texas Economic Development Corporation that does not spend state tax dollars, Mr. Perry's office said. 
On behalf of all residents of the great State of New York, City Room welcomes Mr. Perry and his entourage and hopes that they enjoy their stay and spend lots and lots of money.

HEADLINE: Unproductive Finance

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The price of two second. 

 BODY:
More than half a century ago, in his classic paper on the economics of speculation, Paul Samuelson noted the perverse rewards to knowing stuff just slightly before everyone else. He asked readers to imagine someone who, somehow, consistently received crucial information one second before everyone else. As he pointed out, the social value of that extra second would be minimal; but the private rewards could be huge. 
Today, Kevin Drum points us to a real-world example quite close to Samuelson's thought experiment. It turns out that Thomson-Reuters pays the University of Michigan a million dollars a year to provide selected clients with the results of the latest survey of consumer confidence 5 minutes before the rest of the world sees them -and to provide super-special clients with this information 2 seconds before the rest.
This is a trivial example; still, what we see here, as Drum notes, are real resources being devoted to the socially useless task of getting an economic number slightly before the hoi polloi. And you have to wonder how much of what the financial sector does is like that. Certainly these days many vast fortunes come, not from building something, but from consistently guessing what other investors are going to do a few days, or sometimes a second or two, ahead of the pack.
It sure doesn't look like a productive activity.

HEADLINE: Coty Raises About $1 Billion in Its Public Debut

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The cosmetics maker Coty priced its initial public offering at $17.50 a share on Wednesday, in the middle of its expected range of $16.50 to $18.50. 

 BODY:
After trying once before, the cosmetics maker Coty is set to finally become a public company.
The company, whose products include Sally Hansen nail polish and perfumes endorsed by Beyoncéand Katy Perry, priced its initial public offering at $17.50 a share on Wednesday, in the middle of its expected range of $16.50 to $18.50.
The stock sale values the company at about $6.7 billion. 
The offering, which raised just less than $1 billion in proceeds, is one of the three biggest initial offerings in the United States this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital.
With Wednesday's sale, Coty completed an effort it began several years ago with a few detours along the way. Among them was the company's aborted takeover bid last year for a larger rival, Avon Products.
Coty's selling shareholders sought to take advantage of a burgeoning market for stock offerings amid a healthy rise in equity market valuations this year.
The company's owners are also betting on a revival of consumer confidence, with customers increasing their purchases of higher-ticket perfumes and nail polishes. According to a Euromonitor survey cited in Coty's prospectus, the company's main sectors are expected to grow 3 percent to 4 percent a year through 2016.
Coty reported $258.1 million in net income for the nine months ended March 31, up more than fourfold compared with results in the period a year earlier, though its revenue was roughly flat at $3.59 billion.
Founded by a French perfumer 108 years ago, Coty has become a significant player in the global cosmetics market. It already has a strong hold in the perfume market, especially in the realm of licensed fragrances from the likes of Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Chloé.
And through a string of deals for companies like OPI and TJoy of China, it has broadened both its product offerings and its reach. Coty now sells its wares in more than 130 countries, with an increasing emphasis in emerging markets like Brazil and China.
That international push was one of the main drivers behind the company's $10.7 billion bid for Avon last year. Despite being about half the size of its target, Coty argued that it could bring a strong management team to its embattled rival.
Yet despite securing the backing of Berkshire Hathaway, Coty was unable to convince Avon of the merits of a merger and withdrew its takeover bid last spring. Soon afterward, it filed for an initial public offering.
Wednesday's stock sale will finally open the path to an exit for Coty's primary owners, the wealthy Reimann family of Germany. Through its investment vehicle, Joh. A. Benckiser, the family bought the company in 1992 and spearheaded its expansion.
Coty had contemplated going public two years ago but held off because of volatile market conditions.
Coty's other primary shareholders, the investment firms Berkshire Partners and Rhone Capital, will also sell shares in the offering.
The investors will still retain control of Coty even after selling some of their shares, however. Their remaining holdings will be converted into Class B stock, each share of which will carry 10 votes. All told, the three will control nearly 98 percent of the company's voting power after the public offering. 
The company's shares will begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol COTY.
Its offering was led by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: Vodafone Pursues a German Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Amid growing interest in European cable and telecommunications by investors, the British wireless firm Vodafone started acquisition talks with the German cable operator Kabel Deutschland. 

 BODY:
The British wireless giant Vodafone has approached Kabel Deutschland of Germany over a potential takeover that could be worth more than $10 billion, DealBook's Mark Scott reports. An acquisition would allow Vodafone, which owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless, to expand its cellphone operations in Germany and offset increasing competition.
"Kabel Deutschland does not just represent an opportunity for Vodafone to extract synergies but also to better defend its core business," telecommunications analysts at Espirito Santo in London told investors in a research note on Wednesday. The potential acquisition would be Vodafone's largest since it bought a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar of India for $11 billion in 2007, Mr. Scott writes.
THE END OF LOW RATES | Interest rates may have reached a bottom, Nathaniel Popper and Peter Eavis write in DealBook. It has been a fact of life since the early 1980s that the rate charged by lenders has gone down, reaching historic lows after the financial crisis with the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures. But over the last few months, investors and banks have been demanding higher payments for their loans, pushing up interest rates and bond yields. The cost of mortgages has been going up in recent weeks, and governments are now facing the prospect of higher borrowing costs down the road. 
The first tremors were felt in products reliant on low rates, like bonds issued by American companies, but the movement is spreading more broadly. Global markets in bonds, currencies and stocks have experienced spasms of turmoil. "I think you all should be ready, because rates are going to go up," Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told a financial industry conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday.
Recent economic reports suggest the economy is slowly recovering, leading many on Wall Street to prepare for the Federal Reserve to pare its stimulus program. If rates continue rising, a wide array of market participants will have to shift their assumptions. "When past performance has been so consistent, the risk that investors underestimate the risk, I think has consistently been an issue," said Richard G. Ketchum, president of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF THE JOBS ACT | The Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act was supposed to help revive new company offerings. Now, more than a year after the legislation was passed, the market for I.P.O.'s is indeed heating up, but the JOBS Act "has had little to do with it," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column.
Take the recent I.P.O. of the upscale grocer Fairway Group Holding. "Fairway's selective use of the JOBS Act shows that it is being used to avoid disclosure of information that may cause embarrassment to the company or alert investors of problems. But at the same time, it shows that the law may have allowed companies to get away with not disclosing financial information that investors value," Mr. Davidoff writes. "None of this has anything to do with whether Fairway would have gone public."
ON THE AGENDA | Coty is expected to price its initial public offering Wednesday evening. H&R Block reports earnings after the market closes. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen is on CNBC at 8 a.m. John Thain, head of the CIT Group, is on Bloomberg TV at 11 a.m.
REGULATOR SAYS INSURERS INFLATING BOOKS | "New York State regulators are calling for a nationwide moratorium on transactions that life insurers are using to alter their books by billions of dollars, saying that the deals put policyholders at risk and could lead to another taxpayer bailout," Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook. "Insurers' use of the secretive transactions has become widespread, nearly doubling over the last five years. The deals now affect life insurance policies worth trillions of dollars, according to an analysis done for The New York Times by SNL Financial, a research and data firm."
"Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services, said that life insurers based in New York had alone burnished their books by $48 billion, using what he called 'shadow insurance,' according to an investigation conducted by his department. He issued a report about the investigation late Tuesday. The transactions are so opaque that Mr. Lawsky said it took his team of investigators nearly a year to follow the paper trail, even though they had the power to subpoena documents."

HEADLINE: Goldman Sachs to Finance Early Education Program

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Through an experimental method of financing social services, the bank is lending up to $4.6 million for a preschool program in Salt Lake City. 

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs is making its second foray into an experimental method of financing social services, lending up to $4.6 million for a childhood education program in Salt Lake City.
This "social impact bond," in which Goldman stands to make money if the program is successful but will lose its investment if it fails, will support a preschool program intended to reduce the need for special education and remedial services. The upshot, in theory, is that taxpayers will not have to bear the upfront cost of the program.
Goldman is being joined in this effort by the Chicago investor J.B. Pritzker, who is providing a subordinate loan of up to $2.4 million, bringing the total financing to $7 million. The loans will be announced at an event in Chicago on Thursday. 
"Social impact bonds are an entirely new way of financing things that have traditionally been paid for either through philanthropy or by taxpayer dollars," said Alicia Glen, head of Goldman's urban investment group.
Though the effectiveness of this type of financing remains unproved, it has gained a prominent adherent in New York City, which allowed Goldman to invest nearly $10 million in a jail program last year. The city was the first in the United States to test social impact bonds.
For Goldman, which could gain a public-relations benefit from the investment, Salt Lake City has become an important business center. The city is home to Goldman's second-largest office in the United States, and the Wall Street firm held its annual meeting there in May.
The loans are going to the United Way of Salt Lake, which oversees the Utah High Quality Preschool Program. The investment's success will be measured by the level of cost savings when children do not need to use special education services, which are financed by the state.
The loans carry an interest rate of 5 percent, which is paid along with the principal if the program is successful. In the best case, Goldman and Mr. Pritzker would make additional "success fees."
"We're creating something sustainable that has a focus on returns," Mr. Prtizker said. "This titillates my interest in business and engages me."
This type of financing, which was first used in Britain in 2010, has raised eyebrows. Data on the New York investment, focused on men incarcerated at Rikers Island, is not yet available.
"I think it's distressing the degree to which a new industry has been built around social impact bonds before it's ever been proven viable," said Mark Rosenman, a professor emeritus at Union Institute and University in Cincinnati. "We ought to work it to fruition in a couple places before we start promoting it."
Still, governments around the country are beginning to embrace social impact bonds. Six state and local governments were chosen this week by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Harvard Kennedy School's social impact bond technical assistance lab to receive help in developing such programs after 28 governments applied.
Janis Dubno, a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Voices for Utah Children, who came up with the idea for the Salt Lake City transaction, said the intention was to shift "resources from remediation to prevention."
The deal is "a proof-of-concept transaction," Ms. Dubno, a former investment banker, said. "What we would like to do is demonstrate that this kind of structure can be put into place."

HEADLINE: Dark Money Politics

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: How corrupt are we willing to allow our campaign finance system to become? 

 BODY:
In the world of nonprofit "dark money" groups, nothing is as it seems: political committees, through the magic of the internal revenue code, become tax-exempt "social welfare" organizations; a partisan campaign ad becomes principled "issue advocacy"; and federal election law that requires public disclosure of donors is rendered toothless by regulatory loopholes.
The flow of cash through organizations asserting tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code has been rising exponentially, from just $5.2 million in 2006 to $310.8 million in 2012.
There is one reason for this growth: 501(c)(4) groups do not have to reveal their donors. 
Two pie charts - Figure 1 and Figure 2 - drawn up by the Center for Responsive Politics demonstrate the crucial role of conservative non-profits in driving this increase in spending.
The Center, which has dug deeply into this submerged area of American politics, has gathered a lot of the relevant data about the influence of money on American politics at OpenSecrets.org. It makes for instructive reading.
The controversy over the revelation that organizations whose names include the words "Tea Party" were targeted by the I.R.S. for review has provided new cover for politically active conservative organizations, allowing them to charge that investigations of the legitimacy of their tax-exempt status are politically motivated. Many of these groups have, in fact, been explicitly involved in federal election campaigns, as reported upon by The New York Times and Politico.
Sheila Krumholz, the Center's executive director, told me that despite the denials coming from conservative non-profits her organization has found increasing evidence of practices designed to evade I.R.S. rules governing tax-exempt status and donor disclosure.
The actual I.R.S. rule is worth examining closely:
The promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. However, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization may engage in some political activities, so long as that is not its primary activity. However, any expenditure it makes for political activities may be subject to tax under section 527(f).
The phrase "not its primary activity" has been interpreted by campaign finance lawyers to mean that a 501(c)(4) organization can spend no more that 49.9% of its money on political activity, according to Krumholz.
In a process she refers to as "money churning," a hypothetical tax-exempt organization, let's call it the Good Government Coalition, has $10 million in revenues. The G.G.C. fulfills its obligation to spend just over half its money on non-political activity by giving $5 million plus $1 to another tax-exempt social welfare organization with an ambiguous name, the Liberty Bell Alliance. G.G.C. can now spend what it has left, $4,999,999 on political activity. The Liberty Bell Alliance, which now has $5 million plus $1, can spend just under half, $2,499,999, on political activity. The net result is that of the original $10 million, instead of only $4,999,999 going to political activity, $7,499,998, or 75 percent of the original $10 million, can be spent on politics.
Your eyes glaze over trying to follow money trail between organizations with names like TC4 Trust, the Center for the Protection of Patients' Rights, Americans for Job Security, American Future Fund and American Commitment - not to mention the difficulty for a layperson, or even for a political professional, of keeping track of the differences between 501(c)(4)s, 501(c)(3)s, super PACs, Political Action Committees, independent expenditure groups, and political party committees - or God forbid 501(c)(6)s.
Let's look at just one "social welfare" 501(c)(4) organization, the 60 Plus Association. The purpose of 60 Plus is to serve as a conservative counter to the A.A.R.P., which many Republicans believe to be a subsidiary of the Democratic Party.
60 Plus claims to be "a non-partisan seniors advocacy group." Nonpartisanship is crucial for an organization seeking to get and maintain 501(c)(4) tax exempt status as a social welfare organization, which confers the magic right to conceal the identity of donors.
Generously interpreting the 49.9 percent guideline covering political activity, 60 Plus has pushed the non-partisanship rule beyond the limit. Its web site features items like these: "Shameful Democrats Rush to Defense of Their I.R.S. Political Partners"; "House Votes to Repeal Obamacare as Democrats Stand by Corrupt I.R.S."; "Seniors Overwhelming Support for Romney Could Spell Trouble for Democrats Nationally"; "Democrat Deceptions on Full Display with Paul Ryan Joining GOP Ticket."
James Martin, the chairman of 60 Plus, demonstrated his "nonpartisanship" just before the 2012 election thus:
Senior citizens better than any other group understand how devastating President Obama's policies have been to every generation. They won't sit idly by as he continues to squander our nation's greatness, and liquidate our future under trillions more in debt.
Martin continued in the same vein:
Never forget, America's seniors fought in wars and bled to defend freedom and make this country everything it is today. For four long years we've watched as this President has trampled on everything that defines us as a nation, and now tramples on his opponent, his predecessor and the truth itself in a desperate plea for four more years. Seniors know a great leader when they see one, regardless of party, and this President falls far short of deserving our consideration or our vote.
In the past two elections, 60 Plus has invested heavily in overtly partisan independent expenditures. In 2012, the tax-exempt organization doled out $4.62 million, $3.19 million of which was spent in support of Republicans, with the remaining $1.43 million spent to defeat Democratic candidates for federal office, including $321,933 to defeat Obama.
In the 2010 elections, 60 Plus spent even more money, $6.72 million, almost all of which, $6.67 million, was allocated to defeat Democratic candidates.
60 Plus is one of the major beneficiaries of the recent surge in the investment of conservative money in 501(c)(4) organizations.
In the two years from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009, the organization's annual budgets were a modest $1.89 million and $1.81 million, according to 990 forms filed with the I.R.S. and available through the Guidestar web site. In 2009-10, 60 Plus receipts abruptly rose to $16.01 million, and then to $18.58 million in 2010-11. In 2011-12, the total fell to $11.8 million, which was still 650 percent larger than in 2008-09.
This burst of cash was in part the result of multi-million dollar grants to 60 Plus from two of the other "social welfare" groups I mentioned above, TC4 Trust and the Center for the Protection of Patient Rights. The Center for the Protection of Patient Rights has been the subject of investigations by the Center for Responsive Politics, by the California Fair Political Practices Commission, the web-based Republic Report and the Los Angeles Times.
The L.A. Times reported that Charles and David Koch, the conservative billionaire brothers who own Koch Industries, "have several ties" to the Center for the Protection of Patient Rights:
It is run by Sean Noble, a Phoenix-based GOP consultant who is a key operative in the Kochs' political activities, as noted by the investigative blog Republic Report. One of the center's original directors, Heather Higgins, is chairwoman of the Independent Women's Forum, which has received funding from a Koch-controlled foundation. And Cheryl Hillen, a Connecticut-based consultant who raised $2.6 million for the center, was director of fundraising for the Koch-backed Citizens for a Sound Economy.
The Center for Responsive Politics found that the Center to Protect Patient Rights gave 60 Plus a total of $11.39 million, TC4 Trust gave $4.06 million, and other groups gave smaller amounts, including Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS ($50,000) and the American Petroleum Institute ($25,000).
This year, 60 Plus reported in lobbying disclosure forms that in addition to issues affecting seniors, it is supporting off-shore drilling legislation and a measure to permit online gambling. Past issues it has supported have included opposition to the federal telephone excise tax and to legislation allowing drug imports, as well as support for Arctic drilling and the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
60 Plus has been the subject of a number of attempts to restrain its activities, but it remains undaunted. In July 2012, for example, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission charging that 60 Plus, Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity "are 'political committees' who have failed to register and disclose with the F.E.C." The D.S.C.C. dismissed the organizations' claims of 501(c)(4) status as "spurious" and "risible on their face." The complaint is still pending before the F.E.C.
In July, 2012, well before the current I.R.S. controversy, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, called on the I.R.S. to investigate the political activities of a dozen 501(c)(4)s, including 60 Plus. Levin's list included both Republican and Democratic-leaning 501(c)(4)s: Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, Priorities U.S.A., Americans Elect, American Action Network, Americans for Prosperity, American Future Fund, Americans for Tax Reform, Patriot Majority USA, Club for Growth, Citizens for a Working America Inc. and the Susan B. Anthony List.
60 Plus was not cowed. It is pulling out the stops to capitalize on the controversy regarding the I.R.S. focus on Tea Party groups. In one of his many denunciations of Democrats and the I.R.S., James Martin declared:
The shades of Watergate continue to hover over this scandal. We recall Nixon's defenders dismissed that as a "3rd rate burglary." With new revelations coming out by the day and more I.R.S. employees tucking tail, this disgraceful escapade is making Watergate look like a bad hair day by comparison.
Martin appears to be acting on the premise that the best defense is a good offense. (He did not respond to email or phone requests for comment.) In fact, what the past and present activities of 60 Plus, and of a host of other independent expenditure groups, point to is the need for a thorough rewriting of section 501(c)(4) of the tax code to limit the benefits of tax-exempt status - and of the right to conceal the identity of donors - to legitimate "social welfare" organizations.
The current political activities of large numbers of 501(c) organizations in no way constitute the kind of charitable work for which the public would grant favorable tax status as a reward. One of the reasons the people involved with political nonprofits - operatives and donors alike - love secrecy is that they fear public repercussions if their activities have to be conducted in the open. It is by now abundantly clear that abuse of the 501(c)(4) loophole corrupts and corrodes a campaign-finance system that was hardly a model of rectitude to begin with.

HEADLINE: Goldman Sachs to Finance Early Education Program

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs is making its second foray into an experimental method of financing social services, lending up to $4.6 million for a childhood education program in Salt Lake City.
This ''social impact bond,'' in which Goldman stands to make money if the program is successful but will lose its investment if it fails, will support a preschool program intended to reduce the need for special education and remedial services. The upshot, in theory, is that taxpayers will not have to bear the upfront cost of the program.
Goldman is being joined in this effort by the Chicago investor J.B. Pritzker, who is providing a subordinate loan of up to $2.4 million, bringing the total financing to $7 million. The loans will be announced at an event in Chicago on Thursday. 
''Social impact bonds are an entirely new way of financing things that have traditionally been paid for either through philanthropy or by taxpayer dollars,'' said Alicia Glen, head of Goldman's urban investment group.
Though the effectiveness of this type of financing remains unproved, it has gained a prominent adherent in New York City, which allowed Goldman to invest nearly $10 million in a jail program last year. The city was the first in the United States to test social impact bonds.
For Goldman, which could gain a public-relations benefit from the investment, Salt Lake City has become an important business center. The city is home to Goldman's second-largest office in the United States, and the Wall Street firm held its annual meeting there in May.
The loans are going to the United Way of Salt Lake, which oversees the Utah High Quality Preschool Program. The investment's success will be measured by the level of cost savings when children do not need to use special education services, which are financed by the state.
The loans carry an interest rate of 5 percent, which is paid along with the principal if the program is successful. In the best case, Goldman and Mr. Pritzker would make additional ''success fees.''
''We're creating something sustainable that has a focus on returns,'' Mr. Prtizker said. ''This titillates my interest in business and engages me.''
This type of financing, which was first used in Britain in 2010, has raised eyebrows. Data on the New York investment, focused on men incarcerated at Rikers Island, is not yet available.
''I think it's distressing the degree to which a new industry has been built around social impact bonds before it's ever been proven viable,'' said Mark Rosenman, a professor emeritus at Union Institute and University in Cincinnati. ''We ought to work it to fruition in a couple places before we start promoting it.''
Still, governments around the country are beginning to embrace social impact bonds. Six state and local governments were chosen this week by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Harvard Kennedy School's social impact bond technical assistance lab to receive help in developing such programs after 28 governments applied.
Janis Dubno, a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Voices for Utah Children, who came up with the idea for the Salt Lake City transaction, said the intention was to shift ''resources from remediation to prevention.''
The deal is ''a proof-of-concept transaction,'' Ms. Dubno, a former investment banker, said. ''What we would like to do is demonstrate that this kind of structure can be put into place.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Whites, More Deaths Than Births, Data Shows

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Deaths exceeded births among non-Hispanic white Americans for the first time in at least a century, according to new census data, a benchmark that heralds profound demographic change.
The disparity was tiny -- only about 12,000 -- and was more than made up by a gain of 188,000 as a result of immigration from abroad. But the decrease for the year ending July 1, 2012, coupled with the fact that a majority of births in the United States are now to Hispanic, black and Asian mothers, is further evidence that white Americans will become a minority nationwide within about three decades.
Over all, the number of non-Hispanic white Americans is expected to begin declining by the end of this decade. 
''These new census estimates are an early signal alerting us to the impending decline in the white population that will characterize most of the 21st century,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution.
The transition will mean that ''today's racial and ethnic minorities will no longer be dependent on older whites for their economic well-being,'' Dr. Frey said. In fact, the situation may be reversed. ''It makes more vivid than ever the fact that we will be reliant on younger minorities and immigrants for our future demographic and economic growth,'' he said.
The viability of programs like Social Security and Medicare, Dr. Frey said, ''will be reliant on the success of waves of young Hispanics, Asians and blacks who will become the bulwark of our labor force.'' The issues of minorities, he added, ''will hold greater sway than ever before.''
In 2010, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, more non-Hispanic whites died than were born in 11 states, including California, Florida and Pennsylvania. White deaths exceeded births in a majority of counties, including Los Angeles, the most populous.
The disparity between deaths and births in the year that ended last July surprised experts. They expected that the aging white population would eventually shrink, as it has done in many European countries, but not for another decade or so.
Nationally, said Kenneth M. Johnson, the senior demographer at the Carsey Institute, a research center based at the University of New Hampshire, ''the onset of natural decrease between 2011 and 2012 was not anticipated.'' He attributed the precipitous shift in part to the recession, adding that ''the growing number of older non-Hispanic whites, which will accelerate rapidly as the baby boom ages, guarantees that non-Hispanic white natural decrease will be a significant part of the nation's demographic future.''
Professor Johnson said there were 320,000 more births than deaths among non-Hispanic whites in the year beginning July 2006, just before the recession. From 2010 to 2011, the natural increase among non-Hispanic whites had shrunk to 29,000.
Census Bureau estimates indicate that there were 1.9 million non-Hispanic white births in the year ending July 1, 2012, compared with 2.3 million from July 2006 to 2007 during the economic boom, a 13.3 percent decline. Non-Hispanic white deaths increased only modestly during the same period, by 1.6 percent.
The census population estimates released Thursday also affirmed that Asians were the fastest-growing major ethnic or racial group. Their ranks grew by 2.9 percent, or 530,000, with immigration from overseas accounting for 60 percent of that growth.
The Hispanic population grew by 2.2 percent, or more than 1.1 million, the most of any group, with 76 percent resulting from natural increase.
The non-Hispanic white population expanded by only 175,000, or 0.09 percent, and blacks by 559,000, or 1.3 percent.
The median age rose to 37.5 from 37.3, but the median declined in Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, North Dakota and Oklahoma. It ranged from 64.8 in Sumter, Fla., to 23 in Madison, Idaho.
The number of centenarians nationally neared 62,000.

HEADLINE: A Sharp Rise In Americans With Degrees

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans graduating from college has surged in recent years, sending the share with a college degree to a new high, federal data shows.
The surge follows more than two decades of slow growth in college completion, which caused the United States to fall behind other countries and led politicians from both parties, including President Obama, to raise alarms.
Last year, 33.5 percent of Americans ages 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor's degree, compared with 24.7 percent in 1995, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. In 1975, the share was 21.9 percent. The number of two-year college degrees, master's degrees and doctorates has also risen recently.
The increases appear to be driven both by a sharp rise in college enrollment and by an improvement among colleges in graduating students. The trends could bring good news in future years, economists say, as more Americans become qualified for higher-paying jobs as the economy recovers. 
College attendance has increased in the past decade partly because of the new types of jobs that have been created in the digital age, which have increased the wage gap between degree holders and everyone else. The recent recession, which pushed more workers of all ages to take shelter on college campuses while the job market was poor, has also played a role.
''Basically, I was just barely getting by, and I didn't like my job, and I wanted to do something that wasn't living dollar to dollar,'' said Sarah O'Doherty, 24, a former nail salon receptionist who will graduate next month from the County College of Morris in New Jersey with a degree in respiratory therapy. ''After I had my son, I wanted to do something I felt passionate about, to have a career.''
The attainment of bachelor's degrees has risen much faster for young women in the past decade than for young men. It has also risen among young whites, blacks and Hispanics, though relatively little among Asians, who already had the highest rate of college completion. The share of people with a college degree also varies tremendously by state, with 48.1 percent of people ages 25 to 34 in Massachusetts holding a bachelor's degree, but just 20.4 percent in Nevada, according to the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, a research and development center founded to improve management at colleges.
Despite the recent improvement, higher education experts emphasized that college completion rates were still distressingly low, with only about half of first-time college freshmen who enrolled in 2006 having graduated by 2012, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.
''There are worrisome signs that the demand for high-skilled talent is increasing more rapidly than we're actually educating people,'' said Jamie P. Merisotis, the chief executive of the Lumina Foundation, an Indianapolis group that focuses on higher education, which is releasing a report on Thursday analyzing the federal data. ''We can't expect our citizens to meet the demands of the 21st-century economy and society without a 21st-century education.''
The recent jump in college graduation mirrors similar increases in educational attainment during previous severe downturns, economists said.
''It was sort of one of these ironic good things about the Great Depression, that it got all these kids to graduate from high school, which turned out to be really good for workers later on,'' said Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard.
The G.I. Bill then created a second surge in educational investment after World War II, which also helped fuel the postwar economic boom. Of course, in those cases, Professor Goldin said, education was free or very cheap; college today is not.
Cost may be one reason that college completion has not risen nearly as much for low-income students, many of whom take on large amounts of debt and often do not graduate. The share of 24-year-olds from low-income families who hold college degrees has remained relatively flat over the last several decades, according to Tom Mortenson, a higher education policy analyst with Postsecondary Education Opportunity, a newsletter.
Low-income students are less likely to graduate from high school than more affluent students, less likely to enroll in college after high school and less likely to graduate from college after enrolling. Only about 1 out of 10 Americans whose parents were in the lowest income quartile held four-year college degrees by age 24 in 2011; the comparable share for people from the highest quartile was about 7 in 10, according to Mr. Mortenson.
Some of the recent increase in college completion has come among students who enroll in college, or return to it, at older ages, and experts say any future increases will probably need to come among this group as well, given its growth potential.
For-profit colleges -- despite being more expensive and having lower completion rates than other colleges -- are taking in many of these older and lower-income students. Professor Goldin estimates that for-profit colleges account for about one-fifth of the increase in bachelor's degrees over the last decade.
''Community colleges just don't have the money to expand,'' she said. ''At the for-profits, every person who comes there they're making money on, so boy, are they expanding.''
The increase in college degrees is likely to fuel a debate about the wisdom of having so many people flock to college, given high debt levels and stories of unemployed graduates who are stuck on their parents' couches.
Many economists point out that college graduates have fared much better than their less-educated peers and argue that rising educational levels will help the economy in the long run. Since the recession began in December 2007, the number of Americans with bachelor's degrees who have jobs has risen by 9 percent, while employment has fallen for everyone else.
The unemployment rate for graduates of four-year colleges between the ages of 25 and 34 was 3.3 percent in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For high school graduates in the same age group who had not attended college, it was 11.8 percent.
Today's premium for college degrees is caused partly by increasing selectiveness among employers about whom they hire and screening based on education even for positions that do not require higher skills. But jobs themselves have changed, too.
''Think about jobs 15 years ago that didn't need any college education,'' said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education. Many of them now do, she added.
''Maybe you don't need a bachelor's to change bedpans,'' Ms. Baum said, ''but today if you're an auto mechanic, you really have to understand computers and other technical things.''

HEADLINE: Decisions About Marijuana Sales Loom for Colorado Localities

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
AURORA, Colo. -- As Colorado moves closer to issuing temporary regulations on the sale of marijuana, now legal in small quantities here, some cities and towns are not waiting for the new rules to take effect.
More than a dozen municipalities across the state have decided to enact moratoriums on retail marijuana sales, restricting them for now or at least until after the rules are finalized later this year.
Others, unsettled at the prospect of dispensaries within their borders, have banned marijuana sales entirely -- which they are permitted to do under Amendment 64, the 2012 constitutional amendment passed by voters that legalized recreational use of the drug. 
''As we talked to our police department and our building code enforcement people, it didn't seem to be a very logical answer for us,'' said Mayor Tom Norton of Greeley, a conservative farm town north of Denver that banned marijuana sales outright this month. ''It seemed like it had the potential for creating more mischief than what we wanted to put up with.''
Discussions about how marijuana is to be regulated, and how the state will handle a legal drug market, played a central role during Colorado's 2013 legislative session. Meanwhile, communities from Littleton to Vail have taken it upon themselves to ponder the issue publicly.
In the past six months, a task force of lawmakers, representatives of the state's growing marijuana industry and others have wrestled with developing the rules.
Initial regulations, including licensing provisions -- described as ''emergency rules'' by the Colorado Department of Revenue -- will go into effect on July 1. Permanent rules will be drafted later this summer.
Voters will also consider proposed sales and excise taxes on marijuana on the ballot in November. The first license to sell marijuana in Colorado will not be issued until 2014.
But in the meantime, local governments have until October to decide whether they will allow licensed marijuana businesses to start operating in their areas early next year.
Not surprisingly, reactions in Colorado's communities have varied according to whether their citizens supported Amendment 64.
In Denver, where residents overwhelmingly backed the measure and medical marijuana dispensaries line thoroughfares, city councilors have indicated their desire to move forward with marijuana sales.
Smaller communities like Montrose, the seat of Montrose County, where most voters opposed legalization, have chosen to prohibit sales.
Some have opted for a middle ground.
City councilors here in Aurora, for example, voted last week to delay the date when residents could start applying for marijuana business licenses to next May, so that local officials could take more time to devise their own regulations.
''There is another legislative session next year following the ballot issue this fall, which could change everything,'' Mayor Steve Hogan said. ''We're interested in the possibilities related to retail establishments. But we're not going to do anything until next spring.''
According to data compiled by the Colorado Municipal League, nearly three dozen cities and towns have banned retail marijuana sales outright so far, while 25 have passed moratoriums.
But Christian Sederberg, a lawyer with the Amendment 64 campaign, pointed out that many local governments had taken no action and were planning to embrace the new law.
And he said he thought it was more prudent for officials to examine the regulations after they were codified before deciding on a full-scale ban.
''I think opting out before you've seen the regulations on July 1 is premature,'' he said. ''A lot of these officials don't understand that there is nothing compelling them to act right now.''
If, after reviewing the final rules, a community opts out, ''then that's something people can live with,'' he added.
Officials in the state's second-largest city, Colorado Springs, will be weighing the issue at a meeting this month.
Voters in El Paso County, where the city is situated, were split down the middle on the question of legalization.
The City Council president, Keith King, said he believed most residents were in favor of a moratorium on marijuana sales until the final rules and taxes were fully in place.
''For us, we're making sure our approach doesn't hurt the military bases here and doesn't hurt the economy,'' Mr. King said. ''We'll be very deliberative on this and take our time, no matter which way we go.''

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The government is predicting record corn and soybean yields this year despite intense spring showers that have delayed planting, damaged crops already in the ground and prevented farmers from sowing all of their seeds. But the projections are based on estimates made before the heavy rains came about how many acres of crops will be planted. 
The Department of Agriculture, in a report released on Wednesday, estimated that 14 billion bushels of corn will be produced this year, a forecast that, if it holds true, would crush the previous record of 13.1 billion set four years ago. The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report also forecast that a record 3.39 billion bushels of soybeans would be harvested.
The projections assume that 97.3 million acres of corn and 77.1 million acres of soybeans will be planted this year -- estimates that the department gathered during a survey of farmers this year. Analysts expect that fewer acres will actually be planted. The department will conduct another survey this month and release more accurate planting numbers at the end of the month.
''The projections are still highly tentative,'' Joseph W. Glauber, the U.S.D.A.'s chief economist, wrote in an e-mail.
As of Monday, about 4.5 million acres of corn and 22 million acres of soybeans remained unplanted, according to Christopher A. Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University. By this time last year, all of the nation's corn crop had already been planted.
Record rainfall and flooding across vast swaths of the Farm Belt this spring mucked up fields, keeping many farmers from getting out with their heavy farm equipment to sow crops. Many reported that they planted their corn about a month later than usual this spring, and some said they had yet to plant any of their soybeans.
The late planting of corn could hurt the crops' health because they may not pollinate until late July or August, when temperatures are typically at their peak. Hot weather thwarts the pollination process, which could prevent corn plants from producing their normal yields. Had the corn been planted on time, the pollination would have occurred earlier in the summer, when temperatures are not usually as high.
Because of the late planting, the U.S.D.A. did reduce its forecast for corn production by 135 million bushels from last month's report. Still, agriculture experts say they expect the production numbers to come down even more.
''Anybody around the Midwest knows those numbers, they're not right,'' Professor Hurt said.
But even a moderate decrease in the U.S.D.A.'s current projections would still mean a much more bountiful crop than last year, when one of the most widespread droughts in the nation's history led to a harvest of about 10.8 billion bushels.
Last year's poor production leaves a lot of room for improvement this year, which could translate into an ease on commodity prices.
''It still looks like a reasonable crop,'' Professor Hurt said. ''That's going to keep us from having extraordinarily high prices, as we had from the 2012 crop. This is going to be beneficial in terms of our basic food supplies and our basic inflation in our food.''

11:40 a.m. | Updated
One of India's largest tire makers, Apollo Tyres, announced a deal on Wednesday to acquire the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company for $2.5 billion in cash. 
The acquisition would give Apollo a major foothold in the United States, the world's second-largest auto market after China. Cooper, which focuses on passenger and light- and medium-truck replacement tires, is the fourth-largest tire maker in North America. Its brands include Cooper, Mastercraft, Starfire, Chengshan, Roadmaster and Avon.
It would be the second-biggest acquisition of an American company by a buyer in India, according to Thomson Reuters data, topped only by the $5.8 billion deal (including debt) for aluminum producer Novelis by Mumbai-based Hindalco Industries in 2007.
Under the terms of the deal, Cooper shareholders will receive $35 a share in cash -- a 42.5 percent premium to its closing stock price on Tuesday and a 40 percent premium to Cooper's 30-day volume-weighted average price. The Economic Times of India reported in October that the two companies were near a deal.
In late morning trading on Wednesday,, shares of Cooper were up more than 40 percent, at $34.54.
The combined company will be the seventh-largest tire company in the world, with $6.6 billion in total sales.
''This transformational transaction provides an unprecedented opportunity to serve customers across a host of geographies in both developed and fast-growing emerging markets around the world,'' Onkar S. Kanwar, chairman of Apollo, said in a statement.
Cooper, based in Findlay, Ohio, has its origins in a business founded in 1914. As of the end of last year, it employed 13,550 worldwide. The company said it would continue to recognize its labor unions and honor the terms of collective bargaining agreements.
Apollo, based in Gurgaon, India, near Delhi, was founded in 1972. It has plants in India, the Netherlands and South Africa.
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Amarchand & Mangaldas & Suresh A. Shroff & Company advised Apollo. The investment firm Greater Pacific Capital acted as strategic and financial adviser to Apollo.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firm Jones Day advised Cooper.

HEADLINE: Overhaul Efforts Reflect Few Lessons of Housing Crisis

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Nearly five years after the government took over the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Congress is slouching toward remaking how Americans buy homes.
Gingerly, Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, have been working up a bill. Yet it's striking how much the process is being dominated by emotional battles and financial interests.
In the right corner -- politically as well as figuratively -- we have the contingent that despises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These people continue, against the evidence, to consider them the central cause of the financial crisis. Their preferred solution is to wipe these companies from the earth and somehow get the government out of housing. The hope is that a thousand flowers will bloom on their graves, as private investors rush in to finance mortgages. 
In the left corner -- politically speaking, we are talking left of center -- is a group of financiers that favors a plan to bring back Fannie and Freddie. The argument, forwarded by the banker James E. Millstein, who served as the chief restructuring officer in President Obama's Treasury Department, is that they can be fixed.
Investors like the hedge fund manager John Paulson and Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management have embraced this idea, contending that Fannie and Freddie can pay back taxpayers, be recapitalized and live again. Not incidentally, they could profit handsomely if this works, as they have bought up positions in Fannie and Freddie. It's a time-honored strategy: make one Wall Street investment and then make a second investment in some Washington lobbying to protect the first.
The Corker-Warner plan creates a government insurance operation, similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that would insure mortgage-backed securities. Private investors would have to shoulder the first losses, probably about 10 percent. Taxpayers would not have to bail out those investors should things go south.
It's an appealing notion and the plan has commendable aspects. But if the system worked as advertised, it could make the next housing crisis worse.
To understand why, we should revisit what we have learned about the American housing and mortgage market.
First, we learned that the housing market is so central to people's wealth and the economy that the government will try to save it in a crash. At least Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner's plan grasps that, unlike the most fervent conservatives.
Second, Fannie and Freddie were fatally flawed. They were hybrids, privately held institutions with government charters -- along with too much political influence and too little capital. Investors believed they were implicitly guaranteed by the government, and so they were. (Shareholders got hugely diluted, but not wiped out.) The plan tries to solve this by making the insurance explicit and then supposedly cutting off the private players from the government trough.
Neither of the two senators' offices made anyone available for comment. A statement from Mr. Corker's spokesman emphasized the plan's protection for taxpayers; Mr. Warner's added a goal to maintain access to credit.
The Corker-Warner proposal, which borrows ideas from the recent Bipartisan Policy Center proposal and the left-leaning Center for American Progress, depends on getting three things exactly right. Private investors will need to have enough incentive to buy the securities (or, to use the jargon, there will need to be adequate liquidity in the market). These private entities will also need to put up enough money to have enough skin in the game to prevent taxpayers from losing money on the mortgages. On top of that, these firms and insurance companies will need enough capital to prevent taxpayers from having to step in to take over the companies.
There's reason to be skeptical that Congress will succeed in fine-tuning all of this. Unless the new insurance corporation regulates all housing-related investors, they will be subjected to different oversight from different agencies. Typically, businesses will gravitate to the most lenient agency and the one requiring the least capital.
If the Corker-Warner proposal were to go through, the private companies that have pole position would be the private mortgage insurers. The Republican Party has a fondness for this industry, going so far as to blow it a kiss in the party's 2012 platform. Uncomfortably, private mortgage insurers were quietly a major part of the problem after the housing bubble burst. They were woefully undercapitalized and have been operating almost as zombie institutions.
The 10 percent private investor number also poses a concern. It's a satisfyingly high number. But it's a number that will probably create big problems when housing goes into a downturn. Remember the Great National Housing Crash? Private investors fled. Fannie and Freddie needed to step in to provide liquidity. And the real Big Daddy was the Federal Reserve.
Without some mechanism to ease the requirement, the contemplated reform could worsen a panic, not ease one. A Harvard finance professor, David S. Scharfstein, has a proposal that would remedy this, with the government stepping in during a crisis, ramping up its mortgage insurance business only in a downturn when private investors are fleeing.
What's striking is how much we've learned about housing since the crisis that isn't reflected in the overhaul efforts.
We have learned, for example, that the mortgage servicers have been unholy disasters, foreclosing on homeowners incorrectly, fighting principal reduction and dragging their feet on mortgage modifications that would have helped people stay in their homes. One lesson, then, is that separating mortgage servicing from ownership is a bad idea. The banks that kept loans on their books have been more ready to work out loans to keep people in their homes. The current Washington plans don't do much about this.
We've also learned that having an oligopoly of giant banks controlling the mortgage market leads to higher rates. And, because of the enmity toward Fannie and Freddie, we are in danger of turning against the idea that the government has an important role in providing access to credit for those who might not be able to otherwise buy or rent homes.
Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner nod to providing greater access for small banks to compete with the big boys. And it provides a mechanism to provide access to housing for the credit-impaired. But in their fixation with solving Fannie and Freddie, the current Washington efforts give these important issues short shrift.
The work is in the early stages. But the narrowness of the conversation is troubling.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Go Watch The Movie, Then Ponder The Message

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''Don't change your culture. Understand your culture.''
That challenge is delivered as a stern warning to Coumba (Dior Ka), the first member of her rural Senegalese family to be formally educated, in the spare, moving film ''Tall as the Baobab Tree.'' Those words, spoken by Coumba's mother, encapsulate a guiding theme of the 24th edition of the Human Rights Watch Film Festival, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center through June 23 at Lincoln Center and the IFC Center. The festival's director, John Biaggi, describes the theme as the conflict between traditional patriarchal values and human rights.
Conceived as a simple folk tale based on true events and using local, nonprofessional actors, ''Tall as the Baobab Tree'' -- the festival's closing-night selection -- was directed by Jeremy Teicher, an American filmmaker working in the plain neorealist style of Satyajit Ray. It tells the story of Coumba, a smart, defiant teenager torn between her duties to her family and her desire for a better life for herself and Debo, her younger sister. 
When her older brother injures his leg after falling from a baobab tree and is unable to tend the livestock, Coumba is dispatched to take his place. She arranges for a friend to stand in for her while she goes to the city to work as a hotel maid to earn money for his medical bills. Meanwhile her father arranges for 11-year-old Debo to marry a rich, much older man. Coumba and Debo strenuously resist.
The film festival, conceived as a cinematic arm of Human Rights Watch, a nongovernmental research and advocacy organization based in New York, has gained increasing visibility over its lifetime. Last year one of its documentaries, ''The Invisible War,'' sounded the alarm on the plague of sexual assaults in the United States armed forces, which Congress is now addressing. Whether the film directly spurred Congressional action, however, is unclear.
This year 7 of the 20 films being shown address issues related to women's rights. Freida Mock's ''Anita,'' the opening film on Friday in the festival's main slate, is a portrait of Anita Hill that revisits the 1991 Senate hearings around the Supreme Court confirmation of Clarence Thomas, in which Ms. Hill testified that he had sexually harassed her.
Seen in retrospect, the merciless grilling Ms. Hill endured from congressmen, some responding to her testimony with disbelief and contempt, was infuriatingly shortsighted. Unflappably poised and dignified, Ms. Hill, whose testimony helped change the perception of sexual harassment in the workplace, stood her ground. The film examines the personal values of Ms. Hill, the youngest of 13 children. Some of the most moving scenes show her surrounded by her strong, supportive family at the time of her testimony.
''Anita'' is one of two high-profile films to be shown in this year's festival. The other, Mike Lerner and Maxim Pozdorovkin's ''Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer,'' about the tribulations of the insolent radical feminist punk rockers in Russia who incurred with wrath of Vladimir V. Putin, is now being shown on HBO.
Superstition and modern medicine clash in Harry Freeland's documentary ''In the Shadow of the Sun,'' which explores the perilous existence of Tanzania's 170,000 albinos. Some of them have been hunted and dismembered in the belief that a severed limb of an albino will bring riches. The film focuses on Josephat Torner, an albino activist who travels through the country challenging that myth spread by witch doctors. It also follows Vedastus Zangule, an albino teenager and pariah in his village, who looks after his ailing mother. He is unable to attend a protected school for albino children because it is too full, and his daily life is a struggle to avoid harm.
The festival's subthemes include lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights; disability rights; and crises and migration. The centerpiece, Raoul Peck's ''Fatal Assistance,'' is a devastating study of the damage done in Haiti by international aid agencies in the chaotic aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake there. While billions of dollars were squandered, little money was made available to remove debris.
Of the three films that examine human rights in the United States, one of the strongest is ''99% -- The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film,'' which weaves the work of almost 100 filmmakers from around the country into a forceful polemic against economic inequality. Scenes of Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and their offshoots, particularly in Oakland, Calif., create a sense of the movement as a more cohesive and better-organized rebellion than has been widely portrayed. The film suggests that the protests are far from over despite the current lull.
The movie doesn't disguise its left-wing sympathies with the protesters, and it is bolstered by pungent political commentary from talking heads including Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone magazine; the author Naomi Wolf; and Heidi Boghosian, director of the National Lawyers Guild.
Two films, ''The Act of Killing'' from Joshua Oppenheimer, and ''Camp 14 -- Total Control Zone'' from Marc Wiese, contemplate almost unimaginable real-life horrors. In ''The Act of Killing,'' Anwar Congo and Herman Koto, who joined in the mass murder of suspected Communists and others in Indonesia the mid-1960s, gleefully recreate the scenes of their killings for the camera.
Shin Dong-hyuk, the subject of ''Camp 14,'' who was born in a North Korean prison camp and escaped when he was 23, tells his story of forced labor, near starvation and torture. At 14 he was forced to witness the execution of his mother and brother. Profoundly traumatized, he ultimately confesses that he wants to go back to the camp, which is the only place he understands. The only scenes filmed inside the camp consist of amateur footage taken by a former guard who robotically recalls atrocities he committed.
The best of us and the worst of us: The Human Rights Watch Film Festival examines the limits of human behavior with a thoroughness and a hardheaded compassion that challenge us to confront reality in all its extremes and be the wiser for it.
The Human Rights Watch Film Festival runs through June 23 at Lincoln Center and the IFC Center; ff.hrw.org.

HEADLINE: White House Makes Moves To Promote Gun Safety

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Six months after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., and with no major gun legislation on the horizon in Congress, the White House is quietly moving forward on an executive package of gun safety measures.
The package, which includes 23 executive actions announced by President Obama earlier this year, is intended to bolster the nation's database used for background checks and make it harder for criminals and people with mental illnesses to get guns.
Among other things, the executive orders relax health care privacy regulations that some state executives say prevent them from putting the names of those Americans with mental health records into the database. The orders also give states more money to help them add data to the system and compel federal agencies to share more mental health data on workers. The goal is to add thousands of new people into the database -- those with a history of mental illness, for example -- who would not legally be allowed to buy a gun under current law. 
Gun control groups said that they admired the efforts, but that they would never carry the weight of legislation to expand the number of gun buyers who are subjected to the background check system. ''Everything they have done helps,'' said Mark Glaze, the director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ''They are important and significant and will make a big difference, but the biggest reduction in gun violence will come when every American gets a background check.''
This week, families from Newtown visited Capitol Hill to press for new legislation, while B. Todd Jones, Mr. Obama's choice to head the embattled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, endured a testy nomination hearing.
''We've only just finished round one in our fight to get Congress to pass common-sense measures to save lives, and we will continue to join 90 percent of Americans in calling on them to close loopholes in the background check system,'' Denis McDonough, Mr. Obama's White House chief of staff, said Wednesday in an e-mail. ''But in the meantime, we are doing everything in our power without them -- including strengthening the existing background check system.''
The administration's progress enrages some Republicans and the National Rifle Association, which has aggressively fought any changes to gun laws. ''The reason President Obama is using executive actions is to circumvent the will of the people and to bypass Congressional oversight,'' said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the group.
The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS, is a database made up of law enforcement, mental health and other records maintained by the F.B.I. to screen out prohibited firearms purchasers, including people with a record of felonies, those with active domestic violence protection orders lodged against them or those who have been involuntarily committed. The background check database contains more than 10 million active records, but states have been lax in some cases about uploading records to the system, particularly ones related to mental health.
Without an act of Congress, the administration is unable to significantly expand the number of gun buyers who are subject to background checks, nor curb certain types of weapons and clips, both central to Mr. Obama's gun agenda. Those efforts failed in April on the Senate floor and have yet to be revived.
The executive orders also direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin research into gun violence, which administration officials and gun control groups say will help make the case for new gun safety regulations. During the gun debate this past spring on Capitol Hill, there was little available data about the reasons for gun violence, buying patterns and other gun-related public health issues. The reason is that Congress, under pressure from the gun lobby in the 1990s, redirected money that had been allocated for gun research by the C.D.C. and wrote legislation that was interpreted as a ban on government-financed studies of gun violence.
The Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit organization, released a 69-page report this month that recommended research on the characteristics of firearm violence, preventive strategies, gun safety technology and the role of video games and other popular media on gun violence. The Centers for Disease Control is now moving to study some of these areas.
Gun control groups say that the administration's actions are the closest thing they have to rolling back two decades of an expansion in gun rights in both state legislatures and on Capitol Hill. ''The simple act of saying we are no longer going to prohibit agencies from doing basic research on what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands and kill people is a sea change,'' Mr. Glaze said. He also said that states had responded well when they had been given the resources and historically tended to respond well when they faced the risk of losing scarce funds. ''There are a lot of people who are not in the system who should be,'' Mr. Glaze said. Administration officials say that a few states, like Pennsylvania, have already started to increase entries in the database.
''As a group these efforts work in tandem,'' said Sarah Bianchi, the director of economic and domestic policy for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''But among the most important was expanding the background check system. There are different reasons some states don't send all their records: resources, confusion about the law. We wanted to do everything we could to strengthen the system.''
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, expressed dismay at the recent developments. ''President Obama abused his power by imposing his administration's policies through executive action instead of working with Congress and allowing the issue to be debated,'' he said. ''As a strong defender of the Second Amendment, I will continue to oppose the president's attempts to undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms.''
Next week Mr. Biden will speak to gun groups, his first public event on gun control since the failure of the Senate bill.

HEADLINE: Adopting Technology, but Not the Freedoms, of the West

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

 BODY:
BEIJING -- How did China go from being an impoverished nation in the 1970s to challenging the United States' role as the world economic superpower? Cheap labor? Hard work? Authoritarianism? The unleashed hunger of a people determined to prosper?
The authors of a new book, ''Chinese Industrial Espionage,'' say there is another factor: mass technology transfer. Since the mid-1950s, the Chinese government has been transferring the science and technology of the developed world to China via methods that are legal, illegal and ''extralegal'' -- because they are hidden from scrutiny -- while keeping out the democratic system and liberal education that enabled such advances in the first place. 
''We are talking here of an elaborate, comprehensive system for spotting foreign technologies, acquiring them by every means imaginable, and converting them into weapons and competitive goods. There is nothing like it anywhere else in the world,'' write William C. Hannas, James Mulvenon and Anna B. Puglisi, who conduct research for the U.S. government.
Why do it?
One answer is that the cultural and political changes necessary to build a creative and innovative society would endanger the Communist Party's grip on power, the authors said in written answers to questions. By taking from the developed world what it cannot, or will not, produce itself, it benefits from modernization and freedoms elsewhere, while keeping the lid on at home.
''The problem China's leaders face is how to encourage innovation in one sphere while discouraging it in others,'' the authors said. ''Thanks to these transfer programs, they can selectively import novel ideas while avoiding the challenge of political survival in a free society.''
In recent years, the Chinese government has begun encouraging innovation. The authors said it was happening in a limited way, ''in areas where the regime has identified a stake.''
''Pair talent (native or imported) and money with good research facilities and 'borrowing' foreign ideas and it's a potent mix,'' they said.
In a book likely to annoy and please in equal measure, the authors use Chinese-language sources, often from public policy documents, to describe a system that has at its core not the attention-grabbing issue of cyberespionage, but human-based, meticulous, often open-source acquisition that involves multiple actors at all levels of the party and state, and appeals to the patriotism of Chinese abroad.
Who may be annoyed by the book's conclusion that China resorts to unfair methods? Those who believe that '''developed countries' have no right to monopolize 'the world's technology,''' a view regularly expressed in the Chinese news media, the authors write; and Chinese patriots who say they are only bringing back to China what they have created themselves.
Who may be pleased? The ''individuals and companies that invest in original R&D,'' and ''countries that tolerate the strains, and bear the costs, of an open and diverse society in which creativity can flourish,'' since the transfer practices are ''unfair'' to these two groups, the authors say.
Support from Chinese abroad is often channeled through science, technology and business associations in developed countries. While the authors focus on the United States, they write that Europe, Japan, Australia and other nations are equal targets.
The Federation of Chinese Professional Associations in Europe, which is based in Frankfurt, plays a key role, they say.
''From the Baltic coast to the Alps, from the Ural Mountains to the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean, on Europe's vast earth,'' the association says on its Web site, ''is gathered a crowd of yellow-skinned, black-haired people,'' whose ''common ideal is to build a knowledge group of Chinese spanning expertise and subjects to push strongly for China's reform and construction.'' The organization lists 39 member groups in different European countries.
The top post on the site announces the Yangtze River Delta Meeting, an event being organized by the Chinese government for Sept. 9-14.
Following the link leads to a form asking applicants to list the European country they live in, their employer, their research and results, including patents, as well as details of projects they can present. It supplies a list of what the partner ''science innovation parks'' in China are looking for, including new aircraft materials, energy, auto and microchip technologies, cloud computing, pharmaceuticals and high-end medical equipment. All expenses inside China will be covered by the organizers, the Overseas Chinese Affairs offices of Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces and of Shanghai. The goal? ''To serve the country.''
Efforts to contact the organizers by telephone failed. One number was missing a digit, another's voice mail said the recipient was traveling, and a third rang, but no one answered on a holiday in China.
The cultural pattern for this technology acquisition effort reaches back to the 19th century, the authors write. Struggling to respond to the challenge posed by the scientifically powerful West and Japan, some Chinese reformers proposed the idea of ''tiyong.'' ''Ti'' means essence, and ''yong'' means practical use; preserve the essence of Chinese learning but use Western learning to serve China.
In their written answers, the authors said: ''China seems to think it can import or steal foreign technologies and then strip them of their political or social content.''
''While they have been successful thus far in importing information and communication technologies for economic development without threatening the stability of the regime, each new wave of disruptive technologies poses dangerous challenges to the present government,'' they said.
''At the strategic level, the regime believes that it can separate economic liberalization from political liberalization under the so-called 'Tiananmen bargain,' whereby the population trades liberty for continued prosperity,'' referring to the economic and political model that deepened after the suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. ''This also reflects a superficial understanding of the tectonic changes under way,'' they said.

HEADLINE: Public Debut for Coty Raises About $1 Billion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
After trying once before, the cosmetics maker Coty is set to finally become a public company.
The company, whose products include Sally Hansen nail polish and perfumes endorsed by Beyoncé and Katy Perry, priced its initial public offering at $17.50 a share on Wednesday, in the middle of its expected range of $16.50 to $18.50.
The stock sale values the company at about $6.7 billion. 
The offering, which raised just less than $1 billion in proceeds, is one of the three biggest initial offerings in the United States this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital.
With Wednesday's sale, Coty completed an effort it began several years ago with a few detours along the way. Among them was the company's aborted takeover bid last year for a larger rival, Avon Products.
Coty's selling shareholders sought to take advantage of a burgeoning market for stock offerings amid a healthy rise in equity market valuations this year.
The company's owners are also betting on a revival of consumer confidence, with customers increasing their purchases of higher-ticket perfumes and nail polishes. According to a Euromonitor survey cited in Coty's prospectus, the company's main sectors are expected to grow 3 percent to 4 percent a year through 2016.
Coty reported $258.1 million in net income for the nine months ended March 31, up more than fourfold compared with results in the period a year earlier, though its revenue was roughly flat at $3.59 billion.
Founded by a French perfumer 108 years ago, Coty has become a significant player in the global cosmetics market. It already has a strong hold in the perfume market, especially in the realm of licensed fragrances from the likes of Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Chloé.
And through a string of deals for companies like OPI and TJoy of China, it has broadened both its product offerings and its reach. Coty now sells its wares in more than 130 countries, with an increasing emphasis in emerging markets like Brazil and China.
That international push was one of the main drivers behind the company's $10.7 billion bid for Avon last year. Despite being about half the size of its target, Coty argued that it could bring a strong management team to its embattled rival.
Yet despite securing the backing of Berkshire Hathaway, Coty was unable to convince Avon of the merits of a merger and withdrew its takeover bid last spring. Soon afterward, it filed for an initial public offering.
Wednesday's stock sale will finally open the path to an exit for Coty's primary owners, the wealthy Reimann family of Germany. Through its investment vehicle, Joh. A. Benckiser, the family bought the company in 1992 and spearheaded its expansion.
Coty had contemplated going public two years ago but held off because of volatile market conditions.
Coty's other primary shareholders, the investment firms Berkshire Partners and Rhone Capital, will also sell shares in the offering.
The investors will still retain control of Coty even after selling some of their shares, however. Their remaining holdings will be converted into Class B stock, each share of which will carry 10 votes. All told, the three will control nearly 98 percent of the company's voting power after the public offering.
The company's shares will begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol COTY.
Its offering was led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Behind Failure Of Korean Talks, A Long History Of Squabbling

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Plans for what would have been the highest government dialogue between North and South Korea in years -- and hopes for a rapprochement on the divided Korean Peninsula -- collapsed over what appeared to be a minor technical issue: who should lead their delegations to the planned talks.
In the decades-old confrontation between the two Koreas, even a matter of protocol can escalate into a highly delicate struggle over pride. The latest tussle, over the ranks of their chief delegates, was in part an extension of a struggle that has persisted for decades. 
''We must think of the pride of our people,'' Prime Minister Chung Hong-won of South Korea told the National Assembly on Wednesday, explaining what was at stake in the dispute.
During border talks decades ago, the sides took the competition over protocol and appearances to the extreme, with North Korean military officers secretly adding inches to the legs of their chairs so they would look taller than their counterparts across the table from South Korea and the United States.
In those cold-war-era meetings, the sides usually exchanged invectives and retorts. But they also sometimes persisted in silence -- for over 11 hours in one session in 1969 -- challenging the other side to speak first.
In the best-known contest of pride on the divided peninsula, North and South Korea once engaged in a race over which country could raise its national flag higher over the heavily fortified border. That battle was eventually settled with the North beating the South; today, the North's flagpole stands over 500 feet tall, beating the rival South's by roughly 200 feet.
The latest tussle began when the two Koreas agreed to hold government-to-government dialogue in Seoul, to start on Wednesday, but could not agree on who should be their chief delegates.
South Korea said it would send its vice unification minister, Kim Nam-sik, to the meeting as its chief delegate. North Korea said that Mr. Kim was not senior enough and demanded that the South send Mr. Kim's supervisor, the Unification minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, as chief delegate. The South retorted that the proposed chief North Korean delegate -- Kang Ji-yong, director of the secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea -- was already below Mr. Kim ''in status.''
Last-minute negotiations had failed, with each Korea complaining of a bruised ego. On the eve of the talks, North Korea pulled out of the meeting in Seoul, accusing the South of ''an insult,'' South Korean officials said.
South Korean officials said they were still open to dialogue but had no plan to reach out to the North by making a concession over the chief delegate. On Wednesday, Mr. Chung, the South Korean prime minister, said his government had no intention of succumbing to the North's ''humiliating'' demand.
On Thursday, the North issued a statement indicating that it would not seek dialogue for the time being. It said the South's ''impolite and immoral provocative behavior'' convinced the North that it ''has nothing to expect from the talks between the authorities'' of the two countries. Critics accused the South Korean government of ruining a chance to engage the North. The planned talks had raised hopes of a thaw on the peninsula after months of bellicose language, including threats of nuclear war from the North. But South Korean officials said that their firm stance reflected the new approach under President Park Geun-hye, who has emphasized ''principle'' and ''trust'' in relations with the North and vowed to make it respect ''global standards.''
South Korea's frustration deepened after North Korea pulled out its workers from a jointly operated industrial park in April, blaming military tensions.
North Korea, which relies on foreign aid, has belittled South Korea as an American ''puppet,'' often sending relatively low-ranking officials to sit at senior-level talks with the South -- a practice Ms. Park's government said it was determined to break.
''This is a growing pain as we search for a new relationship with the North,'' Mr. Ryoo told reporters in South Korea on Wednesday.
When North Koreans visited Seoul, which rose from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War to become an economic powerhouse, they used to accuse their counterparts of mobilizing cars to impress them. In a famous rejoinder, a South Korean official reportedly said, ''Yes, we had a hard time mobilizing all those big buildings, too.''
In recent trips, North Korean delegates pointed to ubiquitous signs in English in Seoul as proof that South Korea had turned into an American colony.

HEADLINE: World Bank Forecasts Slower but Smoother Growth

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The world economy will face slower but less volatile growth in the coming months and years, the World Bank forecast on Wednesday, as dire risks from the financial crisis in Europe fade and emerging economies confront new challenges adapting to softer commodity prices and the prospect of rising interest rates.
''There's a growing recognition that this is not the aftereffect of the crisis,'' Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said in an interview. ''It is a new normal.'' 
All in all, the bank's economists forecast that the global economy will grow about 2.2 percent this year and 3 percent in 2014 in the latest periodic update to its Global Economic Prospects report. That is slightly weaker growth than the World Bank forecast in January.
The report's authors said they expected sluggish growth from high-income countries, with the euro area remaining weak but finally emerging from recession and Japan gaining some momentum from the government's aggressive fiscal and monetary measures after a decade of malaise and stagnation. The bank raised its estimate of 2013 growth for Japan to 1.4 percent from its earlier prediction of 0.8 percent.
The United States is expected to be relatively strong among the world's rich nations. Even so, the World Bank, which is responsible for encouraging development around the globe, anticipates that the American economy will grow only about 2 percent this year, in line with its performance over the last three years.
For emerging economies, conditions vary widely, the report said, but the picture is broadly good. Across large parts of Latin America, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, countries are growing close to their potential capacities, tied to factors like increases in productivity and the working-age population, and should expect little acceleration in the coming years, the report said.
In many cases, that means growing more slowly than during the expansion that preceded the global financial crisis. But those lower levels of growth might be more durable and sustainable, the report's authors said.
Policy makers should focus on their individual domestic challenges, like improving infrastructure, streamlining regulations and rebuilding fiscal buffers that were thinned during the crisis. Officials in some countries, like Thailand and Ethiopia, should remain vigilant for signs of overheating and bubbles, the bank said.
''The slower growth is not really an issue of a big change in the fundamentals,'' Mr. Burns said. ''But the very strong growth in the precrisis period was above capacity, and we're moving into a period where growth is more in line with underlying capacity. That can be a bit of a frustrating thing for developing countries.''
In Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, economies remain fragile and in some cases deeply troubled, the report said. Countries in Eastern and Central Europe, still emerging from the post-Soviet era, in many cases suffer from the same problems as countries in high-income Europe. These include fragile banking sectors, credit problems and large budget deficits. Still, growth should pick up in developing Europe to more than 4 percent in 2015 from about 2.7 percent last year.
The Middle Eastern and North African region continues to struggle with political instability. Growth might pick up as tensions ease, the bank said.
The world economy is undergoing a fundamentally positive realignment, Mr. Burns said, as developing economies become more reliant on themselves and one another for new demand. Now, more than half of developing-country trade occurs with other developing countries, rather than with richer nations like the United States and Japan, the report said. That is up from 37 percent in 2001.
The trend is not just about China, either, the bank emphasized, though it buys 26 percent of its exports from developing countries, compared with 14 percent in 2001. ''Growth of trade between the remaining developing countries has also outpaced trade with high-income countries by a wide margin,'' the report said.
There is a new risk from the United States and other high-income economies, however: the end of extremely accommodating monetary policy. The scaling back of the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, for instance, might lead to higher interest rates around the world, the report noted.
Businesses in many countries have eagerly taken advantage of low rates to embark on major projects relying on longer-term loans, like construction projects. That has created conditions ripe for higher losses from loans that no longer make sense if interest rates rise and demand eases.
''Higher interest rates will increase debt-servicing costs and could increase default rates on existing loans,'' the bank warned. ''Banks in countries that have enjoyed very strong growth and asset-price inflation, together with high levels of government or private sector debt, may be at particular risk.''
There were no obvious signs of risk in specific emerging economies, Mr. Burns said, though conditions seemed to indicate that financial bubbles could be developing. ''We won't know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out,'' Mr. Burns said.
Developing countries also may need to adjust to lower commodity prices as global growth slows in the postcrisis period, bank economists said.
''Over the last four years, developing economies have become very accustomed to high commodity prices related to the real economy,'' said Hans Timmer, the director of the development prospects group at the bank. But higher prices helped increase supply, and demand might slow down. ''We're postcrisis, postrecovery, and we're having new discussions.''

HEADLINE: Conflicting Goals Complicate an Effort To Forge a Trans-Atlantic Trade Deal

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The leaders of the European Union, mired in recession and battered by increasing opposition from voters, are desperate for political success to promote economic growth. They are pushing for a rapid negotiation of a trade agreement with the United States aimed at expanding commerce and creating jobs.
But many experts say any such deal faces long odds.
France has already raised objections about its ''cultural exception,'' which is aimed at protecting subsidized, domestic movies and television programs, and continued to press the issue ahead of a meeting on Friday of the European Union's trade ministers. 
At the same time, there is a range of other, probably more serious problems, including agricultural disputes over things like genetically modified food and chlorinated chicken and regulatory questions about car safety, pharmaceuticals and financial derivatives.
New concerns about widespread American spying on Internet and telephone traffic will make existing disagreements about data privacy, an important issue in Europe, even more fractious.
After initial skepticism from Washington, both sides agreed in March to push for what is known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP. David Cameron, the prime minister of Britain, would like to begin the talks formally at the Group of 8 meeting next Monday and Tuesday, if Paris does not block him over its demand to exclude audiovisual services.
Officials say they hope to conclude a deal by November 2014.
''Done properly, TTIP is a good thing, but there are deeply entrenched interests on both sides of the Atlantic, and they will always fight harder to keep what they have rather than get something new,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings Institution. ''There will be small benefits for a lot of people but big losses in certain sectors, and they'll fight.''
There is ''maybe a 1-in-3 chance TTIP will happen,'' Mr. Elliott said. ''And 1-in-3 is optimistic, but the desire to get some economic growth may overcome some serious political problems.''
Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London, is more optimistic than Mr. Elliott but sees ''a risk the whole thing will get hijacked and there will be so many exemptions and opt-outs that the meaning of the exercise will be limited.''
Particularly from the European perspective, the potential deal is considered strategically important, a way of countering the rising influence of China and India in the global economy. And with the essential failure of the Doha round of the World Trade Organization to realize a trade pact, a United States-European Union deal could lay down regulatory markers for the rest of the world. That is one reason Beijing in particular is wary of TTIP and continues to disparage the European Union as a political entity.
Just last week, when the European Commission decided to put new duties on Chinese solar panels after charges of dumping, China responded harshly. The official People's Daily wrote that ''the change of times and the shifts of power have failed to change the condescending attitude of some Europeans,'' adding that while China does not want a trade war, ''trade protectionism cannot but trigger a counterattack.''
China threatened an antidumping investigation into European wine, which could restrict imports of an increasingly popular product among China's affluent city dwellers.
For a European Union weakened by the euro crisis, the view is taking hold that the best way to compete with Asia's inevitable growth is to forge a stronger partnership with the United States, which has its own anxieties about Chinese competition.
The president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, is pushing for the pact. ''I believe that the E.U.-U.S. trade negotiations are a game changer and can be the start of a new era,'' he said recently. ''They will further intensify the economic relationship between the United States and European Union, two economic giants eager to be as successful in the future as they were in the past.''
Even as China is rising, the countries of the European Union and the United States still account for more than 40 percent of world gross domestic product and almost a third of global trade. Two-way trade between the United States and the European Union's 27 member countries reached $646 billion in 2012, higher than American bilateral trade with China. United States two-way trade with France was $72 billion last year; with Britain, $110 billion; and with Germany, $157 billion.
United States investment in Europe is three times larger than that in Asia; European Union investment in America is eight times larger than in India and China put together.
Secretary of State John F. Kerry put the stakes bluntly in April. ''If we agree on the rules of the road about data transmission and privacy,'' he said, ''if we can bring our regulations regarding safety and other kinds of things together,'' then ''we will have established a huge number of goods and products being produced according to a set of standards. And others who want to get into that are going to have to raise their game.''
He noted that the United States was trying to negotiate a similar deal, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with Asian countries and especially with Japan. China is not included in those negotiations, which the Obama administration considers a higher, more immediate priority than the European talks.
Given already low average tariffs (under 3 percent), the main problems are nontariff barriers, things like differing customs and regulatory requirements. The United States and Europe have different auto-safety requirements, for example, and not all American states have the same ones. They differ on how to ensure the safety of chicken -- the Europeans do not allow the import of American chicken that has been chlorinated to kill bacteria. They differ on the safety of genetically modified grains and foods.
In general, said Mr. Elliott of Brookings, European regulators ''have a more cautionary approach than Americans, and they have to prove safety rather than disprove arguments about why something is unsafe.'' American regulators generally require scientific evidence that something is unsafe; the Europeans are more precautionary.
Tariffs and agricultural subsidies are monetary figures that can be negotiated. ''But safety is qualitative and cultural,'' he said. ''On both sides we have strong views about how to do things, and we can get very entrenched.''
Other major issues will include the regulation of derivatives and some other financial products, and whether foreign and multinational banks must operate in America as if they are United States banks. The fight over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing will no doubt come up, and there are questions about whether the Senate will agree to a separate vote on agriculture, as the United States farm lobby wants.
Within Europe, divisions remain over what to put on the table. Belgium appears to be lining up with France in favoring support for homegrown movies and television production in the name of cultural diversity. Hungary and Greece could back Paris as well.
A core issue for France and its allies is ''control of the digital space and the implications of the evolution of the digital economy for culture,'' said a senior European Union diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid disrupting the internal negotiations. ''The reality is that the global market is currently dominated by U.S. operators,'' citing companies like Google, Apple and Netflix, ''and that is why it is such a sensitive issue.''
But most other trade officials want to widen the scope of the talks to keep as many bargaining chips as possible. They want to give the European Commission a free hand to negotiate with Washington in hopes of opening up protected American sectors like transporting goods along the United States coast and government procurement markets at both federal and state levels.
Mr. Barroso would like the negotiations to finish before a new European Commission is chosen in late 2014. But a final deal could take years, which undercuts some of the urgent European support, founded on benefits, even if relatively modest, for economic growth and jobs.
A senior American official based in Europe said that ''the stars were aligned'' for a deal because both economies ''are struggling for growth.'' Still, he said, ''U.S. regulators are deeply skeptical.''
Mircea Geoana, former Romanian foreign minister and ambassador to Washington, perhaps put the inside view best. ''Strategically, we need it like air, to keep America and Europe together,'' he said. ''Practically, it's going to be very difficult.''

HEADLINE: Pollution Rules Delayed As White House Slows The Process of Reviews

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House has blocked several Department of Energy regulations that would require appliances, lighting and buildings to use less energy and create less global-warming pollution, as part of a broader slowdown of new antipollution rules issued by the Obama administration.
The administration has spent as long as two years reviewing some of the energy efficiency rules proposed by the Energy Department, bypassing a 1993 executive order that in most instances requires the White House to act on proposed regulations within 90 days. Regulatory review times at the White House Office of Management and Budget are now the longest in 20 years, having spiked sharply since 2011.
With some Congressional Democrats and environmental advocates criticizing the delays, President Obama's nominee to direct the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs said at his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that his first priority would be to speed the agency's review process.
The nominee, Howard A. Shelanski, who is now the top economist at the Federal Trade Commission, said at the confirmation hearing that he would try ''to ensure that regulatory review at OIRA occurs in as timely a manner as possible.'' His comments were an acknowledgment that the backlog is frustrating presidential policy and failing to meet the deadlines in the executive order under which regulations are reviewed. 
The proposed rules would require that refrigerators, light bulbs and electrical equipment use less energy, much as the Obama administration in its first term required automakers to commit to make cars more energy efficient.
With a sweeping climate bill having died in the Senate in Mr. Obama's first term, his only options for major action on the issue in the second term appear to involve executive action. In one of the signature moments of his 2013 State of the Union address, he vowed that if Congress failed to act on energy and climate change, he would use his executive powers to do so.
While Republicans continue to criticize the administration for what they call regulatory overkill, environmental advocates and some Democrats outside the administration argue that Mr. Obama has not made good on his recent promises and has failed to show enough urgency about climate change.
''The president has pledged if Congress won't act on climate change, he will,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who along with five other Democrats wrote to the administration's new budget director, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, last week to complain about the regulatory delays. ''If he is going to keep that promise, he's going to have to have O.M.B. move with a lot more clarity and alacrity,'' Mr. Whitehouse added, using an abbreviation for the budget office.
The slowdown stems from a combination of factors, including high-level vacancies and election-year politics. Analysts and former administration officials said the White House, sensitive to Republican charges that it was threatening the economy by pushing out dozens of so-called job-killing regulations, reined in the process last year, leaving many major rules awaiting action for months beyond legal deadlines.
Some administration officials are also concerned that regulations have the potential to do more harm than good. ''If we make refrigerators lousy, that's a big problem,'' Cass R. Sunstein wrote in ''Simpler: The Future of Government,'' a book published this year about his time running the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a small unit of the budget office responsible for reviewing regulations
If confirmed, Mr. Shelanski will take over the unit.
The administration's concerns about the cost of regulations are especially acute at a time when unemployment remains high.
''The administration seeks to maintain a balance between our obligation to protect the health, welfare and safety of Americans and our commitment to promoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness and innovation,'' Ms. Burwell wrote in response to Mr. Whitehouse.
She did not address why the pace of rule making had slowed so sharply in 2012 and 2013, or why the energy efficiency rules were held up. White House officials have said energy efficiency rules issued in Mr. Obama's first term would yield $400 billion in consumer savings and reduce carbon emissions by hundreds of millions of tons through 2030.
The White House acknowledged that the pace of rule making slowed last year, but noted that it had issued major rules on power plant emissions and vehicle fuel economy in late 2011 and 2012. The administration calculates the net economic and health benefits of those two rules at $64 billion a year.
One example of a delayed rule is an Energy Department proposal to mandate greater energy efficiency for walk-in coolers and freezers, which are common at many restaurants, supermarkets and warehouses. The measure has been awaiting action from the White House regulatory review office since September 2011.
The delay has added more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, according to calculations by two independent watchdog groups. The groups, the Appliance Standards Awareness Project and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said that each month of delay for the stalled efficiency rules creates pollution equivalent to burning 19,000 rail cars of coal.
Apart from the political battles over whether the government does too much or too little environmental regulation, there is no dispute that rule making has slowed sharply since 2011.
Federal records show that the Obama administration issued rules in its first three years at a pace similar to that of previous administrations.
But in 2012 -- an election year in which the economy was the focus -- the number of rules issued dropped to 424, the lowest number since the review process began in 1993. In the first three years of Mr. Obama's presidency, the administration issued an average of 675 rules.
The amount of time each proposed rule spends under review has also spiked, to 79 days last year and 141 days so far this year. The average review time over the previous 18 years was 50 days.
Mr. Sunstein, who directed the regulatory affairs office from 2009 until last August, hinted at the reasons for the slowdown in a recent Harvard Law Review article and in ''Simpler,'' both of which describe his philosophy of regulation.
He said that a number of other White House offices, from the National Economic Council to the office of the vice president, often weighed in on proposed rules and sometimes disagreed. He added that some rules present difficult questions of costs and benefits.
''We need to know whether the new, energy-efficient refrigerators are as good as the current ones,'' Mr. Sunstein wrote in his book. ''If they don't refrigerate as well, then the rule is imposing a separate cost, and we need to consider that cost in our assessment.''
Lisa Heinzerling, a professor of law at Georgetown University and a former top Environmental Protection Agency official who tangled with Mr. Sunstein over a number of environmental regulations in Mr. Obama's first term, said in a recent article that such demands for detailed analysis become ''a regulatory game of Whac-A-Mole: every time the agency meets one demand for a piece of information about the costs or benefits of a rule, it finds itself met with a new and different demand.''
She said the decision of how quickly to move now rested with Mr. Obama. ''The cabinet does not need a presidential directive telling the agencies to do their work,'' she said, ''rather, it needs presidential support for the work they are trying to do.''

Wary of the raucous street demonstrations that erupted during the last election in 2009, the Iranian government decreed that this year's presidential campaign would consist of rallies in predetermined spaces and a series of tedious, four-hour debates that many Iranians dismissed as more like a pointless quiz show than a discussion of real issues. Thomas Erdbrink reports.
For years it has been an open secret in Rome: That some prelates in the Vatican hierarchy are gay. But the whispers were amplified this week when Pope Francis himself, in a private audience, appears to have acknowledged what he called a "gay lobby" operating inside the Vatican, vying for power and influence. Rachel Donadio reports.

HEADLINE: Indian Tire Maker's Shares Tumble Over Deal for Cooper

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Shares of Apollo Tyres plunged more than 25 percent in India on news of its proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of Cooper Tire and Rubber over concerns about the amount of debt it was taking on. 

 BODY:
The proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of Cooper Tire and Rubber by Apollo Tyres speaks to the ambitions of an Indian company seeking to become the seventh-biggest tire maker in the world. 
It would be the biggest takeover of a United States company by one based in India since the global financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. And it is a deal intended to help the 41-year-old company compete better in a global automotive supply chain dominated by giants. 
 At home, however, the deal has run into something of a large road bump. 
Shares of Apollo plummeted 25.45 percent in trading in Mumbai on Thursday, their first day of trading after the transaction was announced in the United States on Wednesday. The plunge came amid investor concerns about the amount of debt the company was taking on to finance the deal. 
The all-cash acquisition is being financed entirely by new debt. Apollo has committed debt financing for $450 million from Standard Chartered, and nearly $2.4 billion in committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered.
Analysts in India were scathing about the leveraged deal.
Noting that Apollo's ratio of net debt to equity would go from negative 0.5 times equity to 4.8 times, analysts at IIFL Capital gave the stock a "sell" recommendation. "We highlight that a weakening balance sheet is a key concern," they wrote. 
Analysts at Emkay wrote: "We see this as a risky acquisition as the management would have little room for error given the high leverage, very little synergy benefits and the poor demand environment." 
Analysts at Ambit said they found the proposed acquisition of Cooper "aggressive" even while commending Apollo as "one of the best-managed tire companies in India."
Still, they hastened to add that "over 80 percent of great companies in India self-destruct through a combination of overconfidence and unbridled expansion."

HIGHLIGHT: The Detroit police caught thieves trying to steal hundreds of gallons of gasoline, and Justin Bieber has been spotted driving a leopard-print-covered Audi R8. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 The Detroit police nabbed two men in the act of stealing hundreds of gallons of gasoline from a service station Wednesday. The would-be thieves had rigged up a siphon and pump and were filling a container in the back of their van. The police said they were as concerned about the theft as they were about someone driving on public streets in a fuel-laden vehicle that was not designed to carry flammable liquids. According to a report by The Detroit News, although fuel theft was rare, another Detroit-area service station was robbed of $45,000 of gasoline in 2011. (The Detroit News)
 The racecar driver, Jason Leffler, 37, was killed in a crash Wednesday at Bridgeport Speedway in Swedesboro, N.J. His car flipped several times after leaving the ground in a turn on the dirt oval during the 25-lap Night of Wings sprint car event. Leffler has been racing since he was 12, driving in Nascar races and the Indianapolis 500, in which he finished 17th in 2000. (CNN) 
 According to data released this week by Edmunds.com, this year's car sales boom has been spurred largely by incentives. Edmunds' analysis says that automaker subsidies reached $2,500 per vehicle in May - the highest it's been in two years - and that Detroit's Big Three have been the most willing to pinch profit margins in favor of higher sales volumes. Jeremy Acevedo, an Edmunds analyst, said an industrywide focus on American truck sales drove incentives higher, as trucks were typically more expensive than cars. (Bloomberg)
 Apple's move to make iOS available in more cars and trucks seems to have raised the dander of auto industry executives. The conflict stems over who will control automotive electronics in the future: if Apple's products become more prevalent in connected vehicle technology, automakers will lose control of the infotainment systems that have become defining features of their product lineups. Thilo Koslowski, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, told Automotive News that vehicle manufacturers wanted to maintain that control as automobiles moved deeper into the realm of connected vehicle technology. (Automotive News)
 It's been a while since any groundbreaking innovations have been made in windshield design. When the Ford Motor Company began requiring laminated safety glass in all of its cars in 1919, the rest of the industry followed over the years, and it has been standard practice for many decades. But Corning has a new type of glass: Gorilla Glass. Already in use in billions of electronic devices, Corning said its lightweight glass could help fuel economy by reducing a car's weight. (M.I.T. Technology Review)

 If you have all the money in the world (relatively speaking), then you can decorate expensive cars as you see fit, right? That is apparently Justin Bieber's mantra where cars are concerned. Already known for his chrome-wrapped Fisker Karma, the pop star has been seen cruising around Los Angeles in a Leopard print-wrapped Audi R8. Seeing how the more than $100,000 R8 is a very fast car, perhaps Mr. Bieber should have considered having it clad in a Cheetah pattern.

HIGHLIGHT: Some reading to get you through this last soggy week before summer. 

 BODY:
The San Diego Unified School District Board of Education voted to implement meat-free menus on Mondays at some school cafeterias beginning this fall. And after a near-unanimous vote by the Academic Senate of the University of California at San Francisco, over 650,000 meals served to hospital patients each year will no longer contain meat that has been treated with antibiotics. 
An influential committee of MPs has asked the British population to cut down on meat to help ease the food crises in the developing world and mitigate rampant food price inflation.
The 40 percent of food that Americans throw out every year is terrible for the climate, and the U.S.D.A. and E.P.A. are taking some initial steps to mitigate waste. Meanwhile in Switzerland, melting glaciers are putting a small village at risk.
Walmart has announced that it will transport produce from farms to stores faster by cutting out the middleman and buying directly from growers. The company has a reputation of squeezing and manipulating producers, so we'll have to see how these new direct relationships play out. In other major store news, Target joins the list of major retailers who are rejecting GE salmon, and here's why one person thinks that the Whole Foods opening in Detroit is a big deal.
According to a report from the New York City Health Department, one person dies every 90 minutes from diabetes-related causes. Meanwhile, Coca Cola is giving $3.8 million to fight obesity in Georgia with the help of physical and nutritional programs.
Here's Kevin Coupe at Forbes on "the clear and utterly unscientific case for GMO transparency." Fun fact: did you know that Japan stopped importing U.S. wheat in the wake of farmers' lawsuits against Monsanto? More on that from Times. Meanwhile, the Connecticut senate passed a strong GMO labeling bill, and last month two million people took to the streets to march against Monsanto. Another animal study claims to have found that food with GMOs is harmful, but again the doubters appear to have a stronger case. Who'll sort this out?
Fascinating story about Bob Fletcher, who passed away earlier this month. Fletcher, a former California agriculture inspector, quit his job in the middle of World War II to manage the fruit farms of Japanese families who were forced into internment camps.

Amid the current turmoil in global markets, one question is being obsessively debated on Wall Street: Just what was Ben S. Bernanke thinking three weeks ago when he said that the Federal Reserve might soon cut back its stimulus efforts?
While second-guessing the Fed is a parlor game that traders have played for decades, it is an exercise that has taken on heightened significance. That is because in recent years, the markets have been more dependent on central bank support than at than any time in recent memory. So when Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that the stimulus might diminish, alarm was bound to spread. And quite a reaction it was.
 Since May 22, when Mr. Bernanke made those remarks, global stock markets have lost $3 trillion in value, according to Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
The Japanese stock market, for example, lurched into bear-market territory on Thursday after a tumble of 6.4 percent took the cumulative decline in the Nikkei 225 index to more than 21 percent since a peak on May 22. 
While sentiment has been fragile as investors have taken stock of the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, markets in Europe and the United States have been volatile as well. Stocks rallied in the United States on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 1.5 percent, but they have gyrated since Mr. Bernanke's remarks forced investors to consider a world with less Fed stimulus.
Mr. Bernanke will get another bite at the apple at a scheduled news conference next week and in his semiannual testimony to Congress next month, when his comments will be closely scrutinized.
Before looking at what Mr. Bernanke actually said in May, it is helpful to recall some history.
After the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed moved into emergency mode to lift the economy and support the banking system. The central bank has bought more than $2 trillion of bonds, effectively pumping that amount into the banking system and economy.
The Fed's latest bond purchase program kicked in this year. But in contrast to its previous programs, the Fed this time did not say in advance how much it was going to spend on bonds. Instead, the central bank said it would keep up its purchases until certain economic targets were achieved.
The main goal is to get the unemployment rate down to 6.5 percent or lower. The Fed is also watching the falling inflation rate and will keep buying bonds if that indicator falls to a level that it thinks will weaken the economy and financial system.
Looking at where those two gauges are today, investors assumed the Fed would buy bonds for many months. But that changed when Mr. Bernanke testified before Congress on May 22. He said that if the Fed saw improvement in the economy, and felt it could be sustained, it "could in the next few meetings take a step down in our pace of purchases."
The words "next few meetings" were what really worried market participants. They had become accustomed to the Fed's implacable reassurances that it wasn't going to change its accommodative stance until the goals had been met.
Yet here was Mr. Bernanke seemingly saying that the money spigot could start closing later this year. Their thought process continued: Mr. Bernanke must know how much weight his words carry, and he always speaks very carefully to avoid upsetting the apple cart, so his utterance must have been deliberate and must have had a motive.
Here are four theories going around Wall Street on why the Fed chairman said what he said:
 A BONE FOR THE HAWKS 
According to Fed observers, Mr. Bernanke has a consensual style of management on the all-important Fed committee that sets monetary policy. Some members have deep reservations about the large bond purchases. Mr. Bernanke doesn't agree with the hawks, but he wants them to feel that their concerns are listened to.
So he makes an utterance that proves to them that he is not afraid to publicly envision a definite end to the stimulus. They then feel comforted that Helicopter Ben will have the resolve to stop the money drop - one day. This theory is great for the camp that thinks the Fed must keep pressing the gas. It means Mr. Bernanke was merely being a shrewd manager and isn't going to turn stingy any time soon.
 BURSTING BUBBLES 
The Fed has a frighteningly poor record of spotting bubbles and deflating them before they become destructive. There is no gigantic, overarching bubble right now that could harm the wider economy. But over the last two years, as the Fed has pumped money into the financial system, large markets have been driven higher by significant amounts of speculation.
A Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, has highlighted the risks in some of them. On Wall Street, with interest rates this low for so long, it has become easy to make bets with borrowed money. But such investments can unwind violently with even the slightest tightening of credit. Mr. Bernanke may have wanted to throw a little bit of sand into this giant leverage machine.
If so, it seems to have worked so far, because some of the frothiest markets have tumbled since his testimony. From the Fed's perspective, the risk is that the sell-off builds on itself and weighs on the wider economy.
 DRESS REHEARSAL 
One day the Fed will clearly state that it truly is going to pare its purchases. That could usher in a turbulent period in the markets. Talking about such withdrawal today could soften any shock it inflicts on the market when it happens. It is the same reason parents prepare children for their first day of school during the summer.
"You could see this as a trial balloon that was floated," said Brian Smith, who trades bonds at TCW, an asset management firm. "Bernanke might have wanted to see if the market could handle a tapering."
The Fed also gets to examine exactly how the markets reacted and can make tailored responses. In recent weeks, some important assets have been acting in weirdly interconnected ways (just search Google for the term "convexity vortex"). The Fed is now wiser about those sorts of moves.
 A TAP ON THE BRAKES 
The final theory is that Mr. Bernanke has in fact shifted his stance. While certainly not a hawk, he has intellectually moved closer to ending the asset purchases than people might realize. It is important to remember that the latest open-ended program was conceived at the end of last year, when there was great trepidation about the drag that fiscal retrenchment would have on the economy.
"Back in December, the Fed didn't know if we would fall off the fiscal cliff," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates. "So it may have thought, 'We'll shoot now and think later.' "
It turns out that, in spite of Washington's budget battles, the economy has been quite resilient. For the economic conditions that exist right now, smaller purchases may be more appropriate. Some economists dispute this line of thinking.
For instance, they say the Fed isn't going to taper when the inflation rate is declining as it is right now. But Mr. Bernanke may think that dip is temporary, particularly since some forward-looking indicators in the markets predict a rise in inflation. And some economists see strong signs that the latest round of bond purchases is having its desired effect and will lead to a stronger economy as early as the second half of this year.
When faced with frantic speculation over its motives, and weakening markets, the Fed may be tempted to say things to calm everyone down. So far, the most influential Fed governors have not come out to somehow correct people's interpretations of Mr. Bernanke's remarks. That could work to the good of everyone.
"Although the last three weeks have been jarring to everyone - including the Fed - its prime directive is to get policy correct, not worry about several weeks of increased market volatility," said Jim Vogel, a debt markets strategist for FTN Financial.

HEADLINE: Who's Going to Make That?

BYLINE: JESSICA GROSS


HIGHLIGHT: We asked chefs, scientists, chief executives and others to tell us the invention they crave. 

 BODY:
 For this past weekend's Innovations issue, we excavated the origin stories behind a number of familiar, yet often overlooked, items in our daily lives. Which made us wonder, What's missing? What sorts of things do we still need in order to improve everyday existence? So we asked an assortment of people, including chefs, scientists, chief executives and others, to tell us the invention they crave. 
"I was walking a lot in New York City last week, where there's really no dead zones in terms of things to look at and hear, and yet at the same time I was still, because I'm an idiot, staring at my phone the whole time. So what I need is an app for my phone that knows there's something much more interesting in front of me right now and says 'Look up!' and shuts itself off. Like: Look over there, there's a guy roller-skating wearing bunny slippers on his ears. Look up, there's a beautiful 19th-century building in the middle of those skyscrapers. You should be able to choose different approaches. I obviously need the abusive voice." - Peter Sagal, host of the radio quiz show "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!" 
"A new kind of bubble gum. You know how you blow soap bubbles from a bottle and metal ring? Well, my idea is kids would chew a piece of delicious gum, form an 'O' with their lips and blow out a stream of bubbles." - Arthur Shorin, former chief executive of Topps, current partner of Eatwhatever breath freshener 
"I would like to see a program that browsed through your computer documents - PDF files you've saved of papers or publications, your own documents and notes - and randomly picked up a couple of sentences or phrases and put them up in the corner of your computer screen. You could turn it on or off, and you could set how often you wanted it to disturb you. It's what we miss about going to libraries: you go for one thing and you bump into something else." - Stuart Firestein, chairman of the department of biological sciences at Columbia University and author of "Ignorance: How It Drives Science"
"Dress heels that feel like running shoes!" - Mary Wittenberg, president and C.E.O. of New York Road Runners 
"Why on earth have we not invented community grandparenting? There are all these new mesh-economy inventions: we can share cars, we can share lawnmowers - essentially any capital good that you have, there's now a business model for it. But what we don't have is the technology-enabled recreation of 1950s neighborhood living, where when you needed to run to the store or couldn't get home, somebody you knew and trusted watched your kids." - Anne-Marie Slaughter, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, incoming president of the New America Foundation 
"The digital translator: when you write or record on a digital medium, you indicate the program you used. When that program is about to go 'extinct,' your data is automatically translated into a form readable by a new program that's automatically installed on your computer. I have half a lifetime of data that I cannot access: a cassette recording of the conversation when someone told me for the first time, 'I'd rather text than talk'; focus groups taped on minidisks for camcorders no longer in production; interviews on floppy disks written in Scribble, WordPerfect, MS Word 4. But if we don't invent this, it's not just my archives and papers that will go dark. Far more important historical documents will be lost as well." - Sherry Turkle, professor of science, technology and society at M.I.T., author of "Alone Together"
"I want an app that suggests personalized random acts of kindness for select friends and family you haven't contacted recently - send them flowers, pay for a class they'd love, buy them a book, send them a letter or a text message - and prompts you to say why you care about them." - Ben Rattray, founder and C.E.O. of Change.org 
"I want someone to invent an implement that measures the Scoville units of any chili pepper, so you'd know exactly how hot it was without having to taste each one." - Bobby Flay, chef and owner of Mesa Grill and Bar Americain

"A machine that could fill macarons with ganache and close them. The hardest part would be maintaining the consistency of the ganache and keeping all of the finished macarons the same. We make around 2,000-2,500 macarons a day." - Francois Payard, pastry chef and owner of Francois Payard Bakery and FP Patisserie 
"I wish there was an app like Yelp, but for restaurant owners. Employees could comment on their experiences feeding and serving the public." - Justin Severino, chef and founder of CURE Pittsburgh

HEADLINE: Can N.S.A. Surveillance Be Likened to Chinese Spying?

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Amid a report that the N.S.A. gathered communications from China, state media have begun to speak out; others ask if gathering commercial and military secrets, and surveillance to stop terrorist attacks, can even be likened. 

 BODY:
BEIJING -"Snowden: American Government Invaded Chinese Computers," ran a headline Thursday on CCTV, China's state-run television channel.
"'Prismgate': America Owes Global Netizens an Explanation," said an editorial in the Chinese-language edition of the Global Times, a newspaper that is part of the Communist Party-run People's Daily group.
And: "For months, Washington has been accusing China of cyberespionage, but it turns out that the biggest threat to the pursuit of individual freedom and privacy in the U.S. is the unbridled power of the government," the China Daily, a state-run newspaper, quoted Li Haidong, a researcher of American studies at China Foreign Affairs University, as saying in a story titled "Surveillance program a test of Sino-U.S. ties."
Reaction was swelling on Thursday in China's state media to the leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency computer technician, of highly classified documents about the United States' monitoring of Internet and telephone communications. 
And the tone appeared to be increasingly sharp, focusing on reports that the programs included surveillance of Hong Kong and Chinese computers and people, with the South China Morning Post reporting very early Thursday morning about "explosive claims that the U.S. government had been hacking into computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland for years," in an interview with Mr. Snowden conducted at a secret location in Hong Kong.
Yet questions were being raised: Are the two events, U.S. allegations of Chinese hacking of military and commercial secrets, and the N.S.A's surveillance programs, even similar?
Some thought not.
Snowden's biggest harm to US isn't outing secret program, but politically neutering US response to China's far more serious hacking campaign
- Patrick Chovanec (@prchovanec)13 Jun 13
There were plenty of accusations on China's lively Weibos, or microblogs, of "hypocrisy" by the United States, the English-language Post reported.
Another view: "As much as we are so willing to criticize the US for their bad behaviour," wrote Zhao Xiao, a professor at University of Science and Technology Beijing, on his microblog, "it doesn't give China the excuse to act more evil," the Post reported.
Here's what Mr. Snowden said about N.S.A. surveillance of Hong Kong and mainland China, according to the Post: "The N.S.A. had been hacking computers in Hong Kong and on the mainland since 2009. None of the documents revealed any information about Chinese military systems," he said.
One of the targets in Hong Kong was the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and public officials, businesses and students in the city, the Post reported. "The documents also point to hacking activity by the N.S.A. against mainland targets," it wrote. "Snowden believed there had been more than 61,000 N.S.A. hacking operations globally, with hundreds of targets in Hong Kong and on the mainland."
In the article, Mr. Snowden used the word "hacking," instead of the more emotionally loaded word used by CCTV, "invade." In Chinese, the word, "ruqin," implies actual physical invasion.
In Washington, Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the State Department, "rejected the idea that such an incident would represent double standards given recent U.S. criticism of Chinese cyber attacks," according to The Guardian newspaper, which has led the reporting of Mr. Snowden's leaks.
"There is a difference between going after economic data and the issues of surveillance that the president has addressed which are about trying to stop people doing us harm," it cited Ms. Psaki as saying.
Mr. Snowden's leaks were made public last week, when the Chinese and the U.S. presidents met in California for talks that both sides deemed important. Chinese espionage was high on the U.S. agenda following a series of reports there about large, sophisticated cyber-based efforts - apparently successful - from China to extract American commercial and military secrets.
The New York Times has written about the scale and breadth of the campaign: while cyberespionage is the focus of much attention, it has also pointed to allegations that China has for decades waged a campaign to get technology from the developed world, by any means necessary, as a shortcut to development.
A U.S. intelligence employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the two situations - China's stealing of trade and military secrets and N.S.A. surveillance to track possible terrorist attacks - are not comparable, calling them "apples and oranges."
"I can tell you with absolute certainty the U.S. government does not pass on technological secrets obtained through (strictly speaking, as a byproduct of) espionage to U.S. firms, both as a matter of principle and because there is no fair way to do it," he wrote in answer to an e-mailed question.
"I recall some senior bureaucrat proposing this some two decades ago - and he got nowhere," the person wrote. "None of the agencies wanted anything to do with it."
"China, by contrast, deliberately targets foreign technology for military and commercial purposes, so this is apples and oranges," he wrote. "But in the propaganda war, that fact won't matter."
Comments in The China Daily reinforced that view: "The massive U.S. global surveillance program revealed by a former C.I.A. whistle-blower in HongKong is certain to stain Washington's overseas image and test developing Sino-U.S. ties," the newspaper wrote, citing analysts.
The Global Times' commentary concluded: "But in reality, we are not bystanders. If as the Internet superpower America overstepped its capabilities, this question directly touches on our vital interests."
As The New York Times reported from Hong Kong, Li Siling, a social media expert at the China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong, in Shanghai, said that Mr. Snowden's disclosures were likely to play into the hands of those in Beijing who favor a strong security apparatus. "They will say the U.S. is supposed to be the most free country in the world, but they still monitor the Internet and tap every phone," Mr. Li said.
 Is it right to see similarities in stealing economic and military data and gathering information to try to stop terrorist attacks? Is that even the issue here? Is there hypocrisy here, and if so, from whom? The U.S.? China? Both? Tell us what you think.

HEADLINE: A Film Presses the Climate, Health and Security Case for Nuclear Energy

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new film stirs strong feelings and fresh thinking on nuclear energy. 

 BODY:
"Pandora's Promise" is a provocative and important new documentary making the case for nuclear power as a safe and large-scale substitute for fossil fuels. There's a flaw in the film's approach that undercuts its mission, but I still see it as vital viewing and a refreshing new direction in a tired old battle over the shape of America's energy future.
The film, which opened in New York City Wednesday night and expands to 15 cities on Friday, was bound to generate strong reactions among people long opposed to this energy source. In a discussion that I moderated after a screening Monday night at the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, N.Y., Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., flatly told the director, Robert Stone, that the film was an "elaborate hoax" and a "big lie."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.] 
What's fascinating is that not all foes of nuclear energy are in attack mode. A case in point is Terry Tempest Williams, a cancer survivor, anti-nuclear campaigner and ferociously expressive writer on nature and human nature. In The Nation this week, she engaged in a long and fascinating dialogue on the film with Mark Hertsgaard, a journalist echoing Kennedy's derisive view. You can read a pivotal excerpt from Williams's take below. In the magazine, she criticizes Stone for the film's dismissive treatment of critics of the nuclear industry (I concur) but still calls the film "compelling" (I concur).
The film, like a host of documentaries these days - from "Gasland" to "The Cove" - has a strong point of view and pulls no punches. It centers on a Greek chorus of liberal greens who've come around to embracing the atom, including Stewart Brand, the author of "Whole Earth Catalog" and "Whole Earth Discipline," and Mark Lynas, the British environmental writer who wrote a popular global warming book, "Six Degrees," and "The God Species."
[|Insert | The Times has published a feature about the film and the director, including the fun detail that Robert Stone, now 54, made his first movie, on the dawn of environmental consciousness, using his mother's Super 8 camera on the first Earth Day.]
[Video: "Megatons to Megawatts" program in "Pandora's Promise" Watch on YouTube.]
It also draws on the deeply informed views of Richard Rhodes, the journalist and Pulitzer Prize winning historian of atomic weapons. I've also posted a valuable essay that Rhodes wrote on his views and the film's conclusions, and critics.*
In a section of the film highlighting how nuclear power, by displacing coal, can save thousands of lives, Rhodes pointedly says, "To be anti-nuclear is basically to be in favor of burning fossil fuels."
Please read his piece later, and everything that follows, after trying to set aside the blinders and filters we all deploy in facing questions like this.
"Pandora's Promise" is essential viewing because of the way it challenges people, including its protagonists, to examine their own fears or predispositions.
The film marvelously starts with Mark Lynas, now a determined champion of nuclear power, nervously "having a wobble" as he rides through the evacuation zone around Japan's devastated Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Watching his radiation detector ping away in the deserted area, he says:
There's no energy source that does this, that leaves huge areas contaminated by this, this strange, invisible presence, which you know is potentially deadly. Everything has its drawbacks, everything has its risks, but this is something which is unique to nuclear.
Lynas goes on, of course, to explain why he remains in support of harnessing nuclear energy, particularly through advanced reactor designs that don't come with the waste stream and complexity of the light-water reactor design that dominates the industry today - overgrown terrestrial versions of the power source in nuclear submarines.
The film's main flaw is its finger-waving and dismissive approach to critics of the nuclear industry. Data on cancer or other health risks from radiation have, from Hiroshima and Chernobyl onward, revealed a substantial capacity in humans and other species to endure quite substantial exposure. But that doesn't mean the risk is nil, and "the feeling of risk" - to echo the vital work of the psychologist Paul Slovic - is deep and profound, as even Lynas and the director found in their Fukushima tour.
I think the film suffers by not incorporating input from reasoned critics of the nuclear industry, many of whom are not entirely opposed to harnessing the atom. Dave Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists and Thomas Cochran at the Natural Resources Defense Council come to mind.
Instead, it depicts the opposition mainly through shots of the anti-nuclear campaigner Helen Caldicott engaged in raucous demonstrations. She may be famous, but her accusations that international agencies are knowingly underplaying radiation risks have been repeatedly debunked (most thoroughly by the British environmentalist George Monbiot). This makes her far too easy a target. Serious engagement with critics of nuclear power - whether on economics, industry practices or health and environmental issues - is absent.
The film also avoids discussing the high costs and logistical and policy hurdles to adding substantially to the country's, or world's, existing fleets of operating nuclear plants. The scale and costs required to cut into coal use using any technology - nuclear, wind, solar or otherwise - is incredibly daunting.
Nonetheless, the film's sections exploring how nuclear technology became demonized, from the abandonment of the completed Shoreham plant on Long Island to the shutdown of government research on a next generation of plant designs, are informative and convincing.
So, too, is the film's argument that those, like Hertsgaard, warning of nuclear energy leading to arms proliferation are forgetting that, through the Megatons to Megawatts program, fuel from thousands of warheads from the arsenal of the former Soviet Union has been recycled and used in American power plants. As Stewart Brand explains:
We're recycling all these nuclear warheads into energy, electricity, and nuclear power. And, so, nuclear power is doing more to de-nuclear-weaponize the world than any other thing that we do. Poetically, it's rather beautiful. The very things that were designed to blow up our cities are now lighting up our cities. And amazingly, 10 percent of American electricity, half of our nuclear power, comes from reprocessed Russian warheads.
As promised, here's an excerpt from Terry Tempest Williams's side of the conversation in The Nation, which beautifully captures the value of the film:
"I belong to a Clan of One-Breasted Women. My mother, my grandmothers and six aunts have all had mastectomies. Seven are dead." So begins the epilogue of my memoir, "Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place, written in 1991." As Utahns, residents of the Atomic West, we are hibakusha, explosion-affected people bound by the wind. Half of my family has died from cancers that I believe were a result of radioactive fallout caused by aboveground nuclear explosions tested in the Nevada desert from 1945 to 1962....
So when I say that Robert Stone's film "Pandora's Promise" challenged my thinking after thirty years of antinuclear activism and repeated arrests at the Nevada Test Site on behalf of "the Clan of One-Breasted Women," it is not a small statement. This crack in my own thinking is heightened by the fact that I am now watching my extended community of plants, animals, rocks, rivers and human beings be ravaged by the oil and gas industry, be it fracking or the razing of vulnerable wildlands. And then there is the BP oil spill.
For me, this film's strength was not that it changed my mind, which it did not, but that it expanded it. I am interested in having an open conversation about nuclear energy. Climate change is real. We know we must wean ourselves off fossil fuels. So what are the alternatives? Are renewable energy sources enough for the energy-poor around the world? My questions are many. Richard Jeffries, the nineteenth-century British naturalist, wrote: "Never, never rest contented with any circle of ideas, but always be certain that a wider one is still possible."
I urge you to read the full exchange here.
Here's a roundup of other reactions. Back in January when "Pandora's Promise" was unveiled at the Sundance Film Festival, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly hailed it beneath a headline calling the film "radically sane."
After a screening in March, the Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn pointed to the same problem that frustrated me and Terry Tempest Williams - the lack of reasoned voices with nuclear concerns - but still said this: "'Pandora's Promise' stands to be the most important movie about the environment since 'An Inconvenient Truth.'"
Manohla Dargis of The Times disliked the "deck-stacking" but also criticized Stone's argument.
Anne Michaud of Newsday likes the film but notes that its depiction of the Shoreham plant closure on Long Island didn't mention there was no workable evacuation plan.
Finally, for a thorough look at the film's potential value in breaking through the emotion-laden reactions many of us bring to discussions of radiation risk, read the laudatory Scientific American post by David Ropeik, a longtime risk analyst and risk communication consultant.
[1:03 p.m. | Update | Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists digs in on a host of what he calls "less-than-half truths" in the documentary and accuses the filmmakers of the same kind of cherry picking they deride anti-nuclear activists for.]

HEADLINE: In Fight Over Bank Rules, Regulator Calls for Compromise

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, called on his agency to strike a compromise over plans to rein in risky trading overseas. Mr. Chilton signaled a willingness to phase in certain regulations over time, but he argued that the agency should finalize its guidance ahead of a mid-July deadline. 

 BODY:
As federal regulators stumble toward a deadline to rein in risky trading overseas, one official has introduced plans that he hopes will salvage the overhaul.
On Thursday, Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, called on his agency to strike a compromise over the so-called cross-border plan. While Mr. Chilton signaled a willingness to phase in certain regulations over time, he argued that the agency should finalize its plan ahead of a mid-July deadline.
"We can complete our work on cross-border issues now and provide certainty to markets now," Mr. Chilton said in a speech on Thursday. 
If completed by the deadline, the guidance would clarify the breadth of new trading rules adopted in the wake of the financial crisis, when overseas risk-taking imperiled some of the largest financial firms in the United States. In particular, the guidance would outline how the rules apply to foreign banks and overseas affiliates of banks based in the United States, taking aim at those that ship trading overseas to escape scrutiny from United States regulators.
The issue - arguably the most contentious aspect of a federal crackdown on the $700 trillion marketplace for financial instruments known as derivatives - has set off a Wall Street lobbying frenzy and divided the trading commission's five-member panel.
With only a month to go before the agency's self-imposed deadline, the commissioners find themselves at odds on crucial aspects of the plan, including how much to defer to European regulators, who have yet to finalize their own overhaul of derivatives trading. And in recent days, an even thornier question arose: should the commissioners delay the plan until 2014 to allow the Europeans time to catch up?
Mr. Chilton, seen as the most liberal of the agency's commissioners, is advocating something of a middle ground.
In a speech before the Institute of International Bankers at the Yale Club in New York, he proposed that the agency complete a strict version of the guidance before the July 13 deadline. But in a compromise, he also suggested that the agency grant foreign affiliates of United States banks extra time to comply with certain derivatives rules.
"We need to make sure the right institutions are subject to appropriate regulation and oversight with recent history as a guide," Mr. Chilton said. "At the same time, we should simultaneously implement targeted, staggered cross-border compliance."
Under Mr. Chilton's plan, the agency would allow the overseas affiliates a brief reprieve before complying with certain derivatives rules created under the Dodd-Frank Act, even though the banks have had three years to prepare for the law since it was passed after the financial crisis. The law, among other things, requires banks to register with regulators, push their derivatives trades onto regulated trading platforms and turn over a battery of information about their trades.
Mr. Chilton, who appeared on CNBC to promote the plan, called it an "appropriately nuanced, time-limited solution," an approach that could satisfy critics of the cross-border guidance without alienating proponents of derivatives reform.
Yet the fate of his plan is unclear. While it could be one of the few viable options left with the mid-July deadline looming, the internal wrangling at the trading commission could jeopardize any last-ditch deal-making.
Mr. Chilton and Gary Gensler, a Democratic and chairman of the trading commission, are at odds with two Republican commissioners and another Democrat, Mark Wetjen, who have raised concerns about the guidance.
The Republicans, who would like to put off writing the guidance until the end of the year, argue that it could produce conflicts with foreign regulators and drive trading business away from Wall Street banks to overseas competitors. An extended deadline, they argue, will allow foreign regulators time to draft derivatives rules of their own.
Their approach echoes concerns raised by some of the world's top finance ministers, who are concerned that United States authorities are overstepping their borders.
But Mr. Gensler, whose term ends at the end of the year, has cautioned against a deadline extension. Mr. Chilton also came out against such a move on Thursday, arguing that the stability of the global financial system is at stake.
Just five years ago, foreign derivatives trading by the American International Group in London nearly brought American firms to their knees. JPMorgan Chase's recent $6 billion trading loss, which took place at a London-based unit, further highlighted that risk-taking overseas can come crashing back to American shores.
While Mr. Gensler and Mr. Chilton are outnumbered, the agency is unable to extend the deadline unless the chairman approves.
"I appreciate and understand this approach, although it doesn't do what Dodd-Frank requires us to do," Mr. Chilton will say on Thursday.
The debate stems from the fine print of Dodd-Frank. Under the 2010 law, the trading commission is supposed to apply swaps reforms outside the United States only if those activities have "a direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States."
Overseas trades that involve American companies, or a foreign company that is guaranteed by an American bank, are most likely to be covered. It is unclear, however, how much the trading commission will offer so-called substituted compliance, in which the trading commission will defer to foreign regulators as long as they have rules that generally compare to Dodd-Frank.
As the trading commission grapples with the nuance of the law, it has been inundated with complaints from banking lobbyists. Lawmakers, too, have taken aim at the agency. The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would curtail the agency's ability to apply Dodd-Frank rules overseas, which could encourage the trading commission to delay its guidance.
But Mr. Chilton says the agency has had enough time to finish its work.
"This can be done," he said in the speech. "It needs to be done."

HEADLINE: Race vs. Class: The False Dichotomy

BYLINE: By SHERRILYN A. IFILL. 
Sherrilyn A. Ifill is the president and director-counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc.

 BODY:
THE decision is in. All consideration of race in college admissions is over.
No, the Supreme Court has not yet announced its decision in the landmark case of Fisher v. University of Texas; that ruling is expected any day now. But an alarming number of scholars, pundits and columnists -- many of them liberal -- have declared that economic class, not race, should be the appropriate focus of university affirmative-action efforts.
How can we explain this decision to throw in the towel on race-based affirmative action? Are we witnessing a surrender in advance of sure defeat? Or just an early weariness with a debate that, a decade ago, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor predicted would last another 25 years? 
Perhaps it is the presence of a black president that has encouraged so many to believe that race is simply no longer a significant factor in American life. It is true that we have come a long way since the days of Jim Crow segregation. But the plain fact is that race still matters.
It matters with frightening frequency in the encounters of young black men with the police. It matters in our ability to get access to affordable housing, and in the wealth accumulated (or not) by our families. Whether the name on our résumé is Lakeisha or Leslie matters when we try to get a job interview. And it matters often, though not always, in our views about the continuing significance of race in American life.
Race isn't the only factor that matters, of course, and universities should take seriously their obligation to educate poor students of all races. But nor should class be the only factor: after all, it was also true in the early 1960s that ignoring race and merely providing more resources to segregated schools would have benefited some poor black students -- but that certainly didn't mean that separate was equal, or that segregation was constitutional, or that pushing for desegregation was a waste of time.
What we might learn from the decades-long (and painfully incomplete) experience of desegregation is the need to deploy multiple efforts to address a chronic problem. In the context of higher education, that menu of efforts should include considering income (if not wealth), as well as an aggressive campaign to raise the quality of K-12 public education.
But that menu must also include race, for a variety of reasons. For one, in places like Texas and Alabama and Maryland, public universities train the vast majority of the state's leaders. Greater classroom diversity helps ensure that minority and white students alike are prepared for leadership at a time of rapid demographic change.
That diversity includes class. To serve as their state's leaders one day, students at the University of Texas and the University of Maryland will need to understand that not all blacks are poor, not all whites are rich, and not all Latino students speak Spanish.
In fact, by pushing universities to substitute class for race, we may simply reinforce stereotypes within the student body that will equate minority students with poverty, masking both the economic (and ideological) diversity within minority communities but also the challenges that confront white working-class students. At any rate, the true benefits of diversity cannot be achieved when, as the University of Texas discovered in 2003, nearly 80 percent of its classes contained only one black student, or none at all.
What about the stinging charge that race-based affirmative action benefits only middle-class and well-to-do children of professionals, because selective colleges prefer those students over the poor? This is simply untrue as a blanket statement, and it obscures a more troubling and complex reality.
Selective universities first and foremost favor students with higher S.A.T. scores and those who have graduated from academically rigorous high schools. Those students, whether white, Hispanic, black or Asian, tend to come from middle- or upper-class families, with parents who can afford tutoring and exam prep courses that are out of reach for poor students. But that is mostly a reflection of selective universities' overreliance on standardized tests like the S.A.T. and the L.S.A.T., not an indictment of race-conscious affirmative action.
All of this is complicated and uncomfortable -- which is why it's not surprising to hear some commentators argue, in good faith, that we should abandon the consideration of race in affirmative action simply because using race is ''unpopular.'' But what progressive policy in pursuit of racial equity ever is?
In any case, even that argument is dubious: a recent New York Times poll showed that most Americans support affirmative action.
If there is public discomfort, it is precisely because race still does matter, because it still resonates so powerfully in American life. This is evidence that we need more contact among students of different races, not less.
If the Supreme Court reverses its 2003 decision to uphold affirmative action on campus and outlaw any consideration of race in admissions decisions, it would be radical -- a tragic culmination of decades of backtracking on racial justice. But the battle for racial diversity in higher education will not end, because neither the court nor the country can simply will away the enduring importance of race in determining life chances.
Whatever the court decides, students, parents, universities and leaders will continue to fight for diversity, because they recognize, as a majority of the court did in 2003, that the very legitimacy of our democracy depends on ensuring that the doors of opportunity are open to all.

HEADLINE: A Guide to Iran's Presidential Election

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
How many candidates are there?
When Iranians vote on Friday, they will be selecting from six candidates, all drawn from Iran's alliance of Shiite Muslim clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders, known as the traditionalists. All say they are ready to fix the economy by using a ''revolutionary mind-set'' and to solve the nuclear dispute with the West by convincing them that Iran's position is just.
Who are considered the three main candidates? 
Saeed Jalili
Known as Iran's unyielding nuclear negotiator and a protégé of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Saeed Jalili has emerged as a front-runner, an unsettling prospect for future relations with the West. Mr. Jalili, 47, who many analysts say has long been groomed for the top position in Iran, is by far the most outspoken hard-liner among the candidates approved to participate in the election. Opposing ''détente a hundred percent'' and promising no compromise ''whatsoever'' with the West over matters like Iran's nuclear program and its involvement in Syria, Mr. Jalili seems set to further escalate Iran's standoff with the United States and its allies.
Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf
Mr. Ghalibaf, who comes from the hard-line Islamic Revolution tradition, is Tehran's mayor. Once a senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards, he lost the 2005 presidential election to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His supporters applaud his management style and efforts to improve public transportation, parks and highway overpasses in Tehran. He received a public endorsement on May 28 when 120 members of Iran's Parliament signed a declaration of support for his candidacy. He has long presented himself as a technocrat, but last week boasted publicly of having beaten protesting students as a police commander.
Hassan Rowhani
Only one of the candidates, the cleric Hassan Rowhani, a former nuclear negotiator, has even slightly different stances from the traditionalists, thus attracting some of the veterans of the now silenced Green movement. A close ally
of a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was barred from the race by the conservative Guardian Council, he is one of a few prominent politicians proposing better relations with the outside world. Mr. Rowhani, who led the first rounds of negotiations with Western countries after the 2002 disclosure of Iran's secret nuclear program, now finds himself mocked by the Jalili camp, which cites those talks as an example of ignorance and weakness.
What kind of powers does the president actually have?
The exact dimensions of presidential power in Iran are complicated, as shown by this graphic from the 2009 election. The presidency has evolved, starting out weak in the early years of the revolution but taking on greater importance after the abolition of the office of prime minister in the late 1980s. Once in office, presidents now create their own power bases, often clashing with the very people who backed their rise to power. All political struggles in Iran are typically waged under the watchful eye of the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who ultimately decides the winners and losers, carefully balancing competing interests, to make sure no faction amasses too much power.
How easy is it to predict who will win?
Iran's presidential elections, lacking independent opinion polls and subject to manipulation, are notoriously unpredictable. In 2005, Mr. Ahmadinejad came out of nowhere to win. In 2009, millions of people took to the streets to protest what they said was widespread fraud in the voting that returned Mr. Ahmadinejad to office over the opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi.
How is this election different from the 2009 vote?
Iran's 2009 presidential election was an exciting spectacle that aroused a powerful surge of optimism in the populace but ended with the trauma of a violent crackdown. This year's vote, taking place under starkly different circumstances, promises to be far more subdued. Instead of election posters coloring the streets, plainclothes police officers make sure there are no spontaneous gatherings. Wary of the raucous street demonstrations that erupted during the last election, the government decreed that this year's campaign would consist of rallies in predetermined spaces and a series of tedious, four-hour debates that many Iranians dismissed as more like a pointless quiz show than a discussion of real issues.
Where are the opposition leaders from 2009?
Many have fled the country, been silenced or jailed. The two main reformist candidates in that election, Mr. Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, remain under house arrest.
What kind of censorship is at play?
Technically, all Iranians are free to participate in elections, but Iran's powerful Guardian Council, which vets candidates, decides who is allowed to run. Once candidates are vetted they are still cautious about offending the governing establishment of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders.
The Iranian government is known to restrict digital communication in various ways. Google said Wednesday that it had uncovered a vast Iranian spy campaign that had been targeting tens of thousands of Iranian citizens over the past three weeks.

HEADLINE: Argentina, Once Known as the King of Beef, Falls From Its Throne

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- A thick slab of grass-fed sirloin dripping in its own juices: so many Argentines consider such a feast a birthright to be enjoyed regularly that one president in the 1990s quipped to an American magazine, ''Tell your readers, 'Don't come to my country if they're vegetarian.' ''
But tastes change, even here.
Beef consumption in this red-meat colossus has decreased so much over the decades that the nation recently fell from its perch as the world's top per capita consumer of beef, a title Argentine ranchers are fighting to regain from their tiny neighbor, Uruguay. In another jolt, a study warned that pizzerias could soon outnumber steakhouses in this city. 
As if that were not enough to rattle the national psyche, Argentina slipped into 11th place, behind countries like New Zealand and Mexico, in the global ranking of beef exporters this year, prompting solemn reactions like one in a major newspaper that declared it ''the end of a reign.''
''We live, at this moment, immersed in shame,'' the writer Diego Vecino said in a recent 4,000-plus-word magazine article that explored declining beef consumption. ''In the last few years, our Argentine national identity has been roughed up as never before,'' he lamented, in a slightly tongue-in-cheek fashion. ''The ritual of the barbecue persists, but in many cases under the kitsch glow of a retro experience.''
It is hard to overstate beef's centrality to the Argentine way of life for more than a century. Novels and poems extol the art of cattle ranching on the vast pampas, long a touchstone of national pride. Cafes in this city bulge with diners feasting on steaks washed down with glasses of malbec. At lunchtime, it is still possible to see construction crews preparing slabs of beef on makeshift grills, the smoky smell of this ritual permeating their work sites.
Argentines ate about 129 pounds of beef a person last year, far surpassing Americans, who mustered a mere 57.5 pounds by comparison. But Argentina's current level is a pale shadow of its peak: 222 pounds of beef for every man, woman and child, achieved in 1956.
Reasons vary for these doldrums. Beef prices have surged with inflation, but cattlemen contend that government price controls aimed at preventing domestic beef consumption from falling further have wreaked havoc by making it costly to maintain large herds. Others, eying China's rising demand for grains over the last decade, say it is simply more profitable to farm soybeans than to raise cattle.
''We are witnessing a historic decline in our beef industry,'' said Ernesto Ambrosetti, chief economist of the Argentine Rural Society, the country's largest farming association. ''Now our smaller neighbors, Paraguay and Uruguay, have passed us'' in the export rankings.
Government officials contend that their policies to lift beef consumption, including export restraints and price controls intended to make the meat more affordable, are turning the tide. Indeed, domestic consumption has recovered slightly from a record low in 2011.
But while Argentina has experienced swings in beef consumption in the past, some see the latest drops as evidence of a broader paradigm shift: many Argentines are simply opting for a more varied diet.
The shift -- reflected in a rising demand for foods like poultry, pasta and pizza; a greater awareness of the health risks associated with eating beef; and even the emergence of an insurgent vegetarian dining scene in Buenos Aires -- does not sit well with some Argentines.
''Beef consumption is threatened by modern trends of healthy eating, mainly the exaltation of what's natural and ecological, stimulating vegetable consumption,'' the Argentine Beef Promotion Institute warned in a 2006 report, warily acknowledging a ''new age culture and the appearance of cooking fads incorporating other products.''
For some Argentines who were raised in a society so focused on beef, the adjustment was long overdue. ''I almost don't eat meat now,'' said Susana Carfagna, a 61-year-old retiree, as she walked out of a butcher shop with some ground chicken as an alternative to beef burgers. ''It's not healthy. I have high cholesterol and need a more balanced diet.''
At Buenos Aires Verde, a vegetarian restaurant with a pastel orange and lime green color scheme, diners can choose from options like patties made from yamani rice and adzuki beans, or cannelloni made with dehydrated fruit and flax seeds.
''Argentines are demanding a change,'' Mauro Massimino, 33, a vegetarian who owns the restaurant, said as his predominantly svelte clientele ate their meals. ''Around five years ago, vegetarianism started to gain traction here, and the growth since has been incredible.''
The growth of vegetarian restaurants in Argentina's capital has unfolded at a time of big change -- some say upheaval -- in the countryside. As recently as 2007, Argentina had about 55.6 million head of cattle, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. That number fell to 48.1 million in 2011, before recovering somewhat this year to an estimated 51.2 million. (That is still more cows than people, given the country's population of more than 40 million.)
As Argentina's economy over the past decade recovered from a collapse in 2001, beef prices in the country surged. Struggling with the broader increase in inflation, the authorities in 2006 announced a temporary ban on beef exports in an effort to expand the domestic supply and bring down prices for Argentine consumers.
Since then, the government has limited beef exports and imposed price controls, moves that ranchers claim are eroding profitability. As losses mounted, a wave of slaughterhouse shutdowns left thousands of people jobless in recent years. Many cattle ranchers have shifted into soybean farming, with the grain exported largely to China where it is used as animal feed.
The government has tried to curb the impact of rising beef prices and diminished supply through a program called ''Meat for Everyone,'' offering more than a dozen popular cuts of beef at low prices to consumers in the Buenos Aires metro area.
But officials have also promoted other types of animal protein, reflecting the nation's dependence on agribusiness. ''It is much more gratifying to eat some grilled pork than to take Viagra,'' President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said in 2010, joking about what she described as the meat's libido-enhancing qualities while announcing subsidies for the pork industry.
For many Argentines, how much beef they eat comes down to another factor: price. In the last three years, coveted cuts of cuadril (rump steaks) have jumped in price almost 90 percent, to about $5.80 a pound, said Juan Pagano, a butcher in the neighborhood of Colegiales.
''It's unbelievable how the prices have shot up,'' said Eduardo González, 48, who cleans industrial water tanks for a living. Buying a relatively cheap and tough cut of beef one recent evening at a supermarket, he said he could no longer afford sirloin.
''But I still try to eat beef four times a week; if I did not, I would die!'' he said, with a chuckle. ''It is fundamental.''
Indeed, many Argentines are not taking the decline of their beef industry lying down.
Claudia Valenti, a nutritionist for the municipality of Buenos Aires, said people should eat beef, preferably lean cuts, every day.
''We are not herbivores,'' Ms. Valenti said.
''Human beings never were, apart from at the very beginning of time.''

Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category.

&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'A Different Kind of Order: The ICP Triennial' (through Sept. 8) The fourth, and best, edition of the International Center of Photography's triennial turns out to be that extremely rare thing in New York City these days, an exhibition of contemporary art for adults. The up-to-the-minute emphasis is on the continuing and enveloping impact of digital technology on photography. The results, as seen here, couldn't be more varied and gripping in content. This is a show that's in touch with the big, live, real world out there beyond Frieze New York. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'Jack Goldstein x 10,000' (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein's posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein's signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like ''Milk,'' in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or ''Spotlight,'' in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'At War With the Obvious: Photographs by William Eggleston' (through July 28) In 36 transcendentally beautiful photographs shot in the Mississippi Delta region in the 1970s and early '80s, this pioneer of color photography captured those kinds of sacred moments when something you ordinarily would pass by without a thought -- a children's swing set overgrown by weeds, an abandoned gas station, a basket of fake flowers hanging on someone's front door -- suddenly takes your breath away. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cambodian Rattan: The Sculptures of Sopheap Pich' (through July 7) Born in Cambodia in 1971, Soheap Pich first came to international attention in 2009 with a series of openwork, basketlike rattan sculptures that looked as light as air, but carried serious ideas in images of half-built cities, viscera, flowers and bombs. His impressive Met show is embedded in the permanent Asian collection. It starts outside the Chinese painting galleries, continues in mezzanine space usually devoted to South Asian material, and concludes in the galleries of Southeast Asian art with a gorgeous suspended Buddha. (An exhibition of new work is on view through June 14 at Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea.) (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through Sept. 2) If you've seen ''Photography and the American Civil War'' at the Met, you might suppose that viewing another exhibition about the war would be redundant. It's not. With outstanding works by Frederic Edwin Church, Sanford Robinson Gifford and Winslow Homer, this gripping show sheds expansive light on the nation's experience of its own fratricidal conflict. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (through Aug. 14) This entertaining exhibition proves that high fashion rarely looks quite as frivolous and cluelessly 1 percent-ish as when it upgrades aspects of the obstreperous punk sartorial mode, adding gold-plated safety pins, careful rips and holes, and a feigned DIY look that can involve materials like garbage bags or cellophane. Cleverness abounds. A few designers absorb and transform punk attributes, but most garments simplistically scream punk. Not for nothing do they call the show's organizing department the Costume Institute. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi' (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met's rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brush strokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velázquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake in the region. It's a chance to see another commanding Velázquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Expo 1: New York' (through Sept. 2) A sprawling, multisite extravaganza including a multitude of installations, shows-within-shows and events, ''Expo 1: New York'' offers few answers but raises many provocative questions about the current and future state of our planet's unsettled human and natural ecology. Attractions at PS1 range from a beautiful show of pictures by the beloved nature photographer Ansel Adams to a refrigerated room containing chunks from an Icelandic glacier by Olafur Eliasson. On 53rd Street, next to the Museum of Modern Art, ''Rain Room'' invites viewers into a chamber where steady precipitation ceases wherever bodies are detected by high-tech hardware. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 2) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collage-like storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Ellsworth Kelly: Chatham Series' (through Sept. 8) Together again for the first time in 40 years, the 14 two-panel Chatham paintings from 1971 offer giddy instruction in the weights, measures and balances of strong color -- red, blue, green, yellow, black and white. The works -- abutting rectangles that form an inverted L -- seem to expand or contract as you move around the gallery. An adjoining display of 40 small collages from 1951 shows Mr. Kelly laying out some of the stringent abstract vocabulary that he has mined ever since. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
New Museum: 'Adhocracy' (through July 7) The term ''adhocracy'' was coined by the futurologist Alvin Toffler, who predicted that innovative, ad hoc forms of organization would replace more bureaucratically entrenched structures in business and government. This crowded design exhibition presents a variety of self-empowering things that people can make and do for themselves like build their own furniture and bicycles; make new appliances from functional parts of old, broken ones; raise money for bigger projects by means of Kickstarter; and, more problematically, make their own functional handguns using 3-D printers. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; Paul McCarthy: 'Life Cast' (through July 26) One of the outstanding shows of the artist's career is best viewed as a single piece. Three fanatically realistic life-size sculptures of naked humans are paired with two video installations that reveal the meticulous casting process behind their ecstatic, mysterious exactitude. The piece is a homage to -- but also perhaps penance for -- Marcel Duchamp's ''Étant Donnés'' and its obsessive focus on the female sex. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4970, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
'Salvaging the Past: Georges Hoentschel and French Decorative Arts from The Metropolitan Museum of Art' (through Aug. 11) This sometimes arcane but highly effective assemblage of rare furnishings, artifacts and a smattering of art and printed matter resurrects a once-renowned French interior designer whose collections -- and displays -- of 18th-century French decorative material and Medieval art were purchased en bloc by J.P.Morgan and given to the Met. They formed the nuclei of the museum's holdings in these areas, helped shape its departmental structure and influenced the arrangement of its galleries in numerous ways. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Laddie John Dill: 'Elementary' (through July 26) At the end of the 1960s the West Coast Light and Space artist Laddie John Dill began producing electric light works out of blown glass tubes in a lush palette of jewel-bright colors. Here, nine of these works, all from 1971, are installed in one room at regular intervals creating a trippy visual chamber music. Elsewhere, glowing constructions of glass panes in geometric arrangements could be models for updates of Stonehenge, monuments for a new cosmic paganism. Nyehaus, 358 West 20th Street, (212) 366-4493, nyehaus.com. (Johnson)
'Ellsworth Kelly at Ninety' (through June 29) An impressive three-part display of new work (mostly from 2012) reveals a seasoned artist who is doing some of his boldest work. Some introduce new forms (but are actually derived from his early collages). Others expand on more recent works with changes in material and color. Keep an eye out for ''Black Form II,'' ''Yellow Relief Over Blue,'' ''Gold With Orange Reliefs'' and the four-panel ''Curves on White.'' Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)
Karen Heagle: 'Battle Armor' (through June 22) Karen Heagle takes emblems of Medievalism and disarms them with color. In her pieced-together paintings, helmeted suits of mail and motorcycles, those modern battle steeds look like rainbow-colored images in stained-glass windows and or on gold-covered rinpa screens, overseen in this show by portraits of two all-conquering cinematic archangels, Charlotte Rampling and Isabella Rossellini. Churner and Churner, 205 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 675-2750, churnerandchurner.com. (Holland Cotter)
Jeff Koons: 'New Paintings and Sculptures' (through June 29) Hastily assembled as a retort to Mr. Koons's ''Gazing Ball'' exhibition now at David Zwirner, this exhibition reveals the artist to be both highly productive and uneven. His Photo Realist paintings are uniformly lifeless. The best works are a magenta stainless steel balloon sculpture inspired by the Venus of Willendorf and an inflatable gorilla, rendered in a dark material that resembles plastic or bronze but is actually polished granite. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)
Jeff Koons: 'Gazing Ball' (through June 29) In his latest series, the artist everyone loves to hate could be said to revisit his ''Banality'' series of the late 1980s. He appropriates blazing white plaster casts of well-known Greco-Roman sculptures -- the ''Farnese Hercules,'' ''Sleeping Satyr (Barberini Faun)'' and ''Belvedere Torso'' -- and accents each with a blue mirrored ball of the yard-ornament variety to add irony and visual pizazz. Fighting cliché with cliché, they are neither especially good or bad, just average Koons. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)
Marc Quinn: 'All the Time in the World' (through June 29) Four much enlarged, bronze sculptures of seashells made by high-tech 3-D replication seem, at first, like pointless baubles for rich collectors. But they reveal an unexpected inner beauty both literal and metaphorical, as their polished interiors cause their interiors to warmly glow as if supernaturally illuminated from within. Implicitly vaginal, these seeming products of phallic ambition become objects of oceanic, feminine mystery. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Wolfgang Tillmans (through June 22) The nomadic German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans addresses globalization in a curiously offhand way. This is true even in his latest works, which assert themselves more strongly as art objects thanks to Mr. Tillmans's experiments with inkjet printing; they are lush and almost painterly in their rich concentrations of pigment. Only after connecting the dots of the installation -- which moves from downtown Los Angeles to Kilimanjaro, a Masai hut to a construction site in Shanghai, a car headlight to a close-up of mold spores -- do you sense transformation and upheaval. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Ann Toebbe: 'Rooms' (closes on Saturday) The seven modest-size mixed-media paintings in Ann Toebbe's fine New York City solo debut depict psychologically fraught domestic interiors from the artist's past, viewed from above, the wall's flattened so all the furnishings and ornamental details are visible. From photographs she reconstitutes her mother's childhood bedroom; magically, from memory or hearsay, she recreates a neighbor's living room, which was routinely decorated entirely in blue in honor of the Virgin Mary who was said to have appeared there in a vision. Monya Rowe Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com. (Cotter)
Galleries: SoHo
&#x2605; 'Mel Bochner: Proposition and Process: A Theory of Sculpture (1968-1973)' (through June 29) This beautiful exhibition is a veritable time capsule. It shows the artist's pioneering Conceptual works in a setting redolent of the early artist-oriented, pre-retail era of SoHo -- which is when they were made. Defiantly modest, they parse Minimalist space, measuring it openly with non-Minimalist objects (small stones, walnuts, burned matches) often annotated with writing or drawing in chalk, repeatedly locating the place where language, counting and dimensional experience overlap, to the confusion and excitement of eye and mind. Peter Freeman, 140 Grand Street, between Crosby and Lafayette Streets, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com. (Smith)
Andreas Schulze: 'Windows' (through June 23) After a 13-year absence from New York, this terrific German artist has had two exhibitions at this gallery in 14 months. The second features deadpan renderings of recognizably Northern European windows, stoutly framed, often with sturdy metal handles and, always, a view that suggests the arrival of cloud-parting light. The basic nature of painting as a window on an illusionistic world is evoked, with the handles signaling both our disbelief and its suspension. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgal.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Other
Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 316-7490, stjohndivine.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Margaret Weber (through June 23) Recycled industrial carpets are Ms. Weber's thing. In her impressive solo debut she methodically picks apart big swaths of them, layer by layer and thread by thread. Her subtractive handiwork relaxes these slyly pictorial postminimal artworks that retain something of their previous corporate status. Especially indicative of her eco-friendly reverse craft is ''Eater,'' which resembles an unusually elegant version of 1970s fiber art. Ramiken Crucible, 389 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (917) 434-4245, ramikencrucible.com. (Smith)
Out of Town
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
Last Chance
Rodney Graham (closes on Saturday) In four giant photographic transparencies mounted on lightboxes, the versatile Vancouver artist Mr. Graham ponders a man's middle age with comical ennui. Each is a fictional self-portrait of the artist as a construction worker, a scientist, an aging punk and an old hippie in a kayak. They are funny and touching because of the disproportionate relationship between their grandiose scale and their goofy images, which resemble those of downbeat Father's Day greeting cards. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)
Aiko Hachisuka (closes on Friday) The five colorful works in this New York debut distinguish themselves from the increasingly crowded field of stuffed fabric sculptures with their deliberation, complexity and wonderful sleights of hand. From certain viewpoints, they suggest giant, colorfully glazed ceramic planters or tangled bodies but are actually individually stuffed garments carefully stitched together, with paint applied in random shardlike patterns. Soft, cuddly friendliness contrasts with astute, slightly mysterious art-making. Eleven Rivington, 11 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-1930, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
Paul Klee: 'The Bauhaus Years' (closes on Friday) During this decade (1921-31), the artist continued to adapt such modernist staples as flatness, abstraction, the grid and evident process to his own carefully tended cosmos and its denizens. In addition, the etching-like lines of his drawings yield a richly physical repertory of scratches and scrapes in his paintings and even, beneath the sand-colored surface of ''The Snake,'' some Pollock-like drips. Dickinson, 19 East 66th Street, (212) 772-8083, simondickinson.com. (Smith)
Paul Klee: 'Early and Late Years, 1894-1940' (closes on Friday) This delightful exhibition explores the artist's brilliant use of line from his tiny forays into Cubism to the sometimes anguished works of his final years, with their larger scale and rougher rendering. Don't miss the drawing-over-drawing of ''Nude of a Girl'' of 1931 or ''The Sick Heart'' of 1939, a field of notational motifs that presages Philip Guston, Peter Saul and Elizabeth Murray. Moeller Fine Art, 35 East 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 644-2133, moellerfineart.com. (Smith)
James Little: 'Never Say Never' (closes on Tuesday) This linear arrangement of this abstract artist gets more complex every time out, the colors subtler and richer. In the new paintings panels of thin vertical strips are like curtains parting to reveal a center-stage dance of optically charged zigs and zags. The colors are like primaries melted and cushioned by a haze: red, yellow and blue become brick-brown, mustard and bluegrass-green. Jazzy but stately is the mood. June Kelly Gallery, 166 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-1660, junekellygallery.com. (Cotter)
Montclair Art Museum: 'The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913' (closes on Sunday) The Armory Show opened 100 years ago in Manhattan, introducing to Americans the shocking works of van Gogh, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse and Duchamp and other European avant-gardists along with less adventurous efforts by hundreds of homegrown artists. This much more modest, centennial show presents a selection of works by artists who were included, most of them Americans. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Marsden Hartley and John Sloan stand out, but a small, vibrant pastoral scene by Matisse shows how far behind the avant-garde curve the Americans lagged. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Montclair Art Museum: 'Oscar Bluemner's America: Picturing Paterson, New Jersey' (closes on Sunday) This lovely, small show presents works dating from 1910 to 1917 when the American Modernist Bluemner was catching up on European avant-garde developments. He combined realism and Cubism in paintings of farm buildings in rural landscapes and the industrial architecture of Paterson, his hometown. Favoring glowing reds and blues and opaque blacks, he painted images that seem illuminated from within like modern stained-glass windows. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
G.T. Pellizzi: 'The Red and the Black' (closes on Thursday) If you've ever hankered to buy a piece of hot art property on the Lower East Side, here's your chance. G.T. Pellizzi is selling square-foot sections of his attractive red-walled, black-carpeted installation, with the price of each slice determined by local real estate values. When the walls are finally cut up and distributed on the exhibition's closing day, buyers can claim works that are both vivid abstractions but also, in economic terms, the equivalent of cold hard cash. Y Gallery, 165 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (917) 721-4539, ygallerynewyork.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Richard Serra: 'Early Work' (closes on Saturday) This terrific exhibition looks back on five formative years in the career of Mr. Serra, one of the world's most admired living sculptors. One room contains objects made of lead, rubber, wood and stone produced by basic actions like cutting, folding and tearing. A second gallery features works made by propping up 4-by-4-foot lead panels and a single slab of hot-rolled steel, 8 feet tall and 24 feet long, that juts from a corner into the room with grand implacability. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 517-8677, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Marianne Vitale: 'Diamond Crossing' (closes on Saturday) This startling show consists of a single, room-filling objet trouvé titled ''Diamond Crossing.'' The object is an intersection of steel railroad tracks, minus the ties, acquired from a salvage yard in Pennsylvania. From a molded, diamond-shape center, parallel rails extend diagonally to each of the gallery four corners. Weighing in at five tons, the whole construction is slightly elevated on wooden, two-by-four blocks so that it seems to float slightly off the floor. Zach Feuer Gallery, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Johnson)
Robert Zakanitch: 'Hanging Gardens' (closes on Saturday) The veteran Pattern and Decoration painter is showing flower-filled works in gouache and colored pencil on immense pieces of unframed paper. The dense cascading blooms -- based on wisteria or largely invented -- fill the surface, conjuring the exquisitely botanical, the nearly abstract and wallpaper, often at the same time. Light flows through their ravishing abundance. Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 520 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 966-6676, nancyhoffmangallery.com. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Religion And Inequality

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
About a century ago, Walter Judd was a 17-year-old boy hoping to go to college at the University of Nebraska. His father pulled him aside and told him that, though the family had happily paid for Judd's two sisters to go to college, Judd himself would get no money for tuition or room and board.
His father explained that he thought his son might one day go on to become a fine doctor, but he had also seen loose tendencies. Some hard manual labor during college would straighten him out. 
Judd took the train to the university, arrived at the station at 10:30 and by 12:15 had found a job washing dishes at the cafeteria of the Y.M.C.A. He did that job every day of his first year, rising at 6 each morning, not having his first college date until the last week of the school year.
Judd went on to become a doctor, a daring medical missionary and a prominent member of Congress between 1943 and 1963. The anecdote is small, but it illustrates a few things. First, that, in those days, it was possible to work your way through college doing dishes. More important, that people then were more likely to assume that jobs at the bottom of the status ladder were ennobling and that jobs at the top were morally perilous. That is to say, the moral status system was likely to be the inverse of the worldly status system. The working classes were self-controlled, while the rich and the professionals could get away with things.
These mores, among other things, had biblical roots. In the Torah, God didn't pick out the most powerful or notable or populous nation to be his chosen people. He chose a small, lowly band. The Torah is filled with characters who are exiles or from the lower reaches of society who are, nonetheless, chosen for pivotal moments: Moses, Joseph, Saul, David and Esther.
In the New Testament, Jesus blesses the poor, ''for yours is the kingdom of God.'' But ''woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.''
In Corinthians, Jesus tells the crowds, ''Not many of you were wise by worldly standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.''
Under this rubric, your place is not determined by worldly accomplishments, but simply through an acceptance of God's grace. As Paul Tillich put it in a passage recently quoted on Andrew Sullivan's blog, ''Do not seek for anything; do not perform anything; do not intend anything. Simply accept the fact that you are accepted.''
This inverse hierarchy took secular form. Proletarian novels and movies made the working class the moral bedrock of the nation. In Frank Capra movies like ''Meet John Doe,'' the common man is the salt of the earth, while the rich are suspect. It wasn't as if Americans renounced worldly success (this is America!), but there were rival status hierarchies: the biblical hierarchy, the working man's hierarchy, the artist's hierarchy, the intellectual's hierarchy, all of which questioned success and denounced those who climbed and sold out.
Over the years, religion has played a less dominant role in public culture. Meanwhile, the rival status hierarchies have fallen away. The meritocratic hierarchy of professional success is pretty much the only one left standing.
As a result, people are less ambivalent about commerce. We use economic categories, like ''human capital'' and ''opportunity costs,'' in a wide range of spheres. People are less worried about what William James called the ''moral flabbiness'' of the ''bitch-goddess success,'' and are more likely to use professional standing as a measure of life performance.
Words like character, which once suggested traits like renunciation that held back success, now denote traits like self-discipline, which enhance it.
Many rich people once felt compelled to try to square their happiness at being successful with their embarrassment about it. They adopted what Charles Murray calls a code of seemliness (no fancy clothes or cars). Not long ago, many people covered their affluence with a bohemian patina, but that patina has grown increasingly thin.
Now most of us engage in more matter-of-fact boasting: the car stickers that describe the driver's summers on Martha's Vineyard, the college window stickers, the mass embrace of luxury brands, even the currency of ''likes'' on Facebook and Reddit as people unabashedly seek popularity.
The culture was probably more dynamic when there were competing status hierarchies. When there is one hegemonic hierarchy, as there is today, the successful are less haunted by their own status and the less successful have nowhere to hide.

HEADLINE: Father Takes the Stage; Daughter, the Court

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The pioneering American composer of the title serves as referee between a father and daughter in ''Charles Ives Take Me Home,'' a slight but inventive new play by Jessica Dickey that opened on Thursday at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. Although he died in 1954, well before the play's events take place, Ives and his ministrations in the emotional tug of war between John Starr (Drew McVety) and his daughter, Laura (Kate Nowlin), make a kind of spiritual sense. The father-daughter conflict arises from their differing passions -- music and sports -- and Ives was a gifted amateur athlete and a composer of genius.
John is a professional violinist who has dedicated his life to music and watches with increasing bewilderment and dismay as Laura shows no enthusiasm for his great love. Instead, she is equally devoted to a pastime about which he is totally indifferent: basketball. 
Henry Stram, playing Ives, also performs the role of genial master of ceremonies in Ms. Dickey's comedy-drama. As the play begins, he steps forward to greet us, looking tweedy and slightly mad-professorial, and delivers a fresher-than-usual introductory speech in which he thanks us for turning off the usual devices (yawn). But he then adds as an afterthought: ''Thank you for kindly tolerating whatever distractions your neighbor causes. You may also now thank your neighbor for tolerating you: your elbows, your pocketbook on the floor (the fashion ever larger), your emotional life, your fatigue.''
And there's more: ''Thank you for chuckling at any and all attempts at comedy. Thank you for your comedy. For the great folly that you are.''
Ives presides as a slightly eccentric visitor throughout the play, offering whimsical flights of lyricism that have some of the surprise of his music, which also has a presence in the show: Mr. Stram plays the piano and Mr. McVety plays his own violin, both creditably, in short snippets from Ives pieces, including his early variations on the song ''America'' and the ''Concord Sonata.''
After Mr. Stram's smiling Ives has receded, Ms. Nowlin barrels into view, in coaching attire, and proceeds to browbeat her team -- the audience -- for their poor performance in the first half of a game. Leather-tough and not afraid to play the bad guy (clearly she hasn't been reading the sports pages lately, but then the play takes place in 1987), Coach Laura makes it clear that nothing but superhuman effort will satisfy. Ms. Nowlin's glowering pep talk was so convincing I felt myself wilting in my seat, ready to race back on the court and spill blood if need be.
The play, a brisk 80 minutes, consists primarily of scenes from Laura's youth, when the seeds of resentment between father and daughter were planted. John has recently separated from his wife, and he's having trouble making ends meet and paying child support on the salary of a violinist in the Queens Symphony Orchestra.
A Juilliard grad who continually hopes for better things -- he considers each performance, rather quixotically, an audition for the New York Philharmonic -- John tries repeatedly to instill in his daughter his love of music. But young Laura, at just 8 years old, has already found her own calling: the basketball court. And she is just as absorbed in its details as John is in his music.
As the years pass they never find much common ground. John retains a willful belief that his daughter's obsession is a passing phase. Eventually I felt his intransigence pushed past the bounds of truth: Would a loving father, who gave up a chance to join the Frankfurt Symphony because it would mean separation from Laura, really remain so cruelly dismissive?
But then John's resentment has deep roots in his own psyche: while his mother encouraged his interests, John's father was a jock who was disappointed in his son's lackluster athletic abilities. John and Laura are enacting the same drama of estrangement a generation later.
Adults playing children is often troublesome, and Ms. Nowlin is so authoritative and commanding as the grown Laura that she's never quite convincing as the young girl. But then ''Charles Ives Take Me Home'' is an impressionistic, stylized play: Ives is primarily an apparition conjured by John, who once took a class with him at Juilliard and who lingers in his imagination as the father figure he never had.
Fluently directed by Daniella Topol, the play features terrific performances from all three actors and is dappled with passages that cut deeper than the surface conflict. In one scene Ives comforts John with an unusual observation: ''When you lose your father, the trees lean down.'' Continuing as if this were a perfectly natural occurrence, he clarifies: ''The trees aren't leaning down. The sky is closer ... The universe is stretching out above you. And there is nothing there. There is nothing there.''
Although Ms. Dickey does not, in the end, provide many interesting variations on the father-daughter tensions at the heart of the play, ''Charles Ives Take Me Home'' suggests she is a talent to watch: her writing has freshness, economy, an occasional cheeky vulgarity and a fine measure of poetic insight.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Takes the Stage, and the Speculation Heats Up

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- She's come home.
After a temporary tour as a lieutenant in President Obama's army, Hillary Rodham Clinton rejoined the Clinton family business on Thursday and went right to work on one of its main objectives: advancing the Clinton brand.
Mrs. Clinton appeared alongside her husband, Bill Clinton, in a crowded ballroom here and left little doubt that she planned to reclaim the political stage she exited more than four years ago to become the nation's top diplomat. 
At the annual gathering of the foundation established by her husband, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that plunged her back into the heart of the conversation about the country's future, highlighting the need for creating jobs for young people and expanding early childhood development programs.
''In too many places in our own country, community institutions are crumbling,'' she said, expressing concern about ''disconnected young men in our society.''
Mrs. Clinton also pledged to continue her work of expanding opportunities for women and girls as she moves into her new role at what has been renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
''This is truly a labor of love for our entire family,'' she said.
The convention here in downtown Chicago had been billed as the foundation's effort to bring together leaders from the business, nonprofit and government sectors to discuss ways to revive the nation's economy.
But there was little doubt about the main attraction on Thursday, as speculation in and out of the convention site focused on whether Mrs. Clinton's appearance was a sign of her interest in running for president in 2016.
Mrs. Clinton finds herself adjusting to an unfamiliar reality: she holds no government title now for the first time in more than two decades. And she and her aides seem to be grappling with how best to keep her in the news, without the State Department apparatus that provided an elevated stage for her during the past four years.
While she has said she just wants to ''sleep and exercise and travel for fun'' after leaving the State Department, her appearance on Thursday was clearly intended to ensure that she does not drift too far from public attention. Her aides alerted journalists days before that her appearance would be a significant event.
The convention -- which is scheduled to run through Friday -- showed the passions the Clintons continue to generate. The ballroom was packed with hundreds of admirers, and the guest list included some big names in finance, politics, government and entertainment: Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary; Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs; Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; and Eva Longoria, the actress and political activist.
And yet Mrs. Clinton's speech underscored the gap that still exists between the fervent enthusiasm of her admirers, who rose from their chairs and clapped madly when she walked onstage -- and her deliberate and cautious manner. At times during her speech, she came across as dryly academic, citing studies and statistics.
The speech was notable, too, in what she did not dwell on: there was barely any mention of Mr. Obama as Mrs. Clinton seemed to turn the page on that chapter, and bask once again in her husband's embrace.
The warm reception from the crowd was a far cry from the public battering that Mrs. Clinton has received in recent months.
Indeed, the popularity she has enjoyed in the polls during much of her term dropped in recent weeks, as Republicans in Washington have intensified an investigation into possible lapses at the State Department that may have left an American diplomatic station in Benghazi, Libya, vulnerable to a deadly attack last year.
There has been other potentially damaging news, including the recent disclosure of a report by a State Department investigator asserting that high-ranking officials under Mrs. Clinton tried to cover up allegations that American diplomats and security agents solicited prostitutes.
Mrs. Clinton, who has been working on a memoir, has undertaken a gradual effort to re-engage politically and otherwise after years of remaining above the partisan fray and focusing on diplomacy. In March, she released a video announcing that she was reversing her earlier position and endorsing same-sex marriage.
And this week, she opened a Twitter account with a profile that described her as ''wife, mom, lawyer, women & kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD...''

BYLINE: By DEALBOOK

 BODY:
The proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of Cooper Tire and Rubber by Apollo Tyres speaks to the ambitions of an Indian company seeking to become the seventh-biggest tire maker in the world. 
It would be the biggest takeover of a United States company by one based in India since the global financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. And it is a deal intended to help the 41-year-old company compete better in a global automotive supply chain dominated by giants.
At home, however, the deal has run into something of a large road bump.
Shares of Apollo plummeted 25.45 percent in trading in Mumbai on Thursday, their first day of trading after the transaction was announced in the United States on Wednesday. The plunge came amid investor concerns about the amount of debt the company was taking on to finance the deal.
The all-cash acquisition is being financed entirely by new debt. Apollo has committed debt financing for $450 million from Standard Chartered, and nearly $2.4 billion in committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered.
Analysts in India were scathing about the leveraged deal.
Noting that Apollo's ratio of net debt to equity would go from negative 0.5 times equity to 4.8 times, analysts at IIFL Capital gave the stock a ''sell'' recommendation. ''We highlight that a weakening balance sheet is a key concern,'' they wrote.
Analysts at Emkay wrote: ''We see this as a risky acquisition as the management would have little room for error given the high leverage, very little synergy benefits and the poor demand environment.''
Analysts at Ambit said they found the proposed acquisition of Cooper ''aggressive'' even while commending Apollo as ''one of the best-managed tire companies in India.''
Still, they hastened to add that ''over 80 percent of great companies in India self-destruct through a combination of overconfidence and unbridled expansion.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Urging Conservatives To Back an Overhaul

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The former governors Jeb Bush of Florida and Haley Barbour of Mississippi, two of the Republican Party's most outspoken advocates of overhauling the nation's immigration laws, urged conservatives on Thursday to ''change the conversation'' on immigration by arguing that immigrant workers, both high-skilled and low-wage, are essential for economic growth. 
In a moderated discussion before reporters at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit research group, both Republicans said they generally supported a bill under debate in the Senate and were guardedly optimistic that overhaul legislation would pass Congress this year.
Their comments highlighted the rift among conservatives over the bill, which includes a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants here illegally. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Republican who is a leading opponent of the measure, said this week on the Senate floor that it would bring an influx of foreign workers that ''would be disastrous for the wages and job prospects of U.S. workers.''
Mr. Bush, the son and brother of former presidents who is the perennial subject of speculation about his own White House aspirations, said he was advising Republican lawmakers to shift from a focus on illegal immigration to emphasize ''how do you create a strategy of sustained economic growth.'' Both men said the economy would need foreign workers to replace and sustain an aging American labor force.
''That is a winning conversation in conservative America for sure,'' Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush said he agreed with the 13-year pathway to citizenship in the Senate bill, which includes requirements to learn English and to pay back taxes and fines, saying it ''reaches the proper balance'' between the rule of law and the nation's immigrant heritage. Mr. Bush, in a book he published this year, had raised doubts on his views of citizenship for those immigrants.

HEADLINE: Employment and Retail Sales Record Recent Gains

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Economists were encouraged by reports on Thursday that applications last week for unemployment benefits fell and that retail sales rose 0.6 percent in May from April. 
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 334,000, a decline that suggests steady job gains will endure.
The less volatile four-week average decreased 7,250 to 345,250, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Both figures are roughly 7,000 higher than a month ago, which were the lowest in five years.
Applications, a proxy for layoffs, have fallen 6.5 percent since January, suggesting that employers were cutting fewer jobs.
At the same time, hiring has been steady. Employers added 175,000 jobs in May, the department said last week. That nearly matched the monthly average for the previous year. The unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent because more Americans were confident they could find work and began searching for a job.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that retail sales increased 0.6 percent last month, showing that consumers remained resilient despite higher taxes and could drive faster growth later this year.
''The retail sales result is a plus, no question,'' said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets. ''And the improving trend in jobless claims is supportive for future spending.''
About 4.5 million people received unemployment benefits in the week that ended May 25, the latest data available. That is 130,000 fewer than the previous week. The number of people receiving benefits fell 29 percent in the last year. Some of those recipients probably found jobs, but many probably used all the benefits available to them.
The economy grew at a solid annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in more than two years.
The Commerce Department also reported that businesses increased their stockpiles in April but their sales fell for a second straight month, constrained by a decline in orders to American factories.
Stockpiles rose 0.3 percent in April from March, after a decline of 0.1 percent in March from February.
Sales slipped 0.1 percent in April, after a sharp 1.2 percent drop in March. The figures represent the first back-to-back sales declines in nearly a year, although the weakness was concentrated in manufacturing.
More restocking bolsters economic growth because it means companies are ordering more manufactured goods. In April, retailers increased restocking 0.4 percent to lead all categories. Manufacturing and wholesale stockpiles grew 0.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Who Will Succeed President Ahmadinejad?

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Even before the vote on Friday, Iran's presidential election has to be seen as deeply flawed. The Guardian Council that vets candidates disqualified more than 600 potential contenders, including Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president. Only six names are on the ballot, all men who are acceptable to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's real power. Reformers who led protests after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's fraudulent 2009 re-election remain under house arrest, and there has been a new crackdown on newspapers, political activists and foreign journalists. 
Despite such failings, the election is important because it gives Iran and the United States a fresh diplomatic opportunity to avoid a dangerous confrontation over Iran's nuclear program. On the Iranian side, the chance of engagement is bleak but not impossible. While the candidates all support Islamic rule, campaign debates suggested differences on the economy, women's rights, even foreign policy. For instance, while they all assert Iran's right to a peaceful nuclear program, Saeed Jalili, Iran's doctrinaire nuclear negotiator, has drawn criticism for failing to make progress on a deal with the major powers that would ease punishing sanctions in exchange for curbing the program. His rivals, especially Hassan Rowhani, a former nuclear negotiator who is seen as a moderate and the West's best hope, hinted at a more pragmatic approach.
The administration has kept up the pressure by tightening sanctions. Once the election is over, it also needs to step up diplomatic efforts, testing through intermediaries if there is any willingness by the new president, and Mr. Khamenei, to consider a more comprehensive agreement -- dealing with Syria, among other issues -- than the narrowly focused nuclear proposal that the United States and its allies have outlined so far.
Tensions are higher now that Iran has inserted itself directly into the Syrian civil war on the side of President Bashar al-Assad. But President Obama needs to be clearheaded about the core American interest, doing whatever he can diplomatically to rein in an Iranian nuclear program that could quickly produce a weapon.

HEADLINE: Pivot to a Trans-Atlantic Market

BYLINE: By MARTA DASSÙ and CHARLES A. KUPCHAN

 BODY:
Yes, the United States is pivoting to Asia, one of the reasons for the tête-à-tête last week between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping. But behind the scenes, President Obama has actually been reorienting U.S. diplomacy toward Europe.
At the outset of his second term, Obama unfurled a bold initiative -- the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T.T.I.P., to facilitate free trade between the United States and the European Union. The president is headed to Berlin next week to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the euro crisis, the global economy, and defense and other issues. No doubt he will also sing the praises of U.S.-European cooperation. 
The United States is rediscovering the Atlantic even as it deepens its engagement in Asia. The challenge for Europe is to seize the opportunity when European trade ministers meet on Friday to decide whether to start negotiations on the trade deal, which the European Commission has said could add 0.5 percent to the E.U. economy and 0.4 percent to the U.S. economy by 2027.
The main impetus behind America's tilt back to Europe is economic -- something of a paradox given that Europe's economy is in the doldrums. To be sure, trade with Asia offers more upside potential than commerce across the Atlantic; this is precisely why the United States is simultaneously pursuing a trade deal there, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But a Pacific pact will be a much harder sell domestically and could well run afoul of rising geopolitical tensions with China. Meanwhile, the chances of a global trade deal are virtually nil.
With the United States in a hurry to eke out more growth, the trans-Atlantic market is the place to look. The proposed Atlantic pact promises to boost growth on both sides of the pond. According to one official assessment it could create 400,000 jobs and boost the E.U. economy by &#x20ac;119 billion a year and the American economy by &#x20ac;95 billion.
The United States would benefit not only from an uptick in growth and employment. Washington is also eager to do what it can to help the European Union climb out of its economic and political crisis; growth and jobs are the best antidote.
Europe's main goal is to reap the benefits of tying the Union -- the world's largest trading power -- to the American economy, which is gradually coming back to life. In light of the fiscal constraints facing E.U. member states, an economic pact with the United States is one of the few options available for stimulating growth and employment.
Moreover, tighter trans-Atlantic regulations and standards would serve as a lever for the completion of the E.U.'s single market. In addition, the Atlantic trade pact offers Europe a hedge against political and economic isolation at a time when its traditional American ally will be expanding its commercial footprint in Asia.
A trans-Atlantic trade deal could have implications well beyond the United States and the European Union. The two economies represent roughly half of the world's output, meaning that the pact has the potential to serve as a global standard -- a model that other regions might seek to emulate.
Finally, a trans-Atlantic free trade area would bring geopolitical as well as economic gains. The two sides of the Atlantic need to refurbish liberal democracy and free-market capitalism at a time when the spread of Western values seems to be stalling. The Arab Awakening has done more to fuel political Islam than liberal democracy. State capitalism is alive and well in Russia and China. Under these circumstances, the United States and Europe need to show renewed solidarity in defense of a liberal international order.
Turning the world's premier security alliance into the world's premier economic pact won't be easy. In both the United States and the European Union, the tyranny of narrow interests has the potential to trump the collective good -- a considerable risk in light of the populist sentiments that economic duress has stoked on both sides of the Atlantic.
Nonetheless, leaders on both sides must make the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership a reality, keeping a firm eye on the final goal. Europe, in particular, will have to be cohesive from the start.
It may well prove to be a Pacific century, buoyed by Asia's economic dynamism. But at least for now, the United States and Europe remain bound at the hip -- an enduring, perhaps reassuring, reality amid a world in flux.

HEADLINE: In Reprieves, Hint of Immigration Bill's Impact

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
One found a job as a teacher's assistant at a center for children with autism. Another became a kitchen designer in Manhattan for an Italian company and is setting up his own general contracting firm. A third started driving a taxi to help pay for college.
They are among more than 291,000 immigrants who have been granted temporary reprieves from deportation under a program President Obama announced last June.
The program, which is open to young people who were brought to the United States as children and are here illegally, allows them to obtain a Social Security number, apply for driver's licenses and work.
As Congress considers an immigration package, with debate in the Senate beginning this week, the program's impact suggests how the lives of the nation's 11 million immigrants in the country illegally might be transformed by a broader overhaul. 
In interviews, those who have received the reprieve, known as deferred action, said it had changed things in numerous ways, from the practical to the emotional, the mundane to the profound. Many talked about being able to walk out their front door for the first time without fear that a wrong turn could lead to deportation proceedings.
''I'm a human here in this country now; I didn't feel like I was before,'' said Luis Rey Ramirez, 26, a Mexican graphic designer who grew up in the Bronx and was granted the deferral in April. ''I feel like I can just navigate this country easier in a legal way, in a way that I can contribute.''
Yet the young immigrants' elation is tempered by concerns over the program's future.
Should immigration legislation fail and the next president cancel the policy, the recipients might lose their privileges and once again face the possibility of deportation. In the meantime, the program does not grant them permanent residency, and the reprieve from deportation is temporary, subject to renewal after two years. It may also be revoked should a recipient commit a crime or otherwise violate the terms of the program.
A federal official said ''only a handful'' of immigrants had had their deferred action terminated.
Last week, in a vote along party lines, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives adopted an amendment to a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would shut down the program.
Some opponents of the program have gone to court. In a case in Dallas, a federal district judge said in a ruling in April that he was doubtful about the program's legality, suggesting that the president had overstepped his authority and that only Congress could approve such a temporary reprieve from deportation.
The case was brought by 10 immigration agents, who are being represented by Kris W. Kobach, a Republican who is the Kansas secretary of state and a prominent voice in the movement against an immigration overhaul.
The judge, Reed O'Connor, postponed issuing an injunction and asked both sides to submit more information.
Still, whatever the fate of the program, it has already demonstrated the political power of the immigration issue. Mr. Obama's decision to approve deferred action has been widely credited with helping to rally the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election.
While mindful of the threats to the program, many of those who have already been approved said they were pressing ahead.
''It's sort of like an inspiration to get things done faster, to really go ahead and take advantage of the status, because in reality, we don't know if it will be renewed,'' said Jasniya Sanchez, 26, a Mexican immigrant.
Ms. Sanchez was hired as academic coordinator for Qualitas of Life Foundation, which offers financial advice to Latino immigrant families in New York. She had volunteered there for years.
One of the first things Ms. Sanchez did after receiving the reprieve last November was to apply for her Social Security number and a New York State ID. Several weeks ago, with her new ID in hand, she went on a work trip to Dallas and Chicago, boarding planes for the first time since she arrived in the United States in 1999.
For many, government IDs -- particularly driver's licenses -- have come to symbolize their new status.
Cristina Jiménez, managing director at United We Dream, the nation's largest national network of young immigrants, said its members frequently posted photographs of themselves on Facebook, posing with their new licenses. ''To mainstream America, it may not seem like a big deal,'' she said. ''But to people in our community, it's a huge deal.''
For many recipients, the lives they lived before receiving the reprieve were not always underground. They attended schools and universities, many held jobs and some have been outspoken activists for immigration reform and other causes.
But they did this under severe constraints: though illegal immigrants can legally attend public school and are allowed to attend many colleges and universities, they are barred from many scholarship and tuition-assistance programs and cannot be legally employed.
Making ends meet was tough. So, upon receiving the reprieve, recipients have quickly shifted from the shadow economy to legal employment.
Erika Flores, 24, who has lived in New York City since she immigrated from Mexico when she was 4, said that until the announcement of the deferred-action policy, she braced for a sudden dead end in her life.
But the policy coincided with her completion of a master's program focusing on early childhood special education, and she was recently hired as a teacher's assistant in an early intervention center on the Lower East Side, where she works with children with autism.
''I sort of felt relieved that I didn't go to school for nothing and could go and do what I want to do, like everyone else in this country,'' she said. ''I can go out and execute what I learned, working with kids.''
Javier Santos, 29, who studied architecture at New York City College of Technology and volunteered at Asociación Tepeyac, an advocacy group for immigrants, was hired as a full-time designer at a luxury kitchen-manufacturing company within weeks of receiving the reprieve. He is using his Social Security number and work authorization to apply for a general contractor license so that he and his father, a construction worker in the country illegally, can start a business together.
He is also considering opening a restaurant with his mother.
''My parents brought me here for a better future,'' he said. ''And after all that hard work they did, I'm able to help them out.''
For many, the impact of the program has been as much emotional as practical.
''There is a sense of belonging at last,'' said Kamal Essaheb, 31, who came to the United States from Morocco when he was 11 and received deferred action in January. ''I was lawfully present -- finally -- after being here for 20 years.''
Byron Adriano Pullutasig, 20, an Ecuadorean immigrant, said he obtained a driver's license and a job driving a taxi, even as he is pursuing a double major in physics and sociology at Queens College. He has become more involved in political activities and was elected to be a senator in the college's student government.
Deferred action, he explained, ''gave me confidence in myself that I can do a lot more than I could when I was undocumented, because I felt like I had nothing to fear.''
David Chung, 22, an immigrant from South Korea, said he had been planning to return there after college because he did not think that he had a future in the United States. Now, he is working as a paralegal at the MinKwon Center for Community Action, an immigrant advocacy group in Queens. ''I had gotten so much from this country, and I wanted to give back as well,'' he said.
With his new status, he has reveled in each new rite of passage, like qualifying for a driver's license and finding a job -- even, he added, filling out a federal tax return for the first time.

HEADLINE: A Constellation of Identities, Winking and Shifting

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
International art biennials can be lavish affairs, with big budgets, big art and participants flying in from hither and yon. But in the present lean times, even high-profile shows are feeling a pinch, and local ones like ''La Bienal 2013,'' at El Museo del Barrio, survive simply as labors of love on the part of all concerned.
Like many small public museums, El Museo has basically no money, or very little. How the place keeps its lights on, I don't know. But as the major museum devoted to Latino art and culture in this Latino city, it is indispensable, and knows that, and does what it has to do to keep moving. And so the seventh edition of its bienal, this one with the proactive title ''Here Is Where We Jump,'' has arrived.
It's a show with few long-distance travelers; although many of its 37 artists were born elsewhere, most live and work in New York. And most of that work is modest in its materials and size, scaled to small studios. 
Despite, or maybe even because of, such limitations, the show is a good one, thoughtful and personal, uneven in parts, solid as a whole.
It's also a product of that old-fashioned thing, the ethnically specific museum. Even with definitions of ethnicity stretched all kinds of ways -- what does ''Latino'' really mean anymore, anyway? -- the issue of identity remains at the core of such institutions, and informs much of the work in this show.
In a sense, this is another handicap. The New York art market, in thrall to fat-cat formalism, has long since turned its back on identity-as-content. Yet, as anyone aware of the storms surrounding immigration laws knows, who you are and where you came from continue to be matters of life-shaping importance, and the exhibition treats them that way.
The approach can be subtle, oblique and wry, as in a tabletop installation of sculptures in the first gallery. The table is from Ikea; the sculptures -- of human heads, a skull and a few animal forms -- could be either home-decorator accessories or pre-Columbian grave finds. The piece, a witty little altar to middle-class chic and the dead, is by Miguel Cárdenas, born in 1985 in Bogotá, Colombia, and one of several 20-somethings here for whom ethnic identity is an outfit to be lightly worn, mixed and matched with other identities, and continually updated.
A nearby piece by Alex Nuñez, born in 1984 in Miami, mixes its messages in a similar way. A collage painting of a large, smiling face, it's based on a photograph of the rapper Russell Tyrone Jones, a k a Ol' Dirty Bastard, or ODB, a founding member of the Wu-Tang Clan, who died of a drug overdose in 2004 at the age of 35. In Ms. Nuñez's portrait, he's both a clown and a king: his smile is goofy, but with his empty eyes and gold-leaf skin, he is as monumental as a Mesoamerican funerary mask.
It's interesting how young artists introduce darkness into their art, indirectly, with a slight delay.
In El Museo's lobby, a wall drawing by Ernest Concepción, born in 1977 in the Philippines, depicts El Museo and buildings farther east caught up in a kind of whirlwind. It's a fantastic image, out of a digital disaster film, but with a grain of factuality: the barrio really is being blown apart by gentrification.
Change, alternately viewed as progress or destruction, is the essence of El Museo's history. Virtually since it opened in 1969 as an artist-run space in an East Harlem storefront, debates have arisen over its mission. Was it to provide what was then a largely Puerto Rican neighborhood with a museum to call its own? Or to give Latino artists a platform from which to shoot for recognition in the city's larger art world?
When the institution moved in 1977 to its current building, on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, putting physical distance between itself and the barrio, proprietorial tensions increased. They've been a source of discord and splintering; at the same time, they've kept this institution off balance in a productive way, preventing it from settling into a fixed vision of what a ''Latino'' institution should be, keeping it both local and cosmopolitan. In a sense, not quite knowing what to do with identity, and using confusion creatively, is the institutional story here, and it's reflected in the bienal.
In any given gallery we find identity-intensive work in proximity with work that appears to be, in ethnic terms, identity-free. In one gallery a mask and headdress made from street finds by Sean Paul Gallegos addresses Native American heritage, while abstract sculptures by Gabriela Salazar seem to be about getting formally inventive with studio scraps.
Ignacio González-Lang's ''Khinatown,'' a black fabric sculpture in the form of a Ku Klux Klansman, is shot through with histories of racial violence; knitted sculptures of human anatomical parts by Kathleen Granados also refer to histories, but different ones, including the history of feminism.
Three vivid sculptures by Alejandro Guzmán, assembled from plastic flowers, mirrors, feathers and cowrie shells and designed for street performances, evoke an Afro-Caribbean urban culture that once defined much barrio art. By contrast, a cool homage to Barnett Newman by G. T. Pellizzi, in the form of a reconstituted version of a once-vandalized Newman painting, seems to be primarily about museum-enshrined Modernism, and would read that way in any biennial anywhere.
Or would it? Does it really read that way here? Mr. Pellizzi's painting is made from plywood, the stuff of construction sites, not from canvas. His version of Newman's allover blue is the black-blue of police uniforms. In the context of El Museo, painting feels less like a vehicle for metaphysical contemplation than like a blank wall on which the smudgy diaristic drawings of Kenny Rivero might advantageously be arranged, or like a screen onto which the colonialist histories of Latin America referred to by other artists -- Hector Arce-Espasas, Ramón Miranda Beltrán and Christopher Rivera -- might be projected.
Some of this history-driven work is overly didactic or unresolved, but the institutional context does sharpen it, and further strengthens art that is already strong. The self-punishing performances of Élan Jurado, an artist born in 1982 in Texas, have clear sources in the earlier endurance art of Chris Burden and others, but Mr. Jurado's work, seen here in videos, adds new content to the genre. A piece called ''Spew,'' in which the artist repeatedly drinks and violently spits out a black liquid until he is drenched, exhausted and choking, calls up many associations, including certain Abstract Expressionist paintings. But the racial implications of the work stand out in a show that takes race as one of its themes. (Mr. Jurado originally titled it ''Black Spew'' and paired it with a corresponding ''White Spew.'')
Similarly, work by Paula Garcia, one of four Brazilian artists in the bienal, assumes particular meanings here. In a video of a performance from a series called ''Noise Body,'' the artist, dressed in a bulky, heavily magnetized body suit, stands encased in pieces of metal that adhere to her figure. She looks like a robotic conquistador, armored by the very weapons that assault her.
Organized by Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, a curator at El Museo, and Raúl Zamudio, an independent curator, the bienal concludes with work by two artists of different generations installed in the museum's permanent-collection gallery. Manny Vega, born in 1956 in the Bronx and renowned for his street murals and beaded sculptures based on Afro-Caribbean masks, has three wonderful drawings here, including one of the musician Tito Puente. Mr. Vega was part of El Museo in the early days and conveys and preserves its originating Nuyorican sensibility.
The second artist, Pavel Acosta, was born in 1980 in Havana. There, with art supplies hard to come by, he developed a method of composing paintings, collage-fashion, from chips of old paint flaking off city walls. He brings the same technique to a piece called ''Wallscape'' at El Museo. Its image is based on a terrific 1988 painting in the collection by the Dominican artist Manuel Macarrulla, ostensibly of a tropical carnival but really a commentary on colonialist intrusions into the Caribbean. Mr. Acosta stripped white paint from the gallery wall opposite the wall where Mr. Macarrulla's picture hangs, then painstakingly recreated its image from the scrapings, supplementing a dynamic existing art with a mirroring ghost that will haunt the gallery until the bienal is over, then disappear.
''Wallscape'' is, in its exquisite way, an epic performance, a lesson in creative economy, a tribute to existing art, an acknowledgment of ethnicity and its politics, an exercise in personal mastery, and an expression of love for all of that.
''La Bienal 2013: Here Is Where We Jump'' continues through Jan. 4 at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem; (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org.

HEADLINE: Sympathy For The Luddites

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In 1786, the cloth workers of Leeds, a wool-industry center in northern England, issued a protest against the growing use of ''scribbling'' machines, which were taking over a task formerly performed by skilled labor. ''How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families?'' asked the petitioners. ''And what are they to put their children apprentice to?''
Those weren't foolish questions. Mechanization eventually -- that is, after a couple of generations -- led to a broad rise in British living standards. But it's far from clear whether typical workers reaped any benefits during the early stages of the Industrial Revolution; many workers were clearly hurt. And often the workers hurt most were those who had, with effort, acquired valuable skills -- only to find those skills suddenly devalued. 
So are we living in another such era? And, if we are, what are we going to do about it?
Until recently, the conventional wisdom about the effects of technology on workers was, in a way, comforting. Clearly, many workers weren't sharing fully -- or, in many cases, at all -- in the benefits of rising productivity; instead, the bulk of the gains were going to a minority of the work force. But this, the story went, was because modern technology was raising the demand for highly educated workers while reducing the demand for less educated workers. And the solution was more education.
Now, there were always problems with this story. Notably, while it could account for a rising gap in wages between those with college degrees and those without, it couldn't explain why a small group -- the famous ''one percent'' -- was experiencing much bigger gains than highly educated workers in general. Still, there may have been something to this story a decade ago.
Today, however, a much darker picture of the effects of technology on labor is emerging. In this picture, highly educated workers are as likely as less educated workers to find themselves displaced and devalued, and pushing for more education may create as many problems as it solves.
I've noted before that the nature of rising inequality in America changed around 2000. Until then, it was all about worker versus worker; the distribution of income between labor and capital -- between wages and profits, if you like -- had been stable for decades. Since then, however, labor's share of the pie has fallen sharply. As it turns out, this is not a uniquely American phenomenon. A new report from the International Labor Organization points out that the same thing has been happening in many other countries, which is what you'd expect to see if global technological trends were turning against workers.
And some of those turns may well be sudden. The McKinsey Global Institute recently released a report on a dozen major new technologies that it considers likely to be ''disruptive,'' upsetting existing market and social arrangements. Even a quick scan of the report's list suggests that some of the victims of disruption will be workers who are currently considered highly skilled, and who invested a lot of time and money in acquiring those skills. For example, the report suggests that we're going to be seeing a lot of ''automation of knowledge work,'' with software doing things that used to require college graduates. Advanced robotics could further diminish employment in manufacturing, but it could also replace some medical professionals.
So should workers simply be prepared to acquire new skills? The woolworkers of 18th-century Leeds addressed this issue back in 1786: ''Who will maintain our families, whilst we undertake the arduous task'' of learning a new trade? Also, they asked, what will happen if the new trade, in turn, gets devalued by further technological advance?
And the modern counterparts of those woolworkers might well ask further, what will happen to us if, like so many students, we go deep into debt to acquire the skills we're told we need, only to learn that the economy no longer wants those skills?
Education, then, is no longer the answer to rising inequality, if it ever was (which I doubt).
So what is the answer? If the picture I've drawn is at all right, the only way we could have anything resembling a middle-class society -- a society in which ordinary citizens have a reasonable assurance of maintaining a decent life as long as they work hard and play by the rules -- would be by having a strong social safety net, one that guarantees not just health care but a minimum income, too. And with an ever-rising share of income going to capital rather than labor, that safety net would have to be paid for to an important extent via taxes on profits and/or investment income.
I can already hear conservatives shouting about the evils of ''redistribution.'' But what, exactly, would they propose instead?

HEADLINE: Shares Rise Broadly After Upbeat Reports On Retailing and Jobs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Good news about hiring and spending at retail businesses helped send the stock market sharply higher on Thursday.
A pair of government reports offered investors more encouragement that the economic recovery would continue, even as Europe and Japan struggle. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.84 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,636.36.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 180.85 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,176.08. The Nasdaq composite rose 44.94 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,445.37. 
The gains were broad. All 10 industry groups within the S.& P. 500 rose, led by retailers and other consumer-discretionary companies. Gannett, the media company, rose 34 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500, after it said it would buy another media company, Belo, based in Dallas.
''The underlying fundamentals of our economy are clearly doing much better,'' said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Mass.
Markets have been turbulent over the last three weeks. The S.& P. 500 rose 17 percent from the start of the year to May 21 when it hit a high of 1,669. The index began sliding the next day after the Federal Reserve said it would consider pulling back its support for the economy this year.
Since then, the index has fallen as low as 1,608, a trading range of 3.7 percent.
Investors have been debating when the Fed will begin slowing its bond purchases, and they have been worrying about the results. They could get a better sense on Wednesday, when the bank releases its policy statement and when the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, holds another news conference.
''A lot of investors are worried about the Fed,'' said Robert F. Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines. ''That's going to create a bumpy market, at least until they get some clarity on that. But we really think the U.S. is in pretty good shape.''
Mr. Baur said he thought the economic recovery would pick up speed later this year, which could help push corporate earnings and the stock market higher.
The latest positive news came early Thursday when the government said the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell 12,000, to 334,000, below what economists had expected. Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients that the government's weekly numbers, while volatile, ''continue to signal an improving labor market.''
The government also reported that retail sales increased 0.6 percent in May from April. That was up from a 0.1 percent gain in April and the fastest pace since February.
Some investors, like Anton Bayer, the chief executive of Up Capital Management in Granite Bay, Calif., say financial markets will falter when the Fed and other central banks begin to pump less money into the system. The Fed has artificially propped up the economy, he said, which is why investors are nervous about what will happen when the central bank starts buying fewer bonds every month.
''What the markets are seeing is the economic engines are not being primed,'' Mr. Bayer said. ''The fear is of the stimulus going away and exposing an economy that is not really chugging along. It's the big risk.''
The 10-year Treasury note rose 22/32 to 96 15/32, with the yield dropping to 2.15 percent from 2.23 percent late Wednesday.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index slumped 6.4 percent as doubts grew that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic turnaround plan would succeed. The Japanese market is down 20 percent from a high reached on May 22, the definition of a bear market.

HEADLINE: Immigration Cost to Countries Is Overstated, Study Finds

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Public debate about immigration is being distorted by unfounded concerns over the financial burden that new arrivals put on governments, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report on Thursday.
Across the developed world, ''the fiscal impact of immigration is close to zero,'' the organization said in the report, which compares the costs of immigration internationally. ''The current impact of the cumulative waves of migration that arrived over the past 50 years is just not that large,'' it added, ''whether on the positive or negative side.''
The O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris, noted that over the decade 2001-11, immigration was responsible for 40 percent of the population growth in member countries. Nevertheless, that inflow was usually almost irrelevant to overall public expenditures relative to gross domestic product -- ''generally not exceeding 0.5 percent of G.D.P. in either positive or negative terms'' -- as the largest costs to government, like those from military spending, are unaffected by immigration. 
''Immigrants contribute more in tax and social contributions than they get in individual benefits,'' said Jean-Christophe Dumont, the O.E.C.D. official who headed the study. ''That's why the net fiscal impact is mostly positive,'' even if small.
''The public perception is that they take much more out than they put in,'' he said, ''but that's just not the case.''
That message, however, has largely failed to sink in, the O.E.C.D. found, partly because some children of immigrants perform poorly in school and the job market and need government aid. In other cases, politicians find it easy to stereotype immigrants for political gain.
While the study did not address the question of illegal immigration, Mr. Dumont said that ''in most cases,'' such migrants are net contributors, since they pay many taxes but have limited access to public services like education and health.
The O.E.C.D.'s findings were consistent with those of a recent Harvard Medical School study that found immigrants' contributions to Medicare in the United States had helped to create surpluses of $115 billion from 2002 to 2009 in the part of the program that pays for hospital care. That contrasted with a deficit of $28 billion for the American-born population over the same period.
The O.E.C.D. compiled its report using statistical information provided by its member states for 2011, the most recent year for which the complete data were available, as well as some preliminary data for 2012. It noted that in some cases differences in definitions meant that the data were not always precisely compatible across countries.
The organization's 34 members include most of the developed world nations, but exclude important emerging economies like China, Russia, India and Brazil. The organization enters the debate about immigration at a time when high unemployment and tepid economic growth, as well as questions about the viability of social welfare systems, have brought focus to the topic, with the discussion sometimes mixing economic issues and national identity in a politically potent brew.
The O.E.C.D. study found that the average age of immigrant populations affected their fiscal impact: the younger the immigrants, the greater the positive contribution. In a country like the United States, with a young immigrant base and relatively weak social welfare net, the positive impact is great, the study found. By contrast, in Germany, where the immigrant base is skewed toward people who arrived in the 1970s and are now retiring, the picture is more negative.
Asia was the source of 36 percent of all immigration to O.E.C.D. countries in 2011, the study found. China, with 10.3 percent of all immigration to O.E.C.D. nations, was the largest source, while India, at 4.7 percent, ranked fourth. Within Europe, Romania, at 6 percent, ranked second, while Poland, at 5.3 percent, ranked third.
Migrants have suffered more than native-born workers in the economic lethargy of the last few years, the study found, with the average jobless rate among immigrants in the O.E.C.D. rising to 12.9 percent in 2012 from 8.1 percent in 2008, compared with a rise to 8.7 percent, from 5.4 percent, for native-born workers. Immigrant workers were also hurt by long-term unemployment; 44 percent of those who were unemployed in 2012 remained without a job for at least a year, up from 31 percent in 2008.
The study found that the most effective means of ensuring that immigrants made a positive fiscal impact was providing them with adequate access to the labor market. In countries where barriers -- whether that be overt discrimination, insufficient language training or a lack of job-hunting support -- make it hard to find employment, the study found, bringing immigrants onto the same footing as natives could improve their economic contribution significantly.
In the social welfare states of Western Europe, in particular, increasing the employment rate of immigrants relative to native-born workers ''would result in substantial fiscal gains,'' the study found.

HEADLINE: After 14 Years, Murdoch Files for Divorce From Third Wife

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
For the last several years, friends of Rupert and Wendi Murdoch had noticed that the couple seemed to live separate lives. Mrs. Murdoch developed an interest in producing movies, and Mr. Murdoch busied himself steering his $73 billion media conglomerate, News Corporation.
By most accounts the couple had grown apart and spent long stretches away from each other, but people close to the Murdochs did not expect the 82-year-old mogul to divorce his wife of 14 years. Too messy financially. It wouldn't be good for their daughters, Grace, 11, and Chloe, 9, said these people, who would only discuss the couple's marriage anonymously. 
But on Thursday, Mr. Murdoch filed for divorce in a New York State Supreme Court. The filing said that the ''relationship between husband and wife has broken down irretrievably.''
The couple was in New York at their Fifth Avenue penthouse on Thursday when news of the divorce, said to be Mr. Murdoch's decision, emerged. A spokeswoman for News Corporation confirmed the divorce filing, which was first reported by Deadline Hollywood, and said the divorce would have no impact on the company. The Murdoch family trust controls 38.4 percent of News Corporation's voting shares. Mrs. Murdoch has no financial stake in the company.
Ira E. Garr of the law firm Garr Silpe will represent Mr. Murdoch, and Pamela M. Sloan of Aronson Mayefsky & Sloan L.L.P. will represent Mrs. Murdoch, 44, in what could prove a highly contentious divorce. Mr. Murdoch's divorce in 1998 from his second wife, Anna, cost $1.7 billion, including $110 million in cash.
The divorce filing comes as Mr. Murdoch readies News Corporation for a split into two companies on June 28. Entertainment assets like Fox Broadcasting, Fox News and the Hollywood studio will form a company called 21st Century Fox. Publishing assets including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and Harper Collins and a handful of Australian TV assets will form a company called News Corp.
Two years ago, Mrs. Murdoch's image experienced an unexpected boost. In July 2011, as Mr. Murdoch testified in front of a British parliamentary subcommittee about a phone hacking scandal at the company's News of the World tabloid, Mrs. Murdoch, wearing a pink blazer, instinctively lurched toward a protester to protect her husband from a pie attack.
Mrs. Murdoch's protective urge became a viral sensation. ''Nothing can characterize her more than that, protective and strong and fierce and not afraid,'' the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, a friend of Mrs. Murdoch's, said in an interview last year.
Mr. Murdoch first met Wendi Deng in 1998 on a business trip to China. A recent graduate of the Yale School of Management, Ms. Deng was working at Star TV, a unit of News Corporation with a new headquarters in Hong Kong. Mr. Murdoch hosted a town hall and fielded a tough question about his company's China strategy from an eager and well-prepared Ms. Deng.
That same year Liz Smith announced in The New York Post that Mr. Murdoch and his wife of more than three decades, Anna, had separated. The couple had three children, Lachlan, James and Elisabeth. Mr. Murdoch divorced his first wife, Patricia, in 1967. They had one daughter, Prudence.
In 1999, Mr. Murdoch married Ms. Deng in front of 82 guests on board his 155-foot yacht, the Morning Glory, in New York Harbor. The newest Mrs. Murdoch tried to find a place for herself in the family and the family business, with varying degrees of success.
As head of Star TV, James Murdoch worked with Mrs. Murdoch to help build News Corporation's presence in China. Mrs. Murdoch, whose friends describe her as energetic with a passion for business, slowly began to win over James's respect, according to a person close to the Murdoch family.
In 2006, a marital battle erupted after Mr. Murdoch declared in a TV interview with Charlie Rose that while Grace and Chloe would have an economic interest in the family's trust, they would not have the same voting rights as his four children from previous marriages. That was the first time Mrs. Murdoch had heard about the arrangement.
Mr. Murdoch's six children have equal shares in the company through a family trust, but only Prudence, Lachlan, James and Elisabeth have the right to appoint trustees for the trust, which will give them control over the company when Mr. Murdoch dies.
Several people close to the Murdochs pointed to the battle over Grace's and Chloe's inheritance as a sign that future battles could ensue over how Mr. Murdoch's net worth -- $11.2 billion, according to Forbes -- is divided.
''That led to an extremely difficult weekend at the Murdoch household,'' one person close to the family who was not authorized to publicly discuss their relationship said of that fight. ''That had the potential for a breakup at that point,'' this person added.
Born in humble circumstances as Deng Wen Ge in Jiangsu Province in eastern China, Mrs. Murdoch has recently taken on a wider range of professional endeavors, including producing the movie ''Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.'' The movie was released by News Corporation's Fox Searchlight division in July 2011. But its release was soon eclipsed when news surfaced that Mr. Murdoch's British tabloid News of the World had hacked into the voice mail of Milly Dowler, a missing teenager who, it turned out, had been killed.
As the scandal in Britain has somewhat subsided, Mr. Murdoch has readied for the split of his company with what confidants describe as giddy anticipation and the chance to build up his newspaper empire.
''I have been given an extraordinary opportunity most people never get in their lifetime: the chance to do it all over again,'' Mr. Murdoch said in a May 28 investor meeting for the new News Corporation.

HEADLINE: Going Dark, And Putting Blindfolds On Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
What happens to investors who buy securities issued under the protection of United States securities laws and continue to hold them after many of the protections are removed? Sometimes it is not pretty.
That is happening more and more often as companies avail themselves of the right to ''go dark'' because they do not have very many public shareholders. They no longer have to file financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the securities are still publicly traded.
These days, such investors seem to have few friends. Congress is much more interested in making it easier for companies -- or ''job creators'' in the current jargon -- than it is in protecting unfortunate investors. The so-called JOBS Act, enacted last year with widespread bipartisan support, included a provision making it much easier for small banks to go dark, and hundreds have done so.
Going dark, it should be noted, is not the same thing as going private. When that happens, securities are purchased from the public investors. They may not like being forced out, but they are out. 
Not so when a company goes dark. The investors are in, but they may or may not be told what is going on. Companies that go dark sometimes make audited financial statements public, and sometimes they do not.
There is no better example of the perils of going dark -- as well as proof that ''preferred'' can be a misnomer when it comes to stock -- than the former Equity Inns, an owner of hotels, whose common shares were acquired by Goldman Sachs in 2007.
Although the common shares went away, preferred shares remained -- or actually, new issues of preferreds replaced old ones. What has happened since then ''smells like insider trading,'' says James J. Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University and an investor in the preferred stock. Goldman says that is nonsense.
While Goldman acquired the common stock, for $23 a share, or $1.9 billion, it did not acquire the $146 million of preferred shares in public hands. Those shares were in par values of $25 and had been sold primarily to individual investors interested in collecting a reasonably safe income stream. One series paid 8.75 percent a year, and the other 9 percent.
Before the takeover, those shares had been trading above par, and Goldman could have called them at par value. Instead, it took the preferred shares into the dark. The company assured the S.E.C. that there were fewer than 300 shareholders of record for each series of preferred, giving the company the right to go dark. The securities continued to trade over the counter in what Wall Street calls the ''gray market.''
Goldman soon halted the dividend payments, and the share prices fell to as little as a penny.
How was the company doing? The financial statements were confidential, but Goldman did agree to let preferred shareholders see them -- for a fee -- as long as they signed confidentiality agreements that would prevent them from sharing the statements with anyone else, including prospective buyers of the shares.
Someone has, however, violated that confidentiality agreement. After I began calling around for this column, a set of financial statements arrived in an envelope with no return address. Assuming they are accurate, they show that over the three years through 2012, the company had net losses of $315 million on revenue of $1.2 billion. But most of those losses came from $251 million in depreciation. Operating cash flow was a positive $174 million. Told of some of the numbers in the statement, a Goldman spokeswoman did not dispute them.
Those numbers, however, are for the entire company. The preferred shares seem to have an interest in only 1 percent of the assets. If Goldman could find a way to put the 1 percent owner in bankruptcy, while keeping the other 99 percent out, it might be able to largely eliminate the preferred.
Even that might not be necessary. Goldman was also the lender in the deal, and perhaps it could restructure the debt in ways that would essentially give the debt holders -- Goldman, that is -- the ability to get everything, leaving the preferred shareholders with nothing.
Evidently, few saw any value in the preferred shares. But then prices began to rise, and in September the company disclosed that ''a sister company'' -- presumably another Goldman affiliate -- had ''recently'' acquired ''approximately 35 percent'' of the outstanding preferred shares. This week Goldman told me that it bought all of the shares in one private transaction from a single seller. It would not identify the seller or the price, but said it had not made any further purchases or sales since then.
The September purchase amounted to about as many shares as had traded in public markets in the previous six months. It is not clear when the seller accumulated them, and Andrea Raphael, a Goldman spokeswoman, denies there was any advance agreement to purchase them. Mr. Angel sees evidence of a violation of insider trading laws, but Ms. Raphael says that is ridiculous.
''We complied with applicable law in all respects,'' she said. ''Any assertions otherwise are based purely on speculation.''
If the company -- whose formal name is now W2007 Grace Acquisition I -- were still registered with the S.E.C., and the preferred shares traded on an exchange, we would not have to wonder about this. Anyone who acquired more than 5 percent of the issue would have been required to disclose that fact -- as well as the prices paid for recent purchases. But such protections for investors vanish when a company goes dark.
The fact of the purchase breathed new life into the shares. If Goldman, which controls what will happen, saw value in the preferred, surely there was value, or so some traders evidently concluded. The price, which had risen to $4 from about $2 in the months before the disclosure, has now climbed to about $9.
This has become news now because one preferred shareholder, Joseph M. Sullivan, a Sacramento accountant, took it upon himself to assure that the preferred shares had more than 300 owners of record. In December, he set up 301 separate trusts to hold his shares, each of which he said had different beneficial owners but the same trustee -- himself. He demanded that the company file its financial statements with the S.E.C.
In April, a lawyer for Goldman, William G. Farrar of Sullivan & Cromwell, asked the S.E.C. to issue an order exempting the company from any need to file with the commission. The issuer of the preferred shares, he explained, was ''simply a real estate investment firm with a small economic interest in 130 hotels and no employees'' and Mr. Sullivan was engaging in subterfuge to force the company to resume its filings.
The S.E.C. chose to ask for public comment on the request, bringing letters of protest from a number of shareholders, including Mr. Sullivan, who told me he would disclose the identities of the beneficial holders to the S.E.C., but only if it promised not to make them public.
There is no question that the level of 300 owners of record is a magic number in determining whether the company must resume filing with the S.E.C. There is no doubt that there are more than 300 beneficial owners even without counting Mr. Sullivan's trusts. But the rules allow companies to ignore many such owners if all their shares are held at the same brokerage firm. Mr. Sullivan would like the S.E.C. to make it harder for companies to go dark and stay dark.
Even if he prevails in that, it is far from clear what he will have accomplished. Public filings would make it easier to see what was going on, but Goldman would still have all the cards and might find ways to assure that the preferred holders received little or nothing from their investment.
There is one sidelight to this that emphasizes how convoluted it can be when a company has public investors but chooses to keep the public in the dark. The company's charter, available on its Web site, seems to say no one can buy more than 9.9 percent of the preferred shares. But the Goldman affiliate did. The rules do not apply if the company gives up its tax status as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, but nothing I could find on the Web site indicates that happened. In his letter to the S.E.C., Mr. Farrar, the lawyer for Goldman, referred to the company's ''REIT sub,'' short for subsidiary, which sounds as if it is still a REIT.
Not so, Goldman assured me. The company gave up its REIT status years ago and disclosed that in financial statements that are not public.
So why did Mr. Farrar use the language he did?
''Historically it was referred to internally as the 'REIT sub' and we simply continued that reference,'' Ms. Raphael said. ''The reference is not indicative of the company's tax status.''

HEADLINE: Guardians of Peru's Past Sift the Mail for Smuggled Artifacts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Andrea Zarate contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LIMA, Peru -- Gladiz Collatupa, an archaeologist, once stashed six mummies at her parents' house for safe keeping. That was when she dug for artifacts in the dirt of Peru, rich with the leavings of past cultures like the Inca and the Moche. Now she digs through packages at the post office instead, searching for ancient treasure being smuggled out of the country.
Ms. Collatupa and a colleague, Sonia Rojas, an art historian, are a pair of Indiana Joneses in reverse. Instead of swashbuckling around the world looting ruins, they try to keep Peru's ancient riches from being spirited out of the country by mail.
''With less danger,'' noted Ms. Rojas, a petite woman in glasses with a keen interest in colonial Peruvian paintings. She wears a khaki vest with a large button that says, ''I defend my cultural heritage.'' 
The women work for Peru's Ministry of Culture as part of a program aimed at stopping the illegal export of valuable historic and prehistoric objects and artwork, a depletion that began nearly 500 years ago with the Spanish conquest of the Inca empire and has never stopped.
Last year, the post office team, which Ms. Collatupa joined in August, replacing another archaeologist, made 22 seizures, totaling dozens of items. They included pre-Columbian textiles and pottery, fossils, a 19th-century saber, a 19th-century oil painting of St. Anne teaching the Virgin Mary to read, a shipment of 56 books and other texts belonging to the National Library, and a group of religious and legal documents from the 18th century.
This year, they have made seven seizures of items that include old coins and replicas of pre-Columbian dolls that incorporate ancient cloth looted from archaeological sites.
''No matter how small a piece is, it's important,'' said Ms. Collatupa, who has learned to distinguish pre-Hispanic textiles by the way they feel -- smoother and softer with age -- and by the patterns in the weaving. ''They are part of our identity.''
Many of the items are bound for the United States, mailed by tourists who may be unaware they are breaking the law. But others are shipped by dealers and collectors who know exactly what they are doing.
Mostly, Ms. Rojas, 36, and Ms. Collatupa, 32, do not confront the bad guys. But in March, a collector who had tried to mail a silver coin minted in Peru in 1838 to Canada showed up at the postal facility to complain. The coin was a fake, he said, and therefore should not have been seized.
The words ''Firm for the Union'' were stamped on the coin, and Ms. Rojas stood her ground: her examination showed that it was genuine, and it stayed in the country. Like most other items seized at the post office, it was added to the collection of the National Museum.
Still, there is little incentive for unscrupulous traffickers to obey the law. A Sotheby's auction of pre-Columbian works, held in Paris in March, took in more than $13 million for about 150 items. The auction occurred despite claims by the governments of Peru, Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica that many of the objects had been illegally removed from their countries.
And the penalties are relatively minor. Since 2007, no one has been sent to prison for cultural trafficking in Peru, and only five people have been given the maximum fine of about $1,900, at the current exchange rate, according to Blanca Alva, who is in charge of the Culture Ministry's efforts to stop trafficking.
''Compare that to the prices that our pieces bring'' in auctions abroad, Ms. Alva said.
Ms. Alva has also stepped up efforts to recover objects that made it out of the country, often many years ago. Last month, the Foreign Ministry announced the recovery of 125 pieces from the United States, Mexico, Switzerland and Chile, including pre-Columbian ceramic pieces, a 17th-century manuscript, colonial paintings and a silver receptacle for carrying the eucharist that was stolen from a church in Cuzco.
In 2011, Yale University began returning hundreds of artifacts carted away decades ago from Machu Picchu, the famous Incan citadel.
All of this taps into powerful notions of national pride and a lingering resentment over the colonial past. Such themes may have added resonance today in Peru, a country with a strong sense of its heritage, where a decade of sustained economic growth has ignited hopes for greater recognition and influence in the region and around the world.
Ms. Alva said she cried when the Machu Picchu artifacts came back.
''It's the feeling that something is being made whole, something that belongs to me,'' she said. ''It is a little humiliating for us to feel that our heritage is being sold for a price.''
The highlight of Ms. Collatupa's archaeological career came in 2006 when she worked for a power company building a generating station in Lima -- and excavated the six mummies that were exposed during construction. The mummies, from the Ichma culture, from about the 15th century, were wrapped in cloth so that only the tops of their heads poked out. Ms. Collatupa could see their skulls and some hair and feathered headdresses. ''It was very exciting,'' she said.
There was nowhere at the construction site to keep the mummies, so she brought the desiccated remains home to her parents' house. They were not exactly the kind of visitors they had hoped their daughter would be bringing home.
''My parents didn't like it,'' she said. The unusual houseguests stayed for about a month in boxes in the garage before leaving to find a permanent home at a local museum.
While no one has been caught trying to mail mummies out of the country on their watch, Ms. Collatupa and Ms. Rojas have had some exciting finds at the post office too, including a 16th-century Incan ceramic cup and colonial oil paintings. Ms. Collatupa sometimes dreams about the big score, like recovering an object stolen from a Peruvian museum.
But mostly their job seems like a never-ending and extremely frustrating backward Christmas. They are forever opening and then rewrapping packages meant for other people.
In the high-ceilinged postal sorting center where they work, packages arrive down big spiral chutes like water slides at an amusement park. And the sticky chirp of clear packing tape peeling off the roll is never far away.
On a recent morning, the women sorted through a load of several dozen packages leaving the country, arranged in piles by destination: 14 to the United States, 11 to Spain, 8 to Japan, 5 to France.
They decided to inspect a box headed to Japan because it was mailed from Cuzco, a popular tourist town that is a center for the black market in antiquities. The packing list said it contained dolls, a red flag because unscrupulous artisans often use scraps of pre-Hispanic textiles looted from tombs to make dolls that may be offered to tourists as real Incan artifacts.
A customs agent slit open the tape on the package, and Ms. Rojas and Ms. Collatupa donned latex gloves to remove the contents: a Peruvian national soccer team shirt, a purple down vest, a floppy cloth hat and a plastic bag filled with what appeared to be the dolls mentioned in the packing slip: a couple of dozen finger puppets made of brightly colored, synthetic -- not pre-Columbian -- yarn.
They replaced the items and closed the box with a strip of yellow tape indicating it had been opened by customs authorities.
As the women work, a dog is led around to sniff packages for drugs. Many more packages are opened by customs agents looking for drugs (which are found every day, usually in small quantities) than by the women searching for cultural contraband. But sometimes the two types of searches overlap. In February customs agents looking for drugs opened a box that contained 11 rare silver coins minted in the 16th century.
''You never know what you're going to find,'' Ms. Rojas said. ''Every box could contain a surprise.''

Joan Baez (Monday) The incisive folk singer-songwriter, human rights activist and recipient of a lifetime achievement award Grammy in 2007 leads this benefit concert for the sprawling SummerStage festival series. It also supports her sagacious 2008 album, ''Day After Tomorrow'' (Razor & Tie). With the Indigo Girls. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, summerstage.org; sold out. (Stacey Anderson) 
Black Flag (Friday and Saturday) There are a couple of iterations of Black Flag, the punishing hardcore punk band that pioneered the genre in the late 1970s and early '80s: Black Flag, which features the band's founder and guitarist Greg Ginn and emphasizes new material, and Flag, which includes the former band members Keith Morris and Dez Cadena and pushes older fare. Black Flag will perform at Warsaw as part of the Northside Festival. Notably, neither group boasts the loquacious former singer and well-traveled public speaker Henry Rollins, who will surely spend this evening delightedly talking a blue streak to either a crowded room or a particularly rapt corner of drywall. At 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, northsidefestival.com; $32; sold out on Friday. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Rhys Chatham and Oneida (Friday) Mr. Chatham, a composer, is well known for his experimental-rock opus ''Guitar Trio'' of 1977, a minimalist classic of one deafening chord. He ratcheted up the stakes considerably in 2009 for ''A Crimson Grail,'' a symphony for 400 electric guitars. The Brooklyn rock group Oneida is merely a five-piece group, but their past collaborations with Mr. Chatham -- including a performance at the Ecstatic Music Festival of 2012 -- have been great surrenders of convention. They perform as part of the Northside Festival. At 8 p.m., Europa Club, 98 Meserole Avenue, between Lorimar and Manhattan Avenues, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, europaclub.com; $20. (Anderson)
Sky Ferreira (Monday) A bleached-blond electropop minx from Los Angeles, Ms. Ferreira drifts around a playground, boatneck top askew and wide eyes listless, in the drab video for her single ''Everything Is Embarrassing.'' Apathy, and the '80s, rarely scream back to the forefront with this much vengeance. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $12. (Anderson)
Hanson (Monday and Tuesday) The teen pop idols turned Billy Joel-nicking contemporary rockers recently released their own beer, Mmmhops, a decade and a half after their keening earworm hit single of similar name. They release their ninth studio album, ''Anthem'' (3CG), as they toast their 21st anniversary together as a band. In related news, it is high time for all original tween fans of the three blond brothers to contribute to their 401(k)s. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Anderson)
LL Cool J (Thursday) After accruing mainstream good will for his tasteful handling of Whitney Houston's death when he hosted the Grammys in 2012 -- and then sufficiently losing much of it when he guest starred on the country singer Brad Paisley's tone-deaf track ''Accidental Racist'' this spring -- the rapper sticks to other veteran hip-hop company in this ''Kings of the Mic'' collaborative tour. Ice Cube, Public Enemy and De La Soul also fly their flags. At 6:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, roselandballroom.com; $59.50 remaining. (Anderson)
Matuto (Thursday) These engaging Brazilian forró rockers borrow from jazz and funk in their lively sets. They took that alchemy through West Africa as recent participants of the State Department's American Music Abroad diplomacy program. The band celebrates the release of a new album, ''The Devil and the Diamond'' (Motema). At 7 p.m., David Rubinstein Atrium, Lincoln Center, atrium.lincolncenter.org; free. (Anderson)
New Kids on the Block, 98° and Boyz II Men (Sunday) The co-headliners of this summer's ''Package Tour'' -- a properly titillating title for three boy bands that once commanded the hormonal imbalances of a nation of teenage girls -- bring their ab-blasting nostalgia to New Jersey and Brooklyn. Pack a dinner for the kids! At 7:30 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, barclayscenter.com; $29.50 to $99.50. (Anderson)
Christopher Owens (Saturday and Sunday) After fronting Girls -- a bratty, lo-fi psychedelic duo from San Francisco -- this rocker channeled the roiling emotions of a passionate yet doomed love affair into ''Lysandre'' (Fat Possum), a gentler classical- and folk-influenced song cycle that newly suggests Elliott Smith or Conor Oberst. Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 8:30 p.m., the Slipper Room, 167 Orchard Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, slipperroom.com; $20. (Anderson)
&#x2605; The Postal Service (Friday and Saturday) The core duo of this sweet indie electro-pop act -- the singer-songwriter Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie and the musician-producer Jimmy Tamborello -- nod to the 10th anniversary of their delightful, lone album, ''Give Up'' (Sub Pop), with a widely expanded reissue and national tour. Mr. Gibbard's rumored romantic muse, the singer Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley, reprises backing vocal duties on the road too. At 8 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, barclayscenter.com; $50 remaining. (Anderson)
RatKing (Sunday) Tagged straight out of the gate as the East Coast's answer to Odd Future, this hip-hop crew's frenetically paced rhymes and combination of dissonant effects and rapid beats can conjure other upstart acts. Its confidence and adroit observations of New York culture, as well as the rapper Wiki's pinched and preoccupied delivery, are singular. Its debut EP, ''Wiki93'' (Hot Charity/XL), was released last fall. It performs as part of the Northside Festival. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (347) 529-6696, bk.knittingfactory.com; $10. (Anderson)
&#x2605; The Roots and Jim James (Tuesday) The hip-hop stalwarts the Roots are facile collaborators with artists of all pop genres. They offer an unprecedented night of jamming with Mr. James, the frontman of the many-tentacled psychedelic rock band My Morning Jacket who recently released the romantic, wide-scope solo debut album ''Regions of Light and Sound of God'' (ATO). They perform as part of the Celebrate Brooklyn festival. At 7 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, bricartsmedia.org; $41. (Anderson)
Buffy Sainte-Marie (Tuesday) The leading chanteuse of American Indian activism packs one of the most warbling, deliberately halting voices in all of folk. Yet the informed protestations behind that instrument are steadfast, especially the heart-rending refrain of the Academy Award-winning ''Up Where We Belong,'' which she wrote with Jack Nitzsche and Will Jennings. With Del Barber. At 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $40 at the door. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Solange (Sunday) ''True'' (Terrible Records), the digital EP by this chic singer and her collaborator Dev Hynes, is a surprise in its existence alone: a crop of smooth, late-'80s-influenced dance-pop that, at a robust seven tracks, defies convention of what a short play can be. It's also a satisfying reintroduction to a talented, indie-rock-leaning singer. At the peak of her range, Solange shares some tonal similarities with her elder sister, Beyoncé; elsewhere, she earns her own spotlight handily. She performs as part of the Northside Festival with Petite Noir, Cable and My Midnight Heart. At 3 p.m., McCarren Park, Bedford Avenue at North 12th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, northsidefestival.com; RSVP tickets required, but entry guaranteed with festival badge ($80 to $260 remaining). (Anderson)
&#x2605; Mavis Staples (Friday) Ms. Staples, the powerhouse former anchor of the gospel greats the Staple Singers, enjoyed an earthy dose of lo-fi Americana on her recent album, ''You Are Not Alone'' (Anti-), courtesy of its producer, the Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy. She performs at the Celebrate Brooklyn Festival with Cody Chesnutt. At 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, bricartsmedia.org; suggested donation, $3. (Anderson)
Suuns (Friday) The prog-rockers from Montreal take Hemingway-like economy with their tunes, stacking small fragments of dissonant melody into dense, enormous waves. Their debut album, ''Zeroes QC,'' merely suggested the sensational power of their live jams; the follow-up, ''Images Du Futur,'' both released by Secretly Canadian, carried a sinister pace and came closer to their thundering stage experience. They perform as part of the Northside Festival with Amen Dunes and Tempers. At 8 p.m., Glasslands, 289 Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, theglasslands.com; $12. (Anderson)
Suzanne Vega (Wednesday) Ms. Vega's scholastic folk shares the affecting poignancy of Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell; the hauntingly self-conscious refrain of her hit ''Luka'' cut deeper than the lyrics of any of her grandiloquent singer-songwriter peers of the late 1980s. Her performance is part of the Mad. Sq. Music Series. At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Broadway at 23rd Street, madisonsquarepark.org; free. (Anderson)
The Walkmen (Saturday) Unlike many of their early-2000s revivalist rock peers who comprised the so-called New York scene (including the Strokes, Interpol and French Kicks), the Walkmen have mindfully maintained their fan base and steadily pushed their gravelly vintage rock forward. Their 2010 release, ''Lisbon'' (Fat Possum), savored vintage-pop romantic flourishes and was a unifying favorite of mainstream and indie-rock circles. They followed that with ''Heaven,'' released by Fat Possum Records and Bella Union last year to more acclaim. They perform at the Northside Festival with Phosphorescent, Friend Roulette and Abadabad. At 3 p.m., McCarren Park, Bedford Avenue at North 12th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, northsidefestival.com; RSVP tickets required, but entry guaranteed with festival badge ($80 to $260 remaining). (Anderson)
White Mandingos (Friday) Bad Brains, the punk-reggae hybridists who ruled the hardcore underbelly of Washington, D.C., in the 1980s, pulled much of their debauched energy and tight, jazz-derived grooves from the bassist Darryl Jenifer. He anchors this confrontational, recklessly messy new rap-punk group alongside the Los Angeles rapper Murs and the Ego Trip magazine co-founder Sacha Jenkins. At 7 p.m., New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org; $12, $10 for members. (Anderson)
Why? (Sunday) A cabal of prickly indie rockers, Why? displays subtly ingrained hip-hop undertones -- as befits a band entrenched in the Anticon label collective of Oakland, Calif. Its 2012 record, ''Mumps, etc.'' (Anticon/City Slang), featured its most inscrutable verses yet and an itchy sort of superiority complex. The concert, also featuring Sarah Jaffe, is part of the Northside Festival. At 9 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, between Lorimar and Manhattan Avenues, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, europaclub.com; $18. (Anderson)
&#x2605; The Zombies and Django Django (Saturday) The British Invasion cadets the Zombies have heard their swooning psych-pop hit ''She's Not There'' repurposed by such myriad folks as Malcolm McLaren and Neko Case. The original members Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone regrouped in 2011 for the band's 50th anniversary and released ''Breathe Out, Breathe In'' (Rhino), their sixth album and a conversant prog-pop throwback. Django Django borrows heavily from the Zombies' airy, psychedelic vocals, churning them through electronic processing alongside embellished Britpop rock progressions and synthetic effects. Few other new bands have combined disparate genres with such grace. They perform with Adam Green & Binki Shapiro and Modest P as part of the SummerStage Festival. At 6 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free. (Anderson)

HEADLINE: The Stimulus Comment That Agitated Traders

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Amid the current turmoil in global markets, one question is being obsessively debated on Wall Street: Just what was Ben S. Bernanke thinking three weeks ago when he said that the Federal Reserve might soon cut back its stimulus efforts?
While second-guessing the Fed is a parlor game that traders have played for decades, it is an exercise that has taken on heightened significance. That is because in recent years, the markets have been more dependent on central bank support than at than any time in recent memory. So when Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that the stimulus might diminish, alarm was bound to spread. And quite a reaction it was.
Since May 22, when Mr. Bernanke made those remarks, global stock markets have lost $3 trillion in value, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The Japanese stock market, for example, lurched into bear-market territory on Thursday after a tumble of 6.4 percent took the cumulative decline in the Nikkei 225 index to more than 21 percent since a peak on May 22. 
While sentiment has been fragile as investors have taken stock of the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, markets in Europe and the United States have been volatile as well. Stocks rallied in the United States on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 1.5 percent, but they have gyrated since Mr. Bernanke's remarks forced investors to consider a world with less Fed stimulus.
Mr. Bernanke will get another bite at the apple at a scheduled news conference next week and in his semiannual testimony to Congress next month, when his comments will be closely scrutinized.
Before looking at what Mr. Bernanke actually said in May, it is helpful to recall some history.
After the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed moved into emergency mode to lift the economy and support the banking system. The central bank has bought more than $2 trillion of bonds, effectively pumping that amount into the banking system and economy.
The Fed's latest bond purchase program kicked in this year. But in contrast to its previous programs, the Fed this time did not say in advance how much it was going to spend on bonds. Instead, the central bank said it would keep up its purchases until certain economic targets were achieved.
The main goal is to get the unemployment rate down to 6.5 percent or lower. The Fed is also watching the falling inflation rate and will keep buying bonds if that indicator falls to a level that it thinks will weaken the economy and financial system.
Looking at where those two gauges are today, investors assumed the Fed would buy bonds for many months. But that changed when Mr. Bernanke testified before Congress on May 22. He said that if the Fed saw improvement in the economy, and felt it could be sustained, it ''could in the next few meetings take a step down in our pace of purchases.''
The words ''next few meetings'' were what really worried market participants. They had become accustomed to the Fed's implacable reassurances that it wasn't going to change its accommodative stance until the goals had been met.
Yet here was Mr. Bernanke seemingly saying that the money spigot could start closing later this year. Their thought process continued: Mr. Bernanke must know how much weight his words carry, and he always speaks very carefully to avoid upsetting the apple cart, so his utterance must have been deliberate and must have had a motive.
Here are four theories going around Wall Street on why the Fed chairman said what he said:
A BONE FOR THE HAWKSAccording to Fed observers, Mr. Bernanke has a consensual style of management on the all-important Fed committee that sets monetary policy. Some members have deep reservations about the large bond purchases. Mr. Bernanke doesn't agree with the hawks, but he wants them to feel that their concerns are listened to.
So he makes an utterance that proves to them that he is not afraid to publicly envision a definite end to the stimulus. They then feel comforted that Helicopter Ben will have the resolve to stop the money drop -- one day. This theory is great for the camp that thinks the Fed must keep pressing the gas. It means Mr. Bernanke was merely being a shrewd manager and isn't going to turn stingy any time soon.
BURSTING BUBBLES The Fed has a frighteningly poor record of spotting bubbles and deflating them before they become destructive. There is no gigantic, overarching bubble right now that could harm the wider economy. But over the last two years, as the Fed has pumped money into the financial system, large markets have been driven higher by significant amounts of speculation.
A Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, has highlighted the risks in some of them. On Wall Street, with interest rates this low for so long, it has become easy to make bets with borrowed money. But such investments can unwind violently with even the slightest tightening of credit. Mr. Bernanke may have wanted to throw a little bit of sand into this giant leverage machine.
If so, it seems to have worked so far, because some of the frothiest markets have tumbled since his testimony. From the Fed's perspective, the risk is that the sell-off builds on itself and weighs on the wider economy.
DRESS REHEARSALOne day the Fed will clearly state that it truly is going to pare its purchases. That could usher in a turbulent period in the markets. Talking about such withdrawal today could soften any shock it inflicts on the market when it happens. It is the same reason parents prepare children for their first day of school during the summer.
''You could see this as a trial balloon that was floated,'' said Brian Smith, who trades bonds at TCW, an asset management firm. ''Bernanke might have wanted to see if the market could handle a tapering.''
The Fed also gets to examine exactly how the markets reacted and can make tailored responses. In recent weeks, some important assets have been acting in weirdly interconnected ways (just search Google for the term ''convexity vortex''). The Fed is now wiser about those sorts of moves.
A TAP ON THE BRAKESThe final theory is that Mr. Bernanke has in fact shifted his stance. While certainly not a hawk, he has intellectually moved closer to ending the asset purchases than people might realize. It is important to remember that the latest open-ended program was conceived at the end of last year, when there was great trepidation about the drag that fiscal retrenchment would have on the economy.
''Back in December, the Fed didn't know if we would fall off the fiscal cliff,'' said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates. ''So it may have thought, 'We'll shoot now and think later.' ''
It turns out that, in spite of Washington's budget battles, the economy has been quite resilient. For the economic conditions that exist right now, smaller purchases may be more appropriate. Some economists dispute this line of thinking.
For instance, they say the Fed isn't going to taper when the inflation rate is declining as it is right now. But Mr. Bernanke may think that dip is temporary, particularly since some forward-looking indicators in the markets predict a rise in inflation. And some economists see strong signs that the latest round of bond purchases is having its desired effect and will lead to a stronger economy as early as the second half of this year.
When faced with frantic speculation over its motives, and weakening markets, the Fed may be tempted to say things to calm everyone down. So far, the most influential Fed governors have not come out to somehow correct people's interpretations of Mr. Bernanke's remarks. That could work to the good of everyone.
''Although the last three weeks have been jarring to everyone -- including the Fed -- its prime directive is to get policy correct, not worry about several weeks of increased market volatility,'' said Jim Vogel, a debt markets strategist for FTN Financial.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Candidates Recommend A Rent Freeze At Hearing

BYLINE: By MONA EL-NAGGAR

 BODY:
At the Rent Guidelines Board public hearing on Thursday, much of the theater and drama were as always: tenants insisting that the proposed increase at rent-stabilized apartments in New York City was far too high, and landlords complaining that it was far too low.
But with this being a mayoral election year, the hearing featured a few different actors. 
Among those in attendance were three Democratic mayoral candidates, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; Bill de Blasio, the public advocate; and John C. Liu, the city comptroller. All three spoke in favor of imposing a rent freeze.
''It is time we finally consider the tenants,'' Ms. Quinn said, arguing that owners have fared better than tenants over the course of the recession.
''Good luck on your campaign,'' replied Steven J. Schleider, who represents property owners on the nine-member board.
''So you're taking a position that government can dictate how much money or profit or return a private owner can have?'' Mr. Schleider asked.
''We're focused on the needs of tenants,'' Ms. Quinn repeated.
Mr. Schleider shook his head.
Ms. Quinn shot back: ''We've danced this dance before, we know who's leading when, who's following when, and at what point we go from waltz to fox trot.''
The audience broke out in laughter. Some cheered from the back of the room. One man waved his sign that read, ''Justice for tenants.''
In a way, the gist of Ms. Quinn's remark summed up Thursday's hearing.
This year, the board has proposed an increase ranging from 3.25 percent to 6.25 percent for a one-year lease and 5 percent to 9.5 percent for a two-year lease. Last year, the board approved an increase of 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease. An additional supplement, which tenant advocates refer to as the ''poor tax,'' would impose a higher increase in rent for those tenants who live in a rent-stabilized apartment and pay less than $1,000 a month.
Judith Seigel, an 83-year-old artist who owns an 1835 brownstone on Morton Street in the West Village, said her property tax had doubled to about $40,000 over the last decade. And while she said the Village had become more often populated by ''movie stars than artists,'' it is still her home.
''My husband would come home from his job as a buyer in training at Bloomingdale's, hang his clothes and lay bricks and scrape paint until midnight,'' Ms. Seigel said. ''Back then, we could never imagine that World War II emergency rent controls would last beyond 1984, much less 2001. And now it's 2013.''
Mr. de Blasio criticized the board for holding only one public hearing; since 2005, a second hearing has been traditionally held in the Bronx, Brooklyn or Queens. ''By not holding a single hearing in the outer boroughs, the board has marginalized the voices of more than 700,000 renters who face the prospect of higher rents,'' Mr. de Blasio said. The board's solitary hearing ''is not just an inconvenience; it's an outright failure of democracy.''
Mr. Liu called for a one-year moratorium on rent increases.
The board will reconvene next Thursday to vote on the proposed increases.
''It feels like the two sides come from alternate universes, that they are living in different realities,'' said Harvey Epstein, another board member who sits on the opposite side of the hearing table from Mr. Schleider. ''We have to hear the two sides and try to find some balance.''

KIMMEL CENTER, WINDOWS GALLERY: 'ALIEN SCRIPT' (through Aug. 1) The first exhibition of drawings by Walter Mosley, better known as a crime-fiction writer and the author of ''Devil in a Blue Dress,'' is on view in the Windows Gallery at New York University's Kimmel Center.
The 18 images on view here were selected by the curator Lydie Diakhaté -- and organized by the university's Institute of African American Affairs -- from nine of Mr. Mosley's notebooks, which contain more than 500 drawings in pen and ink, watercolor, various paints, crayon, oil pastel and permanent markers. (Above, an untitled work from the series.)
The works are accompanied by the first paragraph of ''Devil in a Blue Dress'' and translated into one of nine languages. In materials for the exhibition Mr. Mosley says of his artwork, ''This Alien Script has become my bid for art, my exploration in the language(s) of line, form and color; unruly textures and songs of dark and light.'' 
An opening reception on Monday starts at 6 p.m.; reservations suggested, at (212) 998-4222. Otherwise the works can be viewed daily, at any time, at 60 Washington Square South, between Thompson Place and La Guardia Place, Greenwich Village; africanastudies.as.nyu.edu; (212) 998-2981; free.

Previews and Openings
'Alligator Summer' (previews start on Thursday; opens next Friday) Leaping lizards! Subtitled ''A Southern Gothic Atrocity in Three Acts,'' this postmodern farce by Dylan Lamb holes up two families in the sweltering attic of a small-town Louisiana home under siege by marauding reptiles. Presented by the young company Squeaky Bicycle Productions, the memory play set in 1944 is an absurdist attempt to examine the way we confront our primal fears and emotional barriers. Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (David Rooney) 
'Choir Boy' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on July 2) The first new work by Tarell Alvin McCraney to be presented in New York since his breakthrough trilogy ''The Brother/Sister Plays,'' this reflection on the repression of gay sexuality via religion had a well-received premiere last fall at the Royal Court Theater in London. Set in an all-black prep school where a student struggles for acceptance in the gospel choir, the play was commissioned by Manhattan Theater Club. Trip Cullman directs a cast that includes Chuck Cooper and Austin Pendleton. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney)
'The Comedy of Errors' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) The thought of an intermission-free Shakespeare is a daunting one, but the Public Theater promises just that with its production of this rarely produced comedy. Featuring the familiar faces of Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Hamish Linklater in duplicate (each plays a pair of twins), this lean-and-mean staging by Daniel Sullivan promises to have audiences out of Central Park in well under two hours. Delacorte Theater, Central Park, near 81st Street and Central Park West, (212) 539-8750, shakespeareinthepark.org. (Eric Grode)
'The Explorers Club' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Nell Benjamin, who co-wrote the score to ''Legally Blonde: The Musical,'' once again takes on the humorous travails of a bright woman trying to surmount institutionalized sexism. Only this time she's looking back about a century, to 1879 London, as the titular organization grapples with whether to allow a brilliant woman (Jennifer Westfeldt) into its ranks. Not even discovering a lost city, it seems, can guarantee membership. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'A Kid Like Jake' (in previews; opens on Monday) As if the application process for New York private schools wasn't daunting enough, one couple (Peter Grosz and the always welcome Carla Gugino) have to take into account their 4-year-old son's predilection for Cinderella and playing dress up. Speaking of high expectations, this new Daniel Pearle play follows one of Lincoln Center Theater's acclaimed productions, ''Disgraced,'' which played in this space last year and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama this year -- the first to be given to a Lincoln Center production. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Grode)
'Love's Labour's Lost' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Is there an audience overlap between downtown summer Shakespeare and a VH1 reality dating show? That question may be answered when Daniel Krstyen, an unlucky contestant on ''Making Mr. Right,'' navigates the entanglements of this comedy about three men struggling to honor their commitment to scholarship over romance. The Shakespeare Forum production aims to scratch out the intense passions and provocations beneath the play's frothy surface. The Gym at Judson, 243 Thompson Street, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, theshakespeareforum.org. (Rooney)
'Nobody Loves You' (previews start on Thursday; opens on July 18) The manufactured romantic drama of a TV dating show collides with the authentic emotional connection of a real relationship, creating complications for a philosophy grad student in this new musical with book and lyrics by the playwright Itamar Moses, and music and lyrics by Gaby Alter. Michelle Tattenbaum directs this Second Stage production, with an eight-member ensemble that includes Leslie Kritzer, Lauren Molina and Rory O'Malley. Choreography is by Mandy Moore, an Emmy winner for her work on ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Rooney)
'Rantoul and Die' (in previews; opens on June 24) The Amoralists, the dependably debauched theater company, hunker down for a two-play summer in New York. A new play by the company's co-founder Derek Ahonen will come in July, but first they will present this biting romantic comedy by Mark Roberts, better known as the creator of the CBS sitcom ''Mike and Molly.'' Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, amoralists.com. (Grode)
'Roadkill' (in previews; opens on Sunday) St. Ann's Warehouse has gained a reputation for immersive and sometimes challenging theater, but this off-site production may test the limits on both counts. In this piece conceived and directed by Cora Bissett, 25 audience members accompany a 13-year-old Nigerian girl and her ''auntie'' to what she the girl has been told will be her new home. The play's title, and the fact that it has won an award from Amnesty International, may give you a sense of what awaits her. Departs from St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
'The Two-Character Play' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Tennessee Williams's titles may tend toward the florid, but this production goes the truth-in-advertising route. (The play was called ''Out Cry'' when it appeared on Broadway in 1973, only to go on a estate-mandated hiatus.) After a well-received London production in 2010, the play, directed by Gene David Kirk, comes to New York. The two characters -- siblings forced to perform for an audience after being deserted by their acting troupe -- are played by Brad Dourif and the frequent Williams interpreter Amanda Plummer. New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin' (in previews; opens on June 27) David Morse, who has played everything including angels (''St. Elsewhere'') and devils (''How I Learned to Drive''), looks to split the difference in this new play by Steven Levenson (''The Language of Trees''). Here he stars as the title character, a white-collar criminal looking to reconnect with his family after his release from jail. But what if the family is managing just fine without him? Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynne Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs in this Tony winner for best new musical (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic (and now Tony-winning) revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in this Tony-winning play directed by Nicholas Martin (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)

'Around the World in 80 Days' This stage version of the Jules Verne novel is an odd combination of steampunk and vaudeville. The actors' shameless mugging grows annoying after a while, but the pace stays brisk and the energy level high (1:30). New Theater at 45th Street, 354 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, aroundtheworldinnyc.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Basilica' Mando Alvarado's new drama sinks into predictable melodrama, but it's still gripping in its portrayal of a family in crisis in San Juan, Tex. This is thanks in large part to the acting, especially that of Felix Solis as the mercurial Joe Garza (2:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Reopens on Tuesday at Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-8444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
'The Caucasian Chalk Circle' Christopher Lloyd brings acrid humor and physical exuberance to his roles as the narrator and the rascally rogue Azdak in Brian Kulick's astute if uneven production of Brecht's fable about a young woman who adopts an abandoned baby. The original music, by Duncan Sheik, is haunting and effective, and Elizabeth A. Davis (''Once'') sings with an appropriate soulfulness as the innocent Grusha (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Far From Heaven' Hinting at shimmering vistas beyond picket-fence conformity, Kelli O'Hara's soprano provides the poetry in this generally prosy adaptation of Todd Haynes's 2002 film about a beleaguered housewife in Eisenhower-era Hartford. Though Scott Frankel and Michael Korie have written some alluring songs, the show often seems to confine its wonderful star, and her character, to two dimensions (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'Good Television' Rod McLachlan explores the ghoulish world of reality television in this unsurprising but nicely done comedy-drama about a crew descending on the family of a South Carolina meth addict (the terrific John Magaro) in the hopes of digging up drama and good ratings (1:45). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who has replaced Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' Dave Malloy's transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (877) 704-2821, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Potted Potter' With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what's a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick's charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)
&#x2605; 'Reasons to Be Happy' Neil LaBute wrote and directed this winning romantic comedy (yes, Neil LaBute), a sequel to his ''reasons to pretty.'' As embodied by Leslie Bibb, Josh Hamilton, Jenna Fischer and Fred Weller, Mr. LaBute's characters remain articulately inarticulate and enlighteningly in the dark, reminding us that though friends and lovers may stop speaking, those relationships never really end (2:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Brantley)
'Somewhere Fun' Kathleen Chalfant and Kate Mulgrew, as two upper crusty old friends whose chance meeting on a Manhattan street incites a collage of strange encounters, lead an excellent cast in Jenny Schwartz's intermittently diverting, blatantly word-drunk but deeply frustrating new play. The virtuosic language often delights, but underneath is an emotional void (2:15). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Sontag: Reborn' Moe Angelos portrays the celebrated writer in search of herself in Ms. Angelos's own adaptation of Sontag's journals and notebooks.

'3 Kinds of Exile' The strange, sad saga of the Polish actress Elzbieta Czyzewska forms the moving heart of John Guare's new work, a triptych of stories about Eastern European exiles. The talented actors David Pittu and Martin Moran appear in the other plays that bookend Mr. Guare's compassionate, engrossing tribute to Czyzewska, which also features the Polish-born actor Omar Sangare (1:45).

'The Tutors' Erica Lipez's likable, well-observed comedy-drama focuses on three Manhattan millennials (well played by Keith Nobbs, Matt Dellapina and Aubrey Dollar) trying to get a social network off the ground while they pay the bills by tutoring clients like the needy, entitled high schooler played by Chris Perfetti. Thomas Kail (''In the Heights'') directs (2:00). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)

'The Seagull' The New York Classical Theater's free outdoor production of Chekhov's classic does a fine job of telling the story of its late-19th-century lovers, losers and dreamers at a Russian country estate. The translation can be simplistic at times, but the great lines are there and the settings (the audience moves en masse several times) couldn't be more beautiful (1:40).

'Showgirls! The Musical!' If ever a movie were ripe for a sendup, it's Paul Verhoeven's 1995 turkey, ''Showgirls.'' The lurid story of a hitchhiker turned pole dancer turned Las Vegas star is catnip for any devotee of camp, and this frenetic production pushes it into the camp stratosphere, with X-rated songs, abundant toplessness and a much higher male quotient. Alas, the movie's misogyny lingers. The tireless and fearless April Kidwell, however, in the Elizabeth Berkley role, is a wonder: Her vibrant physicality and knowing humor inadvertently constitute a welcome riposte to the story's mockery of its protagonist (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00).

'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Catherine Rampell)

'Gorilla' (closes on Sunday) Five underperforming businessmen are trapped in a series of team-building workshops, where they endure ridiculous exercises intended to generate trust, or intimacy, or whatever it is that these insipid hand-holding, blindfold-wearing, allegedly soul-bearing drills are supposed to instill. Some of the gags are funny, but most are tired and drawn out. The show's attempt to offer more depth fails as well, partly because there are so many thinly developed story lines crammed into too little time (1:25).

'Nice Work if You Can Get It' (closes on Saturday) Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin.

HEADLINE: Debate on Environment Grows as Drought Tests Texas Rivers

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
BEAUMONT -- As the Neches River flows south toward a string of oil refineries and manufacturing plants in Southeast Texas, it winds through an area so ecologically diverse that the National Park Service runs a preserve called Big Thicket along its banks.
Despite recent spring rains, years of drought have caught up to the landscape. In 2011, the driest year in recorded Texas history, part of the river became so stagnant that it turned black.
''You see all those dead trees?'' said Kirk Winemiller, who runs an aquatic ecology laboratory at Texas A&M University, pointing from a boat toward bald cypress trees that rose like ghosts along the bank. ''They weren't dead when we came out in 2011.'' (Texas A&M University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) 
Like the Neches, other rivers across Texas have been severely tested by the long-running drought, which still blankets most of the state and comes on top of increasing demands for water from a growing population and industrial base. Average stream-flow measurements are well below normal, especially in western regions, prompting worries about increased salinity and the health of fish and plants. The environmental group American Rivers recently listed the San Saba River in the Hill Country as the country's third-most-endangered river, because of heavy pumping by farmers.
Six years ago, the Texas government began an effort to manage the rivers' health better. But environmental advocates fear that ecology still takes a back seat while the state frets about having enough water in the future for its growing cities. And climate change threatens further disruptions.
The Texas water plan, a wish list of water-supply projects like reservoirs that lawmakers are willing to spend $2 billion to finance, includes no projects to help fish and wildlife, said Myron Hess, who manages the Texas Water Program for the National Wildlife Federation.
''In my mind, it's not acceptable to just say we're not going to worry about what's going to happen to the environment,'' he said, noting that rivers offer economy-boosting activities like fishing, tourism and recreation.
Merry Klonower, a spokeswoman for the Texas Water Development Board, said that the state water plan did take water for the environment into account, because the water supply available was reduced.
Texas' focus on the environmental health of its rivers increased in 2007, when state lawmakers passed a bill that created a process for studying and managing ''environmental flows,'' the amount of water needed to sustain the ecology of major river basins and bays.
The bill ''represents one of the most groundbreaking environmental compromises'' between Texas water suppliers and environmental groups, said Mary Kelly, who runs Parula, an environmental consulting firm in Austin, and was involved in the negotiations.
After a river basin is studied, scientists, farmers, citizens, water suppliers and other stakeholders make recommendations for its management. The input also takes future water needs of people and businesses into account. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state's environmental agency, has the final say over how much water should flow down the river. Lawmakers provided $2 million in additional money for the process during the legislative session that concluded recently.
On a practical level, environmental flow standards can translate to the release of more water from reservoirs. This spring, for example, the agency that manages Texas' Colorado River released a large amount of water -- roughly equivalent to 35,000 Texas households' annual use -- from its reservoirs to aid the blue sucker, a threatened fish species, during its spawning season.
The agency has already issued flow standards for a number of rivers, including the Colorado, but it has more to cover, including the Rio Grande, the Brazos and the Nueces. Dr. Winemiller and Ms. Kelly (who serves on a science advisory committee in the flows process) say that the commission's recommendations have often fallen short of scientific recommendations. So the ecological standards for rivers like the Neches, the Trinity and the Guadalupe are not as high as scientists (and even some stakeholders) think they should be.
''T.C.E.Q.'s adopted environmental flow standards include many of the science team and stakeholder recommendations,'' Terry Clawson, an agency spokesman, said in an e-mail.
A big concern hangs over this river-management process: if the state cannot manage its own rivers, the federal government could step in to help, amid concerns about endangered species.
A court case with potentially significant implications for Texas river management involves the whooping crane, an endangered bird that likes to spend winters on the Texas coast. In March, a federal district judge ruled that the environmental quality commission had failed to ensure that sufficient water to aid the whooping cranes was released down the Guadalupe and San Antonio Rivers. At least 23 cranes died as a result, the judge found.
Texas has appealed, and a federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in the case in August.
''Texas is very proud of their history of making largely autonomous water-permitting, water-use decisions,'' said David Smith, a lawyer with the Austin firm Graves Dougherty Hearon & Moody. ''You throw a couple of federal listed species in the mix, and all of a sudden you have those decisions being made with the specter of having federal oversight.'' (Graves Dougherty Hearon & Moody is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)
In the coming years, Texas may encounter further endangered-species questions involving its waterways. For example, the federal government is expected to consider whether to list various species of freshwater mussels found in Texas rivers.
Meanwhile, human demands continue to put pressure on the rivers. The United States Army Corps of Engineers is seeking Congressional approval to deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, downstream from Big Thicket near the Gulf of Mexico, to allow larger ships to reach the ports.
That could cause more saltwater to flow upriver, scientists say. The saltwater, which can harm swamp vegetation, is stopped by a barrier near Beaumont, which protects the city's water supply.
When the river turned black two years ago, saltwater was a key factor -- some of it left over from Hurricane Ike in 2008, according to Scott Hall, general manager of the Lower Neches Valley Authority, which manages the river and sells its water.
A paper mill has a permit to discharge an average of 65 million gallons of wastewater daily into the Neches not far below the barrier. Mr. Hall said in an e-mail, however, that he believed ''the water color was much more influenced by the high salt concentration than the paper mill effluent.''
This year, with the rains, the river system is ''in pretty good shape,'' he added.

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
8 P.M. (Sundance) AMERICAN GIGOLO (1980) Julian Kaye (Richard Gere), a Los Angeles hustler, revels in the high life with all the trappings -- the Mercedes, the Armani suits, entree to the swankiest establishments -- with a succession of married women in this cult thriller from Paul Schrader. Then, after Julian does a favor for his former pimp (Bill Duke), a woman ends up dead. Julian's actual client won't give him an alibi, the police detective investigating the case doesn't believe his denials and only one person can help him -- a frustrated politician's wife (Lauren Hutton, above with Mr. Gere), the sole woman he doesn't charge for his services. Debbie Harry's ''Call Me'' is the soundtrack's centerpiece.
8 A.M. (Fox News) FOX & FRIENDS As part of the show's ''All-American Summer Concert Series,'' Foreigner performs some greatest hits and talks about its tour. 
NOON (Fox Business) INTERVIEW WITH CHRISTINE LAGARDE In a report from Washington, Liz Claman interviews Ms. Lagarde (right), managing director of the International Monetary Fund, about its annual review of the United States economy, as well as global economic troubles.
NOON (MoreMax) CAPE FEAR (1991) In this Martin Scorsese remake of the 1962 thriller that was originally directed by J. Lee Thompson and starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, Robert De Niro portrays Max Cady, a paroled psycho with a fondness for human flesh, out for vengeance against the Southern lawyer who defended him. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange play the target and his wife; Juliette Lewis is their daughter. ''Mr. Scorsese is having fun with 'Cape Fear,' at heart a shaggy-dog story, but he brings to it the same manic intensity and innovative techniques evident in his more solemn work,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. ''Stay away if you're squeamish, but, if you do, you'll miss an essential work by one of our masters, as well as two of the year's most accomplished performances, those of Mr. De Niro and Ms. Lewis.''
8 P.M. (Disney) UP (2009) Ed Asner lends his voice to Carl Fredricksen, a widower and former balloon salesman who, at 78, is sent sky high when thousands of balloons carry him and his house aloft in this Oscar-winning animated feature from Pete Docter, with Bob Peterson as co-director. Jordan Nagai is Russell, the rotund boy who hitches a ride. And Christopher Plummer is Charles Muntz, a famous aviator and explorer and Carl's childhood hero. Carl runs into Muntz, now an old man, when his house floats down to earth in South America. ''Though the initial images of flight are wonderfully rendered -- the house shudders and creaks and splinters and groans as it's ripped from its foundation by the balloons -- the movie remains bound by convention, despite even its modest 3-D depth,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times.
9 P.M. (Starz) MAGIC CITY A second season begins with Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) sitting in jail after being arrested for murder while his wife, Vera (Olga Kurylenko); his son, Stevie (Steven Strait); and the Miramar Playa staff scurry to raise bail money -- and in the process discover the secret of Ike's silent partners. Ben Diamond (Danny Huston), meanwhile, worries that Ike will crumble under pressure from the State Attorney Jack Klein (Matt Ross) and offers some unexpected help.
10 P.M. (NBC) ROCK CENTER WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS Harry Smith hikes in the Nevada mountains with the 19-year-old Taylor Wilson, who at 11 told his parents that he wanted to build a nuclear reactor in his garage. Three years later he became the youngest person to build a fusor, a low-power nuclear fusion reactor. Since then he has invented a less expensive way to make medical isotopes to treat cancer and a better way to detect dirty bombs. In other segments, Ann Curry interviews Bibi Aisha, whose mutilated face became a symbol of brutality against women in Afghanistan. And Kate Snow speaks with Cesar Millan, a k a the Dog Whisperer, about efforts to rebuild his life after a divorce and a suicide attempt.
1 A.M. (13) THEATER TALK Jesse Green of New York magazine, Michael Musto of Gawker and Out.com and Patrick Pacheco of The Los Angeles Times recap the Tony Awards, including upsets and outrageous moments.

HEADLINE: Nikkei Dives More Than 6 Percent

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The battered Japanese stock market lurched into bear-market territory Thursday, after a tumble of 6.4 percent took the combined decline in the Nikkei 225 index since a peak on May 23 to more than 21 percent.
A pronounced sell-off in the morning and early afternoon accelerated shortly before the markets closed in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended down more than 840 points at 12,445.38, its lowest level since early April. 
Global markets reacted badly at first, with the Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for euro zone blue chips, down almost 2 percent in morning trading. But European shares later recovered most of their losses, and stocks on Wall Street opened quietly after new reports showed recent improvements in the American economy.
The drop in Japan on Thursday was one of many sharp declines seen in recent weeks, since a feverish six-month rally in Japanese stocks -- incited by optimism over the government's aggressive efforts to reinvigorate the listless economy -- came to an abrupt end.
The Nikkei 225 soared more than 80 percent between mid-November and mid-May, but staged a sudden about-face with a 7.3 percent plunge on May 23.
Sentiment has been fragile and trading volatile ever since, as investors have taken stock of the challenges that face ''Abenomics,'' the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and weighed the pros and cons of taking profits after the rally.
A renewed rise in the yen also has eroded a factor that, for months, had worked to support Japanese stocks. The yen weakened substantially between November and May -- a welcome development for Japanese exporters as it made their goods less expensive for customers overseas.
But the currency's move, like that of the stock market, reversed in late May. On Thursday, the yen traded around 94.00 to the American dollar, its strongest level since early April.
In Tokyo, Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, brushed off the market plunge.
''I feel it's important not to swing from joy to sorrow every time stock prices rise or fall, and keep on doing what we need to do,'' Mr. Suga said at a news conference Thursday morning, as shares fell. ''The Japanese economy is steadily improving.''
The Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, met with Mr. Abe on Thursday to exchange views on the economy, according to local news reports. Mr. Abe told the governor he was determined to do his part in putting a growth plan into action, Mr. Kuroda later told reporters. Mr. Kuroda told the prime minister that the central bank was committed to supporting the Japanese economy through monetary stimulus.
Mr. Kuroda also said he expected markets to soon ''calm down to reflect positive developments in the economy,'' according to the Nikkei Web site. On Monday, the Japanese government revised its first-quarter gross domestic product figures, saying its economy grew at an annualized pace of 4.1 percent between January and March, better than the 3.5 percent it initially reported. But that upgrade has not been enough to calm investor jitters.
Factors beyond Japan also have helped send markets lower around the world.
In China, which is a key engine of global growth, the flow of economic data in recent weeks has reinforced the picture of an economy that is struggling to regain momentum.
And in the United States, comments on May 22 by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that he and his colleagues might consider paring back their bond-buying programs ''in the next few meetings'' if the economy shows signs of improvement have helped fan global nervousness. Investors and analysts have struggled to assess the implications of even a small withdrawal of the bond buying that has supported markets in recent years.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have sagged 3.2 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the past three weeks. The DAX in Germany has fallen about 4.5 percent and the CAC 40 in France has dropped more than 6 percent.
Key markets in the Asia-Pacific region have tumbled even more. The Straits Times index in Singapore and the S.&P./ASX 200 in Australia have lost more than 9 percent since May 22, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng has shed more than 10 percent.
A pessimistic outlook issued Wednesday by the World Bank added to the gloom, with Kaushik Basu, the bank's chief economist, noting in a news release that ''the slowdown in the real economy is turning out to be unusually protracted.''
The bank, based in Washington, cut its forecast for global growth to 2.2 percent from a January forecast of 2.4 percent growth.
In explaining the revision, Mr. Basu cited high unemployment in the developed world and slower-than-expected growth in emerging economies. He also noted that India was expanding at a rate below 6 percent for the first time in a decade.

HEADLINE: Indifferent About the Less Fortunate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (''The Big Shrug,'' column, June 10) wonders why policy makers aren't more concerned about the continuing high unemployment rate. As possible reasons, he mentions the continuing influence of the deficit scolds, the fatalism of policy makers and the positive trend.
I can think of one other reason: our attitude toward the poor and the unemployed has changed. In contemporary American society, some tend to blame the less fortunate for their plight -- they are seen as lazy and taking advantage of the system. Sadly, we are less compassionate than we used to be.

KIMMEL CENTER, WINDOWS GALLERY: 'ALIEN SCRIPT' (through Aug. 1) The first exhibition of drawings by Walter Mosley, better known as a crime-fiction writer and the author of ''Devil in a Blue Dress,'' is on view in the Windows Gallery at New York University's Kimmel Center.
The 18 images on view here were selected by the curator Lydie Diakhaté -- and organized by the university's Institute of African American Affairs -- from nine of Mr. Mosley's notebooks, which contain more than 500 drawings in pen and ink, watercolor, various paints, crayon, oil pastel and permanent markers. (Above, an untitled work from the series.)
The works are accompanied by the first paragraph of ''Devil in a Blue Dress'' and translated into one of nine languages. In materials for the exhibition Mr. Mosley says of his artwork, ''This Alien Script has become my bid for art, my exploration in the language(s) of line, form and color; unruly textures and songs of dark and light.'' 
An opening reception on Monday starts at 6 p.m.; reservations suggested, at (212) 998-4222. Otherwise the works can be viewed daily, at any time, at 60 Washington Square South, between Thompson Place and La Guardia Place, Greenwich Village; africanastudies.as.nyu.edu; (212) 998-2981; free.

HEADLINE: Seeking Compromise

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
As federal regulators stumble toward a deadline to rein in risky trading overseas, one official has introduced plans that he hopes will salvage the overhaul.
On Thursday, Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, called on his agency to strike a compromise over the so-called cross-border plan. While Mr. Chilton signaled a willingness to phase in certain regulations over time, he argued that the agency should finalize its plan ahead of a mid-July deadline.
''We can complete our work on cross-border issues now and provide certainty to markets now,'' Mr. Chilton said in a speech on Thursday. 
If completed by the deadline, the guidance would clarify the breadth of new trading rules adopted in the wake of the financial crisis, when overseas risk-taking imperiled some of the largest financial firms in the United States. In particular, the guidance would outline how the rules apply to foreign banks and overseas affiliates of banks based in the United States, taking aim at those that ship trading overseas to escape scrutiny from United States regulators.
The issue -- arguably the most contentious aspect of a federal crackdown on the $700 trillion marketplace for financial instruments known as derivatives -- has set off a Wall Street lobbying frenzy and divided the trading commission's five-member panel.
With only a month to go before the agency's self-imposed deadline, the commissioners find themselves at odds on crucial aspects of the plan, including how much to defer to European regulators, who have yet to finalize their own overhaul of derivatives trading. And in recent days, an even thornier question arose: should the commissioners delay the plan until 2014 to allow the Europeans time to catch up?
Mr. Chilton, seen as the most liberal of the agency's commissioners, is advocating something of a middle ground.
In a speech before the Institute of International Bankers at the Yale Club in New York, he proposed that the agency complete a strict version of the guidance before the July 13 deadline. But in a compromise, he also suggested that the agency grant foreign affiliates of United States banks extra time to comply with certain derivatives rules.
''We need to make sure the right institutions are subject to appropriate regulation and oversight with recent history as a guide,'' Mr. Chilton said. ''At the same time, we should simultaneously implement targeted, staggered cross-border compliance.''
Under Mr. Chilton's plan, the agency would allow the overseas affiliates a brief reprieve before complying with certain derivatives rules created under the Dodd-Frank Act, even though the banks have had three years to prepare for the law since it was passed after the financial crisis. The law, among other things, requires banks to register with regulators, push their derivatives trades onto regulated trading platforms and turn over a battery of information about their trades.
Mr. Chilton, who appeared on CNBC to promote the plan, called it an ''appropriately nuanced, time-limited solution,'' an approach that could satisfy critics of the cross-border guidance without alienating proponents of derivatives reform.
Yet the fate of his plan is unclear. While it could be one of the few viable options left with the mid-July deadline looming, the internal wrangling at the trading commission could jeopardize any last-ditch deal-making.
Mr. Chilton and Gary Gensler, a Democratic and chairman of the trading commission, are at odds with two Republican commissioners and another Democrat, Mark Wetjen, who have raised concerns about the guidance.
The Republicans, who would like to put off writing the guidance until the end of the year, argue that it could produce conflicts with foreign regulators and drive trading business away from Wall Street banks to overseas competitors. An extended deadline, they argue, will allow foreign regulators time to draft derivatives rules of their own.
Their approach echoes concerns raised by some of the world's top finance ministers, who are concerned that United States authorities are overstepping their borders.
But Mr. Gensler, whose term ends at the end of the year, has cautioned against a deadline extension. Mr. Chilton also came out against such a move on Thursday, arguing that the stability of the global financial system is at stake.
Just five years ago, foreign derivatives trading by the American International Group in London nearly brought American firms to their knees. JPMorgan Chase's recent $6 billion trading loss, which took place at a London-based unit, further highlighted that risk-taking overseas can come crashing back to American shores.
While Mr. Gensler and Mr. Chilton are outnumbered, the agency is unable to extend the deadline unless the chairman approves.
''I appreciate and understand this approach, although it doesn't do what Dodd-Frank requires us to do,'' Mr. Chilton will say on Thursday.
The debate stems from the fine print of Dodd-Frank. Under the 2010 law, the trading commission is supposed to apply swaps reforms outside the United States only if those activities have ''a direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.''
Overseas trades that involve American companies, or a foreign company that is guaranteed by an American bank, are most likely to be covered. It is unclear, however, how much the trading commission will offer so-called substituted compliance, in which the trading commission will defer to foreign regulators as long as they have rules that generally compare to Dodd-Frank.
As the trading commission grapples with the nuance of the law, it has been inundated with complaints from banking lobbyists. Lawmakers, too, have taken aim at the agency. The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would curtail the agency's ability to apply Dodd-Frank rules overseas, which could encourage the trading commission to delay its guidance.
But Mr. Chilton says the agency has had enough time to finish its work.
''This can be done,'' he said in the speech. ''It needs to be done.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Getting More Bang for the Buck in Higher Education

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The federal government could do much more to take advantage of the investment in higher education by pressing colleges to be more accountable and flexible, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. 
Republicans and Democrats are hurtling toward another bipartisan standoff, this one over rival plans on the interest rates to be charged on subsidized federal loans to help students and their families pay for postsecondary education. Unless Congress can agree on a plan, the interest rate on new loans will double on July 1 to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent. 
While the interest rate on student loans is important, there are much bigger problems in the financing of higher education: soaring tuition costs, the exploding volume of total student debt and shockingly low college completion rates. Americans are spending unprecedented amounts, both privately and publicly, on higher education. What are the returns? Are there ways to get more bang for the buck on this substantial investment in the nation's future work force?
Students are already borrowing about $113 billion a year, more than twice as much as a decade ago, and student debt now tops $1 trillion. The federal government accounts for nearly 90 percent of all student loans and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that students will take out $1.4 trillion in new federal loans over the next decade. 
For young college graduates the unemployment rate is 8.8 percent, and the underemployment rate, which includes those who have given up looking for a job or who are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job, is about 18.3 percent. In addition, many college graduates have been forced to settle for low-paying jobs that do not require a college degree. 
Not surprisingly, the default rate on student loans is increasing: more than 13 percent of students whose loans came due in 2009 were in default as of September 2012, meaning that they had missed payments on their loans for more than 60 days.

The rising cost of college and the soaring student debt burden have led some to conclude that a college education is a bad investment for young Americans. Don't believe the naysayers. The value of a college education as a way to improve lifetime earnings is near an all-time high. The returns to a college education outpace the returns to other investments - stocks, bonds, housing and gold - by sizable margins. A college graduate is almost 20 percentage points more likely to be employed than someone with a high-school diploma. Although the cost of a college degree is 50 percent higher than it was 30 years ago, the increase in lifetime earnings associated with a college degree is now 75 percent higher. 
Higher education is also a good investment for the country. In a recent study, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development compared the fiscal costs and fiscal benefits of higher education. The fiscal costs include government spending on higher education and forgone tax revenues while students are not working. The fiscal benefits include higher tax revenues from college graduates because of higher incomes and lower outlays for safety-net programs. The bottom line: on average across O.E.C.D. countries, the public return from higher education is about four to one - with a net public benefit of $100,000 per man and about $52,000 per woman. In the United States, the net public benefit is more than $250,000, or five to one for men and about three to one for women. A college degree has not closed the gender pay gap, but it does generate sizable returns for both men and women.
From a fiscal standpoint, cutting government spending on higher education may be penny-wise but it is undoubtedly pound-foolish. That said, there are certainly ways to improve the returns to both private and public spending on higher education, starting with our dismal performance on completion rates. 
Almost half of all students who begin college at a two- or four-year institution - about 60 percent of Hispanic and black students - will not get a degree within six years. When students leave college with no credential and huge debt, they are often worse off than when they entered. The average default rate for those with no credential is more than four times the rate for those with a bachelor's degree.
College is supposed to be the great social equalizer, and the share of low-income students entering college has climbed sharply as a result of federal and state assistance. But despite successful public investment in improving access to higher education, the gap in college completion rates between students from the bottom and top fifths of the income distribution has doubled since the early 1970s. Today, students from the top 20 percent of the income distribution are seven times more likely to graduate than those from the bottom 20 percent. Low-income students are much more likely to end up with crushing debt and nothing to show for it. 
What can be done? A report just released by the Center for American Progress contains several worthwhile recommendations. ("300 Million Engines of Growth: A Middle-Out Plan for Jobs, Business and a Growing Economy," Center for American Progress, June 2013). The first step is greater transparency, and technology as well as disclosure can be helpful here. For students to make wiser choices among competing postsecondary institutions and programs, it must be easier to compare costs, average debt loads, completion and graduation rates, and placement rates after graduation. A bipartisan bill, whose backers include Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would require the Department of Education to provide easy access to clear, current and verified information on every college and university whose students receive federal support. 
Transparency isn't enough, however. A second step is the use of such data by the federal and state governments to hold postsecondary educational institutions accountable for their performance. The federal government has an immense potential stick to influence performance: it could withhold financial aid and student loan support for institutions that do not prove their value. 
President Obama has called on Congress to incorporate performance standards on affordability, debt loads and completion rates into the accreditation process that determines the eligibility of institutions for federal student support. The administration has created a "score card" to track performance on these measures. And building on the success of the "Race to the Top" competitions in K-12 education, the administration has proposed grant competitions among states and colleges to improve affordability and completion rates. Several states are already experimenting with programs that link aid for higher education to measures of student performance.
A recent report by a coalition of the leading nonprofit higher-education associations identified college completion rates as the top priority, calling for more program flexibility, easier credit transfers and more online courses to enable more timely completion of degrees, especially among nontraditional students juggling the demands of education, work and family. Of course, higher completion rates in themselves do not speak to the quality of the education provided, so attention must be paid to how colleges make it easier for students to complete degrees. For example, the availability of stand-alone open online courses is no guarantee that students will complete their course requirements and get a degree. Online courses and e-mentoring systems must by packaged into programs that include scalable and significant faculty-student interactions leading to meaningful degrees. 
Despite its rising cost, college education remains a great investment both for students and for the country. But there is much more that can be done to increase the value of this investment by improving completion rates through greater transparency and accountability, greater program flexibility and the growth of well-planned online courses and degree programs.

HEADLINE: What Is Bernanke Thinking?

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street tries to guess the Federal Reserve&#8217;s direction. | Gannett is betting that owning 30 or 40 television stations is good business. | After the announcement that the head of the Royal Bank of Scotland was leaving, lawmakers and investors registered their displeasure. | More public companies are &#8220;going dark,&#8221; raising concerns. 

 BODY:
WHAT IS BERNANKE THINKING? | Second-guessing the Federal Reserve may be a Wall Street parlor game, but it is one that has taken on heightened significance in recent years, as markets have become more dependent on central bank support than at any time in recent memory, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. Since May 22, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said the stimulus might diminish, global stock markets have lost $3 trillion in value, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The question focusing the minds of investors across Wall Street is: Why did Mr. Bernanke say that? The Fed chairman will get another chance to explain his intentions at a scheduled news conference next week and in his semiannual testimony to Congress next month. But in the meantime, four theories are circulating about his comments in May, Mr. Eavis says. Some speculate that Mr. Bernanke may be throwing a bone to hawks within the Fed; others say Mr. Bernanke may be tying to put a damper on some of the frothiest markets. A different theory holds that the Fed was treating that message as a dress rehearsal, and yet another notion is that Mr. Bernanke has indeed shifted his stance. 
Jon Hilsenrath, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal whose writings are closely scrutinized by investors, weighed in on Thursday, saying the Fed is not close to ending its stimulus. "An adjustment in the program won't mean that it will end all at once, officials say, and even more importantly it won't mean that the Fed is anywhere near raising short-term interest rates," Mr. Hilsenrath reported. "Investors aren't listening."
GANNETT'S TV PLAY | "Owning a big-city television station can be a good business bet, even as the sector faces formidable competition from the Internet. But a better bet is owning 30 or 40 of them," Brian Stelter and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook. "That is the thinking behind a surge of consolidation in local television that crested on Thursday when the Gannett Company agreed to buy the Belo Corporation for about $1.5 billion in cash. Analysts said the deal was the biggest deal in local television in more than a decade."
"For Gannett, best known for owning USA Today and a batch of smaller newspapers from coast to coast, the addition of Belo will nearly double its number of stations, to 43, from 23. It is the latest step in a yearlong strategy by Gannett to diversify its media operations amid continued struggles in the print industry." Investors welcomed the news, sending the stock up 34 percent to close at $26.60 on Thursday.
R.B.S. FACES DOUBTS | A day after the announcement that Stephen Hester, the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was leaving, British lawmakers and international investors registered their displeasure, with the bank's shares falling as much as 8 percent on Thursday before closing down about 3.3 percent. "Much of the criticism has centered on whether George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, played a role in Mr. Hester's ouster," Mark Scott and Julia Werdigier write in DealBook. "Mr. Osborne is to make a speech next week outlining how to privatize the bank and another British rival, the Lloyds Banking Group, though some opposition politicians say they believe he has already decided on how to proceed."
ON THE AGENDA | Thomas Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and H. Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell, are discussing "too important to fail" banks at the Brookings Institution. Data on industrial production in May is out at 9:15 a.m. Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund is on Fox Business Network at 12 p.m. Richard Cordray of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is on Bloomberg TV at 4:30 p.m.
WHEN COMPANIES GO DARK | Public companies that do not have very many shareholders are increasingly availing themselves of the right to "go dark," meaning they no longer have to file financial information with the Securities and Exchange Commission but remain publicly traded, Floyd Norris, a columnist for The New York Times, writes. When a company goes dark, "investors are in, but they may or may not be told what is going on. Companies that go dark sometimes make audited financial statements public, and sometimes they do not."
"There is no better example of the perils of going dark - as well as proof that 'preferred' can be a misnomer when it comes to stock - than the former Equity Inns, an owner of hotels, whose common shares were acquired by Goldman Sachs in 2007."

HEADLINE: Not Just Talking the Talk in Washington

BYLINE: AMI KASSAR


HIGHLIGHT: At a conference about small-business financing, I thought I saw some encouraging signs. 

 BODY:
Sunday night, I packed my bag and broke my own rules by dusting off my navy suit and a tie for what I feared would be another day of Washington blather. And then on Monday, I participated in what was billed as the Capital Access Innovation Summit, which was sponsored by the Small Business Administration and the Department of the Treasury. It was not what I expected.
In the morning, the plenary sessions featured bankers, government leaders, corporate executives, and alternative lenders sharing their carefully scripted messages with a group of about 150 of us who had gathered for the day. We were an interesting mix of small-business owners, S.B.A. officials, Treasury officials, bankers, alternative lenders, academics and various other folks in the small-business finance community. I was genuinely impressed by the group. 
Among those I met were a few people and companies I had not previously encountered. Lending Club, for example, was there to discuss its plans to start financing small businesses over the next few months. If the plans come to fruition, it sounds as if the company will be lending at an annual percentage rate between 9 and 10 percent, which is a fraction of the price being charged by some of the current alternative lenders who also attended the event. 
I enjoyed meeting the leader of the American Dream Fund, which has built a platform that matches entrepreneurs with various local and state grants and funds that can be tough to identify and find. And I was fascinated to meet the chief executive of a company, North End Financial, that provides collateral to banks that make loans to small businesses of less than $200,000. This is similar to the idea of a collateral exchange that I have blogged about.
The rhythm of the day changed dramatically in the afternoon when attendees got to choose break-out sessions. These offered conversations on many different topics. I think for the first time I appreciated some of the challenges that the political appointees struggle with as they try to drive change. I realized that many of them suffer frustrations similar to my own.
The discussions had a different vibe. Instead of contributing to an us-versus-them confrontation, we all rolled up our sleeves and tried to figure out the right things to do. It was nice to see Jacob Lew, the Treasury secretary, come into some of these sessions and listen intently. Some of my favorite discussions concerned the powerful economic impact likely to result if large corporations would simply pay their small-business suppliers faster and free up their cash flow. A program like this would be about Americans helping Americans, and might not require any legislation or tax policy.
I was also impressed by the conversation about the marketing challenges facing the S.B.A. The agency offers many programs that could work wonders for many small businesses - at rates that are reasonable and affordable. Unfortunately, many small-business owners either don't know about these programs or they don't know how to find lenders that facilitate them. My hope is that the sexiness of the new alternative lenders, many of whom played a role in the conference, will not overshadow the more traditional programs that offer lower rates.
After some of my previous trips to Washington, I felt as if I had wasted my time. I left frustrated, wondering why I had bothered to make the trip. This time, as I took off my jacket, loosened my tie, and walked back to my hotel, I felt different. I hope the feeling lasts.

HEADLINE: Struggles Behind Him, a Poet of El Barrio Embraces Life

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Earlier this year, Jesus Melendez, known as Papoleto, could not sleep because of a financial crisis. But after a story on his plight was published, his life changed. 

 BODY:
Inside a cluttered living room six stories above East 111th Street in El Barrio, the sounds of construction crews and laughing children gave way to the strains of "Nessun Dorma," the Unknown Prince's aria from Puccini's "Turandot." Jesus Melendez sat at his computer, transfixed, his folded hands touching his lips.
"Vanish, o night!" a tenor sang in Italian on a YouTube video. "Set, stars! Set, stars! 
"At dawn, I will win! I will win! I will win!"
The recording ended.
"'None Shall Sleep,' that is the best damn aria," he said, shaking his head. "If you want to cry, play that. You'll cry even if you don't know the words. But I do."
He has lived them. Earlier this year, he could not sleep because of a financial crisis that left him three months behind on his rent and facing the possibility of losing the same apartment where he had lived as a child. Though famed as Papoleto, a founder of the Nuyorican poetry movement, he might as well have been as unknown as Puccini's prince, since teaching jobs and paid recitals were scarce.
Days after a story on his plight was published, Papoleto's life changed. A famed photographer paid his back rent. A New Jersey poet raised $3,255 from fellow poets and writers. He was invited to speak at colleges, and Pregones Theater in the Bronx announced a collaboration. An admirer even set up a poetry hot line: 630-4ARHYME.
Best of all, he landed two jobs doing poetry workshops.
Instead of hiding in his apartment, he embraces life on the streets of El Barrio. In the last week alone, he went from finishing an anthology of his students' poems and attending the wake of Ibrahim Gonzalez, a gifted musician and dear friend, to marching in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. (And befitting poetic royalty, he was ferried in a pedicab.)
He watches, he listens. He does what poets must - feed his mind and soul in the hope that he can write words that touch your heart.
"I don't mind struggle," said Papoleto, who just turned 63. "I don't believe in easy-breezy. Your blood has to boil sometimes. But when you get older, you want security."
He is especially grateful to Carmen Bardeguez-Brown, the principal of the School for Excellence in the Bronx, located inside the landmark building that was originally Morris High School. Because of her, he got an eight-week residency that will continue in the fall.
"The kids love him; we love him," said Ms. Bardeguez-Brown. "He changes the culture of the school. He brings so much history and passion as an icon of Latino culture. You can't quantify that. He's just amazing."
He is a little amazed too - he attended the old Morris. It's where he came of age, became a poet and published his first book - in the school's basement print shop. He speaks excitedly about his workshop and how he guided students through the process of figuring out their thoughts, writing them as narratives and then fashioning them into poems. He teaches them craft, an alien discipline in the era of spoken-word celebrity.
"Kids have trouble just sitting down and writing," he said. "Some people say when they go to prison and have solitude, they can learn to write. People don't need to go to prison to learn to write! They need to go to college."
With the afternoon sun warm and bright, he needed to get out. He walked south along Second Avenue, peering into store windows, pointing out new buildings and old hangouts. He dropped in on a bookstore and headed for the poetry section. They had Neruda, but not his recent anthology, "Hey Yo! Yo Soy!" He left, grumbling.
"I walk in," he muttered, "and they look at me like I had on a ski mask."
He headed north, past new high-rises and chic pubs that have attracted newcomers to the old - and vanishing - Barrio.
"We have cultural interlopers here," he said. "Capitalists who benefit from the cultural identity of a community whose leadership they never knew. They come here to exploit and logo-ize 'El Barrio This' and 'El Barrio That.' But they've built their whole thing on a poltergeist, on the backs and graves of a diaspora. And with a poltergeist, you know what's going to happen!"
His mood eased as he encountered some friends. By dinnertime, he was settled into a spot by the window of Camaradas, where he jotted down thoughts and chatted with strangers. Not a bad day for a poet. As he walked home, he stopped under a tree and listened to a bright, chirping aria.
"The birds are coming home," he said. "That's their conversation about the day. They're reporting to God."
He smiled and kept walking. The sun was setting, but his mood would not. It was dusk, and he had won.

HEADLINE: Polls Show Chemical Weapons Affect Public's View on Syria

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Polls have found that public support for intervention in Syria increases sharply under circumstances where it is confirmed that the Assad regime used chemical weapons. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration, which had long resisted sending weapons to antigovernment forces in Syria's civil war, has announced plans to supply the rebel forces with small arms after concluding that the troops of President Bashar al-Assad have used chemical weapons against them. 
The shift in administration policy on Syria seems reflective of public opinion. Polls have consistently shown Americans are deeply wary of the United States becoming involved in the fighting in Syria. But they also show that public support for intervention increases sharply under circumstances where it is confirmed that the Assad regime used chemical weapons.
Over all, the vast majority of Americans say they do not believe the United States has a responsibility to intervene in the Syrian conflict, which has killed more than 90,000 people over more than two years. On average, only about one in four Americans say the United States has an obligation to intervene. 
Polls that have asked whether the United States ought to get involved in Syria - rather than whether the United States simply has the responsibility to - have found similar numbers: A Gallup poll from late May found that 24 percent supported intervention. Just 17 percent supported intervention in a survey conducted in December by ABC News and The Washington Post.
Fewer surveys have asked respondents to suppose that the Assad regime used chemical weapons, but the ones that have found support for intervention increased substantially.
According to an average of the three surveys in the PollingReport.com database that asked, 58 percent of adults said they would support military intervention if it were confirmed that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons either on antigovernment forces or on civilians. (It remains to be seen, of course, whether public support for military intervention will actually increase now that such a confirmation has come.)
Polls have generally shown that, when presented with options, the public is more likely to support less invasive interventions in Syria. An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey [PDF] conducted from May 30 to June 2 found that 42 percent of respondents supported providing only humanitarian aid to the Syrian rebels, 15 percent favored taking military action, 11 percent supported providing arms and 24 percent advocated taking no action. Another NBC/Wall Street Journal survey [PDF] conducted from Feb. 29 to March 3 found similar results.
Two CNN/ORC surveys last year, conducted in August and December, found that roughly one in three respondents supported sending ground troops into Syria, while roughly 45 percent favored helping the rebels with military airstrikes.
The present course President Obama has chosen - sending small arms and ammunition to antigovernment forces - was supported by 41 percent of adults in the CNN survey from December. A Pew Research poll from around the same time found that just 24 percent of adults favored sending "arms and military supplies to anti-government groups in Syria."

HEADLINE: A Wider View of India's Foreign Policy Reveals Clear Strategy

BYLINE: DHRUVA JAISHANKAR


HIGHLIGHT: There are many reasons why India&#8217;s foreign policy remains something of an enigma to analysts, scholars, and reporters &#8212; both in India and abroad. 

 BODY:
Shinzo Abe has ruffled quite a few feathers since his return as Japan's prime minister in December. His cabinet ministers' visit in April to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, was condemned by China and South Korea, and in no time, Japan became the target of North Korean saber-rattling and American finger-wagging. So it ought to have elicited more surprise when Abe's soft-spoken Indian counterpart, Manmohan Singh, plainly declared his comfort with his host's worldview on a recent visit to Tokyo.
"India and Japan have a shared vision of a rising Asia," Mr. Singh said in a prepared speech. "Our relations draw their strength from our spiritual, cultural and civilizational affinities and a shared commitment to the ideals of democracy, peace and freedom," he said, adding, "Prime Minister Abe and I will work together to strengthen our strategic partnership." The declaration, which was accompanied by a rare private dinner between the two prime ministers, was seen in many quarters as an unambiguous signal to China. 
The last year has been a tough one for India under Mr. Singh's embattled leadership. His government has come to be perceived as ineffective - even absent, when it comes to responding to popular concerns such as the tragic gang rape of a student in Delhi - and venal, linked to one massive corruption scam after another, including a scandal over coal allocations that threatened to taint the prime minister personally. The once-booming Indian economy has slowed drastically, with growth recently forecast to have dropped under 5 percent. A brazen attack by Maoists in the central state of Chhattisgarh last month and an incursion by Chinese troops in northern Ladakh have drawn global attention to the government's inadequate handling of internal and external security challenges.
Criticism of all sorts has mounted. The Economist ran a cover story in March which argued that the country's lack of strategic culture promises to constrain its rise. The influential magazine Foreign Affairs published an article by the Boston University professor Manjari Chatterjee Miller which declared that New Delhi lacked strategic ambition. However, as Mr. Singh's speech in Tokyo hinted, such assertions about India's emergence may be more than a little misleading.
India's enigmatic foreign policy
There are many reasons why India's foreign policy remains something of an enigma to analysts, scholars, and reporters - both in India and abroad. The Indian government is averse to publishing strategic documents of the kind regularly released by the United States, most European states and even China. A careerist bureaucracy and hypercompetitive national politics encourage secrecy in decision-making. Policymakers have traditionally been distrustful of researchers and journalists, both Indian and foreign. And the views of disgruntled critics outside of government resonate far more loudly than bland official pronouncements do. But it is nonetheless clear that India's objectives since the end of the Cold War have remained remarkably consistent, and its performance surprisingly effective.
In essence, New Delhi's goals have been characterized by three features. The first is internal balancing: basically, attempts at increasing the country's resources and capabilities. This has involved the establishment and enhancement of economic and trade links with various countries in India's neighborhood and beyond. Almost 20 years after announcing a "Look East" policy, India agreed to lower tariffs with Japan, South Korea, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, while enjoying steadily deeper commercial relations with the United States, China and the European Union. Such efforts appear to have borne dividends: since 1997, India's total trade has grown more than sevenfold, about 60 percent faster than its economy.
Economic growth also requires stability, and Indian leaders have spoken repeatedly of their objective of maintaining a conducive regional environment for growth. This has been largely responsible for New Delhi's attempts at normalizing its relations with Pakistan and not intervening as aggressively in places like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. India has also made conscious attempts to enhance its technological capabilities. The centerpiece of New Delhi's new strategic relationship with Washington was a civil nuclear agreement, an attempt at gaining access to embargoed nuclear know-how.
The second facet that has marked India's external relations is deterrence, the dissuasion of others from using or threatening force. India withstood widespread international opprobrium after conducting five nuclear tests in 1998, a decision that enjoyed support across the country despite being portrayed as a nationalistic endeavor. In time, India's nuclear capability has helped stabilize relations with both Pakistan and China, countries with which it had fought wars in the past. In recent years, the Indian armed forces have also sought to diversify and gradually modernize their conventional weaponry, including combat aircraft, submarines and artillery. All of this has had positive effects. India's relations with China now exhibit many of the characteristics of normalcy. Manmohan Singh has also followed his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee in managing relations with Pakistan, including through a back-channel dialogue that seems to have come close to a grand bargain.
The third aspect of Indian foreign policy is autonomy, ensuring that the country is not unduly dependent on any one ally or partner. Thus, India has sought to diversify its sources of energy and other natural resources beyond a handful of suppliers in the Middle East to exporters in Africa and Latin America, among other places. Similarly, it sources much of its military equipment from Russia, Israel, Europe, and - increasingly - the United States. Diplomatic engagement with other major powers has also been active, as attested to by the regularity of two-way bilateral visits. In just one two-month period in late 2010, India received President Barack Obama of the United States, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, then-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China and then-President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia.
Consistency in pursuing India's primary objectives has generally risen above individual leaders and governments. A Congress-led government under P.V. Narasimha Rao oversaw preparations for a nuclear test in December 1995, even though tests were eventually carried out under the Bharatiya Janata Party. Similarly, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's B.J.P. government sought a nuclear agreement akin to the deal secured by Manmohan Singh. Both Mr. Vajpayee and Mr. Singh also made concerted attempts at normalizing ties with Pakistan and China. While never overtly declared as doctrine, India's quest for growth, security, and balanced relationships is intuitive to many members of its strategic community and its patterns of behavior largely consistent.
India's successes have by no means been categorical. Implementation has often been found wanting, as with its difficulty in concluding trade and security agreements. India's policymakers are also conscious of the country's severe limitations, making them reluctant to commit to ambitious endeavors. And India, not unlike other rising powers, is often content to "free ride" on others, making it all the more eager to downplay its own capabilities.
At the same time, there is no question that the country has made extraordinary strides in achieving its goals over the past two decades. India has far more resources, security, and friends than it did in 1991, the year it was confronted by a balance-of-payments crisis, several conflagrating insurgencies and the collapse of its primary ally, the Soviet Union. Perhaps there is more to India's strategic culture - and strategic ambition - than meets the eye.
What next?
An absence of further liberalization promises to jeopardize India's international clout, while providing real constraints on its ability to acquire the tools required of a great power. A further change may be brought about by China's behavior as it continues its rapid evolution into a global superpower. As the incursion in April by a few dozen Chinese soldiers into disputed territory along the border showed, indications of China's aggressive intent could galvanize Indian public opinion, push New Delhi towards adopting harder positions with Beijing and compel India to cooperate more closely with other countries that share its concerns about China's rise.
Additionally, India is undergoing a series of unprecedented social and political revolutions that, collectively, could alter its overall approach to international affairs. A new, post-Cold War generation of leaders could well adopt very different positions than their predecessors did. India's massive military may want to have a greater say on matters of national security. In Kashmir, for example, the army has resisted changes to its legal protection regime that were being advocated both by the cabinet and the state's chief minister. A competitive media environment could constrain or coerce India's leaders, preventing them from collaborating more closely with the United States, on the one hand, or forcing India to respond to Pakistani provocations on the other.
The diffusion of political power to regional parties, combined with coalition governments at the center, has already shown signs of altering India's approach towards its neighbors, for better and for worse. In recent years, regional parties have adopted strong positions on relations with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, contrary to New Delhi's stated objectives. India's thriving private sector is only now becoming a player on matters of foreign policy, compelling the Indian government to become a bigger advocate of Indian business interests abroad, including on such matters as immigration legislation in the United States. And an increasingly activist-oriented diaspora - with stronger links than ever to its country of origin - is beginning to feature prominently in India's international relations. The External Affairs Ministry, for example, weighed in recently on the treatment of Indian students in Australia and a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.
It is easy to take a superficial look at India's international behavior and see little more than haphazard decision-making and reticence. Foreign observers - and indeed many Indian commentators - have been doing so for years. The Indian government has not always helped itself with its failure to articulate its positions clearly. But taken together, India's behavior over the past two decades has demonstrated remarkable consistency, clarity and success. Perhaps it is time the rest of the world paid attention.

HEADLINE: This Summer, New York Loves Horse Racing

BYLINE: LESLIE KNAUF


HIGHLIGHT: For the first time in the 36-year history of New York State&#8217;s iconic &#8220;I Love NY&#8221; tourism campaign, a thrilling action image of horse racing is featured on the cover of the state&#8217;s annual summer travel guide &#8211; its signature promotional publication. 

 BODY:
Say what you will about the wisdom, or the inadvisability, of government's direct involvement in horse racing in New York, there are certain programmatic areas in which a close collaboration with the state can have a powerful and positive impact.
To that end, and for the first time in the 36-year history of New York State's iconic "I Love NY" tourism campaign, a thrilling action image of horse racing is featured on the cover of the state's annual summer travel guide - its signature promotional publication. 
The splashy color photo features horses captured in midair as they land over a steeplechase obstacle on the turf homestretch at Saratoga Race Course. The Eclipse Award-winning photographer Skip Dickstein shot the photo for The Albany Times Union, which allowed the state to use it for this year's guide. 
Published in both print and online editions, the travel guide is produced by the New York State Department of Economic Development's Division of Tourism and has long been one of the essential tools used to promote New York as a destination to consumers. 
An attractive, glossy magazine loaded with colorful images and detailed information on destinations and attractions across the state, the 132-page guide also provides information on autumn and winter activities, as well. And it's a bargain, too - it's free.
Hard copies of the print edition can be found at selected welcome centers across the state. It also can be requested for delivery by mail via the state's tourism Web site or via phone. 
Conveying the action, drama and excitement embodied in racing, the photo's placement on the state travel guide's cover is the result of a concerted effort by local tourism and business interests in Saratoga County to attract the state's participation in the promotion of a five-month celebration of the 150th anniversary of horse racing in Saratoga this summer that began May 1 in the picturesque upstate Victorian city.
Marylou Whitney, the beloved doyenne of horse racing in Saratoga, is an honorary chairperson of the Saratoga 150 celebration along with her husband John Hendrickson, and serves as its local celebrity spokesperson. 
The travel guide cover gives a strong boost to Saratoga Springs and the Saratoga 150 celebration, the historic race course and annual race meeting (which runs from July 19 through Labor Day this summer), and the surrounding region. More broadly, it boldly recognizes horse racing in New York, reinforcing the sport's image as fast-moving and thrilling to watch - with beautiful animals as its centerpiece - that visitors should not miss when visiting New York State.
Having spent the better part of 25 years involved in tourism promotion in New York State - half of those years in state government service overseeing the tourism services and welcome centers along the New York Thruway and promoting the state's 524-mile canal system, including the legendary Erie Canal, as a world-class tourism and recreational resource - I know how highly popular this publication is with both residents and visitors as an essential reference for planning vacations. As a tourism marketer, I also know that landing the annual state travel guide cover is a prime placement - a coveted bonus that automatically enhances any destination promotion effort.
At a time when horse racing can use all the friends it can get as marketing partners to help promote the sport and strengthen its recently beleaguered public image, highly influential ones like the state's I Love NY campaign - widely acknowledged as one of the most recognizable brands in the world - are some of the best kind to have. 
The timing of this featured exposure for racing is auspicious, too. In the closing minutes of an all-day tourism industry summit meeting convened in Albany on May 8, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the allocation of $60 million in new funding for the state's tourism promotion efforts, which represents the highest funding level in the history of the I Love NY campaign. It's a substantial boost for an industry that attracts to New York more than 200 million visitors annually, generates $57 billion in direct spending and is responsible for 714,000 jobs, according to the governor's office.
In its own right, the horse industry in New York - including racing, other horse sports and related equestrian activities, breeding, and ancillary businesses - has a $4.2 billion impact on the state's economy and generates the equivalent of about 33,000 full-time jobs, according to a study released in October by the New York State Horse Racing and Agriculture Industry Alliance. 
In December, the New York State Racing Fan Advisory Council released its first report and recommendations to the state's Racing and Wagering Board (now Gaming Commission). Included among the Council's recommendations was the development of an "I Love NY Horse Racing" promotion. Certainly, such an initiative would be consistent with the desire the governor expressed at the recent tourism summit to tap new avenues for tourism product development, particularly those within the sporting events sector. Given the world-class horse racing and other well-established horse-related events and facilities that already exist in New York, it would seem to be a no-brainer to cleverly package and promote those resources collectively in collaboration with the I Love NY program to broaden their appeal and extend further their economic impact as tourism attractions.
"Tourism is marketing," the governor said during the industry summit. "Ultimately, it all comes down to the product we're marketing, and we have the best product imaginable."
Perhaps it was Whitney who best described the obvious link between tourism and horse racing when she accepted a special Eclipse Award of Merit in Florida in 2011.
"We should also remember that racing is not just about the betting," she said. "The beauty, pageantry, and flair is what separates our sport from any other. Every race meet must be an extraordinary event - the only place to be." 
This summer, that place will be Saratoga, but here's hoping the affection shown for horse racing by the state's I Love NY campaign will extend beyond the season and the historic spa city and signal the beginning of a productive new promotional partnership with the sport and not just a fleeting summer romance.

HEADLINE: Million-Anecdote Baby

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: If Obamacare works, the game will be over for those doomsayers who oppose the most significant change in American life in a generation&#8217;s time. 

 BODY:
A friend of mine has an adult child with cancer, a young man just old enough to be beyond the age of coverage under his parents' health care plan. After nearly killing him, the dreaded Hodgkin's lymphoma is in remission. But he's still a pariah in the eyes of the insurance industry, which means they can deny him a policy that might save his life.
Not for long. In six months' time, the heartless practice of refusing to let sick people buy affordable health insurance - private-sector death panels, the most odious kind of American exceptionalism - will be illegal from shore to shore. 
"I can't wait for Obamacare," my friend gushed the other day. And she's not alone. About one in 10 people with cancer in this country have been denied health coverage.
The cartoon version of the Affordable Care Act, that much-loathed government takeover of one-sixth of the economy, is now moving from Beltway gasbags and caricaturists into the hands of consumers. Its fate will be determined by the countless anecdotes of people who will apply the law to their lives.
The early indications are that most Americans will be pleasantly surprised. Millions of people, shopping and comparing prices on the exchanges set up by the states, are likely to get far better coverage for the same - or less - money than they pay now. The law, as honest conservatives predicted, before they orphaned their own idea, is injecting competition into a market dominated by a few big names.
You won't hear this from the entrenched forces that have spent about $400 million denouncing the law on television ads, groups like the Karl Rove-backed Crossroads GPS. They have good reason to fear it: if Obamacare works, the game will be over for those who oppose the most significant change in American life in a generation's time. You also don't hear much from Mr. Obama himself; once again, he's a passive observer of his presidency.
But out among the states that are actively building the foundations of Obamacare, the law seems to be doing what it was supposed to do. In Washington State, nine companies have filed paperwork to offer policies in a region that has long been controlled by three big entities.
"The surprise is that, for many in the individual market, the premiums will be lower and the benefits so much richer," said Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington. "Eventually, I can see the Affordable Care Act being embraced like Medicare, because once people get used to this kind of coverage, it's going to be a pretty abhorrent thing to try and take it away."
In Oregon, brisk competition will mean real choice for consumers. Starting in October, a 40-year-old resident of Portland can choose between one insurer charging $169 a month or another asking $422 for the same plan. When these rates were first posted not long ago, some of the companies requested a do-over so they could submit lower rates. Yes, lower rates. So much for a government takeover.
In California, 13 companies will compete for the business of 5.3 million or so people expected to purchase insurance through the new exchanges. Officials say the average monthly premium will be $321 - that is, $110 less than the national average predicted by the Congressional Budget Office.
All of the above are for individuals, shopping for their own health insurance as required by the new law. For the majority of Americans, those with employer coverage, Medicare or Medicaid, little will change except that insurers can no longer put a lifetime cap on benefits. The biggest change, the one likely to drive public perception, will be felt by people long denied care because of "pre-existing conditions." Soon, they will pay the same insurance rates as healthy people, and get second chances at life.
As well, there's a bonus opportunity for those stuck in jobs they hate, holding on only because they need the health care, for a take-this-job-and-shove-it moment. Moderate-income families qualify for significant bargains, using the subsidies of Obamacare.
Of course, you can expect scare stories and Fox News alerts about higher premiums. These anecdotes will focus on young, healthy people with no coverage who will have to join the rest of the country in the insurance pool, or pay a fine. Some employers will also choose to pay the government rather than insure their own workers, but you won't find too many of those listed among the best places to work. And we've already seen claims of skyrocketing premiums under the new plan, but those have been widely debunked as fraudulent comparisons between the bottom-of-the-bin teaser rates of today and the substantial packages of coverage required in the new law.
It's a fascinating moment, akin to the dawn of Social Security or Medicare. Republicans in the last three years actually did the country a favor by wildly overstating the case against a middle-ground approach to getting the United States closer to universal health care. As in 1935 and in 1965, the ossified right is warning once again of an impending end to American life as we know it. Thankfully, they're right.

HEADLINE: Tech Pushes to Keep Its Spoils in Immigration Bill

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: The technology industry this week dispatched executives and entrepreneurs to buttonhole lawmakers and rallied people to mount a digital campaign on Congress. 

 BODY:
Keen to hold on to its winnings in a landmark Senate immigration bill, the technology industry this week put on what one lobbyist called "a full court press" on Capitol Hill, dispatching executives and entrepreneurs to buttonhole lawmakers and rallying people in the industry to dispatch e-mails, telephone calls and Twitter messages to Congress.
Human resource department heads from eight of the country's largest technology companies popped into the offices of more than a dozen members of Congress. A new group called Engine Advocacy, which has focused on a so-called start-up visa for foreign entrepreneurs, sent its representatives to the Hill and set up a new online platform, called www.keepushere.org, to encourage techies to send Twitter posts to members of Congress. And yet another industry-led coalition, called Partnership for a New American Economy, and supported by New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, was rallying supporters to aim at crucial senators, state by state, to support the bill with a "virtual march."

The efforts all point to a wave of unprecedented effort by Silicon Valley firms to make sure the overhaul of the federal immigration law goes in their favor. The omnibus bill, which arrived on the full Senate floor this week after intense negotiations in the Judiciary Committee, contains several provisions directed specifically at the technology sector. It makes it easier for foreign students who get science and engineering degrees at American universities to get permanent residency, creates a new temporary visa for entrepreneurs, and in the most contested clause, vastly expands how many temporary contract workers can be brought into this country under so-called H-1B visas, while also raising the minimum wages they must be paid. 
I just pledged to call my Senator on June 18th to ask for support on comprehensive immigration reform http://t.co/N8vpzuv7YP #KeepUsHere
- Swaroop Kolli (@swaroopkolli)12 Jun 13
The delicate political agreement could still fall apart, and for Silicon Valley, the temporary work visas expansion is by far the most delicate piece. Labor groups say the law should require these companies to hire Americans first. Industry groups call that undue regulatory interference. Both sides have tried to muster evidence to back their claims. And this week, the industry upped the ante by bringing human resources managers directly to Washington to persuade Congress of their need to bring in foreign workers to fill job openings. Organized by the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that includes companies like Apple and Oracle, the hiring managers told lawmakers that the demand for talent is so competitive that they sometimes blatantly poach from one another. 
There are likely to be more calls on the Senate floor to require companies to show that they are making efforts to hire Americans. 
Meanwhile, Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, introduced an amendment Wednesday to lower the investments that an entrepreneur would need to get permanent residency. The current bill requires a foreign entrepreneur to raise $100,000 in investments to gain a temporary visa and $500,000 for permanent residency. Among other things, the amendment would lower those thresholds: anyone who raises $250,000 in investments would be eligible for permanent residence.
The biggest push is yet to come. All eyes are on what the industry's newest, most well-financed lobby, Fwd.us, backed by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, will do next. It has stepped into the immigration fight with expensive television advertisements for key Republicans who backed the immigration bill in the Senate Judiciary. Those ads included a television spot that praised the Keystone XL pipeline, a pet project of key Republican senators, and it cost Fwd.us support from some of its backers in Silicon Valley. It remains to be seen what kinds of political advertisements the group will bankroll next, and who they will back.

Now that high school graduation season is winding down, it's worth taking a moment to remember that in the sea of flowing gowns lurk some unsettling statistical realities. On many measures of childhood well-being, the last decade in the United States has been one of stagnation. We remain an outlier in many ways among developed countries.
This doesn't mean that the United States hasn't made progress in recent memory. It has. It's just that much of that progress came in the 1990s. Since then, our progress has slowed or stalled. 
This week, the research group Child Trends released a statistical portrait of the high school class of 2013, compiled by a senior researcher, David Murphey. The numbers were depressing.
The report imagines a hypothetical class of 100 graduates. Of those, it estimates that:
â- 71 have experienced physical assault, 28 have been victimized sexually (10 report that they have been the victims of dating violence in the past year, and 10 report they have been raped), 32 have experienced some form of child maltreatment, 27 were in a physical fight, and 16 carried a weapon in the past year.
â- 64 have had sexual intercourse, 48 are sexually active, 27 used a condom and 12 were on birth control pills the last time they had sex; 21 percent had a sexually transmitted infection in the past year; three or four of the young women have been or are pregnant, and one has had an abortion.
â- 39 have been bullied, physically or emotionally -- 16 in the past year; 29 felt ''sad and hopeless'' continually for at least two weeks during the past year; 14 thought seriously about attempting suicide, and six went through with the attempt.
â- 34 are overweight, and 22 are living in poverty (10 in deep poverty).
Those statistics are shameful.
We have not sufficiently prioritized some fundamental safety structures for children in this country -- fighting child poverty; supporting all families (including single-parent ones) and their children through policies like paid family leave and early childhood education; insulating children from a culture soaked with violence; and educating children fully about sexuality and pregnancy, and allowing them open access to a full range of safe sex options (which would reduce our extraordinary rate of sexually transmitted disease, prevent more unintended pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions).
Our problems would be fixable if only we could agree that the protection and healthy development of this country's children is not only a humanitarian and moral imperative, but also an economic and cultural one: today's students are tomorrow's workers.
However, many conservatives seem too selfish to take the altruistic view and too blind to take the self-interested one.
For instance, we are among only three countries that have not ratified the United Nations' 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Unicef calls ''the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights -- civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights.'' The other two countries are South Sudan, which just became a country in 2011, and Somalia.
During a 2008 youth debate between the presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain were asked whether they would seek to ratify the treaty. Obama responded:
''It's important that the United States return to its position as a respected global leader and promoter of human rights. It's embarrassing to find ourselves in the company of Somalia, a lawless land. I will review this and other treaties, and ensure the United States resumes its global leadership in human rights.''
Embarrassing is an understatement, but efforts to have the United States ratify the treaty have been met with opposition from Republicans because, as Mother Jones reported in 2010, ''Under the treaty, 'parents would no longer be able to administer reasonable spankings to their children,' the government couldn't sentence teenagers to life in prison, kids could get sex-ed and birth control if they wanted it, and -- gasp! -- children would be able to choose their own religion, according to a fact sheet published by ParentalRights.org.''
That year, ParentalRights.org reported that 31 senators were co-sponsoring legislation to prevent the United States from ratifying the treaty; two other senators signed a letter opposing ratification. All of them were Republicans. Only eight Republican senators did not sign on to this tomfoolery; five of them are now gone from the Senate.
When you prefer the company of Somalia on issues of children's rights and well-being, you know what your priorities are.

HEADLINE: Future of an Industry and a Tribe Hinges on a Coal Export Battle

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
CROW AGENCY, Mont. -- Every few hours trains packed with coal pass through the sagebrush-covered landscape here in southern Montana, some on their way north to Canadian ports for shipment to Japan and South Korea. If the mining company Cloud Peak Energy has its way, many more trains will cross the prairie to far larger proposed export terminals in Washington State.
It's part of a push by the nation's coal industry, hobbled by plummeting demand as Americans turn to cleaner natural gas, to vastly expand what it sends to Asia and Europe. But the aggressive effort to rescue the $40 billion industry is running into fierce opposition from environmental groups, who say pollution caused by burning coal should not be exported.
The two sides have engaged in an increasingly pitched battle, in regulatory arenas and on the airwaves, scaring off some investors and raising concerns about the fate of the industry, which is seen as a key to economic growth in Western states like Montana and Wyoming. 
''The future of the U.S. coal industry is at stake,'' said Richard Morse, managing director at SuperCritical Capital, an energy consultancy. ''Their future domestically is dim and demand growth internationally is very robust, so it is fair to say that a resuscitation of the industry has to come overseas.''
The future of the impoverished Crow Nation may also hang in the balance since it owns an enormous deposit of up to 1.4 billion tons of coal -- more than the United States produces in a year. But before Cloud Peak can mine the land and send the coal to energy-hungry nations in Asia, it needs more export terminals to be built in the Pacific Northwest, and those have been delayed or, in some cases, scuttled after investors grew weary of the continued opposition from environmental groups.
Last week, the Sierra Club and other groups opened another phase in the battle, filing suit in a federal court in Seattle against Burlington Northern Santa Fe railway and several coal companies, saying coal dust escaping from trains has polluted rivers and lakes in Washington. The new export terminals, they say, would only bring more trains carrying coal to the ports and increase the amount of dust.
Coal's share of electricity generation in the United States has fallen to under 40 percent in the last decade, from 50 percent. Annual production dropped 7 percent in 2012 to just over 1 billion tons, the lowest total in two decades, and the stock prices of many coal companies have been plummeting.
Cheap, abundant and cleaner natural gas produced in new shale fields has replaced much of the coal that American power plants once burned, and regulatory pressures are mounting to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal combustion. That has left exports as the only sure growth engine for the declining American coal industry.
Last year, American coal exports set a record of 125 million tons in sales, roughly double the volume in 2009, with most of that going to Europe. Exports fell this spring because of slower Chinese demand for steelmaking coal. But energy experts say the big potential market for American coal remains in Asia, and several proposed Pacific Northwest export terminals would have the capacity to nearly double current exports.
For the Crow Nation, which is sitting on the reserves here, and many coal companies like Cloud Peak, exports could make the difference between just getting by and prospering.
While coal mining is the largest private sector provider of jobs, half the adult population is unemployed. Homelessness would be pandemic if it were not customary for three or four families to cram into small trailers so crowded that couples sometimes go to motels for moments of privacy and children struggle to do homework through a blare of television.
Three bright days a year come when families receive small bonuses from the tribe, thanks to one coal mine that operates on the reservation, to buy presents for Christmas and beads and tepee canvas for the tribe's annual powwow. The Crow hope more bright days may be coming, although some express concerns about the damage more coal mines could do to archaeological sites.
Cloud Peak and the Crow signed an initial agreement in January to develop three enormous coal deposits that are both low in sulfur and produce an abundance of heat when burned -- exactly what Asian buyers are seeking.
The Crow stand to earn $10 million over the first five years if the Interior Department approves the agreement, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars more in royalties and other payments in future years.
But before any digging can start here, Cloud Peak needs to know that somebody is willing and able to buy the coal. ''We know the coal is there,'' Colin Marshall, Cloud Peak's chief executive, said in an interview. ''With the ports, I am very optimistic that it will be developed.''
To win approval, the Crow are quietly lobbying other tribes in the Pacific Northwest, who say that the terminals will harm their fishing and the environment.
''We understand the issue of global warming, but at the same time, because of the economy of the tribe, we are dependent on coal,'' said Cedric Black Eagle, the former chairman of the Crow Nation, who began contract negotiations with Cloud Peak.
Environmental groups have made the terminals a central focus in their campaign against the coal industry.
Investors have dropped out of three of the originally proposed six terminals, including Kinder Morgan, which withdrew from a proposed terminal on Oregon's Columbia River last month.
''We are getting close to putting the stake through the heart of the beast of coal exports,'' said Cesia Kearns, a Sierra Club ''Beyond Coal'' campaigner in Oregon.
Cloud Peak, the No. 4 American coal company, produces 90 million tons of coal a year but exports just roughly 4.5 million tons annually through British Columbia ports. Cloud Peak is poised to expand those exports by negotiating deals for roughly 21 million tons of export capacity with the builders of two proposed Washington State terminals.
''I'm optimistic but I am also realistic that there is very well-organized opposition to the building of terminals,'' said Mr. Marshall, Cloud Peak's chief executive.
The Powder River basin produces more than 500 million tons of coal a year, nearly half the country's total, but only about 15 million tons are exported every year, mostly because of the lack of export outlets.
Coal experts say the basin could export 10 times what it does today if the Pacific Northwest terminals were approved. And industry executives insist that the basin's low-sulfur coal is far cleaner than much of the coal burned in Chinese and other Asian cities.
''You can have some of the cleanest coal in the world in the Powder River basin going to fuel electricity in a part of the world that can use clean energy,'' said Vic Svec, a senior vice president at Peabody Energy, the largest American coal company.
Environmentalists want to keep the coal in the ground. More coal on the international market, they say, reduces coal prices and discourages the transition to cleaner energy sources like solar and wind.
''If we are successful at blocking exports from the United States, we help renewables become more competitive in China,'' said Justin Guay, international climate and energy representative of the Sierra Club.
For the 6,500 or so Crow Indians, the deal is seen as a way out of a life with few economic prospects.
The Crow Nation chairman, Darrin Old Coyote, insisted that coal was a gift to his community that goes back to the tribe's creation story. ''Coal is life,'' he said. ''It feeds families and pays the bills.''

HEADLINE: Food and Gas Drove Wholesale Prices Up in May

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Economic reports released on Friday weighed on investors, showing that consumer confidence has fallen this month and that American factories barely increased their output in May.
In addition, the Labor Department reported that a rise in food and gas costs drove a measure of wholesale prices up sharply in May. But outside those volatile categories, inflation was mild. 
The department also said on Friday that the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in May from April. Gas prices rose 1.5 percent last month, and food costs increased 0.6 percent.
Confidence in the economy has fallen in June to a lower level than economists estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey.
Scott King, senior fiduciary investment adviser at Unified Trust in Lexington, Ky., said that investors were disappointed on Friday by the decline in consumer confidence. He described the economy as ''plodding along.''
''Wage growth continues to be pretty meager, and unemployment continues to be lackluster,'' Mr. King said.
The Federal Reserve said on Friday that factory production rose just 0.1 percent in May from April, a sign that manufacturing was providing little support for the economy. Output fell 0.4 percent in April and 0.3 percent in March.
Factories produced more autos, computers and wood products last month, offsetting declines in the production of furniture and primary metals.
Manufacturing output has risen 1.7 percent in the last 12 months.
''Manufacturers are still struggling to cope with the ongoing weakness of global demand,'' said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
In wholesale prices, the increase last month came after a 0.7 percent decline in April and a 0.6 percent drop in March, both of which were driven by steep declines in gas prices.
Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in May. That matches the April increase. The index measures price changes before they reach the consumer.
''There really is not much inflationary pressure in the economy,'' Mr. Dales said in a note to clients.
Aside from sharp swings in gas prices, consumer and wholesale inflation has increased very slowly in the last year. Both the overall and core indexes have risen just 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in May. That is less than the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target, allowing the Fed more latitude to pursue its aggressive policies to spur greater economic growth.
The combination of modest economic growth and high unemployment has kept wages from rising quickly, making it harder for retailers and other businesses to raise prices.
Most of the May increase in food costs stemmed from a 41.6 percent rise in the cost of eggs, the biggest on record. The increase reflected soaring demand in the United States and overseas. The Memorial Day and Mother's Day holidays, popular occasions for brunch, spurred more demand in the United States, a department spokesman said. And Mexico imported more eggs from the United States in response to a bird flu epidemic.
Nearly two-thirds of the 0.1 percent increase in core prices was caused by a 0.4 percent rise in the wholesale cost of pickup trucks. The housing recovery has created more business for landscapers and contractors, who have bought more trucks.

HEADLINE: European Ministers Clear Trade Deal

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
LUXEMBOURG -- European Union ministers thrashed out a deal to begin trade negotiations with the United States late Friday after bowing to French demands to protect state-sponsored film and television industries.
The breakthrough, which came after 13 hours of tense talks, should enable Britain to hail the start of the trans-Atlantic trade discussions when the leaders of the Group of 8 biggest economies hold a summit meeting on Monday in Northern Ireland.
''The formal launch of negotiations between the world's two largest trading blocs is now imminent,'' Vince Cable, the British business secretary, said in a statement shortly after the deal was announced. ''Achieving an agreement is in all our interests and would deliver a much-needed boost to the economies of all involved.'' 
The divisive issue of shielding films, TV shows and other audiovisual services from competition could be debated again at a later stage, and that promises more wrangling ahead between European nations over what to offer the United States in exchange for lower tariffs and streamlined regulations.
Although the French position could be scaled back, the fact that the other 26 trade ministers in the European Union acceded to France's demand could make negotiations with the United States that much more difficult, given the protectionist impulses on both sides of the Atlantic that are likely to come into play.
A trade pact would aim to lower barriers between the world's two biggest trading partners. But before formal talks can start, the European Union's 27 trade ministers needed to reach a unanimous deal to give the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, the formal authority to start the negotiations.
The decision in Luxembourg was a preliminary victory for France, which fought hard for months to protect Europe's so-called cultural exception, which is, in practice, a thicket of quotas and subsidies for audiovisual productions that promote locally and regionally produced content.
''We are satisfied because we have the exclusion from the mandate for everything that is to do with audiovisual,'' Nicole Bricq, the French trade minister, told a news conference. The guarantee was ''written in black and white'' in the agreement, she said.
The European Union, which is plagued by low growth and high unemployment, broadly favors a trade pact with the United States to bolster the economy and generate new jobs. But the drawn-out negotiations in Luxembourg were a stark reminder of how the bloc's members still are reluctant to set aside national priorities and to make collective decision-making a reality.
The main sticking point on Friday was France's demand to exclude audiovisual services, including future digital services, from the talks.
Britain, along with countries including Spain and the Netherlands, was concerned that such an exclusion would prompt the United States to require protections of its own.
The exclusion of audiovisual material from a trade deal would especially disappoint American technology and media companies, including the online movie distributor Netflix, which want easier access to European markets.
The deal that emerged was a classic European accommodation allowing a flagship initiative -- a trans-Atlantic trade pact -- to move forward while leaving decisions on the thorniest questions, like how to manage digital services, for a later date.
The compromise leaves the European Commission with the option to make a proposal, once the talks with the United States are under way, to use audiovisual services as a bargaining chip so long as all 27 member states agree that the advantages are sufficiently attractive.
''There is no carve-out on audiovisual services,'' Karel De Gucht, the European Union trade commissioner who will lead the negotiations with the United States, told a news conference.''We are ready to discuss it with our American counterparts and to listen to their views on this issue.''
In a sign of the bitterness that nearly led to the collapse of the talks on Friday, Ms. Bricq, of France, accused some member states of pandering to American demands to keep the audiovisual industries as a bargaining chip.
And, earlier in the day, in a thinly veiled reference to the European outcry over recent disclosures that the National Security Agency in the United States had gained access to online data from many of the biggest Internet companies, she added that ''current events unhappily remind us'' of American influence over the online world.
How much progress Europe and the United States can make is an open question. Tariffs are already low, and the main goal -- harmonizing regulations -- is likely to pose a huge challenge for negotiators.
There are also questions about their differences over regulations on a host of industries, including new technologies, car safety, pharmaceuticals and financial derivatives.

HEADLINE: In Colorado, Nature Takes a Fiery Toll Despite a Community's Efforts to Prepare

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
DENVER -- For years, families in Black Forest, Colo., did what they could to keep the flames at bay. They scooped up pine needles and trimmed low-hanging branches around their homes. They chopped down saplings and hauled dead trees to the community mulcher.
But when the fire came this week, hundreds of their homes still burned. 
As fire crews fought Friday to contain the most destructive wildfire in Colorado's history -- a blaze that has now burned 400 homes, killed two people and spread across 15,000 acres -- residents and public officials raised questions about whether faster responses or tighter fire regulations could have done anything to curb its destructive path.
''They've got to get on them faster,'' said Tim Morrison, whose house burned to the ground. ''You have a very narrow window of opportunity in this weather. The key is to be there with more.''
Officials in El Paso County said Friday that they believed the fire was human-caused, though they did not know whether it was an accident or arson.
Like earthquakes in California or hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, wildfires are a perennial danger in the tinderbox West. But experts say the wildfires are getting bigger and more destructive, made worse by years of drought and fire suppression, a rise in temperatures from climate change and denser development into the wild.
The six worst wildfire seasons of the past 50 years have happened since 2000, according to a recent report by Headwaters Economics, a Montana-based research firm that often examines fires and their consequences.
About 32 percent of the homes in the United States sit in what experts call the wildland-urban interface, high-risk areas where development and nature overlap. A report by the Forest Service predicted the numbers would grow as development spread and aging baby boomers looked for quiet, scenic places to spend their retirements. As more houses are built in the forests, fires and firefighting become more expensive, experts say.
Generations ago, Black Forest, about 60 miles south of Denver, was an assortment of farms and summer homes. Today, about 13,000 people live there among the ponderosa pines, in modest ranch homes and new million-dollar stone mansions.
''These homes are throughout the trees,'' Gov. John W. Hickenlooper said Thursday. ''We knew there would be a lot of losses, a lot of damages. That's just an inherent risk.''
In the wake of the Black Forest fire, Mr. Hickenlooper said there was a need to make sure people in fire-prone areas were using the right materials as siding and shingles. But states and the federal government have limited sway, with most building and fire codes left up to local officials.
Last year, after a wildfire destroyed nearly 360 homes in the Mountain Shadows neighborhood of Colorado Springs, elected officials passed stricter fire codes for new and rebuilt homes in the city's foothills. Some residents and public officials objected, saying it would add too many expenses to building costs.
In Black Forest, Eddie Bracken, the chairman of the community's fire protection district, said there were plenty of incentives, but few requirements, for residents to reduce fire danger around their homes. Members of the largely volunteer department inspect homes if asked and suggest how owners can clean away brush. But he said homeowners did not have to follow the advice.
''We don't have an enforcement capability,'' Mr. Bracken said. ''We shouldn't. It's personal property and individual rights. We don't have the means or the desire or wherewithal to inflict a penalty on them.''
County officials said that residents were required to follow local fire codes and that homebuilders in high-risk fire zones were required to submit their plans to the county fire marshal or local fire department.
Residents in Black Forest said they spent much of their summers guarding against fires. They would attend meetings at the fire department and get together to reduce fire hazards along major evacuation routes.
But some said their neighbors were less vigilant, and they wondered whether homes littered with dead brush had helped feed the flames. The community wrote a long wildfire protection plan.
Brittany Culwell grew up on 10 acres of meadowland and woods, in a house her grandparents built, on a street that was once so new her family had the right to name it. As a child, she was warned that if she played with matches or lighted a candle outside, the whole neighborhood could be set ablaze. But unlike people in Tornado Alley, who are used to running to shelters, she said that wildfires were a distant threat. Only once, when she was 10, did the family evacuate.
''We knew the risk was there, but it hadn't burned in 100 years,'' she said. ''We thought it never would.''
Ms. Culwell's childhood home -- which she said was kept meticulously clean of deadfall and high grasses -- was incinerated in the fire, along with every other house on Coolwell Drive.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Need Tough Talk From Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID MAKOVSKY

 BODY:
The final communiqué of the G-8 summit meeting next week in Northern Ireland will invariably mention Middle East peace, perhaps supporting Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to revive peace negotiations. In any case, any statement will be promptly forgotten when the summit ends. Nevertheless, Europe can help Kerry.
It's worth remembering that just before the G-8 meeting two years ago, President Obama delivered a landmark speech on the Middle East, one that included an important expression of tough love. Here was a president of the United States, the traditional patron of Israel, saying that the baseline for territorial negotiations should be land exchanges based on the boundaries that existed before the 1967 war -- a call that was echoed earlier this year by an Arab League delegation. 
Because it delineated territorial terms of a peace accord, Obama's speech was not popular with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Nor was it well-received in the United States, where a leading Republican, Mitt Romney, charged that Obama was ''throwing Israel under the bus.'' Democrats weren't very supportive either.
Obama won initial plaudits from the Europeans, but then there was silence. Unfortunately, the quartet of Middle East peacemakers -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the secretary general of the U.N. -- never adequately backed the president's speech. After many drafts over the summer of 2011, Moscow helped quash any quartet statement of support due to aspects of the speech that it felt was not sufficiently to the Palestinians' liking.
The quartet has never recovered. It is no longer a diplomatic force, although its special envoy, former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, has been involved in favorable economic and governance actions supporting the Palestinians.
It's time for a unified European speech, one that would serve as an analogue to the Obama speech. If the U.S. president told the Israelis things that they didn't want to hear, the European Union, traditional patron of the Palestinians, needs to tell them what they need to hear. Such a speech would give Kerry a chance to succeed, albeit not a guarantee. It would tell the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that he doesn't have a free pass from Europe, that E.U. patience with the Palestinians has its limits. It would also tell the Israelis that the deck isn't stacked against them in the international community.
It's hard for Europeans to argue that the Palestinians have exhausted negotiations, given that Abbas has agreed to only three weeks of talks in the last four years, and that an offer in September 2008 by Israel's then-prime minister, Ehud Olmert, never received a reply.
Of course, Netanyahu is not blameless: Consider the expansion of Israeli settlements. But the negotiating track has not been tried in many years, despite the myth to the contrary. The parties only agreed to deal with the final status or core issues one other time apart from 2008 -- in 1999 and 2000, during Bill Clinton's final years in the White House.
In order to give Middle East peace talks a new chance, here are some things that a European speech needs to say:
The only way to achieve Palestinian statehood is through direct, unconditional talks with Israel. The European Union's council of ministers has said as much in a diplomatic communiqué, but it is not stated so directly to the Palestinians. The United Nations would willingly endorse statehood, but the Security Council has blocked this in the past, and joining Unesco will not lift Israeli control of the West Bank. The Palestinians must try negotiations. The road to statehood runs through peace.
Both Jews and Arabs have a historical connection to the land, and therefore, it must be shared.
Any Palestinian refugee can go to the new state of Palestine, but not to Palestine and Israel.
Israel is not wrong to insist on strict security arrangements. Security is not ancillary to any deal. Just as the world needs to empathize with the Palestinians' predicament, so too should we see security issues through Israel's eyes. On the Gaza-Egypt border, tunnels have been used to smuggle rockets into Gaza that have been repeatedly and indiscriminately fired on Israeli cities. It is indisputable that aspects of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 calling for an arms embargo on Hezbollah after the 2006 Lebanon war, were never implemented. Moreover, international peacekeepers cannot be the sole basis of security -- as shown by Austria's recent decision to pull out of the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force interposed between Syrian and Israeli forces.
In private conversations, many European diplomats agree with many of these points. But no European leader has shown Obama's courage in endorsing them publicly. Perhaps it is time for the Europeans to stop complaining about the lack of American success in the Middle East. The point is not the identity of the messenger, but rather that there be a unified message.
Europe can and must have an impact. President Obama told the Israelis that they should have no illusions about the territorial price to be paid to end this conflict. The Europeans, no less a supporter of the Palestinians than the United States has been of Israel, need to do the same with the Palestinians. The Europeans need to tell them that E.U. support will no longer be unconditional.
Leadership is not about telling your friends what they want to hear; it's about telling them what they need to hear. Europe needs to reciprocate the Obama speech with one of its own.

HEADLINE: Moderate Leads Initial Returns In Iran Election

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK; Rick Gladstone and Robert Mackey contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iranian voters turned out in huge numbers on Friday, a late surge of interest in the presidential vote that seemed to swing the tide in the favor of the most moderate candidate in the field. But it was uncertain whether any single contestant would exceed the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff next week.
With long lines at the polls, voting hours were extended by five hours in parts of Tehran and four hours in the rest of the country. Turnout reached 75 percent, by official count, as disaffected members of the Green Movement, which was crushed in the uprising that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election, dropped a threatened boycott and appeared to coalesce behind a cleric, Hassan Rowhani, and the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf.
Iran's interior minister, Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, said Saturday morning on state television that preliminary results showed Mr. Rowhani with a strong lead, followed by Mr. Ghalibaf. Mr. Najjar did not say when the final result would be available. Iran has more than 50 million eligible voters and as of early Saturday morning nearly three million votes had been counted. 
The early results seemed to be a repudiation of the coalition of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guard commanders, the so-called traditionalists, who consolidated power after the 2009 election, which the opposition said was rigged. The traditionalists' favored candidate, Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and a protégé of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not seem to have gained much traction with the public, emphasizing vague concepts like ''Islamic society'' and standing up to Western pressure.
Early Saturday, officials at the Interior Ministry with access to the preliminary tallies said that Mr. Rowhani appeared to be the clear winner in some cities but that nothing had been confirmed. The ministry's early figures showed Mr. Rowhani with just under 50 percent of the votes counted, news agencies reported. Early Saturday, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, the spokesman for the Guardian Council, warned against publishing any rumors and urged all to wait for the official results.
Nonetheless many veteran Iran political watchers, who had expected a conservative winner in what had been a carefully vetted and controlled campaign, expressed surprise.
''If the reports are true, it tells me that there was a hidden but huge reservoir of reformist energy in Iran that broke loose in a true political wave,'' said Cliff Kupchan, an Iran analyst for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington. ''It was unpredictable -- not even tip of the iceberg visible two days or three days ago -- but it seems to have happened.''
Farideh Farhi, an Iranian scholar at the University of Hawaii, while careful not to draw conclusions until the official result was known, said it was clear that reformists and other disaffected voters in Iran had summoned energy to mobilize for a heavy turnout despite their own doubts about the system.
''Everyone's assumption was they would not be able to create a wave of voters in the society,'' Ms. Farhi said. ''This outcome was not something planned by Ayatollah Khamenei.''
In surveys and interviews throughout the campaign, Iranians have consistently listed as their top priorities the economy, individual rights and the normalization of relations with the rest of the world. They also said they saw the vote as a way to send a message about their displeasure with the direction of the country, which has been hobbled by economic mismanagement and tough Western sanctions, stemming from the government's refusal to stop enriching uranium.
Mr. Rowhani, a former nuclear negotiator, had been criticized by Mr. Jalili for being too willing to bargain away Iran's nuclear program, which the West says is a cover for developing nuclear weapons but Tehran says is for peaceful purposes.
But Mr. Rowhani seemed to strike a more popular chord by promoting more freedom and rights for women, and gained momentum late in the campaign with the withdrawal of the only other candidate with any reformist tendencies and the endorsement of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, 78, the moderate former president who was disqualified by the Guardian Council, which vets all presidential candidates.
While not claiming victory, Mr. Rowhani's campaign released a statement Saturday urging the authorities to conduct a clean count. ''We hope that the respected Guardian Council and the election headquarters of the country will follow the guidelines of the supreme leader regarding protecting the peoples' rights in counting the votes,'' it read.
Mr. Rowhani's closest competitor in the early results, Mr. Ghalibaf, is also considered a moderate, a strong manager who has improved the quality of life in Tehran in his eight years as mayor. The other four candidates, all conservatives, seemed to be trailing badly, informal surveys indicated.
Mr. Jalili, known for his unyielding stance as a nuclear negotiator, had been considered a front-runner less than three weeks ago. But his campaign never gained much momentum, and in his public statements and appearances he appeared to have little knowledge of Iran's economic problems, one of the biggest concerns here.
In the Iranian political system, the president appoints governors, some members of the cabinet and other officials, and has some say in economic policy. But all power ultimately resides with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, particularly in foreign policy and the nuclear program.
Nevertheless, as the departing incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, made clear with his bombastic appearances at the United Nations and his express desire to see Israel ''wiped off the map,'' the president can have a profound effect in setting the tone in the country. Analysts said they expected that the election of either Mr. Rowhani or Mr. Ghalibaf might lead to a softening of Tehran's confrontational tone, if not its actual stance in negotiations.
As the counting continued through the night, officials issued an edict to all the candidates to avoid any gatherings until the official result was announced. The order was a reminder of the political minefield presented by the election, which descended into protest and chaos four years ago when pro-reformist candidates accused the authorities of rigging the vote to ensure the re-election of Mr. Ahmadinejad. He was not eligible for a third term.
Wary of stirring those same passions, the authorities had banned street rallies this year and limited the candidates to smaller meetings in enclosed spaces, like theaters and gymnasiums. After casting his ballot Ayatollah Khamenei went out of his way to reassure Iranians that the vote would be free and fair.
''I have advice for the people in charge of ballot boxes and counting the votes,'' he said. ''They need to know that they are the trustee of the people and their vote needs to be preserved and this is the people's right.''
The top election official in Tehran Province, which includes the capital and is the country's largest urban area, said he believed at least 70 percent of voters had cast ballots by day's end. ''The political epic that the leader expected took place,'' the official, Safar Ali Baratloo, head of the Election Headquarters of Tehran, was quoted as saying by the Iranian Students' News Agency.
Mr. Rowhani was drawing a number of votes in Geysha, a middle-class Tehran neighborhood. ''He will change this country,'' said Golnaz, 20, who refused to give her family name for security reasons. ''We need change.''
But there were some doubts about just how much things would change even with a more moderate president. Addressing American skepticism about the outcome as he exhorted Iranians to vote, Ayatollah Khamenei told reporters: ''To hell with you if you do not believe in our election. If the Iranian nation had to wait for you to see what you believe in and what you do not, then the Iranian nation would have lagged behind.''

HEADLINE: Shares End the Week Down After 2 Dissatisfying Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Disappointing reports about the economy helped push the stock market lower on Friday.
Concern that the Federal Reserve could announce plans to cut back its stimulus program next week also weighed on the mood of investors.
Americans' confidence in the economy weakened in June and was lower than economists had estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey released on Friday. Another report said factories were not as busy as expected.
The International Monetary Fund, a global lender, offered no help. The I.M.F. said Friday in its annual report on the American economy that spending cuts by the United States government that kicked in March 1 were ''ill designed'' and slowed the economy. Though in a statment, the fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said, ''There are signs that the U.S. recovery is gaining ground and becoming more durable.'' 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 9.63 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,626.73. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 105.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 15,070.18. The Nasdaq composite index lost 21.81 points, or 0.63 percent, to 3,423.56.
American Express led the Dow lower, losing $2.24, or 3 percent, to $72.97. The media company Gannett fell the most, dropping 6 percent, or $1.61, to $24.99.
''There was just no good news today,'' said Cam Albright, a director at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in Wilmington, Del. Add the handful of economic reports out Friday to the anxiety over the Fed's stimulus program, ''and you have the recipe for a soft market to finish the week,'' he said.
Market indexes flitted from slight gains to losses in morning trading, a contrast to the sudden lurches in previous days. All three major indexes lost 1 percent or more this week.
Trading has been volatile since late May as investors try to figure out when the Fed will dial back its aggressive support for the economy. The Fed buys $85 billion in bonds every month as part of a campaign to keep interest rates extremely low. The aim is to encourage borrowing, spending and investing. Some investors worry that long-term interest rates could spike when the Fed pulls back, raising borrowing costs and threatening the economic recovery. Higher yields for government bonds have already started pushing mortgage rates up.
Policy makers at the Fed will start a two-day meeting on Tuesday to discuss the central bank's next steps. Afterward, the bank will release its policy statement and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will hold a news conference.
Banks led nine of the 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 lower. Utilities made slight gains. Investors tend to favor these safety plays when they want stable companies that pay steady dividends.
The S.& P. 500 hit a record of 1,669 on May 21. The next day, Fed officials said they would consider pulling back on its stimulus program once the economy looked healthy. The index has lost 2 percent since.
The price of oil rose $1.15, to $98.07 a barrel, near its highest level of the year, as traders reacted to news that the United States would provide weapons to rebel forces in Syria.
Gold rose $9.70, to $1,387.30 an ounce.
In the market for government bonds, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32 to 96 20/32, sending the yield down to 2.13 percent from 2.15 percent late Thursday. The yield reached a 14-month high of 2.29 percent on Tuesday.
Expectations that the Fed would pare its bond buying have helped drive the yield up from 1.63 percent on May 3, when it was at its lowest level this year.

HEADLINE: The Unspoken Stigma of Workplace Flexibility

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Assume for a moment that your employer let you decide when and where you worked -- you might arrive early so you could leave in time to care for a child, or work part of the week from home. Or perhaps you want to reduce your hours for a while to care for an aging parent. How would you be perceived if you raised your hand for one of these options?
''Many times these policies are on the books, but informally everyone knows you are penalized for using them,'' said Joan C. Williams, founding director of the Center for Work-Life Law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, referring to the array of flexible work arrangements some employers offer. ''I invented the term 'flexibility stigma' to describe that phenomenon. Recent studies have found that it is alive and well, and it functions quite differently for women than it does for men.'' 
For some women, it gives employers a reason to view them through the lens of motherhood, prompting the strongest form of gender discrimination. Mothers are seen as less competent and less committed to their work, she said, citing other studies. But more surprising is that men who seek work flexibility may be penalized more severely than women, because they're viewed as more feminine, deviating from their traditional role of fully committed breadwinners.
That may at least in part explain why using flexible work options -- which include telecommuting, compressed work weeks and sharing jobs among employees, to name a few -- has been slow to catch on, even though more organizations are offering them (at least on paper). Employers have increased options to help workers manage the time and place they work, from 2005 to 2012, according to the Families and Work Institute's 2012 National Study of Employers. But employers have cut back on alternatives that would enable employees to spend significant amounts of time away from full-time work, like career breaks or moving from part time to full time and back again.
A group of researchers recently examined the stigma of workplace flexibility from all angles in a series of studies published on Friday in The Journal of Social Issues, co-edited by Professor Williams and others. Among other things, the researchers examined the effect of men taking leave after the birth of a child (they were more likely to be penalized and less likely to get promoted or receive raises), as well as the reasons some professional women decide to leave work after having children (working reduced hours resulted in less meaningful work assignments). They also looked at how the perception of women using flexible arrangements differs across class lines: affluent women often receive the message that they should stay at home, while poor women are more likely to hear that they shouldn't have had children to begin with.
''These studies show that deep-rooted cultural values intertwining work devotion and gender identity drive the flexibility stigma,'' said Professor Williams said.
But it is clear that many American families crave flexibility, especially as traditional gender roles of mothers and fathers continue to blur. A study by the Society for Human Resource Management conducted in 2008, the most recent data available, found that 34 percent of human resources professionals polled indicated an increase in requests for these arrangements compared to the previous year.
The reasons are fairly obvious, as more Americans chase the elusive work-life balance. Nearly equal shares of working mothers and fathers report that they feel stressed about juggling work and family life, a recent Pew Research Center analysis found. But while working fathers placed more importance on having a high-paying job, the study found working mothers were more concerned with having a flexible schedule.
In fact, it's possible that more women would be working if they had such arrangements available to them, and that they felt comfortable using. The share of working-age American women in the work force has been on the decline relative to other developed countries, a phenomenon tied at least in part to those countries' rapid expansion of family-friendly policies, according to a study by Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, both professors of economics at Cornell, published in February.
In 1990, the United States had the sixth-highest share of women in the work force among 22 developed countries, with 74 percent of women ages 25 to 54 working. But by 2010, the share of American women working dropped to 17th place, with slightly more than 75 percent of women working compared to 80 percent outside the country, the research found. They estimate that American women's participation would have been 82 percent if they had access to the other countries' policies, which include a right to part-time work. ''Maybe we have reached a maximum and we can't go any higher,'' Professor Blau said, referring to the percentage of working women. ''But this suggests we could go higher if we worked on these work-life balance issues.''
Flexibility does potentially present a double-edged sword, at least as far as women's advancement goes. Long, paid parental leaves and the availability of part-time positions may encourage women who would have otherwise been more committed to working to take those part-time or lower-level jobs, Professor Blau explained. And employers, in turn, may be less likely to promote or put women in higher positions if they think they are going to take advantage of flexible arrangements. As it stands now, women in the United States are more likely to work full time than in other developed countries and they are more likely to be in higher-level positions.
''If you have a very extensive network of these family-friendly programs, it can encourage women to take a more traditional role,'' Professor Blau said. ''It's an issue of balance. If you don't have adequate arrangements, then it's very hard for women to maintain their attachment to the labor force and for employers to invest in the women's skills.''
But it's also an issue of perspective. For women to be able to take advantage of these arrangements without judgment, men need to use them freely, too. But that requires viewing men not solely as breadwinners, but as individuals who also have the same choices as women.
''Not only have we put women on the mommy track, we put dad on the daddy track,'' said Kenneth Matos, an organizational psychologist and senior director of employment research and practice at the Families and Work Institute, a research group. ''We tend to talk about what happens to women, but we don't talk about what happens to men and we wonder why women are stuck.''
After all, as Professor Williams explained, pressures on men haven't changed. ''Feminism is all about choices -- well, choices for whom?'' she asked. ''Even feminism is putting pressure on men to live up to the ideal of work devotion. So long as that is the state of play, nothing is changing for men. And if nothing is changing for men, nothing is changing for women.''
Both inside many companies and at the national level, workers largely have been left to sort these issues out on their own. But some places are beginning to take cues from other countries that have already carried out national policies to protect workers who want more flexible arrangements. Last month, Vermont passed an ''equal pay'' law that, among other things, provides employees with the right to request flexible working arrangements and protects them from retaliation for asking. The law requires employers to listen to workers' pleas twice a year, though they aren't obliged to grant any requests. ''This law is modeled after similar laws in the U.K. and Australia,'' said Cary Brown, executive director of the Vermont Commission on Women, ''and we believe it's the first of its kind in the United States.''
Still, most workers still remain at the mercy of their managers. ''It is not systematic and it is not reliable and for a lot of people, it depends on whether your supervisors are sympathetic,'' said Ariane Hegewisch, a study director at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. ''But you have no guarantees.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Plants, Old and Uncompetitive, Are Closing Earlier Than Expected

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Washington -- When does a nuclear plant become too old?
The nuclear industry is wrestling with that question as it tries to determine whether problems at reactors, all designed in the 1960s and 1970s, are middle-aged aches and pains or end-of-life crises.
This year, utilities have announced the retirement of four reactors, bringing the number remaining in the United States to 100. Three had expensive mechanical problems but one, Kewaunee in Wisconsin, was running well, and its owner, Dominion, had secured permission to run it an additional 20 years. But it was losing money, because of the low wholesale price of electricity. 
''That's the one that's probably most ominous,'' said Peter A. Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a former head of the Public Service Commission in New York. ''It's as much a function of the cost of the alternatives as it is the reactor itself.''
While the other three, San Onofre 2 and 3 near San Diego and Crystal River 3 in Florida, faced expensive repair bills because of botched maintenance projects, ''Kewaunee not only didn't have a major screw-up in repair work, it didn't even seem to be confronting a major capital investment,'' he said.
This is a turnaround because until recently, the life expectancy of reactors was growing. When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began routinely authorizing reactors to run 20 years beyond their initial 40-year licenses, people in the electricity business began thinking that 60 was the new 40. But after the last few weeks, 40 is looking old again, at least in reactor years, with implications for the power plants still running, and for several new ones being built.
''They were intended to last for as long as they were commercially feasible,'' said Robert E. Curry Jr., who was a member of the New York Public Service Commission from 2006 to 2012. But with low gas prices, additional costs imposed after the Fukushima Daiichi accident of March 2011, and ''the general mistrust of nuclear by anyone who saw 'The China Syndrome,' '' commercial feasibility now is evidently shorter, he said.
Even if the economics do not result in retirements, they do mean setbacks. Exelon, the nation's largest nuclear operator, set out a few years ago to invest $2.3 billion in its existing reactors and raise their generating capacity by 1,300 megawatts, a little more than one new reactor would generate. But after completing about a quarter of the plan, it dropped the rest, and said it would pay its suppliers $100 million in penalties for the cancellation, because the economics were no longer favorable.
Christopher M. Crane, the chief executive, said that Exelon had no plans now to retire any reactors but that the company would continue to review conditions, including low wholesale prices for electricity, to see if early shutdowns were needed.
Oyster Creek, an Exelon reactor in Forked River, N.J., is the oldest in the country, having opened in 1969. It received a 20-year license extension in 2010, but Exelon promised to shut it by the end of 2019 in exchange for an exemption from some rules governing the discharge of hot water from the plant. It might not make it to 2019, though. At San Onofre, the owners were faced with the need for a big new investment for repair, and calculated not only the price but the number of years of life remaining over which they could recoup their investment. The same could happen at Oyster Creek.
Two to watch are Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, just north of the Massachusetts border, and Indian Point, in Buchanan, N.Y., 30 miles up the Hudson River from New York City. The states of Vermont and New York are seeking to close them. If they remain profitable, the owner of all three units, Entergy, seems likely to fight tooth and nail to keep them open, but Vermont Yankee's profitability does not seem certain. It could join plants like Maine Yankee, or Zion, near Chicago, in retirement and decommissioning.
Such is the fate of all old power plants. As the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's main trade association, pointed out when San Onofre closed, of the power plant retirements since 2010, 41 percent were coal and 33 percent were natural gas. Ten percent were nuclear. Old power plants lead conditional existences; they may not survive new environmental rules or other circumstances that require expensive retrofits.
The difference is that gas plants continue to be built, and so do a few coal plants. There was a gap of 30 years in new nuclear plant construction, which ended this year, but only four plants, two twin-reactor installations, have broken ground. A fifth, left for dead in the 1980s, is being revived. While utilities in the last few years have announced plans for more than a dozen new reactors, beyond the five now under construction only another four or so seem possible in the next few years.
And all the others are getting older.

HEADLINE: Sleek New Star Attraction

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
TOULOUSE, France -- The A350 XWB, the first all-new commercial jet from Airbus in more than six years, took wing into partly cloudy skies here on Friday.
There was a lot more riding on it than the multinational crew of two test pilots and four engineers.
The new aircraft carries the burden of dispelling Airbus's reputation for cross-cultural and industrial dysfunction, which caused costly delays in the introduction of the company's previous plane, the A380 superjumbo. And in the wake of last year's failed merger of the plane maker's parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, and the British military contractor BAE Systems, Airbus is betting its future more heavily on the success of commercial jets like the A350.
It is no coincidence that Airbus showed off the A350 -- a twin-engine wide-body jet meant to compete with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777 -- as the global aviation industry assembled for the biennial Paris Air Show, scheduled to open Monday at Le Bourget Airport north of the French capital. As always at the show, which is the world's largest aerospace bazaar, any announcements by other industry players will be undercard matches compared with the main event of Airbus vs. Boeing. 
While both aircraft makers are going into the show with order books for commercial airliners fat enough to keep their assembly lines humming for much of the next decade, military budgets are shrinking in the United States and Europe, the two biggest spenders on military planes.
Few, if any, major announcements for military orders are expected at the show, and belt-tightening at the Pentagon means that the turnout of American military contractors will be among the lowest in recent memory. Northrop Grumman, for example, will be absent, and the delegations from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing's defense and security division, among others, will be much smaller than in years past.
And this year's show may be relatively subdued in terms of new commercial jet order announcements as well, given the uncertain near-term outlook for airline profits and economic growth, particularly in emerging markets.
But on Friday the spotlight was on Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, about a 90-minute flight south of Paris, where, precisely at 10 a.m., the A350 lifted effortlessly from the sun-dappled runway. The purr of the plane's two Rolls-Royce engines was momentarily drowned out by the cheers and whistles of a throng of Airbus employees, well-wishers and members of the news media who had gathered -- camera phones at the ready -- to capture the moment.
The distinctive curled tips of the carbon-fiber wings glinted briefly before the jet slipped into the clouds.
Judith Lindner, a 36-year-old quality control technician from an Airbus factory in Stade, Germany, whooped as the jet sailed past, jabbing her thumb in the air.
''What a tremendous thrill -- fantastic,'' Ms. Lindner said, adding that she had helped inspect the vertical stabilizer on the plane's tail. ''I feel such a mix of pride and relief.''
Analysts said the value of a well-timed and well-executed A350 debut could not be overestimated. Some said they still expected Airbus to try to maintain the public relations momentum by staging an A350 flyby sometime during the weeklong show in Paris.
It would be hard for Airbus to find a bigger stage. Show organizers said they expected the chalets and exhibition halls of the air show to be filled with more than 2,200 companies from more than 40 countries. As many as 350,000 visitors from the aerospace industry, as well as the public, are expected over the course of the week.
Even Boeing executives acknowledged that the timing of the A350 flight was likely to steal much of the American company's thunder at the event.
''I know they work hard to keep the home fans entertained,'' Randy Tinseth, Boeing's head of marketing, said at a briefing on Tuesday in Paris.
Not so long ago, Airbus's prospects did not look nearly as bright. It was struggling to roll out its last big-bet plane: the twin-deck A380. Miscommunication in the design, manufacturing and installation of electrical cables resulted in a series of missteps in the mid-2000s that delayed the A380's first delivery by three years. The debacle prompted a management reshuffle in 2006 and more than $6 billion in losses.
Airbus executives say they are determined not to repeat the experience.
For the new A350, the company has changed its internal design systems and decision-making, even involving major suppliers in the process from the start. While in the past Airbus engineers in France and Germany operated independently, in some cases using incompatible tools and software, they now collaborate on shared digital blueprints.
So far, analysts said, Airbus has managed to keep the A350's development hiccups to a relative minimum. Friday's flight took place about a year later than the company had envisioned when it began marketing the plane in 2007 -- not all that significant a delay in aerospace terms.
Airbus, of course, is not the only jet maker that has had trouble with new products. Boeing rolled out its 787 Dreamliner three years late, and early this year was forced to ground the plane for three months after its lightweight but volatile lithium-ion batteries proved prone to overheating.
''This is quickly coming down to a battle of credibility'' between Airbus and Boeing, said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. ''Signaling that you are a reliable provider sends a great message.''
That is especially crucial because orders for commercial jets have slowed after several years of record purchases.
This month, the International Air Transport Association, a trade group based in Geneva and Montreal, predicted that its 240 member airlines would report a combined profit of $12.7 billion in 2013, up from $7.6 billion last year. But those expected gains are largely the result of falling fuel prices and efforts to pack more customers onto fewer planes, rather than a jump in travel demand.
While new jet sales may be slowing, there is still a big backlog of plane orders. Both Boeing and Airbus, as well as smaller jet makers like Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil, have been steadily increasing output. That has increased short-term demand for components, posing a quandary for parts suppliers. Many are reluctant to invest too heavily in new production capacity for fear that they will later be saddled with redundant plants and equipment -- and debt.
''I hear concerns everywhere in commercial markets about the reliability and resilience of the supply chain when they are increasing production everywhere,'' said Damien Lasou, a managing director and aerospace analyst at Accenture in Paris. ''It is a big distraction to management, particularly in terms of capital investment.''
In recent years, the battle for commercial jet sales has focused on shorter-range, single-aisle models like the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737, particularly after the two companies introduced new versions of those planes with more fuel-efficient engines. But airlines have also begun to show renewed interest in the latest wide-body jets, which can offer significantly greater range and more seats than previous models -- promising bigger profit margins on long-distance routes.
Several flag carriers, including Ethiopian Airlines, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa of Germany and Malaysia Airlines, say they are considering multibillion-dollar orders for the larger jets, including the A350 and the 787.
Despite the battery hazards that were revealed on the 787 this year, airlines remain keenly interested in the plane, which is built extensively from lightweight composite materials.
''The shelf life of new jetliner controversy is slightly less than fresh oysters,'' Mr. Aboulafia of Teal Group said of the Boeing 787's troubles. ''It goes away incredibly fast.''

HEADLINE: A Budding Movement to Redefine the Successful Life

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
EVERY day, news releases and books cross my desk that promise success in all sorts of areas -- getting a job, getting a better job, managing your employees, managing your boss, managing your relationships.
Some are interesting, some are ridiculous and many are repetitive takes on the same theme. But recently, I came across two items that, separately, talked about an issue I've tackled before in one of my columns -- questioning what we actually mean by success.
That column, which appeared almost a year ago to the day, discussed how we shouldn't always aim for the extraordinary, but celebrate the ordinary. It was one of my most popular articles ever.
So I was intrigued when I was told that a conference was being held on the very issue of redefining success. And, separately, that American Express had recently released a study showing that Americans were thinking of success in different ways than in the past. 
''The Third Metric: Redefining Success Beyond Money & Power'' was the conference presented last week by Mika Brzezinski, host of MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' and Arianna Huffington, editor in chief of the Huffington Post, at Ms. Huffington's new apartment in TriBeCa (some 200 people squeezed into her living room).
Panels, covering topics ranging from ''Managing a Frenetic Life'' to ''Wellness and the Bottom Line,'' featured a number of prominent people, among them the actress Candice Bergen and Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama.
The message, one that Ms. Huffington is promoting in her publication and in speeches, is particularly aimed at women. ''The way we define success isn't working,'' Ms. Huffington said at the conference. ''More, bigger, better -- we can't do that anymore.''
The concepts seem a little fuzzy at times, but the overarching thesis is that it is time to rethink the common wisdom of how to achieve success: sleep four hours a night, work 20 hours a day, see your family rarely and never admit the need for downtime.
That system is wearing us down, Ms. Huffington said. In her commencement speech this year at Smith College, she told students, ''If we don't redefine success, the personal price we pay will get higher and higher. And as the data shows, the price is even higher for women than for men. Already women in stressful jobs have a nearly 40 percent increased risk of heart disease and a 60 percent greater risk for diabetes.
''Right now, America's workplace culture is practically fueled by stress, sleep deprivation and burnout,'' she said.
The answer? To create a movement that embraces the idea that physical and spiritual wellness -- from meditation to exercise to good nutrition -- are integral to, not separate from, a successful life.
She cited as one example the two nap rooms available for Huffington Post employees, which employees were at first afraid to use because they feared it looked as if they were shirking their duties. Now they are always booked.
Another answer: To build workplaces where empathy and kindness are rewarded, in the somewhat corny terminology of the speakers, where a go-giver is as desirable as a go-getter.
It all sounds wonderful, of course, but how does this fit into our society? Many people are working harder for less money, are concerned less about spiritual wholeness than basic health care, and find it hard to carve out time for a short coffee break, let alone a nap.
''This is well-intentioned and important,'' Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said to me after she spoke at the conference, while acknowledging that ''it's luxurious to have the ability to rethink time in your life.''
It is easy to dismiss these ideas as the privileges available only to those who no longer have to worry about money or power. But perhaps a better reaction would be to find a way to incorporate them into public policy and to ensure that such ideas find their way from the bosses to the workers.
''The whole issue of overwork cuts across class,'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the nonprofit Families and Work Institute. ''We consistently find that one out of three employees feel overwhelmed by everything they have to do at work.''
The institute's latest National Study of the Changing Workforce conducted in 2008 -- phone interviews of more than 3,000 Americans -- found that the No. 1 correlation between better health, such as less frequent minor health problems and fewer signs of depression, was economic security.
The next are ''work-life fit'' and ''autonomy'' or more control over your work environment.
Ms. Galinsky and Ms. Huffington agreed that the phrase work/life balance should have been retired long ago.
''For decades, I've hated the term work/life balance,'' Ms. Galinsky said. ''It implies a scale where one thing takes away from the other. A good life can enhance your job and vice versa.'' A work/life fit, she said, doesn't keep work on one side of the equation and life on the other, but weaves them together.
Some examples are schedule flexibility and co-workers and supervisors who are supportive and responsive to personal and family business.
Ms. Galinsky said her institute had drawn up a list of six criteria for an effective workplace, with effective being defined as having employees who are highly engaged, satisfied and planning to remain with their organization.
These criteria are: challenging and learning on the job, autonomy, work-life fit, support from a supervisor, a work climate of respect and trust and, of course, economic security.
''There is no one magic bullet,'' she said. ''We have six ingredients and none are stand-alone. It's not just about flexibility -- flexibility and a horrible boss don't make a wonderful life.''
The idea that people are eager to find -- or define -- success outside the normal parameters is backed up by a study done for American Express.
The top ways people define a successful life, according to the study: Being in good health, finding time for the important things in life, having a good marriage/relationship and knowing how to spend money well.
The Futures Company, which assisted in the American Express study, also issues the annual U.S. Yankelovich Monitor, a report that has been conducted since 1971 that assesses Americans' attitudes, lifestyles and values.
According to the Monitor report, many fewer people see owning an expensive car as a sign of success, while being satisfied and in control of your life have grown over the years.
''It doesn't mean that material success is unimportant,'' said Peter J. Rose, senior vice president of the Futures Company. Rather, intangibles, like a good marriage and being able to take a day off when desired have grown in importance when defining success.
The Third Metric conference and the American Express study demonstrate a trend -- or maybe the hope of a trend -- that we can reinterpret success beyond the traditional signposts of wealth and concrete achievement.
As Ms. Galinsky said, it's a good philosophy and goal to aim for, but the real question will be, ''How do we make the ideas applicable to everyone in the work force, not just to those who are already very successful?''

HEADLINE: Snowden's Disclosures on Hacking in China Could Affect Its Role in His Fate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The decision by a former National Security Agency contractor to divulge classified data about the United States government's surveillance of computers in mainland China and Hong Kong has complicated his legal position, but may also make China's security apparatus more interested in helping him stay here, law and security experts said on Friday.
The South China Morning Post, a local newspaper, reported on Friday that Edward J. Snowden, the contractor, had shared detailed data showing the dates and Internet Protocol addresses of specific computers in mainland China and Hong Kong that the National Security Agency penetrated over the last four years. The data also showed whether the agency was still breaking into these computers, the success rates for hacking and other operational information.
Mr. Snowden told the newspaper that the computers were in the civilian sector. But Western experts have long said that the dividing line between the civilian sector and the government is very blurry in China. State-owned or state-controlled enterprises still control much of the economy, and virtually all are run by Communist Party cadres who tend to rotate back and forth between government and corporate jobs every few years as part of elaborate career development procedures. 
Kevin Egan, a former prosecutor here who has represented people fighting extradition to the United States, said that Mr. Snowden's latest disclosures would make it harder for him to fight an expected request by the United States for him to be turned over to American law enforcement. ''He's digging his own grave with a very large spade,'' he said.
But a person with longstanding ties to mainland Chinese military and intelligence agencies said that Mr. Snowden's latest disclosures showed that he and his accumulated documents could be valuable to China, particularly if Mr. Snowden chooses to cooperate with mainland authorities.
''The idea is very tempting, but how do you do that, unless he defects,'' said the person, who spoke anonymously because of the diplomatic delicacy of the case. ''It all depends on his attitude.''
The person declined to comment on whether Chinese intelligence agencies would obtain copies of all of Mr. Snowden's computer files anyway if he were arrested by the Hong Kong police pursuant to a warrant from the United States, where the Justice Department has already been reviewing possible charges against him.
A Hong Kong Police Force spokeswoman said earlier this week that any arrest would have to be carried out by the Hong Kong police and not by foreign law enforcement. The Hong Kong police have a responsibility to share with mainland China anything of intelligence value that they find during raids or seizures of evidence, according to law enforcement experts.
Patricia Ho, a lawyer who specializes in political asylum at Daly and Associates, a Hong Kong law firm, said that if Beijing decides that it wants Mr. Snowden to stay in Hong Kong for a long time, the simplest way to do so would be for mainland officials to quietly tell Hong Kong's government officials not to hurry the legal process.
The United States and China have long accused each other of monitoring each other's computer networks for national security reasons. The United States has also accused China of hacking to harvest technological secrets and commercial data on a broad scale from American companies and transferring that information to Chinese companies to give them a competitive advantage.
Tom Billington, an independent cybersecurity specialist in Washington, said that mainland China could benefit by obtaining a copy of the data that Mr. Snowden gave to The South China Morning Post. The data, if independently verified, could help Chinese officials figure out which computers have been hacked, patch security holes, itemize compromised data, analyze the quality of computer security defenses and develop techniques for hardening other Chinese computers against future surveillance by the N.S.A.
''It certainly would seem valuable data for the Chinese,'' Mr. Billington said.
According to The Guardian newspaper of Britain, Mr. Snowden showed up with four laptop computers for a meeting with its journalists in Hong Kong. But The Los Angeles Times has reported that Mr. Snowden originally smuggled electronic files out of the National Security Agency in Hawaii using a USB thumb drive.
Simon Young, the director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, said in a statement that it would be a violation of Hong Kong law to disclose any information that had been shared confidentially by the Hong Kong or mainland Chinese governments with the United States.
''These recent developments underline the importance of Mr. Snowden obtaining immediate legal advice in Hong Kong, especially before any further disclosures are made,'' Mr. Young said.
Mr. Young did not suggest whether any of the data shared by Mr. Snowden would fall into this category. But the Hong Kong government has a history of close law enforcement cooperation with the United States, particularly in the area of counterterrorism. The Hong Kong police have long focused on trying to prevent the territory's freewheeling financial system from becoming a base for Al Qaeda-related money laundering.
The South China Morning Post said that one target of N.S.A. hacking identified by Mr. Snowden was the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which hosts the city's main hub for Internet connections to the rest of the world. ''The University has not detected any form of hacking to the network, which has been running normally,'' the university said in a statement.
The newspaper said that it had not independently verified the accuracy of the data that Mr. Snowden provided. But the United States government has not questioned the authenticity of any of the documents he has released.
The Global Times, a nationalistic mainland Chinese newspaper under direct control of the Communist Party, published an editorial on Friday calling for China to glean as much information as possible from him.
''Snowden is a 'card' that China never expected,'' the commentary said. ''But China is neither adept at nor used to playing it.''
The commentary also called for China and Hong Kong to treat Mr. Snowden kindly enough so that others with national security secrets will not be discouraged from fleeing here. ''China should make sure that Hong Kong is not the last place where other 'Snowdens' want to go,'' it said.
The Associated Press reported on Friday that Britain had issued an alert to airlines around the world warning them not to bring Mr. Snowden to its soil, and threatening them with a fine of 2,000 pounds, or $3,125. Geoffrey Robertson, of London, who was an initial lawyer for Julian Assange during the WikiLeaks dispute, criticized the alert as unusual because it was being applied to someone who has denounced government policies.
''This is a power hitherto used only against those who incite terrorism, race hatred and homophobia -- never before against whistle-blowers,'' Mr. Robertson wrote in an e-mail. ''The British government is simply afraid that its judges, who are fiercely independent, and the European court would embarrass its closest ally by ruling that Snowden could not be extradited because, even if his ''revelations'' prove to be mistaken, he would be subjected to oppressive treatment akin to that being meted out to Bradley Manning,'' the American Army private accused of having leaked secrets in the WikiLeaks case.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pushes Agencies To Free Up Spectrum

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Three years after President Obama laid out an ambitious plan to double the country's supply of airwaves for use in high-speed wireless Internet service, the White House on Friday announced efforts intended in part to spur participation by government agencies that have been slow to join the cause.
Without additional airwaves for consumer and business use, administration officials say, the ''skyrocketing demand of consumer and broadband business users'' for wireless service for smartphones, tablets and other devices will soon outgrow the supply. 
For consumers, the initiative could allow cellphone and wireless broadband companies to eventually increase the reliability of their networks, meaning fewer dropped calls and shorter delays in loading video and other large files.
It also could create jobs, the administration says. It cites industry studies reporting that since 2007, more than 500,000 jobs have been created in what is known as the App Economy -- the business of creating and selling applications and programs that take advantage of faster Internet speeds and more advanced devices.
The administration said it would invest $40 million in the next year and $60 million more over the next five years to find ways for government agencies to share lightly used airwaves that are under federal control with private wireless communications companies.
Mr. Obama directed federal agencies to make more capacity available by enhancing the efficiency of their spectrum use and to recommend ways of using financial or other incentives to increase sharing of airwaves by government agencies.
''The number of wireless devices is exploding, and that means increasing demands on the spectrum upon which they all rely,'' Gene B. Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, said in a White House blog post on Friday. ''The federal government helps manage that resource, and we know we can do a better job of unleashing innovation by ensuring more of it is shared, unlicensed for innovations like Wi-Fi, and better used by our departments and agencies.''
One roadblock to that seemingly unlimited growth potential, however, is the reluctance of some parts of the government to part with any of their vast holdings of the nation's electromagnetic spectrum -- the airwaves used by cellphone and wireless communications companies.
In 2010, Mr. Obama directed government agencies to work to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum from federal and private sector sources. Those efforts have been embraced by numerous federal departments, administration officials say.
But a few others, including the Defense Department, have expressed wariness not only at sharing or giving up any of their designated frequencies, but even at revealing the amount and location of airwaves they control. Doing so could compromise national security, Pentagon officials say.
An administration official cited one hypothetical example where an executive department might use a certain frequency for about 12 hours a week of training activities. One agency might be willing to confine its use to prescribed hours, and allow commercial users to share the airwaves at other times, while another department might say it needs the flexibility to be able to use the airwaves at any time.
The Defense Department has said it supports the president's goals of freeing up spectrum, but noted that an increasingly electronically armed military had its own rising needs for spectrum. The administration emphasized that any new plans to free spectrum should not interfere with ''mission-critical capabilities'' of military and other government departments.
Nevertheless, the intransigency of some departments has frustrated lawmakers.
''I have long called for a thorough inventory of all public spectrum assets in order to gauge usage and improve efficiency, and have been frustrated by how this debate has dragged out over the past four years,'' Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Friday. ''Federal agencies should have the spectrum they need to protect the public, but no one should be warehousing spectrum.''
The Commerce Department has identified more than 300 megahertz of spectrum controlled by the federal government that could be set aside for other uses. The remainder of the 500 megahertz defined as the goal by the administration would come from the so-called incentive auctions that were authorized as part of the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act.
That law provided for the government to share the proceeds of auctions of newly cleared spectrum with television broadcasters who would willingly sell some or all of their spectrum licenses.
Perhaps the most interesting and highly charged recommendation in the president's directive is one ordering recommendations for incentives that could be used to persuade government departments to share or give up spectrum.
A study released last year by a presidential advisory council on science and technology recommended that the government create a ''synthetic'' currency that could be used to entice federal agencies. The system would in effect increase an agency's budget if it gave up or shared its airwaves.
Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel of the Federal Communications Commission, who has also been advocating such a system since joining the agency in May 2012, about the time the advisory council's report was released, said federal spectrum policy should be built ''on carrots, not sticks.''
''Our traditional three-step process for reallocating federal spectrum -- clearing federal users, relocating them, and then auctioning the cleared spectrum for new use -- is reaching its limits,'' she said. The new initiatives, however, ''are a significant step toward meeting the country's spectrum needs.''

HEADLINE: In Student Housing, Luxuries Overshadow Studying

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Brenden Heiland had breathed the vanilla lavender-scented clubhouse air. He had seen the beach volleyball court, toured the game room equipped with billiards, Ping-Pong and air hockey tables, and learned with delight of the Friday pool parties with a D.J., free food and snow cones, spiked with rum for those of age.
Now, as he and the three friends he was apartment hunting with stood peering at the pool, Mr. Heiland, 19, pondered what life might be like if he chose to live in this off-campus complex, the Grove, when his sophomore year at the University of Missouri begins this fall.
''It's like a vacation, almost,'' he said. ''I'm not going to go to class -- that's how I look at it.'' 
As private housing developers try harder than ever to outdo the amenities that their competitors offer in college towns, concern is growing about the academic and social consequences of upscale off-campus student housing.
The spas, tanning salons and sprawling pools offered by these complexes, which often require their tenants to be students, are a far cry from the traditional on-campus residence halls that may house classrooms and faculty and host lectures and academic discussions.
''These are sort of more social environments,'' said Arthur J. Lidsky, the president of Dober Lidsky Mathey, a campus planning consultancy. ''It takes away from sort of a community of learners, and it creates more of a separate living environment that doesn't support that mission.''
Even through the recession and the housing crisis, student housing development has remained robust, outperforming other sectors in part because the rising college student population increased the demand for accommodations. Construction of student housing, though down from its peak five years ago, continues to boom, and analysts predict growth in the coming years.
Here in Columbia, a growing supply of upscale student apartments is the result of private developers meeting the demand that the university could not keep up with as its enrollment ballooned. Developers have created more than 3,800 beds of student housing in town since 2011, according to data compiled by John John, a real estate agent here with Remax Boone Realty. But even that pace of development falls short of the need, which Mr. John predicted would grow in the future as Missouri's freshman population climbs. (It is up more than 28 percent since 2007.)
With all the competition, developers are looking for ways to set their properties apart. That has led to the construction of complexes with tanning salons; spas offering manicures, pedicures, facials and massages; 24-hour workout rooms with virtual trainers; and outdoor pools with bars and cabanas. There are washers and dryers that send text messages when a cycle is complete, and exercise machines that allow users to check their e-mail.
The Domain at Columbia, which is set to open here this year, includes a full-swing golf simulator, a video game room and a theater room. On its Web site, which opens with a two-minute video set to music, the development says it has ''the largest resort style pool in Columbia and the most over the top amenities.''
''We're always trying to make it cooler and more hip than the last one,'' said Jill Lung, the director of interior design at Sixthriver Architects, who has worked on many student residences.
Some of the projects she has worked on, Ms. Lung said, have used technology to create a better learning environment. Some study rooms have flat-screen monitors that students can plug their tablets or computers into and use to collaborate on projects.
Still, college administrators say, those projects fall short of the academic amenities offered on a campus. ''We're trying to integrate our facilities with the academic mission,'' said Frankie Minor, Missouri's director of residential life. ''You don't see the same types of educational programming going on in those facilities as you do in ours.''
Missouri's residence halls have classrooms and study rooms; visiting faculty members live in some, and they host lectures, discussions and scientific experiments.
But Greg Henry, the chief executive of Aspen Heights, a developer based in Austin, Tex., that will open a 980-bed property here in August, said it was up to the property managers to create an environment conducive to learning. Mr. Henry said that his company, which now has 15 student properties nationwide, has been designing its clubhouses to serve as suitable study spaces. On-site staff give the students personalized attention, like birthday greetings or help when they are stressed, he said.
''I don't think it's doing bad in the world to provide a nicer space for college students to live and study and rest and play,'' Mr. Henry said.
Their comforts, some developers argue, will give students less to worry about and allow them to focus more on their schoolwork.
''It lessens the stress,'' said Sam Tchen, 22, who has lived in a modern complex in downtown Columbia for the past two years. ''You just feel more comfortable in your environment.''
Brookside, the complex where Mr. Tchen lives, has a tanning salon and a rooftop pool with a bar and grill run by a local restaurant. The apartments come with a 42-inch flat-screen television, stainless steel appliances, granite countertops and balconies.
Academic concerns aside, some developers, market analysts and city and university officials believe that too much student housing is being built in various college towns and that a bubble could soon burst.
''I think people are looking too much at historic performance,'' said Hans G. Nordby, the marketing director of Property and Portfolio Research, a company that analyzes commercial real estate. ''They're working a good horse to death. It's too much supply.''
Some say the new developments detract from the charm of college towns.
''It's sort of this mass-produced, soulless luxury,'' said Miranda Metheny, a recent Missouri graduate who lives across the street from Brookside in the 176-year-old Niedermeyer Building, which was slated to be razed and replaced with an upscale high rise before public outcry saved the landmark.
The monthly rates for the modern units in Columbia generally start at $700 per student for a spot in an apartment, about twice the cost of older housing in the area. Yet they are on par with the price of on-campus housing, which equates to about $1,000 a month per bed, meals included.
The differences in price and amenities between the old and the new have fed assumptions around Columbia about the type of students enjoying the more upscale accommodations.
''The people who live there are kind of jerks -- not all of them,'' said Ms. Metheny, 23. ''I think they have a sense of entitlement. Even people who grew up with a lot of money, student life is supposed to have certain connotations, like you go without some things.''
Courtney Cooper, 21, who will move into Brookside for her senior year this fall, disputes the stereotype. ''I hear plenty of people that think if you live in Brookside you're going to be spoiled,'' she said. ''I don't think it's true. Some people, their parents pay for what they want. But I'm chipping in. I wouldn't say I'm spoiled by any means.''

HEADLINE: Court in Venezuela Orders Release of a Judge Once Scorned and Jailed by Chávez

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and MARÍA EUGENIA DÍAZ; William Neuman reported from New York, and María Eugenia Díaz from Caracas, Venezuela.

 BODY:
During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest, Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez. On Friday, a court in Caracas, acting at the government's request, ordered Ms. Afiuni to be set free in the latest sign of a shifting political landscape in post-Chávez Venezuela.
Ms. Afiuni was jailed in December 2009 after issuing a court ruling that infuriated Mr. Chávez, who went on television and demanded that she be sentenced to 30 years in prison. For years Mr. Chávez ignored international appeals for her release, including from the American leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky. 
Mr. Chávez, a charismatic socialist, died in March, leaving a bitterly divided country.
His handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, was elected by a slim margin in April and since then has confronted political turmoil and serious economic difficulties that have tested his nascent leadership skills. As Mr. Maduro lurches from one crisis to the next, the quality he seems to have honed most is delivering mixed messages at top volume.
He branded President Obama ''the big boss of the devils'' and then sent his foreign minister to shake hands with Secretary of State John Kerry and call for warmer relations.
He assailed capitalists for causing soaring inflation and rampant product shortages and then sat down with the head of the country's biggest private company to discuss the economy.
And while he has relentlessly vilified the political opposition and the man he edged out in the election, Henrique Capriles Radonski, as traitors and coup plotters, his government has made some moves that could be seen as concessions to longstanding grievances of the opposition, which has been demanding Ms. Afiuni's release.
''There are lots of mixed signals,'' said Elsa Cardozo, a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela. ''It is clear the government of President Maduro is in a situation that is forcing it to make some changes in direction. What we don't know is if they are permanent changes or tactical changes.''
But while government opponents have long called for Ms. Afiuni's release, the action may actually be intended to counter an opposition campaign to take its message abroad, with leaders visiting countries around the world to make the case that Mr. Maduro was unfairly declared the winner of a flawed election and that his government is repressive.
The opposition routinely points to Ms. Afiuni as the most prominent among a group of what it calls political prisoners, who it says were jailed arbitrarily or were convicted in politically motivated trials.
''I view it as a sign from the government to the outside world, the international community, that it is trying to show that it is respectful of human rights,'' José Vicente Haro, a constitutional law expert, said of Ms. Afiuni's release.
Ms. Afiuni was arrested after she ordered a jailed businessman accused of evading currency controls freed while awaiting trial. She has said that the man had been held in custody for longer than Venezuelan law generally permitted under the circumstances and that her ruling complied with a recommendation by United Nations human rights monitors.
Her lawyer, José Amalio Graterol, confirmed reports last year that she was raped while in prison, became pregnant and had an abortion, which led to other health problems. She was moved to house arrest in Caracas in 2011.
Ms. Afiuni's trial began last November and is continuing, although she has refused to attend it.
Last week the national prosecutor's office made a surprise announcement that it had asked a court to release Ms. Afiuni from house arrest, citing her need for medical treatment. The prosecutor asked the court to require her to report to the authorities every 15 days and to bar her from leaving the country and speaking to the news media.
''A judge never should have been imprisoned for three years and six months for issuing a decision in accordance with the law,'' Ms. Afiuni's lawyer, Mr. Graterol, said Friday, adding that her case had intimidated other judges who feared defying the government.

HEADLINE: Household Wealth Is Recovering, but Younger Adults Are Slower to Make Gains

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE total wealth of American households has recovered from the financial crisis and Great Recession, according to the Federal Reserve Board. But that recovery has not been enough to keep up with inflation, and many Americans, particularly younger adults who took on heavy debt to acquire homes before the housing bubble collapsed, are lagging. 
The Fed said last week that household wealth rose by $3 trillion in the first quarter, to $70.3 trillion. It was the first time the total exceeded the $68.1 trillion total posted in the third quarter of 2007, before the recession began, and was the largest quarterly increase since 1999, when the stock market was rising rapidly.
In the first quarter, a third of the gain in wealth came directly from rising values of corporate stocks owned by households. That was a little more than the gain attributed to rising real estate values.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis pointed out that there are more households now than there were in 2007, and that there has been inflation as well. As can be seen in an accompanying chart, the average household wealth at the end of the quarter was $613,635, a figure that is 11 percent below the peak of $689,996 (in 2013 dollars) set in the first quarter of 2007.
Those averages are deceptive, in that they are raised by the high wealth of a relatively small number of households. A very different picture emerges from looking at the median -- the level at which half the households are richer and half poorer. That statistic can be calculated from the Fed's triennial survey of consumer finances. In the studies conducted in the 1990s, the median net wealth was about one-quarter of the average. In the 2000s, the median fell to about one-fifth of the average, and in 2010, it was down to about one-sixth of the average.
During the housing boom, said William R. Emmons, the chief economist of the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, ''exactly the people you would think need to act conservatively were doing the opposite.'' Homeownership rates, and mortgage debt levels, rose for younger households, as well as for less educated and minority ones. Those groups suffered more during the crisis, he said, and have been slower to recover.
Mr. Emmons compiled average wealth figures for different groups from the triennial surveys, and estimated how they have changed since the 2010 survey. The charts also show the results based on age. While all age groups have yet to recover to their 2007 wealth, when adjusted for inflation, older households are down just 3 percent on average, while those headed by middle-age people are down about 10 percent. But the decline is nearly 40 percent for the younger group.
During the housing boom, households ended up with more of their wealth in real estate than before, and mortgage debt rose to record levels relative to the size of the economy. The proportion of wealth in homes is now back to close to the level of the 1990s, but the debt levels remain high by historical standards.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: The Old Get Richer, but Not the Young: Household net worth in the United States returned to record levels in the first quarter, but average household wealth remains well below the 2007 peak when adjusted for inflation. Households headed by relatively young people were among the worst hit in the crisis, and have been slow to recover. Over all, households now have less debt and are less dependent on real estate than they were, but those figures remain high by historical standards. Household ownership of stocks has climbed, but is not close to record levels. Ownership of bonds and other credit market instruments has slipped, but remains high by historical standards.

HIGHLIGHT: Syrian rebels weigh prospects; war crimes tribunal rift; Argentines turn from beef; trade deal in Europe; and a new Airbus jet. 

 BODY:
 NEWS As a group of rebels gathered in an apartment in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, debating the value of the United States' decision to provide them with weapons, government forces nearby began pounding an opposition-held neighborhood. The opposing events led the group to focus on a question asked on Friday by many in Syria's beleaguered opposition: Would the promised aid come in time, or would be it be too little, too late? An older rebel who leads a few dozen fighters on one of the front lines in Aleppo was skeptical. "I'll believe that America is helping us when I see American arms in my group's hands, not statements and food baskets," said the 40-year-old fighter, who calls himself Abu Zaki. Ben Hubbard reports from Cairo. 
A judge at the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague has exposed a deep rift at the highest levels of the court in a blistering letter suggesting that the court's president, an American, pressured other judges into approving the recent acquittals of top Serb and Croat commanders. The letter from the judge, Frederik Harhoff of Denmark, raised serious questions about the credibility of the court, which was created in 1993 to address the atrocities committed in the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Even before Judge Harhoff's letter was made public Thursday, in the Danish newspaper Berlingske, the recent acquittals had provoked a storm of complaints from international lawyers, human rights groups and other judges at the court, who claimed in private that the rulings had abruptly rewritten legal standards that had been applied in earlier cases.Marlise Simons reports from Paris.
 A thick slab of grass-fed sirloin dripping in its own juices: so many Argentines consider such a feast a birthright to be enjoyed regularly that one president in the 1990s quipped to an American magazine, "Tell your readers, 'Don't come to my country if they're vegetarian.' " But tastes change, even in Argentina. Beef consumption in this red-meat colossus has decreased so much over the decades that the nation recently fell from its perch as the world's top per capita consumer of beef, a title Argentine ranchers are fighting to regain from their tiny neighbor, Uruguay. In another jolt, a study warned that pizzerias could soon outnumber steakhouses in this city. Simon Romero reports from Buenos Aires.
European Union ministers thrashed out a deal to begin trade negotiations with the United States late Friday after bowing to French demands to protect state-sponsored film and television industries. The breakthrough, which came after 13 hours of tense talks, should enable Britain to hail the start of the trans-Atlantic trade discussions when the leaders of the Group of 8 biggest economies hold a summit meeting on Monday in Northern Ireland. "The formal launch of negotiations between the world's two largest trading blocs is now imminent," Vince Cable, the British business secretary, said in a statement shortly after the deal was announced. James Kanter reports from Luxembourg
The A350 XWB, the first all-new commercial jet from Airbus in more than six years, took wing into partly cloudy skies here on Friday. There was a lot more riding on it than the multinational crew of two test pilots and four engineers. The new aircraft carries the burden of dispelling Airbus's reputation for cross-cultural and industrial dysfunction, which caused costly delays in the introduction of the company's previous plane, the A380 superjumbo. And in the wake of last year's failed merger of the plane maker's parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, and the British military contractor BAE Systems, Airbus is betting its future more heavily on the success of commercial jets like the A350. Nicola Clark reports from Toulouse, France.
 ARTS The market for antiquities from the ancient world is undergoing an upheaval that sends some works of art skyrocketing to unimaginable heights while scores of others are effectively becoming unsalable. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the Unesco convention adopted in 1970 to safeguard the buried heritage of mankind and shield standing monuments from looting. While many countries, including the United States, did not sign up, the convention is effectively being implemented by international institutions and, increasingly, by prudent collectors and dealers, fearful that the legitimate ownership of their acquisitions may be challenged in the future. Souren Melikian reports from Paris.
 SPORTS Of the 156 players who started the U.S. Open tournament in Pennsylvania, by nightfall Friday only Phil Mickelson and Billy Horschel were under par. Horschel finished his weather-delayed first round of two-over 72 in the morning and chased it with a 67 in the afternoon for a one-under 139 on Merion Golf Club's East Course. Horschel, a winner at this year's PGA Tour stop in New Orleans, hit every green in regulation. He finished around the time Mickelson, the first-round leader, was teeing off. Mickelson, who opened with a 67, made a bogey at the first hole and two more on the 12th and 13th. His only birdie in his round of 72 came on the 18th hole, after the horn sounded to suspend play because of darkness. Karen Crouse reports from Ardmore, Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Why Colorado's Fire Losses, Even with Global Warming, Need Not Be the 'New Normal'

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A deeper look at ways to cut risk and losses in America&#8217;s wildfire red zones. 

 BODY:
As Coloradans grappled with the impact of the state's latest wildfire disaster, some writers were quick to call this "the new normal" due to greenhouse-driven climate change.
Global warming is almost surely contributing to drought and heat in ways that exacerbate fire risk, but the prime driver of losses in these recent fires is a heavily subsidized burst of development in zones of implicit fire danger.
And assertions that such losses are the new normal distract from glaring opportunities to cut unnecessary (and costly) exposure to this danger in the West, even as the grander task of curbing emissions of greenhouse gases proceeds. 
This Twitter item and the Storify post it links to provide my quick take on the prime lessons and opportunities related to Colorado's latest fire: 
Job One in Wildfire 'Red Zones' - Cut Incentives Boosting Building http://t.co/aNFJQPv7pR #storify #agw
- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)15 Jun 13
I also discussed ways to cut vulnerability in hot spots for climate-related hazards, including wildfire hot zones, in my chat yesterday with David Roberts of Grist. Here's my prime point (with relevant links):
We've grown our vulnerability at a pace far exceeding whatever forces climate change is exerting on the same scenarios. Whatever you do on carbon, job one right now is to get out of harm's way, and especially to tweak those knobs where you know that policies are putting us there. There's an economist in Colorado who proposed ending the mortgage deduction for second homes if a house is in a fire zone. I think it's a great idea.
Here's our talk (the relevant portion starts around the 13th minute, but I hope you take the time to watch the whole thing):
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The following excerpts from an article I wrote for Outside Magazine (and a related Dot Earth post) on President Obama's second-term opportunities for environmental progress are worth reposting:
 Stop subsidizing the building boom in danger zones: 
The president and Congress should cut federal subsidies that keep the price of insurance in some high-risk zones (flood plains, coastal areas threatened by rising seas, and regions prone to wildfires) artificially - and disastrously - low.
"If we had never created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the private market would be charging much higher premiums and it would be much more of a deterrent for people living in these places," says Eileen Fretz, director of flood management at the non-profit, American Rivers. While we're not likely to completely end government-backed insurance, last June Congress passed legislation that cut NFIP funding for businesses, second homes, and repeat beneficiaries (that is, homes that flooded multiple times). This is a good start, but we need to do more: stop giving taxpayer protection, and indirectly encouraging development, to communities behind levees. We also need to actively protect our most valuable flood protection infrastructure - wetlands, barrier islands, and dune beaches.
Similar opportunities lie in the nation's wildfire "red zones," where the government is spending $3 billion a year on wildfire protection. "We ain't seen nothing yet," says Ray Rasker, an economist and director of Headwaters Economics. Only 16 percent of private wildland now has homes, he says. "Put climate change on top of new development, and you have a crisis." He suggests cutting support for construction of at-risk homes, doing away with breaks like the federal mortgage tax deduction. [ The rest .]
Here's a bit more on this last point that didn't make it into the piece but is worth adding here:
Given the disastrous impact of wildfires on communities from Texas to Colorado, President Obama can order a reexamination of forest management practices on federal lands that have resulted in huge accumulations of fuel for conflagrations. He can insure that federal agencies responsible for developing codes for construction and materials move ahead with plans for national codes and standards for building in what's called the "wildland-urban interface." The standards would tighten depending on level of hazard determined through a "fire exposure severity zoning system."
I encourage you to explore the fantastic Headwaters Economics report and Web presentation on these issues here:
The Rising Cost of Wildfire Protection
Wildfires are becoming more severe and expensive. This report describes how the protection of homes in the Wildland-Urban Interface has added to these costs and concludes with a brief discussion of solutions that may help control escalating costs.
More background:
"Climate change and wildfire: How vulnerable are we?" - Max Moritz of the University of California, Berkeley, in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last year
"Why People Keep Moving Into Fire-Prone Areas" - Colorado Public Radio interview with Gregory Simon, University of Colorado, Denver.
A Twitter conversation with Phil Plait of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog is worth a look.
 9:49 a.m. | Addendum | After re-reading my published post, I changed the headline to "Colorado's Fire Losses" from "Colorado's Fires" because it's the losses that can be sharply cut through various policy shifts, not necessarily the fires themselves (although many such fires are the result of human proximity to combustible forests and grasslands).

As Bahman Kalbasi of BBC Persian notes, reports from Tehran suggest that joy over the victory of the reformist candidate is mixed with widespread relief at the end of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's two terms in office.

 3:30 P.M. | Full White House Statement on Iran's Election 
Here is the complete text of a statement from the White House on the election of Hassan Rowhani as Iran's next president:
We have seen the announcement by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran that Hojjatoleslam Doctor Hassan Rouhani has been declared the winner of Iran's presidential election. We respect the vote of the Iranian people and congratulate them for their participation in the political process, and their courage in making their voices heard. Yesterday's election took place against the backdrop of a lack of transparency, censorship of the media, Internet, and text messages, and an intimidating security environment that limited freedom of expression and assembly. However, despite these government obstacles and limitations, the Iranian people were determined to act to shape their future.
It is our hope that the Iranian government will heed the will of the Iranian people and make responsible choices that create a better future for all Iranians. The United States remains ready to engage the Iranian government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program.

#Rouhani has won Iran's presidential election, securing over 50% of the vote and so avoiding the need for a run-off.

 11:13 A.M. | Celebrations as Vote Count Nears End 
According to my colleague Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran, a cautious celebration has begun outside the campaign headquarters of the reformist candidate Hassan Rowhani, as the news that he seems to be closing in on an outright victory, with nearly all the votes counted, filters out.
Reza H. Akbari, a research associate at the the Stimson Center in Washington, notes that Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency just reported that less than 7,000 ballot boxes remain to be counted, and the reformist retains his slim majority.
Update: 6,300 ballot boxes are left to count. Rouhani in lead with 50.98%. Ghalibaf far behind in 2nd place with 15.76% #Iran #Iranelection

Thomas notes that a small number of people, wearing the purple color that symbolized the Rowhani campaign, are chanting for reform and a sarcastic farewell to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

A blogger writing on Twitter as @persiankiwi, a supporter of the 2009 Green Movement who claims to be a political activist in Tehran but has been mostly silent since then, just posted a series of updates on celebrations in Iran's capital.

The blogger also posted a barbed look back at the very different vote-counting process and timetable four years ago.

 10:46 A.M. | Reformist Candidate Rowhani Holds Majority in New Tally 
The director of Iran's Fars News Agency, which is close to the influential Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, reports on Twitter that the reformist cleric Hassan Rowhani still leads with slightly more than 50 percent of the votes in the latest official count of 32 million ballots released by Iran's interior ministry minutes ago.
#Iranelection UPDATE: Total 32189k. Rouhani 16413k, Qalibaf 5073k, Jalili 3665k, Rezayi 3593k, Velayati 1969k, Gharazi 391k

#Iranelection Ruohani leads with 50.98 percent of votes.
- Abas Aslani (@abasinfo)15 Jun 13
The research and polling firm Information and Public Opinion Solutions, which produced a poll just before the vote showing a surge in support for Mr. Rowhani, is keeping a running tally of the official numbers on its Web site.
According to my colleague Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran, supporters of Mr. Rowhani, who could be declared Iran's next president within hours, seem determined not to provoke the authorities by spilling into the streets - not, at least, just yet.

There are around 50 people waiting around Rowhani's headquarters. No festive atmosphere at all.
- Thomas Erdbrink (@ThomasErdbrink)15 Jun 13
The response seemed in keeping with the careful campaign slogan of a candidate who managed to inspire the hopes of reformist voters and yet avoid taunting the Islamic Republic's unelected clerical authorities: "Hope. Prudence."

According to bloggers in Iran, and residents of Tehran speaking to expatriate Iranian journalists, the desire for change drove many citizens to vote, despite the disappointment of the last election, and calls from exiled activists for a boycott of the poll.

As the Iranian-American writer Hooman Madj noted earlier, the fact that Mr. Rowhani must get more than 50 percent of the total ballots cast, including those intentionally spoiled as an act of protest, could cause some regret from reformists who did not expect this result.
Given that spoiled ballots count in the #Iranelection +50% margin, will those who intentionally spoiled ballots in protest regret it?
- Hooman Majd (@hmajd)15 Jun 13
It remains possible that the cleric could end up with slightly more than 50 percent of the valid votes counted, but slightly less than 50 percent of the total votes, making a second-round runoff possible.
If we go to the second round, people will be on streets for 2 weeks asking others to vote for #rouhani. This is not good for the state
- jadi (@jadi)15 Jun 13
 10:08 A.M. | Rowhani With More Than 50 Percent in Latest Count 
As my colleague Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran within the last hour, Iran's state television announced that the reformist cleric Hassan Rowhani has maintained a commanding lead in the latest vote count released by interior ministry.
State tv latest: total counted votes: 27.5 million votes - Rowhani: 14.02 million votes - Ghalibaf 4.36 million votes.
- Thomas Erdbrink (@ThomasErdbrink)15 Jun 13
The focus now is on whether or not the reformist will finish with a clear majority of the votes, or be forced into a second-round runoff with his nearest challenger, the conservative mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf. Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent in Tehran, notes that as Mr. Rowhani was narrowly above that mark according to the latest information.
Latest vote count around 5:30 pm total votes 27,595,717 14,020,139 for @HassanRouhani or 50.805% #iranelection
- Jason Rezaian (@jrezaian)15 Jun 13
As excitement built in the reformist camp at the possibility of an outright win, Iran's unelected ruling cleric, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed on his Twitter feed that a similar wave of joy had greeted the disputed victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.
In 2009 was same excitement but w/ insults;this #election has no disrespect. It's valuable that we've progressed so much in 4 years. #Iran
- khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir)15 Jun 13
According to Najmeh Bozorgmehr, reporting from Tehran for The Financial Times, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a two-term former president who called for greater freedom during protests in 2009, and was barred from running this year, has started calling Mr. Rowhani "the president-elect."
Rafsanjani hoped "the preisdent-elect" would do his best 2 resolve country's problems! He clearly considers the election over.

HEADLINE: Against Stupidity, The IMF Itself Contends In Vain

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The awesomely destructive new policy normal. 

 BODY:
Yesterday the IMF chided the United States for spending too little and cutting its budget deficit too fast - and most people, if they heard about it, just shrugged. To be honest, that was my initial reaction too: we've come to accept the sheer stupidity of our current economic policies, and the fact that apparently nothing can be done about it, as part of the "new normal". 
Still, every once in a while we should step back and consider the awesomeness of the situation. Normally, we expect governments to have trouble containing demands that they spend more and/or tax less. Normally, we expect the IMF to be a fiscal scold, telling spendthrift governments to make tough choices; the old joke is that IMF stands for It's Mostly Fiscal.
But now we're in a situation - a liquidity trap - in which more government spending is a good thing, because it helps put unemployed resources to work; meanwhile, the cost in terms of future debt service is minimal, because interest rates are so low. Both ends of the intellectual case for austerity - the claim that spending cuts are actually expansionary and the claim that terrible things happen when debt rises even if interest rates are low - have collapsed. What could be easier, then, than for politicians to make constituents happy by spending more on things voters like?
So what happens? More austerity, because a party dedicated to the proposition that less government is always more blackmailed Obama into accepting the sequester, and now uses its blocking power to prevent any solution; and it's true, Obama has chosen not to make this a central political issue. There are many ways to show how big the government shortfall is; here's a comparison of the track of overall government spending (federal, state, and local) during the last recession and aftermath with the Great Recession and aftermath, just in dollar terms (if we did it in, say, real per capita terms you'd see that spending is falling fairly quickly):
If government spending had grown at normal rates since 2007, it would be hundreds of billions higher than it is - and the unemployment rate would probably be 6 percent or less. At this point austerity is the main reason we're still in an inadequate recovery.
But there isn't even a hint of significant movement on fiscal policy. It's really amazing.

HEADLINE: No Country For Slow Broadband

BYLINE: By RICHARD BENNETT. 
A senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and a co-author of its recent report ''The Whole Picture: Where America's Broadband Networks Really Stand.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- THERE is a popular story going around about the state of America's broadband networks: service is pitifully slow, hugely overpriced and limited to the richest neighborhoods -- whereas in Europe, service is cheap, fast and widespread because regulators force big companies to make room for smaller service providers.
Almost none of this is true: America's broadband networks lead the world by many measures, and they are improving at a more rapid rate than networks in most developed countries. 
Much of the disparity between perception and reality has to do with timing. Before the recession, American Internet service was on a very different path, not keeping pace with large sections of Western Europe and East Asia.
But that began to change as the economy turned around. Private investment and advances in technology, brought about by a competition policy that encouraged cable and phone companies to improve their networks, have propelled America's networks forward.
Over the last three years America's broadband systems have doubled in speed, while Europe's have remained stagnant. And that will continue, because broadband companies here are installing advanced fiber-optic technology faster than Europe, and most of the world's users of the fastest mobile broadband technology, 4G/LTE, live in America.
This is particularly impressive for a nation where low urban population density imposes higher actual costs on network upgrades than in most of the world, and in which government subsidies are rare. In fact, America outranks all nations with similar population density.
Much of the recent growth has come thanks to our system of facilities-based competition -- that is, each service provider is responsible not only for broadband service but for the underlying infrastructure, which encourages them to improve network quality to win customers.
Most European providers still depend on telephone wires controlled by the local phone company, leasing infrastructure they have no ability to improve. Only two European nations, Belgium and the Netherlands, have more network-based competition than America, and many European regulators are now seeking to mimic the American model.
As the reality has changed, many critics have simply stopped discussing international rankings. Others repeat outdated statistics: Susan Crawford, a law professor and author of the widely praised book ''Captive Audience,'' relies on 2009 data to claim that America is 22nd in average broadband speed among developed countries -- and falling. This is despite the fact that the source of that data, the technology company Akamai, has updated its analysis showing America in eighth place -- and rising.
Critics have also focused on price and profit, claiming that America's broadband companies earn windfall profits at the expense of customers. But company financial reports show that American providers are four times less profitable than their European counterparts.
Others say the reason almost a third of Americans don't subscribe to broadband is because networks are underbuilt or overpriced. Yet over 96 percent of households are in areas with access to wired broadband, while prices for entry-level plans are now the third-lowest in the world.
The major causes for low subscribership, as extensive survey research shows, are low interest in the Internet and minimal digital literacy. And too many American households lack the money or interest to buy a computer. As a result, more Americans subscribe to cable TV and cellphones than to Internet service. Our broadband subscription rate is 70 percent, but could easily surpass 90 percent if computer ownership and digital literacy were widespread.
Indeed, the most critical issue facing American broadband has nothing to do with the quality of our networks; it is our relatively low rates of subscribership.
This is one place where we could learn from the rest of the world. The leaders in broadband subscriptions, like South Korea and Singapore, use outreach, education and computer ownership programs to get people online.
We are starting to see something like this in outreach and education initiatives in the United States, including Connect2Compete and Comcast's Internet Essentials. It is too early to evaluate them fully. But at least they address a genuine, present-day problem -- rather than an overwrought historical phantom.

HEADLINE: A New Generation of Borrowers

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
The next generation of potential home buyers prefer to live in developments with an array of housing types close to shops and mass transit, a recent survey shows. Is this bad news for the baby boomers who will eventually be looking to sell their big suburban houses?
It's too soon to tell, analysts say, because the generation that is now roughly 18 to 34 is still moving into its child-raising years. As Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia, noted, ''It's very hard to imagine before you have kids what you will want when you have kids.'' 
But it's likely that this generation, who are known as millennials or Generation Y, will force some type of shift in the housing market; it is more racially and ethnically diverse than previous generations, as well as more deeply affected by the recession than older adults.
''I do think their preferences are going to result in sustained change,'' said Lynn Ross, the executive director of the Urban Land Institute's Terwilliger Center for Housing. ''This group is so different from previous generations.''
The institute recently released the results of a survey showing the generation's penchant for urban-style living. About 60 percent say they prefer a mix of housing choices, along with proximity to shops, dining, offices and transit. Seventy-five percent said they valued walkability -- a preference that jibes with this generation's declining number of licensed drivers, according to a report by U.S. Pirg, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.
Of the 63 percent who said they planned to move within the next five years, nearly 40 percent expect to live in some type of multifamily housing.
Ms. Ross said the findings didn't necessarily mean this generation would move en masse to city locations. These young buyers may also be drawn to compact development in downtown suburban locations.
More than half of the young adults surveyed by the institute are renting, but they haven't given up on the American dream. In fact, nearly 70 percent said they expected to buy within five years.
While that may sound reassuring to real estate and mortgage professionals, it may also be overly optimistic. This generation is heavily saddled with student-loan debt -- in a recent Wells Fargo survey, 54 percent of adults 22 to 32 cited debt as their biggest financial concern, with 42 percent referring to it as ''overwhelming.''
Young adults are financially stymied in other ways as well. Unemployment remains a problem, credit is hard to access, and parents hurt by the recession or victim to foreclosure are less able to help out, Ms. Ross said.
''This generation has been through an incredibly difficult time,'' she said, ''and I think it is ultimately going to operate very similarly to the generation that went through the Great Depression.''
Mr. Kolko agrees that this generation faces some high financial hurdles, as demonstrated by a falling rate of homeownership. (His research puts that rate around 37 percent for people under 35, down from 42 percent before the housing bubble burst.) But he said that didn't mean that once they were able to buy, they wouldn't follow their parents' example and move to a grassy subdivision.
Mr. Kolko noted that although people surveyed by Trulia often say they want walkability and proximity to mass transit, property searches on Trulia.com are more often conducted by city people looking in the suburbs than vice versa. ''Gen Y may turn out to have unrealistic expectations about what they can afford,'' he said, ''but that doesn't mean they want something radically different. It's too soon to tell whether there is a permanent shift.''

HEADLINE: Rough Road Ahead, but a Robot Driver Takes It in Stride

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
ROMEO, MICH. -- A Ford Transit van slams its way over concrete obstacles in a test of durability here at the automaker's proving grounds some 40 miles north of Detroit. The continuous on-road torture is punishing and could wreak havoc on both chassis-components and a driver's spine, but this test driver doesn't mind.
That's because the driver is a robot -- a robotic autonomous device -- and it has not been programmed to complain.
Robots have helped assemble cars since 1961, when, according to the International Federation of Robotics, a Unimate robot on a General Motors assembly line began installing door handles. Robots have since taken over many tedious and hazardous tasks, but it's only in recent years that they have been assigned to test-track duty. 
Other automakers use robotic drivers to test vehicles in limited ways, but Ford is the only company using them in place of human test drivers for this level of durability testing, said Dave Payne, Ford's manager of vehicle development operations, in an interview. The automaker began running robotically controlled vehicles on its test track in October 2012, following a development program of nearly two years.
The sight of a large van with no one at the wheel -- I had never seen a driverless vehicle navigate roads before -- bearing down on my position was a bit tense at first, but the machine's accurate course proved reassuring.
The robotic system guiding the van, developed by Ford in partnership with Autonomous Solutions of Petersboro, Utah, depends on global positioning sensors. The GPS ability relies on the same satellites that help a smartphone find a restaurant, but it is far more precise. Accurate to one inch, it uses correction technology similar to that employed by systems that land airplanes.
When the plan for autonomous durability testing was approved, the proving grounds team began creating precise maps of the test-track roads. Then inch-by-inch, turn-by-turn paths for the tests, defined by lines and arcs that correspond to points on the road, were developed.
These were used to create instruction sets with steering, throttle and braking commands that would keep each test vehicle on a course varying by less than an inch at any point, Mr. Payne said. Rather than one set for an entire test, the driving instructions are divided into segments, each covering a portion of the track.
A radio system using multiple antennas uploads segment instructions to an onboard controller in each test vehicle. The instructions are queued and become active as required by vehicle position. The controller generates signals that operate steering, brake, throttle and gearshift as required.
Steering is done by a motor that turns a ring gear attached to the wheel; linear actuators operate the throttle, brakes and gearshift selector.
The operation of test-fleet vehicles is overseen from a command center, where a flesh-and-blood supervisor watches multiple monitors displaying maps that trace the path of each vehicle, live test-track video, readouts of vehicle system vitals and more. Looking over his shoulder, I watched as GPS software traced the path of a vehicle on one monitor, while the next monitor displayed a corresponding video.
Should a car or truck deviate from its path, the supervisor can shut it down with a push of a big red button. A second button can shut down all robotic vehicles on the proving grounds.
Jeff Bledsoe, Ford's durability technical specialist, said the project team sampled products from several suppliers before they found a communication system that delivered the performance necessary to relay information to test vehicles rapidly.
The system can deliver a signal in 20 to 50 milliseconds, so a vehicle going 30 m.p.h. will travel only about a foot in the time it takes for a message to arrive. Because the command center is sending only segment instructions and not direct guidance, that's more than adequate.
I rode along as a robotic test driver negotiated a punishing course in a Transit van. The digitized operator wheezed and clanked as it executed turns and guided the vehicle over substantial bumps, but it kept us on course with reassuring accuracy.
It wasn't big on conversation but had apparently turned the radio on before I climbed in, perhaps thinking I required entertainment. The robot's steering control was good, but its brake and throttle application were herky-jerky -- I wouldn't want to commute with it every day -- but it delivered me safely back to the starting point.
Ford's automated durability testing project not only replaces human drivers in unhealthy and tedious assignments, but it also can produce more reliable and consistent test results.
To evaluate the system, Ford engineers mapped loads applied to chassis parts on a specific course with human and robotic vehicle operators. Two robots achieved results that were nearly identical, while the load graphs from a pair of human drivers were widely divergent.
Good repeatability of test-drive routes and speeds helps ensure that the test results are comparable. And because robotic test drivers don't take lunch, the number of bumps required to stress a part to failure can be packed into far fewer hours than would otherwise be required.
Ford technicians have run as many as four robotic test vehicles simultaneously, and they have the capability to run eight, crossing paths and interacting on the test track. But they have not yet mixed robot-driven vehicles with cars and trucks driven by human drivers.
That, however, is coming.
Mr. Bledsoe said the vehicle controllers would soon be equipped to recognize other vehicles and pedestrians.
''Autonomous Solutions has developed software that makes this possible,'' he said. ''We've experimented with it, but have more prove-out to do.''
The software employs some of the same sensors and cameras used for smart cruise control systems.
Asked how the test-track robotics project might relate to fully autonomous vehicle development, Mr. Payne said that while the test-track system had some things in common with autonomous technology, true driverless operation on a public road was ''a whole different animal'' in that the vehicle had to make decisions based on the environment.
That raises the question of whether Ford is working on a fully autonomous vehicle. A Ford spokesman, Said Deep, provided a company statement that said, in part, ''We believe that automation will act as an assistance feature supporting the creation of better drivers, providing increasingly more capable cars that make driving safer -- always keeping the drivers in control.''
In other words, Ford says it believes you're not going to want a robot at the wheel any time soon.
Mel Torrie, chief executive of Autonomous Systems, shows considerably more enthusiasm for autonomous passenger cars. ''We are doing technology that would be applicable,'' he said. ''We would love to work with Ford on that.''

HEADLINE: Six Faces of the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
AT least one part of the labor force has expanded significantly since the recession hit: the low-wage part, made up of burger flippers, home health aides and the like. 
Put simply, the recession took middle-class jobs, and the recovery has replaced them with low-income ones, a trend that has exacerbated income inequality. According to Labor Department data, about 1.7 million workers earned the minimum wage or less in 2007. By 2012, the total had surged to 3.6 million, with millions of others earning just a few cents or dollars more.
In his State of the Union address in February, President Obama made raising the federal minimum wage his banner economic proposal. The White House argued that increasing the wage to $9 an hour from its current $7.25 and indexing it to inflation would lift hundreds of thousands of families above the poverty line.
Combined with tax measures the administration has supported, Alan B. Krueger, the departing chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said that raising the minimum wage would undo ''a lot of the rise in inequality we've seen over the last 20 years.''
But the proposal has gone nowhere. Democrats in Congress put forward a bill raising the minimum wage to more than $10 an hour, and their Republican counterparts voted it down.
Many conservatives and some economists say that raising the cost of employing workers results in fewer workers. ''What happens when you take away the first couple of rungs on the economic ladder, you make it harder for people to get on,''John A. Boehner, the House speaker, has said.
Mr. Krueger disagrees. His work with David Card of the University of California, Berkeley (later replicated by others) demonstrated in a real-life experiment that raising the minimum wage did not result in businesses shedding workers, perhaps in part because it helped reduce turnover.
But for now, it seems the minimum will stay where it is. Because of inflation, the minimum wage loses value over time if it is not bumped up. Accounting for inflation's effects, it is now worth less than in the 1960s and 70s. And, as the people pictured here can attest, getting by on it -- whether the federal minimum or a state version, which can be somewhat higher -- is getting harder.

HEADLINE: In Queens, a Bet Gone Bad

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
On a recent Saturday afternoon I set out to explore South Ozone Park in Queens, in particular a stretch whose racial composition -- according to recent census data, about a quarter white, a quarter Asian, 10 percent black and 11 percent biracial, with 30 percent of residents belonging to the statistical category of ''other'' -- makes it one of the three most diverse patches of the city. Ethnically, too, it contains multitudes: Dominicans and Puerto Ricans live alongside Ecuadoreans, Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese and people who look as though they might be cast in the production of anything succumbing to Italian-American caricature.
What had prompted my visit was, in a sense, a tourist's curiosity about how integration of this kind might actually be lived and how, in the midst of a mayoral race, political conceptions in such a place might be evolving. 
There were instances of inspiration to be found, encounters with a New York of one's gorgeous mosaic fantasies. A barbershop called E Place, owned by an Uzbek immigrant named Eric Dzhuray, caters to Trinidadians and Guyanese -- who make up a considerable share of the community in South Ozone Park -- and at least one young white suburbanite who had grown so devoted to the shop when he lived in neighboring Howard Beach that he continued his patronage even though he had married and moved to Long Island.
The fact that a catering hall called La Bella Vita, owned by a man named Tony Modica and steeped in Pompeii aesthetics, was full of black patrons on the day I wandered in suggested that a certain kind of social progress had been made since the divisive days of Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing,'' two decades ago.
Both the barbershop and catering hall were to be found on Rockaway Boulevard, the primary commercial thoroughfare in South Ozone Park. Though it seemed as if it should be a busy place, full of pedestrian traffic and businesses servicing varied cultural interests, it has the bloodless feel of a Sun Belt village lost to misbegotten visions. The area itself is not poor; in the particular census tract I was visiting, median family income stands at $63,000 a year, above the figure for the city on the whole. But whatever vitality the demographics might suggest is so obviously lacking that one longtime resident mentioned that he hoped simply for a McDonald's to energize the slackened mood.
How could this have happened? When the subject of politics came up, it elicited little interest (except from a man named Danny Napoli, who wore dark glasses and a flag bandanna around his head and said that he was supporting Christine Quinn, offering that it didn't matter to him that she was gay). Few others seemed to have much sense of who was running for mayor at all or much faith that government could effect significant change -- or at least significant good -- locally.
Something unfortunate had happened in the neighborhood, and now there seemed to be no turning back, people said: the opening nearly two years ago of Resorts World Casino on Rockaway Boulevard, adjacent to the Aqueduct Racetrack. As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo pushes for the authorization of three Las Vegas-style casinos in upstate New York, and as the possibility of additional casinos in the city looms in the years ahead, there are certainly lessons to be absorbed from what Resorts World has wrought.
As Alberto Livecchi, a longtime resident of South Ozone Park and the owner of a store selling musical equipment, explained, the construction of the casino -- a racino, in gambling parlance -- came with promises that have not materialized. Having been sold as a boon to local commerce, it has instead affected businesses negatively, Mr. Livecchi argued. ''People are just funneled into the casino and don't leave,'' he remarked. Whatever street life there was has been destroyed, residents said; pawnshops are ubiquitous. ''Casinos are only interested in enriching themselves,'' Mr. Modica said.
Ample data on how gambling affects local businesses suggests that these men are not hallucinating. In the 1990s, researchers at Iowa State University examined the consequences of riverboat gambling for business owners in Clinton, Iowa, and found that while 12 percent reported an increase in business, 29 percent reported a decrease, and 60 percent reported no change at all. And racetrack casinos, as Clyde Barrow, a political economist who studies gambling, explained, draw most customers not from the far and wide but from a 30-minute radius. Rather than drawing new money to the area, it seems, they divert local dollars to gambling.
What we hardly need research to tell us is that the world that emerges around casinos is often an intensely depressing place. Across the street from Resorts World is Sell and Pawn Inc., which takes gold, silver, jewelry, electronics and so on from those compelled to find their way to their next slot machine dollar. The shop's owner, a Russian immigrant, opened up a year after the casino did, having worked in construction and seeing that work dry up after the financial crisis. A friend urged him to open a pawnshop because it was lucrative, but he was not, it seemed, prepared for the psychological toll this new occupation would take, for the fact that moral bankruptcy was now a job requirement.
''You have to take advantage of desperate people,'' he told me, looking fairly miserable. ''I don't like this business at all.''

HEADLINE: Caste Is Not Past

BYLINE: By LAVANYA SANKARAN. 
The author of the novel ''The Hope Factory.''

 BODY:
BANGALORE, India -- CASTE is not a word that modernizing India likes to use. It has receded to the unfashionable background. Newspapers reserve their headlines for the newer metrics of social hierarchy: wealth and politics, and those powerful influencers of popular culture, actors and cricket stars.
There are two stories we tell ourselves in urban India. One is about how education transforms lives. It is the golden key to the future, allowing people to rise above the circumstances of their birth and background. And sometimes, it does. In my own neighborhood, a few sons and daughters of cooks and gardeners are earning their engineering and business degrees, and sweeping their families into the middle class. Not many, certainly. But enough that this is a valid hope, a valid dream. 
The other story is about how the last two decades of economic growth have fundamentally changed the country, creating jobs and income and nurturing aspiration where earlier there was none. New money and an increasingly powerful middle class are supposedly displacing the old social hierarchies.
These are exciting stories, even revolutionary in a country where, for centuries, the social order was considered immutable. Traditionally, Indian society was divided into four main castes. At the top, Brahmins, as priests and teachers; second came the Kshatriyas, the warriors and rulers; third, Vaishyas, who were merchants; last, Shudras, the laborers. And below them all, the Dalits, or untouchables, called Harijans, or ''children of God,'' by Mahatma Gandhi (for indeed, who isn't?).
The castes were ostensibly professional divisions but were locked firmly into place by birth and a rigid structure of social rules that governed interaction between and within them.
That, famously, was then. Discrimination based on caste has been illegal in India for more than six decades. In today's urban India, this land of possibility, separated from rural India by cultural and economic chasms, it seems reactionary even to speak of caste. Certainly it shouldn't -- and usually doesn't -- come up at work or at play or in the apartment elevator.
If it features in urban conversations at all, it is defanged, reduced to cultural stereotypes and amusing-if-annoying tropes that never bother with political correctness. Gujarati Baniyas of the Vaishya caste have a keen eye on finance. Tamil Brahmins do math and classical music. Nobody parties or fights harder than a Punjabi Khatri (of the Kshatriyas). It's the equivalent, in America, of expecting the Asian kid to have good grades, the black man to be the best dancer and the Jewish guy to be well-read and have some slight mother issues.
As India transforms, one might expect caste to dissolve and disappear, but that is not happening. Instead, caste is making its presence felt in ways similar to race in modern America: less important now in jobs and education, but vibrantly alive when it comes to two significant societal markers -- marriage and politics.
No surprise on that first one. Inter-caste marriages in India are on the rise but still tend to be the province of the liberal few. For much of the country, with its penchant for arranged marriages and close family ties, caste is still a primary determinant in choosing a spouse.
Politics is where caste has gotten a surprising new lease on life. After money and education, democracy is, of course, the third powerful force transforming Indian society. But Indians, it turns out, are passionate about the caste of their politicians. Nearly half of the voting population of even a highly educated city like Bangalore considers caste to be the No. 1 reason to vote for a candidate.
Democracy gives power to people who previously had none. But, like race, caste can shift political discussions from present-day merit to payback for historical injustices.
Six decades of democratic statehood have attempted to correct the imbalances of the past through ''reservation'' -- job and education quotas for the so-called backward castes, like the Dalits. This program has been effective, in a fairly hit-or-miss fashion. Some say that nearly all university seats are reserved for lower castes, effectively blocking Brahmins from higher education. Others point out that the vast majority of high paying jobs are still in the hands of the top three castes.
This, then, is the problem of discussing caste in India: the profound lack of information and contradictory data on the subject. Succeeding governments for years shied away from gathering caste-based data, preferring, with obscure political wisdom, to enact their policies in the dark. This changed in 2011, with the first Indian census to visit the subject in eight decades.
The ostensible reason for the caste census was to see where we were economically. But let's have no doubt, the impact will be political.
Indian political parties have played caste politics for years. The powerful Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party and its derivatives have thrived on an anti-Brahmin platform in Tamil Nadu. The compelling rise of Mayawati, a Dalit woman who goes by one name, to chief minister of Uttar Pradesh was built on the support of her caste. But, once in office, her reputation as one of the world's most influential female politicians was marred by corruption and mismanagement in her administration. Last year, her party lost control of Uttar Pradesh's legislative assembly, and Ms. Mayawati resigned her position. Now, in an intriguing twist, she hopes to regain power by wooing not just Dalits but also Brahmins, arguing that the latter are newly marginalized.
The census results will give strategists their best tools for precisely targeting voters and tailoring campaign messages to caste concerns and fears. Caste will probably grow as a voter focal point, at the expense of administrative competency in economics, education, foreign policy, women's rights, the environment and every other vital matter of governance that concerns a growing India.
So that is the fascinating conundrum of Indian society: on one hand, caste is losing its virility as India opens up opportunities and mind-sets, while on the other, the forces of democratic politics ensure that it will thrive and never be forgotten as a crucial social index.

What $1 Million Can and Can't Do
The Strategies column last week described how a low-interest-rate world was imperiling would-be retirees -- even those with a $1 million bond portfolio.
The original column drew more than 640 reader comments on nytimes.com, as readers of all ages told of their worries about the financial future -- and how they were rewriting their own savings-and-spending plans. Some are adopting much more frugal lifestyles. Others are contemplating working long past their planned retirement age. Still others said that their own nest eggs -- whether $1 million or even much, much less -- could still go far in today's world.
Here are some of the comments, which have been edited and condensed: 
Investment education is key to overcoming the retirement dilemma the nation will be facing. Start saving at least 20 percent starting in your 20s, diversify your portfolio between domestic and international stocks, be an aggressive bargainer and negotiator across all aspects of life, live simply and try to stay healthy.
I'm 33 and single with $120,000 in savings and a $125,000 investment portfolio. I know where this country is heading and am living with the assumption that nobody will provide for me except myself. A lot can be achieved with a change in attitude.
YANKEES, CT.
If you arrange your retirement life right, you need far less than $1 million. I retired at 63 with no debt, a modest home and no compulsion to acquire high-priced toys. I travel, eat well and do (pretty much) everything I want, but my wants are reasonable. It was my choice to put retirement at the top of my goals.
JOANNE FROM MN, EAGAN, MINN.
It's the baby-boomer blues. When we went to buy our first house and needed to borrow money, interest rates were at 13 percent. Now, after saving all of our lives, interest rates are at 0 percent. Can't win, can we?
TJJ, ALBUQUERQUE
I'm a Gen Xer. None of my siblings or friends save a dime. Now we're all in our 30s and they still haven't figured out how to live within their means, let alone set anything aside. The baby boomers are in for a tough ride, but it's going to look like cake compared to us.
PATRICK, MINNEAPOLIS
I'm against working longer before retirement. You've got 66 years to accumulate sufficient funds to support your retirement years. After that, walk out the door and give that spot to college graduates desperately looking for work.
BSB, PRINCETON
We give the elderly pride of place in the federal budget, with Medicare, Social Security and, for the last 20 years, low tax rates, along with some of the most amazing real estate run-ups imaginable. All that largess has come at the expense of funding for education and other programs for people who are not elderly. How many articles and whining comments do I have to keep reading about a bond market shortchanging retirees? Doesn't anyone care about people who aren't going to be retiring in the next 10 years?
BARBARA, VIRGINIA
Of many differences between Americans and Western Europeans, the most striking is that we live in terror of growing old while they know that in certain respects -- health care, housing, social welfare -- their government has provided for them. Your article would be incomprehensible to someone in a European welfare state.
LAOXIAO2, BALI
It is critical to the very survival of all but the very wealthiest Americans that Social Security and original Medicare be maintained. If Social Security benefits are cut, and Medicare is changed to some kind of privatized voucher system, or goes bust altogether, millions of Americans will be facing a very grim retirement indeed.
DJS, NEW YORK
I'm sorry, but there is no reason two retired people cannot live off $1 million in liquid assets. It is not that hard to generate 4 percent with solid dividend-producing stocks. Two Social Security payments could be another $40,000. (I'm assuming no pensions.) So, you're not going on world cruises and staying at the Ritz. But $80,000 a year (more if you work part time) for a couple with grown children and no mortgage is really not that terrible.
JOSEPH, ALBANY
After I retired in 2009, I took a part-time job at $36,000 a year. It did not sound like much at the time, but I realized that one would need $1.2 million earning 3 percent to generate that much retirement income. I will keep working this job as long as I can.
WEEDDR81, LITTLE ROCK, ARK.
We're a nation of grasshoppers, looking for ants to do our dirty work. I suggest we take a good look in the mirror. The answer lies within each of us to save 20 percent of our income from our first job and to never stop.
I have sympathy for low-income families. I do not have sympathy for families making $80,000, $120,000 or $200,000. Instead of watching ''The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,'' maybe our culture ought to aspire more toward spiritually uplifting, self-empowering, financially rewarding and physically rejuvenating endeavors like living within our means, rejecting conspicuous consumption and following a healthy, low-environmental-impact lifestyle.
GENE, PLYMOUTH, MICH.
Soon, retirement will again become what it was for most of history; something that only the rich and the dead could do.

HEADLINE: The Not-So-Good Old Days

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE COONTZ. 
Stephanie Coontz, a guest columnist, teaches at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.

 BODY:
MY column last month about the dangers of nostalgia inspired many readers to write to me about their family memories of the 1950s and '60s. Some shared poignant stories about the discrimination they encountered as blacks, women, gay men or lesbians. Others described how much easier it was for their working-class fathers to support a family back then.
Manufacturing workers have reason to regret the passing of an era. Between 1945 and 1978, their real earnings almost doubled -- rising by 95 percent -- but then, over the next 34 years, they actually fell by 2.3 percent. Supporters of women's reproductive rights might feel nostalgic for an era when three former presidents, the Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson, were happy to serve as honorary co-chairmen of a Planned Parenthood fund-raising committee. 
But you can't just stroll through the past, picking the things you like and skipping the ones you don't, as if historical eras were menus, and you could pick one from column A and one from column B. They are, rather, interconnected social, economic and political systems. Whether someone would really want to return to a particular time depends on socioeconomic class, age, sex, race and health.
In 1950, a young man, with or without a high school degree, would have found it much easier than it is today to get and keep a job in the auto industry. And in that year, according to Colin Gordon, a historian at the University of Iowa, the average autoworker could meet monthly mortgage payments on a median-priced home with just 13.4 percent of his take-home pay. Today a similar mortgage would claim more than twice that share of his monthly earnings.
Other members of the autoworker's family, however, might be less inclined to trade the present for the past. His retired parents would certainly have had less economic security back then. Throughout much of the 1960s, more than a quarter of men and women age 65 and older lived below the poverty level, compared to less than 10 percent in 2010.
In most states, his wife could not have taken out a loan or a credit card in her own name. If she wanted a job, she had to turn to the ''Help Wanted -- Female'' section of the classifieds, where she might learn, as one 1963 ad in this newspaper put it, that ''you must be really beautiful'' to be hired. In 42 states, a homemaker had no legal claim on the earnings of her husband. And nowhere did a wife have legal recourse against marital rape.
A couple with a disabled child would surely not want to return to an era when such kids were regularly warehoused in institutions, where they might be sterilized or lobotomized. Not long ago I drove past one such former hospital in Winfield, Kan., the long-closed Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth.
Nor would most black workers want to revert to a time when, on average, they earned 40 percent less than their white counterparts, while restrictive racial covenants largely prevented them from buying into the suburban neighborhoods being built for white working-class families.
Today, new problems have emerged in the process of resolving old ones, but the solution is not to go back to the past. Some people may long for an era when divorce was still hard to come by. The spread of no-fault divorce has reduced the bargaining power of whichever spouse is more interested in continuing the relationship. And the breakup of such marriages has caused pain for many families.
Yet, according to the economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, whenever a state adopted a no-fault divorce law, the annual rate of female suicide there dropped by 8 to 16 percent, and the incidence of domestic violence declined by roughly 30 percent.
It would certainly help if we could reverse the deterioration of real wages and job security that so many Americans have endured in recent decades. But even if we succeeded, we will have to accept that family life will never again be as stable, universal or uniform as it was when few women could support themselves, when couples who divorced or lived together outside of marriage faced widespread discrimination, when gay men and lesbians were often pressured into sham marriages and when victims of domestic violence or child abuse had few avenues to escape from their tormentors.
The growing diversity of family life comes with new possibilities as well as new challenges. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, more than 80 percent of Americans believe that their current family is as close as the one in which they grew up, or closer. Finding ways to improve the lives of the remaining 20 percent seems more realistic than trying to restore an imaginary golden age.

HEADLINE: Bill Schools Barry on Syria

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- NOT only is President Obama leading from behind, now he's leading from behind Bill Clinton.
After dithering for two years over what to do about the slaughter in Syria, the president was finally shoved into action by the past and perhaps future occupant of his bedroom.
Clinton told John McCain during a private Q. and A. on Tuesday in New York that Obama should be more forceful on Syria and should not rationalize with opinion polls that reflect Americans' reluctance to tangle in foreign crises. McCain has been banging the gong on a no-fly zone in Syria for some time. 
The oddity of Obama's being taken to the leadership woodshed by the Democrat who preceded him and the Republican who failed to pre-empt him was not lost on anyone. When Obama appointed Clinton ''the Secretary of 'Splaining Stuff,'' he didn't think Bill would be 'splaining how lame Barry was.
As Maggie Haberman reported in Politico, Clinton said at the McCain Institute for International Leadership that the public elects presidents and lawmakers to ''look around the corner and see down the road'' and ''to win,'' not to follow polls.
When the man who polled where to take his summer vacation and whether to tell the truth about his affair with Monica Lewinsky tells you you're a captive of polls, you'd better listen up.
Citing his own experiences in Kosovo and Bosnia, Clinton said that if you blamed a poll for a lack of action, ''you'd look like a total wuss.'' He added that ''when people are telling you 'no' in these situations, very often what they're doing is flashing a giant yellow light'' of caution.
According to Haberman, Clinton, who apologized for failing to intervene in the Rwandan genocide, continued: ''If you refuse to act and you cause a calamity, the one thing you cannot say when all the eggs have been broken is that 'Oh my God, two years ago there was a poll that said 80 percent of you were against it.' Right? You'd look like a total fool. So you really have to in the end trust the American people, tell them what you're doing, and hope to God you can sell it.''
That is the problem for Obama: selling it. The silver-tongued campaigner has turned out to be a leaden salesman in the Oval Office. On issues from drones to gun control to taxes to Syria, the president likes to cite public opinion polls to justify his action or inaction. He seems incapable of getting in front of issues and shaping public and Congressional opinion with a strong selling job.
After the whistle was blown on the National Security Agency's No Call Left Behind program, the president said he would welcome an ex post facto debate. But now that polls indicate that the overwhelming American attitude is ''Spy on me,'' Obama has dropped the subject.
Too bad. We'll see what Americans have to say when someone in the mold of Dick Cheney or Bob Haldeman gets his hands on all that personal data; the West Wing has been known to drive its occupants nuts.
On Syria, the administration now says it will begin supplying rebels with small arms and ammunition, a gesture that friends and foes alike say is too little, too late. The Times's Peter Baker reported on Saturday that Obama himself said it wouldn't change anything but would maybe buy time.
And as the White House announced this pittance of a policy on Thursday evening, the president was nowhere to be seen. He let his deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, be the face of the Syria plan, while he spent time at an LGBT Pride Month celebration, a Father's Day luncheon and a reception for the W.N.B.A. championship Indiana Fever basketball team.
On ''Morning Joe'' on Friday, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Carter national security adviser, dismissed the president's response to Syria as ''propaganda,'' noting the ambiguous nature of the red line that President Assad had crossed, killing 150 people with chemical weapons after nearly 93,000 had died in the civil war.
''It all seems to me rather sporadic, chaotic, unstructured, undirected,'' he said. ''I think we need a serious policy review with the top people involved, not just an announcement by the deputy head of the N.S.C.''
Especially, he added, since Syria could slide into a larger regional war that would pit America against Syria's ally, Iran, with a huge effect on the international economy and America's budget.
While the president was avoiding talking about what he hadn't wanted to do in the first place, the former president was ubiquitous and uxorious, chatting about Syria and myriad other issues on MSNBC and Bloomberg TV; smiling on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and offering his solutions for corporate America's problems; presiding at his global initiative in Chicago; and promoting the woman he hopes will be the next president.
On Friday, a self-satisfied Clinton told the ''Morning Joe'' hosts about Syria, ''It looks to me like this thing is trending in the right direction now.''
The less Obama leads, the more likely it is that history will see him as a pallid interregnum between two chaotic Clinton eras.
Nature abhors a vacuum. And so does Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: Million-Anecdote Baby

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Ross Douthat is off today.

 BODY:
A friend of mine has an adult child with cancer, a young man just old enough to be beyond the age of coverage under his parents' health care plan. After nearly killing him, the dreaded Hodgkin's lymphoma is in remission. But he's still a pariah in the eyes of the insurance industry, which means they can deny him a policy that might save his life.
Not for long. In six months' time, the heartless practice of refusing to let sick people buy affordable health insurance -- private-sector death panels, the most odious kind of American exceptionalism -- will be illegal from shore to shore. 
''I can't wait for Obamacare,'' my friend gushed the other day. And she's not alone. About one in 10 people with cancer in this country have been denied health coverage.
The cartoon version of the Affordable Care Act, that much-loathed government takeover of one-sixth of the economy, is now moving from Beltway gasbags and caricaturists into the hands of consumers. Its fate will be determined by the countless anecdotes of people who will apply the law to their lives.
The early indications are that most Americans will be pleasantly surprised. Millions of people, shopping and comparing prices on the exchanges set up by the states, are likely to get far better coverage for the same -- or less -- money than they pay now. The law, as honest conservatives predicted, before they orphaned their own idea, is injecting competition into a market dominated by a few big names.
You won't hear this from the entrenched forces that have spent about $400 million denouncing the law on television ads, groups like the Karl Rove-backed Crossroads GPS. They have good reason to fear it: if Obamacare works, the game will be over for those who oppose the most significant change in American life in a generation's time. You also don't hear much from Mr. Obama himself; once again, he's a passive observer of his presidency.
But out among the states that are actively building the foundations of Obamacare, the law seems to be doing what it was supposed to do. In Washington State, nine companies have filed paperwork to offer policies in a region that has long been controlled by three big entities.
''The surprise is that, for many in the individual market, the premiums will be lower and the benefits so much richer,'' said Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington. ''Eventually, I can see the Affordable Care Act being embraced like Medicare, because once people get used to this kind of coverage, it's going to be a pretty abhorrent thing to try and take it away.''
In Oregon, brisk competition will mean real choice for consumers. Starting in October, a 40-year-old resident of Portland can choose between one insurer charging $169 a month or another asking $422 for the same plan. When these rates were first posted not long ago, some of the companies requested a do-over so they could submit lower rates. Yes, lower rates. So much for a government takeover.
In California, 13 companies will compete for the business of 5.3 million or so people expected to purchase insurance through the new exchanges. Officials say the average monthly premium will be $321 -- that is, $110 less than the national average predicted by the Congressional Budget Office.
All of the above are for individuals, shopping for their own health insurance as required by the new law. For the majority of Americans, those with employer coverage, Medicare or Medicaid, little will change except that insurers can no longer put a lifetime cap on benefits. The biggest change, the one likely to drive public perception, will be felt by people long denied care because of ''pre-existing conditions.'' Soon, they will pay the same insurance rates as healthy people, and get second chances at life.
As well, there's a bonus opportunity for those stuck in jobs they hate, holding on only because they need the health care, for a take-this-job-and-shove-it moment. Moderate-income families qualify for significant bargains, using the subsidies of Obamacare.
Of course, you can expect scare stories and Fox News alerts about higher premiums. These anecdotes will focus on young, healthy people with no coverage who will have to join the rest of the country in the insurance pool, or pay a fine. Some employers will also choose to pay the government rather than insure their own workers, but you won't find too many of those listed among the best places to work. And we've already seen claims of skyrocketing premiums under the new plan, but those have been widely debunked as fraudulent comparisons between the bottom-of-the-bin teaser rates of today and the substantial packages of coverage required in the new law.
It's a fascinating moment, akin to the dawn of Social Security or Medicare. Republicans in the last three years actually did the country a favor by wildly overstating the case against a middle-ground approach to getting the United States closer to universal health care. As in 1935 and in 1965, the ossified right is warning once again of an impending end to American life as we know it. Thankfully, they're right.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Big Five No Longer Adds Up

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
It was like clockwork. Someone writing in The New York Times would refer to the Big Five American orchestras: the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. And within hours, Peter Pastreich, the respected executive director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1978 to 1999, would beard The Times's overseer of classical music -- at the time, me -- by telephone or e-mail, complaining that the term Big Five had long since outlived whatever usefulness it may once have had.
The Times was by no means alone in using it. At least by the mid-1960s, soon after I had started to follow classical music, the term had become common coin in discussions of the American orchestral scene. And it proved remarkably persistent, even as the mighty handful started to suffer setbacks and other orchestras grew in budget and artistic stature, notably the St. Louis Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the San Francisco Symphony. 
Ernest Fleischmann, executive director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1969 to 1998, argued for recognition of a big six. And the San Francisco Symphony, celebrating its centennial in the 2011-12 season under Mr. Pastreich's successor, Brent Assink, found a creative way to imply the existence of a big seven if not proclaim it, presenting each of the Big Five and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in brief residencies at its home, Davies Symphony Hall.
Plausible notions both, though neither caught on. Yet it is true that while the idea of the Big Five may still exist in the public imagination, you no longer hear talk of it in the profession except from Big Five members, when, occasionally, they find it useful.
A century or so ago, when classical music thrived in a nation of immigrants, orchestras were a powerful force, flagship institutions that helped to put American cities on the cultural map. And the Big Five, when it coalesced, helped, with its cumulative weight, to put American orchestras firmly on the international map. No other country could boast of such a constellation.
But this landscape has changed greatly over the last half-century, much as the country's economic, demographic and cultural landscape has, and in many of the same ways. The economic fortunes of the flagship ensembles have changed with the fortunes of their cities.
''The notion of the Big Five just doesn't exist today,'' Thomas W. Morris, the chief executive and artistic director of Spring for Music, a festival of North American orchestras at Carnegie Hall, says in a video on the festival's Web site.
The idea of the Big Five was largely created and popularized by journalists, although the member executives started to hold their own meetings. The concept was certified, in a way, by 1969 and 1972 analyses commissioned by, er, the Big Five suggesting that perhaps only the Big Five would survive.
''There is a natural tendency in any field to want to identify and celebrate the best,'' said Jesse Rosen, president and chief executive of the League of American Orchestras, a service organization, whose annual conference opens Tuesday in St. Louis.
The problem is establishing criteria. In sports, the best can usually be identified by hard and fast quantities: timings, distances, scores, percentages. In music, as in other arts, the issue is quality, and that is not so easily determined or compared.
In fact, the criteria of membership in the Big Five, never firmly established, began with quantities. They included size of budget, number of recordings, amount of touring (especially stops in New York), presence on radio and television, and number of year-round musicians. Quality, it was more or less assumed, would follow the numbers, with more-prosperous orchestras able to attract better players, conductors and guest artists.
But those quantities were always squishy, and the balances shifted. The Cleveland Orchestra, for example, with the smallest budget by far, got its foot in the door of what some thought of as a Big Four Plus One mainly on the strength of its artistic achievement under George Szell, its music director from 1946 to 1970, before gaining full recognition.
Vague though it was, the notion of a Big Five carried real meaning and impact for a time. ''If you go far enough back, 30 to 40 years,'' said Gary Hanson, the Cleveland Orchestra's executive director, ''the defining element of success had a lot more to do with an institution's ability to compete for talent than anything else. In that competitive environment, there was a direct relationship between reputation and quality.''
The major orchestras competed for recording contracts, players, major conductors. Today, with recording contracts rare, more orchestras employing their players year-round and geographical mobility a way of life, the market is more diffuse. Climate and cost of living are as likely to figure in a musician's choice of employer as an orchestra's historic renown.
Mr. Hanson acknowledged that the Big Five orchestras benefit slightly from a ''residual reputational momentum.''
''But today,'' he added, ''the ability to maintain a viable orchestra and pursue greater quality depends almost entirely on philanthropy. It depends on the ability of the local community to fund its orchestra.''
Cleveland is a particularly difficult case, with so many corporations having fled the city. But with Franz Welser-Möst as music director, the Cleveland Orchestra has retained its lofty artistic profile while relying on major gifts and on residencies in Miami, Vienna and elsewhere.
In another stressed city, the Philadelphia Orchestra filed for bankruptcy in 2011. But it, too, seems to have weathered the storm in fine artistic fettle, thanks to the interim efforts of Charles Dutoit as principal conductor and Yannick Nézet-Séguin's arrival last year as music director.
Yet, in the words of Deborah Borda, executive director of the New York Philharmonic from 1991 to 1999 and now president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, ''the great western migration continues.'' She was referring to both geophysical and cultural trends.
Ms. Borda's orchestra -- first under Esa-Pekka Salonen as music director, and now under Gustavo Dudamel -- is flourishing as never before, artistically as well as financially. Its programming is easily the most adventurous of any major American orchestra. And the San Francisco Symphony continues to thrive under its longtime music director, Michael Tilson Thomas, notwithstanding the bump of a 17-day players' strike in March that wiped out a scheduled East Coast tour, including two concerts at Carnegie Hall.
Mr. Pastreich, the former San Francisco Symphony director, recently examined the budgets for the major American ensembles listed by the League of American Orchestras and found Los Angeles (with the Hollywood Bowl) at the top, followed by Boston (with the Boston Pops and Tanglewood), Chicago, San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia. Cleveland, which didn't report, is no doubt some lengths behind.
Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the Chicago Symphony, echoed Mr. Hanson of Cleveland in noting a shift in priorities toward local concerns.
''The personality of the Chicago Symphony is based on the personality of Chicago,'' she said. ''If we focus on how we rank rather than how we are doing in our own market, we won't succeed. We don't want to be fantastic in Tokyo and less than great in Chicago.''
Other orchestras, too, are trying to integrate themselves more deeply into the culture of their cities and develop new, younger audiences and new sources of financing.
''Success today is not limited to the quality of execution,'' said Mr. Rosen of the orchestra league. ''The things that represent quality today are much more varied, more democratic, more inclusive. Orchestras have to be more innovative, experimental and creative, more advanced in the ways they use technology.''
But in quality of execution, another leveling factor among American orchestras has been the astonishing degree of talent among young musicians who keep pouring out of conservatories. ''The general level of playing has never been higher,'' said Mr. Morris of Spring for Music.
As artistic director of that festival and the person who selects orchestras for Carnegie Hall appearances with an eye toward adventurous programming, Mr. Morris gets to hear a lot of them, and as a former general manager of the Boston Symphony and executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra, he knows what life used to be like at the top. He is quick to point out that with a heightened technical level and versatility has come a certain loss of character, style and individual point of view among orchestras.
It used to be that an experienced ear, listening blind to a recording or a radio broadcast, could quickly tell one ensemble from another: Szell's Cleveland Orchestra by its transparency, precision and sheer virtuosity; the Philadelphia Orchestra by its warmth, with a lush, enveloping string sound cultivated by Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy and mostly maintained by Riccardo Muti; the Chicago Symphony (Mr. Muti's new orchestra) by its power, with a machine-tooled brass core energized by Fritz Reiner and almost turned into caricature by Georg Solti; the Boston Symphony by a slightly febrile, penetrating quality suited to the French music it performed under Charles Munch and Pierre Monteux; Leonard Bernstein's New York Philharmonic by its attitude, with a rough and ready edge.
Alas, this loss has been international, with Russian brass players having lost their nasal swagger and German oboists no longer sounding like ducks. It is inevitable at a time when star conductors jet around the globe, often juggling multiple music directorships and imposing internationalist standards, and when players are more mobile geographically and upwardly.
Though no one would like to admit it, interchangeability -- again, at the highest of levels -- is in danger of becoming the norm. Then again, these may all seem fine points in view of the air of crisis that hangs over the whole American orchestral enterprise at the moment. Hardly a week goes by without a report of a pending bankruptcy, a threatened strike, a lockout, a cut in personnel or a slashing of budgets. Every orchestra, you could believe, is suffering, each in its own way.
Once again, Mr. Pastreich, formerly of San Francisco, takes issue with the way things are reported in the press.
''If I dropped in on the United States from Mars and heard, 'What a disaster!,' what would I see?'' he asked. ''Every little town has an orchestra. The Bay Area has dozens of them, some of very high quality. There are so many places with really dynamic stuff going on. The trouble does not reflect itself in the concert hall. This is an amazingly vibrant musical life.''
Granted. But financial problems are indeed widespread. And the death of, say, the Minnesota Orchestra, which has already lost a season to a lockout just as it seemed on the verge of drawing near the top of the Big Whatever, would be mourned far beyond Minneapolis.
So in this burbling stew of toil, trouble and occasional triumph, does the passing of the Big Five represent loss or gain?
Mark Volpe, the managing director of the Boston Symphony, said the designation was now irrelevant, even though it had yielded some benefits. ''It was not objectionable,'' he added, ''and it cut through the noise of the marketplace and got us attention. So in that sense it was positive.''
You wanted to think, too, that the concept of a Big Five retained a certain aspirational quality for other orchestras. But it is clear after half a century that all the aspiration in the world was not enough for others to break into its ranks, and their aspirations now rightly lie elsewhere.
Mr. Morris of Spring for Music spoke for many in the business when he said: ''The Big Five was kind of a false god. It's good that it doesn't exist anymore.''

HEADLINE: Watchdogs Without Any Bark

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FOR the last two weeks, a justice in New York State Supreme Court has heard testimony in one of the most pivotal cases of the financial crisis. The hearings will tell whether Bank of America can extinguish legal liability for more than a million Countrywide Financial loans by paying $8.5 billion in cash and agreeing to loan servicing improvements in a settlement struck with 22 investors in 2011.
But the case, being heard by Justice Barbara R. Kapnick, extends far beyond the impact of the settlement on Bank of America's balance sheet. It is also laying bare an industry practice that has put investors in mortgage securities at a disadvantage and reduced their financial recoveries in the aftermath of the home loan mania. 
The practice at issue involves trustee banks overseeing the vast and complex mortgage pools bought by pension funds, mutual funds and others. Trustees like Bank of New York Mellon were paid by investors to make sure that the servicers administering these mortgage deals, known as trusts, treated them properly. Trustees receive nominal fees -- less than a penny on each dollar of assets -- for the work.
But when mortgages soured, trustees declined to pursue available remedies for investors, such as pushing a servicer to buy back loans that did not meet quality standards promised when the securities were sold.
In other words, this case highlights a problem with trustees: they are a dog that could have barked but didn't.
Before mortgage securities were undone by troubled loans, trustee inaction was not an issue. Trustees collected their fees at minimal effort and investors were satisfied.
But because trustees are hired by the big banks that package and sell the securities, their allegiances are divided. Sure, investors are paying the fees, but if a trustee wants to be hired by sellers of securities in the future, being combative on problematic loan pools may be unwise.
Trustee practices are under the microscope in Justice Kapnick's courtroom because Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee overseeing all 530 Countrywide mortgage deals covered by the proposed $8.5 billion settlement. The trustee is supporting the deal between Bank of America and the 22 investors that include BlackRock, Pimco and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Losses by all investors in the securities are projected at $100 billion.
While lawyers for BlackRock and Pimco were negotiating this deal, other investors in the securities were not at the bargaining table. Nevertheless, they must abide by the settlement's terms.
Some outside investors, including the American International Group, have objected, saying $8.5 billion is inadequate given the mountain of problem loans it covers. Lawyers for A.I.G. contend that Bank of New York put its interests ahead of other investors outside the settlement process. Had the trustee been more aggressive with Bank of America, the servicer administering the troubled securities, investors would have received more money in a settlement, A.I.G.'s lawyers say.
Bank of New York Mellon argues that the settlement is reasonable and that it has always acted in the best interests of all investors.
But over the last two weeks, arguments and testimony have shed light on behind-the-scenes dealings during the settlement negotiations with Bank of America. Some of these details raise questions about the trustee's assertiveness on behalf of all investors.
A crucial issue: the trustee didn't request individual loan files from Bank of America to help determine how many mortgages had problems and, therefore, whether $8.5 billion was a reasonable recovery. A trustee has the right to request those files for investors who cannot get them on their own.
When loan files have been examined, recoveries have been far greater. Last year, for example, Deutsche Bank agreed to reimburse Assured Guaranty, a bond insurer, for 80 percent of losses on eight residential mortgage securities it had insured.
Asked about the basis for the $8.5 billion settlement, Kent Smith, a Pimco executive with experience in loan servicing, testified on June 7 that it came in part from an estimated percentage of problematic loans that was provided to the investors by Bank of America. But on cross-examination, he said the estimate was far lower than it would have been if Bank of New York Mellon had examined specific loan files.
The estimate, 36 percent, meant that just over one-third of the loans had violated underwriting representations and warranties made to investors. But a review of the loan files would have pushed the figure as high as 65 percent, he testified.
Additional testimony raised questions about fairness during the settlement talks. The 22 investors who struck the deal held at least 25 percent -- a required threshold for taking action -- in only 215 trusts, less than half the 530 covered by the settlement. No other investors had an advocate at the bargaining table. Asked who was representing investors outside the negotiating group, an in-house lawyer for Bank of New York Mellon said he did not know.
Then there's an e-mail from Jason H. P. Kravitt, Bank of New York Mellon's outside counsel, recounting how he told Bank of America that on one important point its and the trustee's ''self-interest'' were aligned -- neither wanted the Countrywide securities to go into default. If they did default, the trustee would have been forced to increase its oversight of Bank of America, adding to its costs. If the trustee did not sue the bank, investors could.
Referring to a default, Mr. Kravitt said he told a Bank of America lawyer, ''We don't want it either, Chris.''
Asked about these matters, Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York Mellon spokesman, said, ''We believe an $8.5 billion bird-in-the-hand settlement with significant servicing improvements is a far better result for all investors than the likely outcome following years of costly litigation.''
Trustees argue that they do not make enough money overseeing these loan pools to act on investors' behalf. But this could be resolved if the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed or encouraged trustees to use trust assets to pay for loan reviews or litigation.
Justice Kapnick's decision is not expected for months, and will affect only this settlement. But the revelations in her courtroom send a message to investors who might have expected trustees to protect their interests with more vigor.

HEADLINE: A Local Hero Accused

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
THE morning after a catastrophic earthquake leveled buildings and killed thousands of people in Haiti in 2010, an Internet marketing millionaire from St. George, Utah, named Jeremy Johnson decided to cancel all his business meetings and arrange his own ad hoc aid mission.
Mr. Johnson, 34 at the time, had never traveled to Haiti before. But his decision to stage a private airlift, using his own aircraft, did not surprise his friends and family. They were used to his impulsive acts of magnanimity.
Six feet tall, with unruly red hair and a toothy grin, Mr. Johnson was well-known around St. George for deploying his own helicopter to rescue hikers stranded in nearby canyons and for housing families fleeing from polygamous communities. One local resident who befriended Mr. Johnson when they were both Boy Scouts described him as ''one of the most Christ-like people I have ever come to know.'' 
In Haiti, Mr. Johnson piloted his own helicopter, flying infant formula to remote orphanages, evacuating injured children and delivering 110-pound bags of beans and rice to outskirts of Port-au-Prince, said another friend, Daniel Gardner, who joined him on the mission. On the last day of the 12-day trip, Mr. Johnson gave away personal possessions -- a baseball cap, his iPod -- down to the hiking boots he had been wearing, Mr. Gardner recalled. Mr. Johnson flew home with his feet clad only in striped Paul Smith socks.
''When I think of Jeremy Johnson, I think of the most generous person I ever met,'' said Mr. Gardner, an assistant loan officer in Provo, Utah. ''Whatever he had, he would give and give and give.''
But what Mr. Johnson had to give -- and it was quite a bit -- may have come from consumers who got taken. The Federal Trade Commission says Mr. Johnson was ''the mastermind'' behind one of the largest and most intricate online marketing frauds ever perpetrated in the United States.
Mr. Johnson founded and ran a company called I Works, which, the agency says, marketed programs to help people get government grants for personal needs and earn easy money. According to a civil complaint filed by the F.T.C., the company lured consumers with online pitches for free or ''risk-free'' CD-ROMs that required only a nominal shipping fee and then charged their credit cards for recurring online memberships they were unaware of and had not consented to.
Over five years, Mr. Johnson, along with I Works, company executives and related corporations, supposedly swindled ''unwitting consumers'' out of more than $275 million, the complaint said. The company also discouraged dissatisfied customers from seeking refunds from their credit card companies, the complaint said, by threatening to report those customers to a company-operated consumer blacklist called BadCustomer.com.
All the while, proceeds from the enterprise were used to finance Mr. Johnson's ''lavish lifestyles'' of helicopters and houseboats, classic cars and poker at a Las Vegas casino, according to a receiver's report to the court on Mr. Johnson's assets. Some details in the case file read as if they came from an Old West novel: according to testimony from a witness, Mr. Johnson supposedly amassed bundles of cash and buried caches of gold.
''This is the anatomy of a really interesting fraud done by a clever guy at the expense of the most vulnerable people,'' asserted David C. Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who worked on the case in his previous job as director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Mr. Johnson has repeatedly and vehemently denied any wrongdoing; a court filing by his defense team describes the F.T.C.'s argument as ''filled with half-truths, distortions and inflammatory rhetoric that is not supported by the evidence.'' The purpose of BadCustomer.com, for instance, was simply to steer people to his customer service centers, he said in a court filing.
In addition to the F.T.C.'s civil case, taking place in the United States District Court of Nevada, he is now facing 86 related criminal charges -- including conspiracy, money laundering and bank fraud -- brought by the United States attorney in Utah. Mr. Johnson has denied those charges, too.
''We did not commit any fraud whatsoever,'' he wrote in an e-mail to an F.T.C. lawyer in 2011.
Over the last 19 months, in an attempt to clear his name, Mr. Johnson has mounted a campaign that accuses federal agents of misdeeds, including interfering with his right to a fair and speedy trial. Because of his jeremiads, federal prosecutors asked a judge in federal court in Salt Lake to prohibit him from further public commentary. In May, the judge imposed the order on Mr. Johnson, along with others in the criminal case including defendants, defense lawyers and prosecutors, prohibiting them from making public statements about the case.
Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Utah, said federal prosecutors could not comment on the criminal case because of the order. Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the F.T.C., declined to comment on its case ''given the posture of the litigation.'' But in hundreds of court filings, federal regulators paint a portrait of I Works as an enterprise that went to great lengths to lure online users even as consumer dissatisfaction mounted. Rather than modify their business practices, an F.T.C. court filing says, ''defendants adopted strategies that allowed their fraud machine to continue reaping millions of dollars from unsuspecting customers.''
Ronald J. Yengich, Mr. Johnson's criminal defense lawyer, declined to comment, citing the judge's order. That leaves Mr. Johnson's friends and family members to plead his case with the public. Mr. Gardner, for one, says he doesn't recognize the portrayal of his friend that he reads about in the papers.
''I want you to know him the way I know him,'' Mr. Gardner said when I called him recently to ask about the Haiti trip. ''He doesn't have an ounce of selfishness in his body.''
Where friends see a hero, however, consumer advocates like Professor Vladeck, the former F.T.C. official, see a swindler.
''I can't decide if he was completely venal or completely clueless,'' said Professor Vladeck, a lawyer who has argued First Amendment and civil rights cases before the Supreme Court. ''Either he is a great actor or he thought all of this was just fine.''
A Gifted Proselytizer
In the early 1850s, Jeremy Johnson's great-great-grandfather, a sawmill operator named Joel Hills Johnson, helped settle the desolate territory of southern Utah, a landscape of dramatic red sandstone canyons and mesas. Johnson descendants have lived in the area ever since.
When Mr. Johnson was growing up in St. George, about a two-hour drive from Las Vegas, the town had fewer than 30,000 residents. While the population has since more than doubled, the place retains a small-town intimacy. During my visit there in April, everyone I met seemed to have some connection to -- or at least an opinion about -- Mr. Johnson. Even a barista at a local espresso joint told me that his mother was a friend of Mr. Johnson and that they had attended parties at the Johnsons' home.
Andy Johnson, one of Mr. Johnson's three younger siblings, still lives in the area, and invited me over.
He didn't talk about the lawsuits -- he worked for his brother at I Works and is one of the defendants in the civil case -- but he was happy to tell stories about their childhood. He recalled the time the brothers were horsing around at home, sliding down the stairs in a cardboard refrigerator box. When a baby sitter came over, Andy Johnson says, his older brother tossed his shoes into the farthest end of the box and then sniffled that he couldn't reach them.
''He whipped up some tears and told her 'my shoes are in the box,' '' Andy Johnson recalled. When the baby sitter crawled in to retrieve the shoes, the brothers gave the box a gentle push downstairs. ''I think that was the end of the baby sitter.''
Jeremy was also the kind of child who would set up a lemonade stand only to give away the proceeds, family members say. The Johnsons are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their faith emphasizes service. Yet Jeremy's drive to give to others always seemed singular, his brother said.''He doesn't care what it looks like to other people,'' Andy Johnson said. ''He just tries to do the right thing.''
Mr. Johnson credits the two years he spent as a Mormon missionary in Independence, Mo., with giving him a hands-on education in marketing; being a missionary allowed him to meet and talk to all kinds of people, says his cousin Nathan Ruben.
By all accounts, Mr. Johnson was a gifted proselytizer. He started his first online venture in 1999, when he was just 23. The company was a penny-stock recommendation site called RumorSearch.com. Subscribers who paid to join would post rumors about companies on the site. Then the site's researchers, one of whom was Andy Johnson, would check the validity of those rumors and follow up with their findings.
RumorSearch attracted several thousand members. It also led to a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency contended that the site had misleadingly promoted a stock and failed to disclose that Mr. Johnson had received thousands of that company's shares in compensation -- and had sold them at a profit of $315,848. In 2002, Mr. Johnson settled the charges without admitting or denying them.
By then, Mr. Johnson had closed RumorSearch and started I Works, another enterprise with an online membership model. Apparently, he developed the idea of marketing a digital clearinghouse for grants while watching a TV pitch for grant books.
''He saw one of those infomercials where this guy was selling catalogs of government grants for $99,'' recalled Paul Ruben, an uncle of Mr. Johnson and a software engineer in Murray, Utah. ''He said: 'That's the crummiest delivery system I can think of. I can do a lot better with a subscription base and people could sign up and cancel when they didn't need it anymore.' ''
I Works made Mr. Johnson a wealthy man. According to a report prepared by the receiver in the civil case, I Works generated more than $50 million in profits that benefited Mr. Johnson or was transferred to his affiliates. The report said he spent the money on, among other things, a 22,000-square-foot home in a gated community in a St. George suburb; an office building downtown called Tabernacle Towers; a car lot; houses and land in various parts in Utah; a house in Santa Monica, Calif.; land near Idaho Falls, Idaho; two houseboats; a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and other cars; gold bars and coins; and silver coins and palladium bars. He also lost about $1.3 million at a Las Vegas casino and donated $1.5 million to a local church ward, according to the report.
Now the F.T.C.'s allegations of fraud have some Utahans wondering whether Mr. Johnson financed his endeavors with ill-gotten gains.
''He did a lot of good out of the country. So you don't know,'' John Miller, a retiree in St. George, told me one Sunday morning as he was filling up his car at a local gas station. ''If he's guilty of what he is accused of, he's a crook.''
'I Felt I Had Been Scammed'
In late 2008, Nicky Miller went looking for a way to open a center for children with disabilities. She had recently lost her job as a pharmacy technician but, before that, she worked for years as a special-education teacher and administrator. She wanted to put that training to use. She just needed financing.
Ms. Miller said she landed on a Web site that featured a photograph of President Obama and offered a free CD-ROM with information on how to find and apply for federal grants. She also said she saw testimonials on the site from consumers enthusing over the grant money they had received. It seemed legitimate to her. After all, Congress had passed a stimulus package that year to buttress the economy.
All she would have to pay, she thought, was $2.29 for shipping and handling.
A few days after signing up, Ms. Miller received a disk in the mail titled ''Your Federal and Private Grant CD,'' a program marketed by I Works. She looked at the information on the disk but, she says, it was too general to be of use to her.
''It was a waste of time,'' Ms. Miller, who lives in Minden, Nev., told me recently. She didn't think about it again until a few months later, when she checked her bank account statements and noticed debits of $221.52 from entities with names like Grant Search, Center 4 Grants and Business Fund.
She was unemployed at the time and had been watching her spending carefully. Those unexpected charges wiped out her funds, she said, and piled on $245 in bank overdraft fees.
''I was shocked,'' Ms. Miller said in a declaration submitted as evidence in the civil case by the F.T.C.
She called Center 4 Grants and learned from a customer service representative that when she ordered the CD, she had been enrolled in different online membership programs -- one for $39.95 a month, another for $12.95 a month. The memberships came with free trial periods, which typically allowed people to cancel within a week or two without incurring charges. But Ms. Miller said she did not recall seeing disclosures about memberships when she ordered the disk. Eventually, a call center representative canceled the memberships for her and issued a partial refund.
''I felt I had been scammed,'' Ms. Miller, 60, told me.
Other consumers who gave declarations to the F.T.C. received order confirmations for I Works grant CDs that mentioned memberships.
Many companies -- like wireless carriers or streaming video services -- use similar continuity plans, in which charges recur until a consumer cancels. It's a standard practice called ''negative option'' or ''advanced consent'' marketing. Bundling additional products with an order, a practice called ''forced upsells,'' is also a standard marketing practice. Both practices are perfectly legal if the marketing is truthful, the disclosures are adequate and the consumer consents.
In Mr. Johnson's case, federal regulators contend that I Works-affiliated sites often displayed the disclosures in small print -- and sometimes failed to disclose them at all.
''The scam, operated by 10 individuals through 61 companies,'' an F.T.C. memorandum to the Nevada court says, ''has tricked consumers into providing their credit and debit card information and has repeatedly billed these consumers for Internet-based memberships they never agreed to join.'' At its height, ''the scheme was ensnaring 15,000 consumers per day,'' the document says.
The complaint also contends that promotional testimonials from satisfied customers were false. Mr. Johnson, court filings say, had created his own grant program. Called Grant-A-Day, it gave money to individuals for things like utility bills or college textbooks. The testimonials on the sites, court filings say, came from people who received money through this program, not from government grants. (Court filings for the defense don't deny that assertion, but contend that the testimonials were nonetheless authentic and came with disclaimers like ''results may vary.'')
Mr. Johnson, who has denied any wrongdoing, wrote in an e-mail to the agency in 2011 that he had attended an F.T.C. workshop in Washington in 2007 on how to comply with marketing regulations for programs with recurring fees and that his Web sites had displayed clear disclosures.
''I attended your conference on negative options. We hired attorneys to review our Web sites to insure they were compliant,'' Mr. Johnson wrote in the e-mail. ''We never, at any time, used a false testimonial, and we did not ever develop a Web site without all the terms and conditions of the offer clearly disclosed.''
Karra J. Porter, a lawyer in Salt Lake City who represents I Works, Mr. Johnson's wife and parents, and 24 other companies named as defendants in the case (though not Mr. Johnson), said the disclosures were prominent enough that, out of some 10 million membership enrollments, I Works' customers canceled about three million during the free trial period.
Mr. Johnson's family members and friends say his private philanthropy, like the Grant-A-Day program, is powerful testimony to his good intentions. When business was flush, they say, he even liked to give out $100 bills to needy strangers shopping at the local Walmart during the Christmas season.
But Mr. Johnson's accusers do not see a contradiction between his charitable acts and their allegations that he defrauded consumers. They see a connection.
''There is a Robin Hood aspect to Jeremy's behavior,'' said Professor Vladeck, the former F.T.C. official -- the difference being that Mr. Johnson, he asserted, defrauded needy consumers to give to the needy.
'Roads Led Back to St. George'
In late December 2010, Mr. Johnson flew emergency supplies to people stranded by floods in southern Utah. A few days later, the F.T.C. filed its suit against him.
''Flooding Hero Sued by F.T.C. in Alleged Internet Scam,'' a headline in The Salt Lake Tribune read. That same week, the Deseret News newspaper, despite acknowledging the lawsuit, placed Mr. Johnson atop its list of people who ''made a difference'' that year and symbolized ''the greatness Utah has to offer.''
It was as if there was no reconciling the local hero with the man charged with running what the F.T.C. described in a court filing as a ''well-oiled fraud machine.''
Mr. Johnson founded I Works in 2000. But it wasn't until 2009 that federal regulators began looking into the company in earnest. That year, Visa noticed a growing number of cardholders seeking to reverse charges -- a procedure called a chargeback -- for certain online membership programs.
If customers reverse 1 percent or more of a merchant's charges, the banks that process its credit and debit card transactions may terminate the company's accounts and place it in a terminated-merchant file -- a blacklist that reduces the company's ability to obtain new merchant accounts. That is what befell a number of I Works entities.
But federal regulators did not immediately connect the various high chargeback rates to I Works itself because the company was operating under so many different names and programs: Easy Grant Finder, Bottom Dollar, Business Funding Success, Fast Gov Grants and many more, according to court filings.
''At the time we started, we did not know that all roads led back to St. George,'' said Professor Vladeck, the former F.T.C. official.
The F.T.C.'s pursuit of Mr. Johnson is part of a larger law-enforcement crusade to rid online marketing of malefactors. Over the last few years, the agency has shut down a number of online operators who marketed free trials and then charged sizable recurring fees.
Last year, Central Coast Nutraceuticals, a company that used free trials and negative options to market acai berry supplements and ''colon cleansers,'' settled F.T.C. charges that it had defrauded consumers out of $80 million. Federal regulators also won a $359 million judgment against an online marketer in Canada who, the agency said, lured consumers in the United States and four other countries with offers of ''free trials'' for weight-loss pills, teeth whiteners, information about government grants and a work-at-home program.
But Professor Vladeck says Mr. Johnson led a vastly more complex enterprise; a receiver's report to the court describes it as a ''spider web of entities.'' In the civil suit, the F.T.C. contended that Mr. Johnson and associates incorporated more than 50 shell companies -- using mail-drop addresses and straw owners -- to trick merchant banks into setting up new merchant accounts.
Mr. Johnson has denied this. He has told family members that I Works opened new companies and merchant accounts to root out fraud among several hundred marketing Web sites that I Works regularly used to steer customers to its own product sites.
''By creating different entities, they would be able to identify more easily who was committing fraud against them,'' said Ms. Porter, the lawyer for I Works. ''This is a recognized method of combating fraud.''
Industry experts say it would make more sense for online marketers to scrupulously vet affiliated Web sites before letting them promote their products, so they wouldn't need to set up new merchant accounts after the fact to look for affiliate fraud.
''You shouldn't have to do that,'' said John Engler, the vice president for sales at LiveIntent, a company that delivers ads in e-mail. ''You should run a better business.'' Mr. Engler, a 15-year veteran of online marketing, said he was speaking generally about industry practices, and not about any particular company. (I Works had a compliance department that vetted affiliated Web sites.)
Soon after the F.T.C. filed its suit, Mr. Johnson closed I Works. A couple of months later, agency lawyers persuaded a judge in the case to grant a preliminary injunction, effectively shuttering I Works, and to appoint a court-supervised receiver to take charge of the assets so that money would be available for refunds to consumers should the F.T.C. prove its charges. The court also prohibited Mr. Johnson from marketing grant programs, among other things, pending the case's outcome.
That was the moment when Mr. Johnson's supporters say they became convinced that federal officials were out to railroad him. By depriving him of his money, the F.T.C. had stripped him of his ability to pay for a lawyer to defend himself against the government's allegations, Mr. Johnson wrote in a court filing in May. Although he has a court-appointed lawyer in the criminal case, he is now representing himself in the civil case.
F.T.C. lawyers, however, have contended in court filings that Mr. Johnson still has access to substantial finances because he transferred assets, like ownership of his home as well as $1 million in silver bars and coins, to family members and associates. For that reason, the F.T.C. in January named Mr. Johnson's parents and his wife, Sharla, as relief defendants in the civil case. They are ''not charged with participating in the I Works scheme,'' the agency said, ''but allegedly received ill-gotten gains from it that the F.T.C. seeks to recover.''
The receiver, a company called Robb Evans & Associates, based in Los Angeles, says I Works has proved to be one of the most complicated asset-tracing cases it has ever tackled. In addition to benefiting from the more than $50 million in profits from I Works, the receiver contended in a report, Mr. Johnson routed about $51 million in additional funds to other companies or individuals.
''A significant amount of money was filtered through a number of entities in an apparent attempt to conceal assets,'' Brick Kane, the president of Robb Evans, told me. The receiver's pursuit of the assets is an expensive endeavor: it has charged $3.9 million in fees and expenses through the end of last year that comes out of the I Works receivership. ''We are still tracing,'' Mr. Kane says. ''There are still unanswered questions in this case.''
Ms. Porter, the lawyer for I Works, said that there was nothing untoward -- or even unusual -- about the company moving assets through holding companies and other entities.
''The funds that were used to pay for services or gifts that were given to his parents years before the F.T.C. alleges any wrongdoing,'' she says. ''What is the basis for seizing that?''
Recently, however, a judge in the civil case denied a motion from a former business associate who had asked to separate money in which his businesses claim an interest from the receivership; the judge said the money properly belonged to the receivership.
Fighting Back, Undaunted
Mr. Johnson still lives with his wife and their two daughters in their Tuscan-style manor with an outdoor pool and pond in a suburb of St. George. Well-fed orange tabby cats strut about the grounds like royal peacocks, as if they owned the place.
Mr. Johnson has not been making his mortgage payments, and there is a lien on the house. Friends and family members, including Mr. Ruben, his uncle, put up about $2.8 million of their own property as a bond to secure his release from jail after he was arrested in the summer of 2011 on one count of mail fraud.
While his living situation seems precarious and his legal troubles unlikely to go away soon, Mr. Johnson has been anything but resigned. He has been tweaking his accusers with a high-profile campaign to clear his name.
It began with an e-mail sent at the end of 2011 to various federal officials, more than a dozen United States senators and a handful of journalists. The e-mail came from an official-sounding account: ftcdocuments@gmail.com But Mr. Johnson had registered the address. And he had an announcement.
Rather than sign a settlement agreement being proposed by the F.T.C., he wrote, he and other defendants were preparing to publicly accuse federal agents of serious misconduct. They had even set up a Web site for this purpose. They called it EvilFTC.com.
''We will no longer remain silent and let you mislead the media with your lies and deceit,'' Mr. Johnson wrote in the e-mail included in court filings. ''We are compiling documentation to prove that we are innocent of your allegations.''
By then the site, along with an accompanying Twitter feed of the same name, had gone live. Mr. Johnson used the power of free speech and the ease of the Internet to try to reposition himself as a victim of a government conspiracy rather than a businessman accused of deceptive marketing.
The site came with a tagline: ''Dirty Deeds by Big Government.'' In addition to rebutting the F.T.C.'s allegations, it leveled accusations of its own. The site contended, for instance, that the leading F.T.C. lawyer in the case had improperly called Mr. Johnson while he was in jail, interfering with his right to due process. (Professor Vladeck said the ''F.T.C. had no choice but to contact Jeremy directly'' because the agency believed Mr. Johnson was acting at that time as his own lawyer in the civil case.)
When F.T.C. lawyers investigated, they discovered that Mr. Johnson, along with his brother Andy Johnson and others, had registered at least 30 domain names -- including FTCscam.com and FTCCorruption.com. Calling Jeremy Johnson's activities ''shenanigans'' and ''harassment'' (and his opinions ''meritless and scandalous''), government lawyers filed an emergency motion, asking a judge to shut down the sites.
Judge Roger L. Hunt of the Federal District Court denied the F.T.C.'s motion in the main, ruling that Mr. Johnson could continue to express his opinion as long as the sites did not misrepresent themselves as government entities. Mr. Johnson has since toned down EvilFTC.com.
Mr. Johnson had won the first skirmish in his campaign against the government, but the judge did admonish him not to go too far. Referring to a site that Mr. Johnson had set up to criticize the receiver, which he called ''RobbEvansfraud.com,'' Judge Hunt said, ''You need to understand, sir, you are accused in this case of using the Internet to deceive people.''
The judge added: ''When you use this procedure, process of multiple Web sites, which, in the court's view, deceive or intended to misrepresent or deceive or mischaracterize the court, its appointed receiver or a governmental agency, it's going to be difficult for you to convince me that you do not use the Internet to deceive at the time of trial.''
But the judge's warning did not seem to daunt Mr. Johnson's campaign. In January, a video appeared on YouTube accusing federal prosecutors in the criminal case of threatening Mr. Johnson and his family with the aim of pressuring him to accept a plea deal. (Prosecutors have publicly denied the accusations.)
''Jeremy felt it was better to get the truth out than to sit and be quiet, which is not his nature,'' said Mr. Ruben, his uncle.
Lumberjacking, for Now
The government seems determined, too. Federal prosecutors have asked Judge Miranda Du of district court in Las Vegas to stop almost all discovery in the civil case. If she decides in the government's favor, the civil suit would effectively be put on hold while federal prosecutors pursued the criminal charges. Banned from marketing grant programs while the cases proceed, Mr. Johnson recently bought a portable sawmill on eBay and is lumberjacking in forests near where his great-great-grandfather had a sawmill. But he has not disappeared into the woods.
Where many other online marketers who sold similar products using similar techniques eventually agreed to settle F.T.C. charges of deceptive practices, Mr. Johnson continues to proclaim his innocence.
''Imagine for a moment the possibility that I have done no wrong,'' he recently wrote in a report prepared for a police detective in Salt Lake City. In that event, he said, government officials would be to blame for ruining his business, seizing and selling his worldly goods, putting him in jail and, perhaps most significant to a marketer for whom believability is everything, diminishing his reputation ''from one that was known for good to that of a mastermind of a $300 million fraud.''
The canyon lands of Utah seem to breed legendary characters who write their own rules. One of them, born in 1866 and called Robert LeRoy Parker, later took the name Butch Cassidy.
''The leader of the Wild Bunch was a friendly, gay, reckless and coolly daring young man whom everyone liked, even the sheriffs who chased him,'' Wallace Stegner wrote of the outlaw in his book ''Mormon Country'' in 1942. ''He thumbed his nose at pursuing posses.''
The government's account of Jeremy Johnson follows a similar narrative, albeit updated for the online era, wherein a congenial schemer and his loyal crew, operating on the wild frontier of e-commerce, manage for a time to elude the Internet sheriffs.
''I would hate to think there is someone bigger than Jeremy out there that we missed,'' said Professor Vladeck, the former F.T.C. official. ''In this field, Jeremy is a whale.''

BYLINE: By PAMELA PAUL

 BODY:
New York is an overwhelming city to visit with children -- crowded, loud, expensive and larded with a seemingly infinite number of landmarks and showstoppers that your children simply must experience.
If it's any consolation, even people raising children in New York are daunted; at any given moment another family is certainly doing something more enriching and entertaining than yours. But from experience comes wisdom, and local parents have learned how to take advantage of New York in manageable portions.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art as one of five things to do on a Saturday? Not unless you feel like losing sight of your 4-year-old. Try something smaller or skip it. Need a roomy bathroom in Midtown? Department stores present an all-too-rare opportunity. What follows is carefully culled advice from New Yorkers on how to cover the city right, whether your brood includes a toddler or a teenager.
Lesson Plan 
No one can expect children to spend a week traipsing through museums, but some of New York's boutique institutions are of special interest to young people. The Tenement Museum (103 Orchard Street near Delancey Street; tenement.org) on the Lower East Side offers a riveting glimpse into urban family life. Guided tours reveal the daily routines of generations of Irish, Jewish and Italian immigrants who made their mark then quickly moved up and out. Pick up a copy of ''All-of-a-Kind Family''or a vintage toy in the museum shop, one of the city's best.
MoMA (11 West 53rd Street; moma.org) does an excellent job making modern and contemporary art accessible to children as young as 4. On weekend mornings, guided tours are divided into age-appropriate groups in which children can observe a number of works and draw; later they gain free admittance to the entire museum. The cafeteria is both grown-up and child-friendly, and there's an art laboratory with hands-on activities and even an audio guide for young people.
Ideal for balmier days, the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum (Pier 86, 12th Avenue at 46th Street; intrepidmuseum.org) has expanded its exhibits and family programs since I spent chilly, bored afternoons there as a child in the '80s. The most significant is the Space Shuttle Pavilion, which is scheduled to reopen in July, showcasing the Enterprise, NASA's first space shuttle, which arrived last year. The U.S.S. Intrepid, a World War II-era aircraft carrier, is worthwhile in itself. While the complex suffered damage during Hurricane Sandy, most of its facilities are once again shipshape. Families may want to consider Operation Slumber, which allows for overnight visits with special activities for children 6 and older.
The New York Transit Museum (Boerum Place and Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn; mta.info/mta/museum) is a favorite with train-obsessed grown-ups and children alike. The permanent exhibits include old turnstiles and vintage subway cars.
An entire book could be devoted to kid-literary New York, but highlights include the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, a standard photo-op; Grand Central Terminal for the finale of ''The Cricket in Times Square''; the genteel neighborhood of Yorkville, specifically East 88th Street, for the ''Lyle, Lyle Crocodile'' books, and the same neighborhood for ''Harriet the Spy.'' Also, the Plaza hotel for ''Eloise'' and the Met for fans of ''From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler'' (a downloadable guide is available online).
Snack Time
Chicken nuggets and chain restaurants can be found anywhere. For fresher food, head to the Union Square Greenmarket, a mecca for top restaurateurs (open Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; grownyc.org/unionsquaregreenmarket). You may get a green or two into your child's mouth, or at least a wild strawberry. There are ample samples of jam and maple sugar candy.
If you're not up for the interminable wait for a table at Serendipity 3, try Alice's Tea Cup (three locations; alicesteacup.com), where children can get a sprinkle of fairy dust before their Alice's s'mores (''served melted and messy'') and admire murals of Lewis Carroll-inspired images. The astonishingly moist scones are not to be missed, and there are healthful salads and sandwiches as well (try the Lapsang souchong smoked chicken).
For more sweets, head to Economy Candy (108 Rivington Street near Ludlow Street; economycandy.com), an overstuffed emporium of candies both oldfangled (Astro Pops, Sugar Daddy) and new (gummies galore).
Recess
Once the children are hopped up on sugar, they'll need to burn off the energy. Try the Children's Museum of the Arts (103 Charlton Street near Hudson Street; cmany.org). All the artwork is made by children, and visitors can make their own (bonus: you don't have to clean up). An area for younger children includes sand, Play-Doh and guided music activities. Children go berserk for the Ball Pond, a closed-in area of oversize balls. Is it experiential art? An installation? Children need not bother with such imponderables.
For those more in need of a gambol, New York has hundreds of playgrounds, with 21 in Central Park alone. Some of the best truly shine in summer, when the sprinklers are turned on. Heckscher, Central Park's oldest playground, just off Central Park South, is hard to beat with its rivers of water and sprinklers separated into areas for older and younger children. Behind the playground are massive glacial rocks that bolder children like to climb on and slide down. (It's also within striking distance of the manageable Central Park Zoo, with its fanciful musical clock and accessible feeding zoo.)
Adventure Playground at 67th Street in Central Park also offers excellent water play, as does the Arthur Ross Terrace, a free outdoor water fountain park on the north side of the American Museum of Natural History. The gentle play is especially good for toddlers and very small children. On the East Side, Ancient Playground, just north of the Metropolitan Museum of Art near 85th Street, includes pyramid structures for climbing.
Downtown, Teardrop Park in Battery Park City is a haven of walkways, playgrounds and Hudson River views, with one of the grandest slides in the city. Nelson A. Rockefeller Park near Chambers Street includes a wading pool.
Adults and children of all ages (with smaller children in strollers) may enjoy taking the pedestrian walkway over the Brooklyn Bridge, one of New York's great pleasures. Once in Brooklyn, Jane's Carousel (janescarousel.com), a gorgeously restored 1922 ride in Brooklyn Bridge Park, gives children a spin while offering parents a spectacular view of the Manhattan skyline. Dumbo, one of Brooklyn's newly glitzy neighborhoods, has a number of boutiques for local loft babies, as well as Jacques Torres Chocolate (66 Water Street near Main Street, mrchocolate.com), where children can gawp at the factory within.
CHEAT SHEET
Where to Set Up Base
Midtown is close to everything but is crowded and expensive. The West Village is picturesque and more manageable. The Upper West Side is a kiddie haven. Union Square has its Greenmarket and subways to points in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
How to Feed Picky Eaters
Delis and diners are two key operative terms. Delis will make everything from an egg-and-cheese sandwich to tuna melts, and many offer huge hot-plate selections. Diners have immense menus that include pasta and sandwich basics. And there's always the New York pizzeria, where a typical $2.50 slice is enough to fill a 5-year-old.
Where to Go for a Pit Stop
The New York Public Library (Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street) is a welcome refuge, with exhibits centered on children's literature and illustration, and a large children's library with reading room.
Where to Find a Potty
The city's dirty secret is that beyond the parks, there are few public bathrooms. Try Starbucks or dash into a restaurant looking sheepish; having a desperate child on hand usually expedites matters. A few chain stores have bathrooms, as do nail salons and public libraries.
Which Must-Sees to Miss
Dylan's Candy Bar, which draws hordes of sugar-mad tweens, can be skipped. So can the Children's Museum of Manhattan, which is small compared to similar museums elsewhere. And sadly the glorious Neue Galerie does not admit children under 12.
Where to Take a Field Trip
Coney Island hosts the eccentric and colorful Mermaid Parade on June 22, with revelers in shimmery scales and oversized tails. Afterward, young children can ride the low-scare Mermaid Parade ride at Luna Park (lunaparknyc.com). In the fall, the Medieval Festival at Fort Tryon Park (whidc.org/home.html) is a great excuse to explore the Cloisters, the medieval branch of the Met, with the added bonus of princesses and knights. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Sakura Matsuri Festival, a weekend-long celebration of cherry blossoms in the spring, is a local favorite.
Taking the Kids is a new column in which writers who live in a major city provide an insider's guide for traveling there with children.

HEADLINE: North Korea Proposes Talks On Security With the U.S.

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Sunday proposed high-level talks with the United States, saying that it was ready to discuss easing tensions and eventually denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
The North's proposal indicated that it was shifting to dialogue after months of bellicose language, including threats to launch nuclear strikes at the United States and South Korea, that have raised tensions to the highest in years. North Korea had also proposed dialogue with South Korea this month, though their initial agreement to hold high-level dialogue in Seoul collapsed last week over a difference over the level of their chief delegates.
We ''propose high-level talks between the North Korean and U.S. governments to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and establish regional peace and security,'' a spokesman of the National Defense Commission, the North's top governing agency, said in an ''important statement'' carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. 
The spokesman said North Korea and the United States could meet ''any time and at any place the United States wants.''
He said North Korea reaffirmed that ''the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was an unchanged will and resolution of our military and the people.'' To stress the credibility of that statement, the spokesman attributed it to the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, and his son Kim Jong-il, who led North Korea until he died in 2011. He was succeeded by his son Kim Jong-un.
North Korea has issued a similar statement in the past. However, in recent months, it had taken a confrontational approach as it protested United Nations sanctions imposed after its rocket launching in December and its nuclear test in February. In those statements, it appeared to have hardened its position, saying that it would never join any talks designed to end its nuclear weapons programs.
The North Korea also made it clear on Sunday that the denuclearization of the peninsula must include the removal of all American nuclear threats in the region. It was in essence reiterating its longstanding position that it would discuss dismantling its nuclear weapons programs with the United States, but only as part of broader nuclear arms reduction talks in the region.
''Whether anyone accepts our proud status as a nuclear power, we will hold fast to it until the denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula is realized and the nuclear threats from the outside is completely terminated,'' the North Korean spokesman said.
Washington, however, has demanded that before direct talks, North Korea must first take concrete steps to show its sincerity in giving up its nuclear weapons.
On Sunday, the North said the United States should stop raising ''preconditions'' for dialogue if it was serious in easing tensions and ''safeguarding the peace and security of the region, including the mainland United States.''
The North also reiterated that it wants to negotiate a treaty to replace the 1953 Korean War armistice and formally end the war.
In their last senior-level talks, the United States and North Korea reached the so-called ''leap day'' agreement on Feb. 29, 2012, in which Washington promised 240,000 tons of food aid and North Korea agreed to place a moratorium on uranium enrichment and nuclear and missile tests. But the agreement quickly collapsed when North Korea launched a long-range rocket in April 2012 and the United States, seeing the launching as a provocative test of missile technology, scrapped the food aid and led efforts at the United Nations to tighten sanctions against the North.
Under its new leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea has declared that it would focus on rebuilding its moribund economy and improving the living standards of its long-suffering people. It said its nuclear weapons allowed it to re-direct some of the national resources developed to the military to the economic front. But it also emphasized that it would continue to expand its nuclear weapons arsenal as a deterrent.
The North successfully launched a satellite into orbit on a three-stage rocket last December. The United States believes that the launching was part of North Korea's efforts to build intercontinental ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear warheads, although American intelligence agencies differ over how close the North is to mastering that technology.

HEADLINE: Redesign for Living

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Vishaan Chakrabarti, 47, has been a force in New York real estate for decades, working as director of the Manhattan office for the Department of City Planning and later as a senior executive at the Related Companies. Now he is the Marc Holliday associate professor of real estate development and the director of CURE, the Center for Urban Real Estate, at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. He is also a partner at SHoP Architects, and recently published his first book, ''A Country of Cities: A Manifesto for an Urban America.'' Despite his many hats, Mr. Chakrabarti finds time on Sundays to work with his wife, Maria Alataris, also an architect, on renovations for their home near Union Square and to relax with their 5-year-old daughter, Avia, and 11-year-old son, Evan. The family lives on the top floor of a co-op on West 17th Street and was recently joined by a Havanese puppy, Hero.
RECHARGING The weekends are usually divided between time with my family and time to recharge my batteries. I get up before 6, so it is very peaceful and quiet in the house, and that is the time I write. 
CAFFEINE I also drink this Laughing Man coffee, which I love. I make it in my French press, so it is very strong. I'm also really excited about the new puppy. Our son has allergies, and this dog is hypoallergenic. He likes to sit next to me while I write.
FAMILY BREAKFAST At around 7:30, the rest of the family gets up. My kids will eat waffles or French toast, while my wife and I usually just eat steel-cut oatmeal. The kids like to watch cartoons in the morning, usually ''Phineas and Ferb.''
TRAINER CALLING At around 10:30, my trainer, Rich, comes over. I used to run a lot when I was younger, and I damaged my back. The way I avoid back surgery is by working out regularly. But it is torturous.
LUNCH AND PLAYTIME When it's time for lunch, we usually get dressed and go out to someplace nearby, nothing very fancy, like this pasta place or barbecue place we like. If the weather is nice, I'll take my daughter to the playground. She loves to be swung really high on the swings in Union Square Park. If the weather isn't great, we like to play Tank! Tank! Tank! on the Wii. Sometimes I'll take my son to the movies. We recently saw ''Lincoln'' and ''42.''
DRAWING BOARD Right now, we are planning a gut renovation of our apartment. It is a loft, and it hasn't been touched in 23 years. We were living in a big duplex in TriBeCa, but when I decided to become an architect and a professor instead of a real estate developer, it required a little lifestyle shift. More work for less pay. I really missed design and architecture, and I never could have written my book if it hadn't been for Columbia. It is very intellectually frothy up there, and I feel very stimulated now.
TOGETHERNESS My wife and I met and became friends while working at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. We have done a few projects together, including our summer cottage in Bellport. We will just sit at the table and draw.
HOME COOKING My wife is a fabulous cook, and she really likes to make Sunday dinner. She is a natural; she can make anything. She makes delicious Indian food.
RELAXING The kids have piano lessons in the afternoon, so I'll watch a Yankee game or read a book.
GAME TIME Sunday is game night at our house, usually Parcheesi or Monopoly. My son must have real estate in his blood, since he always wins at Monopoly. Then my daughter goes to bed and we will clean up. At night, my son will take a shower and read. He loves Japanese manga, and is also reading a book about Ulysses right now.
WINDING DOWN When they are in bed, my wife and I will break out a little red wine, make some popcorn and watch an episode of ''The Good Wife'' or ''Mad Men.'' I find Don Draper really fantastic, but it doesn't come on until 10 o'clock and I always seem to fall asleep halfway through the show.

HEADLINE: Paul Soros, Shipping Entrepreneur and Philanthropist, Dies at 87

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
When Paul Soros, as a young engineer, observed that large cargo ships could not get to shallow-water piers to load and unload, he came up with a radical solution: take the piers to the ships.
The idea sprang from his boyhood in Hungary. He remembered seeing buoys being used to create floating piers on the Danube, where he and his younger brother, George, who would grow up to become one of the richest men in the world, spent peaceful days at the family's summer home before war changed everything for them.
Replicating the system in the United States, Mr. Soros, who died early Saturday at his home in Manhattan at 87, went on to build Soros Associates, which has dominated the port-building industry and shifted international trade and production patterns through its shipping innovations.
The Brazilian national mining company, for example, used Soros designs at its port of Tubarão to become the world's largest iron ore producer, more than quintupling Brazil's output in the process. Mr. Soros's company, with projects in 90 countries, either designed or expanded seven of the 10 largest bulk ports in the world for bauxite, alumina and coal as well as for iron ore. 
Mr. Soros died at his home on Fifth Avenue, his son Peter said. He had been treated for Parkinson's disease, cancer, diabetes and renal failure. He had lost a kidney as a young man and later an eye in a freak accident during a golfing lesson. Earlier he had lived through harrowing times, threatened by Nazis and taken prisoner by Russians before managing to flee to the West.
And he lived in the long shadow of his brother, who found fame as an investor, philanthropist and promoter of progressive political causes. Indeed, Paul was often called ''the invisible Soros.''
He was born Paul Schwartz on June 5, 1926 in Budapest, the son of Tivadar Schwartz, a well-connected Jewish lawyer, publisher, investor and former officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and the former Erzebet Szucz, the daughter of a well-to-do fabric store owner. During World War I, his father was captured by Russian troops and imprisoned in a Siberian camp before escaping and making his way to Budapest.
Theirs was a comfortable and cultured life, with ski vacations in Austria and summers on the Danube. Paul became an expert skier and a star tennis player and attended a technical college in Hungary.
But in 1936, as Hungary began aligning itself with fascist powers and anti-Semitism spread, the family changed its name to Soros. When German troops entered Budapest in 1944 and began rounding up Jews for deportation to concentration camps or shooting them outright on the banks of the Danube, Tivadar forged identity papers that gave the family false names and portrayed them as Christians. They survived a year of terror, living in safe houses and scraping together supplies until the Russians came and the Nazis were defeated.
The Soviet authorities, however, accused Paul Soros of being a fugitive SS officer and sent him on a forced march east with other prisoners ''in rows of four,'' Mr. Soros wrote in an unpublished memoir for his family. As they approached a stream beside a village, he recalled, ''I knew that, after the bridge, there were no more villages, just open country. With snow on the ground there was no way to get away or hide.''
So as the prisoners and their Russians guards squeezed across the bridge, ''I simply made a run for it,'' Mr. Soros wrote, escaping the guards' notice. He hid himself in a burned-out farmhouse and ''watched the column pass for about an hour'' before walking back to Budapest.
Afterward he became a member of the Hungarian ski team and would have joined it at the 1948 Olympics had it not been for an injury. He soon left home for Soviet-occupied Austria, where he became the country's No. 2 tennis player and an expert at forging passports. Seeking to defect to the West, he managed to make his way to New York in 1948 on a one-year student visa.
George, meanwhile, at 17 and with his father's help, fled communist Hungary under the pretense of attending a conference in Switzerland. He traveled to London, where he enrolled in a technical school with a distant relative's help, did odd jobs to support himself and later was admitted to the London School of Economics.
Paul and George Soros were rivals when young; George believed the firstborn Paul received more attention from their parents. In his memoir Paul wrote that they had had ''a pretty bad relationship'' as youngsters and that as young men they did not see each other for eight years until reuniting in London.
They acknowledged becoming closer, however, while living in New York years later; their Upper East Side homes were only blocks apart. George handled some of Paul's investments, which proved quite lucrative and contributed to Paul's own immense fortune.
After arriving in the United States, Paul was soon admitted to St. Lawrence University in New York State, but left early on after losing a kidney in a skiing accident in which a buried slalom pole popped up and speared him in the back. After his recovery he enrolled at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now affiliated with New York University.
Once out of college, he took a succession of engineering jobs before joining Hewitt Robins International, a maker of conveyor belting and industrial hose, as a sales engineer in the export department. By then he had married Daisy Schlenger, whom he had met in New York, and moved to Connecticut.
But he grew restless, wanting to strike out on his own, and though he was offered the chance to run Hewitt Robins' European operations in Amsterdam, he turned it down and quit to form Soros Associates, based at first in his Connecticut home.
''Not that being a big shot in Europe was a hardship prospect,'' he wrote in his memoir. ''But I knew that if I did not try the alternative, all my life it would bug me, what if?''
Soros Associates, which is based in New York and has offices throughout the world, became a leading international provider of port planning, engineering and installations. Mr. Soros acknowledged that a variation of his buoy system had been used for oil tankers, but pumping oil from ship to port is a process far different from unloading raw materials like bauxite, iron ore and coal.
Besides his son Peter, Mr. Soros is survived by his wife; another son, Jeffrey; his brother, George; four grandchildren and one step-granddaughter. A third son, Steven, died at 18 months in a playground accident; an 18-month-old daughter, Linda, died after being hit by a vehicle backing out of their garage.
Mr. Soros and his wife had homes in New Canaan, Conn.; on Nantucket in Massachusetts and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It was in New Canaan that he lost an eye while taking an indoor golf lesson at a country club. In his memoir, which he titled ''American (Con)quest,'' he wrote that after he had reached 65 his taxable income exceeded $100 million a year.
But he said his lifestyle was not lavish.
''I find conspicuous consumption in bad taste and something of an insult to people who have to work hard to make ends meet,'' he wrote.
He played rubber bridge well into his 80s and at such a high level that his skill won the attention of the bridge columnist for The New York Times in 2010.
In 1998 Mr. Soros and his wife created a trust called the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, which provides grants to immigrants for graduate study; the endowment eventually totaled $75 million. For 18 years, through 2012, they underwrote Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center's outdoor dance party.
''My story is riches to rags to riches again,'' Mr. Soros once said. ''I was lucky to survive. The rest was relatively easy.''

HEADLINE: Don't Blame the Work Force

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
There is a durable belief that much of today's unemployment is rooted in a skills gap, in which good jobs go unfilled for lack of qualified applicants. This is mostly a corporate fiction, based in part on self-interest and a misreading of government data.
A Labor Department report last week showed 3.8 million job openings in the United States in April -- proof, to some, that there would be fewer unemployed if more people had a better education and better skills. But both academic research and a closer look at the numbers in the department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey show that unemployment has little to do with the quality of the applicant pool. 
THE NUMBERS In a healthy economy, job openings are plentiful and unemployment is low. April's tally of 3.8 million openings might sound like a lot, but it is still well below the prerecession average, in 2007, of 4.5 million openings a month. It is also far lower than the record high of 5.2 million openings in December 2000, when the survey was started near the peak of a long economic expansion.
Unemployment is also stubbornly high -- 7.5 percent in April, or 11.7 million people, a ratio of 3.1 job seekers for every opening. No category has been spared: unemployed workers outnumber openings in all of the 17 major sectors covered by the survey. The biggest problem in the labor market is not a skills shortage; rather, it is a persistently weak economy where businesses do not have sufficient demand to justify adding employees.
THE RESEARCH Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, has noted sharply different opinions between corporate executives, who typically say that schools are failing to give workers the skills they need, and the people who actually do the hiring, who say the real obstacles are traditional ones like lack of on-the-job experience. In addition, when there are many more applicants than jobs, employers tend to impose overexacting criteria and then wait for the perfect match. They also offer tightfisted pay packages. What employers describe as talent shortages are often failures to agree on salary.
If a business really needed workers, it would pay up. That is not happening, which calls into question the existence of a skills gap as well as the urgency on the part of employers to fill their openings. Research from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that ''recruiting intensity'' -- that is, business efforts to fill job openings -- has been low in this recovery. Employers may be posting openings, but they are not trying all that hard to fill them, say, by increasing job ads or offering better pay packages.
Corporate executives have valuable perspectives on the economy, but they also have an interest in promoting the notion of a skills gap. They want schools and, by extension, the government to take on more of the costs of training workers that used to be covered by companies as part of on-the-job employee development. They also want more immigration, both low and high skilled, because immigrants may be willing to work for less than their American counterparts.
There are many reasons to improve education, to welcome immigrants and to advance other policies aimed at transforming the work force and society. But a skills gap is not among them. Meeting today's job challenges requires action to improve both the economy and pay, including government measures to create jobs, strengthen health and retirement systems, and raise the minimum wage. Fretting about a skills gap that does not exist will not help.

HEADLINE: A Judicial Travesty in Egypt

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Human rights in Egypt have remained under attack even after the 2011 revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak. Still, it was a shock when the Cairo Criminal Court convicted 43 employees of foreign nonprofit groups, including 16 Americans, on criminal charges and gave them prison sentences of one to five years. 
The politically driven decision sends a chilling message to Egyptians who want to work for democratic change and to countries like the United States that have committed to being Egypt's partners in stabilizing the region, reviving the economy and establishing democratic institutions.
The case began when the military-led government that took control after Mr. Mubarak's fall started a crusade against human rights and civil liberties groups. In December 2011, security forces raided several groups in Cairo, including three American-financed democracy-building organizations -- the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House -- and carried off files and computers. Forty-three foreign and local activists were questioned in a bogus criminal investigation and briefly barred from leaving Egypt.
On June 4, the court convicted them under a Mubarak-era law of receiving illegal funds from abroad and operating unlicensed organizations. In doing so, the court capitulated to the paranoid argument, made by the generals and later by President Mohamed Morsi's government, that the groups -- which, among other things, train poll workers and work on voter education -- were ''foreign hands'' out to destroy Egypt. Altogether, the groups received far less from foreign sources than the $1.3 billion the army receives annually from the United States. Also, they had been invited by the government to help with the post-Mubarak elections.
It is unlikely that any of the defendants will go to prison; some are out of the country and others have received suspended sentences. Still, the verdict is a travesty, and Mr. Morsi should exercise his presidential power to pardon them. He knows the law under which they were convicted is deeply flawed since he has proposed a substitute. But even his proposal falls short of international human rights standards and should be modified.
Secretary of State John Kerry has condemned the verdict as ''incompatible with the transition to democracy,'' but a much stronger American response is needed. The verdict might also be cause for Washington to rethink its relationship with Egypt, whose democratic transition is running aground. It is troubling that Mr. Kerry last month approved giving Egypt its annual $1.3 billion in military aid despite its failure to meet Congressionally mandated democracy standards.
Egypt's stability and its ability to build durable democratic institutions, establish a sound economy, respect the rights and freedoms of its citizens and uphold the peace treaty with Israel are hugely important. The United States needs to find a more effective way of getting that message across.

HEADLINE: What Sweden Can Tell Us About Obamacare

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
LAST month, for the 37th time, the House of Representatives voted to repeal Obamacare, with many Republicans saying that its call for greater government involvement in the health care system spells doom. Yet most other industrial countries have health care systems with far more government involvement than we are ever likely to see under Obamacare. What does their experience tell us about Republican fears?
While in Sweden this month as a visiting scholar, I've asked several Swedish health economists to share their thoughts about that question. They have spent their lives under a system in which most health care providers work directly for the government. Like economists in most other countries, they tend to be skeptical of large bureaucracies. So if extensive government involvement in health care is indeed a recipe for doom, they should have clear evidence of that by now. 
Yet none of them voiced the kinds of complaints about recalcitrant bureaucrats and runaway health costs that invariably surface in similar conversations with American colleagues. Little wonder. The Swedish system performs superbly, and my Swedish colleagues cited evidence of that fact with obvious pride.
The United States spends more than $8,000 a person per year on health care, well more than twice what Sweden spends. Yet health outcomes are far better in Sweden along virtually every dimension. Its infant mortality rate, for example, was recently less than half that of the United States. And males aged 15 to 60 are almost twice as likely to die in any given year in the United States than in Sweden.
In fairness, those differences result partly from lifestyle. In Sweden, workers are more likely to commute by bicycle than by car, for example, and obesity is far less common. Absolute poverty and income inequality -- both associated with adverse health outcomes -- are also lower.
But when illness strikes, the Swedish health care system responds efficiently. Managers have exploited economies of scale by consolidating services into fewer but larger hospitals. The American system has also gone through consolidation, but, by contrast, boutique hospitals are also more common here -- partly in response to demands from patients with very high-cost health plans. In large hospitals, CT scanners and other expensive diagnostic and treatment machines are in nearly constant use, versus only a few hours of weekly use in some small ones.
Larger hospitals with heavier patient flows also enable their staff to hone their skills through specialization and experience. If you are getting a knee replacement or coronary bypass surgery, you want teams that do scores of such procedures each month.
Doctors in the two countries also face different financial incentives. In the United States, under the fee-for-service model, they can bolster their incomes, often substantially, by prescribing additional tests and procedures. Most Swedish doctors, as salaried employees, have no comparable incentive.
Another important difference is that, unlike many American health insurance providers, the government groups that manage Swedish health care are nonprofit entities. Because their charge is to provide quality care for all citizens, they don't face the same incentive to withhold care that for-profit organizations do. That more hip-replacement operations are performed per capita in Sweden than in most other countries is almost certainly a reflection of the generous care options rather than of any inherent deficiency in Swedes' hip joints.
The Swedes also provide drugs and other treatments only when evidence establishes their effectiveness. People can spend privately on unproven treatments, but the government refuses to impose their cost on taxpayers.
IS there a catch? When I asked my Swedish hosts to describe any downsides to their system, several mentioned the waiting times for certain nonemergency services. One told me that whereas in the United States a wealthy or well-insured patient might schedule a hip replacement with only a week's notice, in Sweden the wait could be as long as three months. He described such waits as a design feature, noting that they allowed facilities to be used at consistently high capacity, and thus more efficiently.
Obamacare also contains many evidence-based provisions for medication and other treatments. But at least in its initial stages, it will not be able to match the cost savings achieved in Sweden.
That's because the legislation's design was heavily constrained from the outset. Surveys showed that most Americans were satisfied with the existing health plans provided by their employers, so any new system that required people to abandon them would have been a political non-starter. As I discussed in an earlier column, however, such plans are an extremely inefficient way to pay for health care. They arose as an unfortunate historical accident during World War II, when employers used them to sidestep the wage controls that had resulted in extreme labor shortages.
Employer health plans have been disappearing steadily, and may one day be gone entirely. The encouraging news is that the Affordable Care Act was intended to foster the evolution of a new system that can capture many of the gains currently enjoyed by countries like Sweden.
For that to happen, however, Congressional critics must abandon their futile efforts to repeal Obamacare and focus instead on improving it. Their core premise -- that greater government involvement in health care provision spells disaster -- lacks support in the wealth of evidence from around the world that bears on it.
The truth appears closer to the reverse: Because of pervasive market failures in private health care markets, this may be the sector that benefits most from collective action.

HEADLINE: A Place That Isn't Out to Get Him

BYLINE: By DAN SHAW

 BODY:
Adam Goldman lives in one of those Brooklyn prewar buildings near Prospect Park where the buzzer doesn't always work, and the vestibule and lobby doors are frequently left unlatched. ''But I feel safe here,'' said Mr. Goldman, the creator, director and star of ''The Outs,'' the cultish online TV series that chronicled the dissolution of a romance between two gay 20-something men in contemporary Brooklyn. ''This apartment is a step up.''
Mr. Goldman, 27, is a bona fide struggling artist, although he grew up in affluent Newton, Mass., and studied theater at Bard College. ''After graduation,'' he said, ''I moved home and worked at the Apple Store for six months like a good nerd, to save money to move to Williamsburg.''
Williamsburg was not kind to him. ''Certainly, my first apartment tried to kill me,'' he said. ''The heater in the basement exploded, and I got a call at work saying that flames were coming out of the chimney. It was December, and there was no heat. I had to move really quickly.'' 
His next apartment was hard by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. ''I didn't mind the traffic,'' he said, ''but then a nightclub opened downstairs and noise became an issue. When the ceiling caved in and acrid water poured down, I went onto Craigslist and found this place.''
The renovated three-bedroom apartment that Mr. Goldman has called home for the past two years is one block from the Franklin Avenue subway station and a short walk from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. ''If you're a real estate broker you say we live in Prospect Heights,'' he said. ''But we say we live in Crown Heights, which is the correct answer.''
Mr. Goldman shares the apartment with two roommates: Sasha Winters, who plays Oona, the straight female best friend on ''The Outs,'' and Matthew Phelan, an artist and writer. ''One of the reasons I chose this apartment is that we could have a TV room,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Our last apartment had no common space. I really wanted a place where we could hang out and watch 'Mad Men' with our friends.''
Furnished with an Ikea sofa draped with an afghan made by his grandmother and a Saarinen chair from a thrift shop, the TV room is not much larger than a walk-in closet. But it's a place of pride decorated with sentimental objects: a Surrealist painting bought at a stoop sale that mesmerizes a character in Episode 5 of the show; a multicolored glass bong.
''That's a prop bong!'' Mr. Goldman said. ''I mean, it's a functioning bong, but we purchased it on St. Marks Place for the show. We wanted the character Frank to have this weirdly overstylized bong. I think it's very beautiful.''
The sad-looking robot pillow in the corner with the gangly arms and legs is a souvenir of a cross-country trip that Mr. Goldman took by himself a few years ago to record an independent radio documentary about 10 American towns named Hollywood. ''A friend noticed that my passenger seat was empty and gave me the pillow for a co-pilot,'' he said. ''Besides books, I don't really own a lot of stuff.''
Neither do the characters on ''The Outs,'' which started with the first of six episodes in March 2012 and had an unvarnished verisimilitude. ''We shot in places that belonged to friends that we could use for free, including this apartment,'' he said.
The characters Jack and Mitchell (played by Hunter Canning and Mr. Goldman respectively) sleep under the same rumpled Ikea sheets that are on his bed today -- life imitating art imitating life. ''I only cleaned up for you as much as I would for a first date,'' he said, surveying his disheveled surroundings.
''The Outs'' does not romanticize Brooklyn. ''The show's not aspirational,'' he said. The characters don't go to trendy restaurants or clubs. They take the subway at 3 a.m. because they can't afford cabs.
''I think of the subway as an oasis,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''When I am home, I always feel like I should be writing or researching or sending e-mails. But on the subway, I don't feel like I have to be working on anything. I can read or listen to music. If it takes me an hour to get somewhere on the subway, I think of it as an underground vacation.'' He pauses for comic effect. ''Does that sound depressing?''
Living a bare-bones existence was the only way he could afford to make the series, which was financed by Kickstarter campaigns that raised $1,600 and $22,000. ''The plan was to pour all my creative energy into the show and hope it would turn into something,'' he said, noting that more than 16,000 people have liked ''The Outs'' on Facebook. As the show went viral, it gained middle-aged fans including the actor Alan Cumming, who volunteered to appear as himself in the Hanukkah Special, the ''bonus'' seventh episode.
The buzz about ''The Outs'' has reached even the White House. He was invited to President Obama's L.G.B.T. Pride reception the other day. ''I called the social secretary's office to make sure it wasn't a scam,'' Mr. Goldman said, ''and the gentleman I spoke to told me he was a fan. It's incredibly bizarre that in the upper echelons of power, people are watching the show.''
While ''The Outs'' focused on love and the ''radioactive effect'' of ending a relationship, Mr. Goldman's next, still-untitled, series will focus on economic survival in the same milieu. ''The central question of the new show,'' he said, ''is: How long are you expected to do something that you hate for free until it becomes something that you love and can make a living from, and whether that feels possible to people in my generation.''
It seems possible for Mr. Goldman, who mentions that he now has ''representation in L.A.'' As he talks, thumping music from the street suddenly ricochets around his second-floor bedroom. ''We live on a loud corner,'' he said with beatific resignation. ''I've always had that experience in Brooklyn. I have never lived somewhere that someone did not drive by four times a day blaring loud music.''

THE DISPENSABLE NATIONAmerican Foreign Policy in Retreat
By Vali Nasr300 pp. Doubleday. $28.95.FOREIGN POLICY BEGINS AT HOMEThe Case for Putting America's House in OrderBy Richard N. Haass195 pp. Basic Books. $25.99.
For two years, Vali Nasr traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan with Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special envoy to the region. One of Holbrooke's first trips included India, where his domain was supposed to reach, and which was integral to solving the problem at hand. The Indians rebuffed the envoy, in part because they judged he knew little about the country. But mostly, they did not want anything to do with a mission that included India's enemy, Pakistan. It was a rough start, and Holbrooke's responsibility was reduced to two countries: AfPak, as he affectionately called his portfolio.
That Holbrooke's push for a settlement in Afghanistan soured, and with it his efforts to bring Pakistan closer to the United States, is hardly a secret. Although he never said so publicly, Holbrooke no doubt hoped he could duplicate, in a very different part of the world, his success with the 1995 Dayton accords that brought peace to the shards of Yugoslavia. 
Instead, on the Pakistan and Afghanistan beat, he was stymied from the outset by a White House staff that never trusted him and a president who never consulted him. In Pakistan he was treated as a diplomat who failed to understand the subcontinent, and in Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai ignored him. One of Holbrooke's few supporters in this dirty power play, President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, was too weak and self-absorbed to be much help.
Nasr viewed all of these humiliations up close, and he opens ''The Dispensable Nation,'' his readable and valuable account of the current status of American foreign policy, with a sympathetic portrait of Holbrooke battling ogres in the White House as his stellar fan, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, runs interference.
To make his case, Nasr skates over some of the shortcomings of Holbrooke's tenure, including that first trip to India.
But even for devotees of Beltway contortions, the details are astonishing. ''The White House kept a dossier on Holbrooke's misdeeds,'' he writes, ''and Clinton kept a folder on churlish attempts by the White House's AfPak office to undermine Holbrooke.'' Holbrooke did extract some short-term victories from Pakistan: visas for the deep-cover C.I.A. operatives who tracked down Osama bin Laden, and more distance between Pakistan and Iran. Those small gains, however, are now by the wayside as Pakistan lurches ever closer toward the hands of extremists.
But the import of Nasr's book arises not only from the question of Who Lost Pakistan. (The shorthand answer in Nasr's estimation: the intelligence agencies that ran the drone campaign and the United States military leaders who demanded Pakistan be used as a logistics highway to feed the war machine in Afghanistan.)
Nasr, a Middle East expert with a particularly fine knowledge of Iran who is now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, brings a steady, nonideological explanation of the weaknesses of United States foreign policy at the start of the second Obama term.
The United States, he asserts, is not declining. It still retains overwhelming power. But American influence is definitely diminishing. Why? ''The answer,'' he writes, ''lies in how we exercise our power and how we see our role in the world.''
In other words, the Obama administration has made some bad choices. Making a ''pivot'' to East Asia the core of its foreign policy was a basic mistake, he argues. China views it as a containment strategy. The Middle East views it as a way of saying goodbye. More important, Nasr argues, the Middle East ''remains the single most important region of the world,'' and it is in the Middle East where the great power rivalry with China will play out. He could have added that, so far, the ''pivot'' to Asia has been more talk than action.
The United States, he says, should be paying attention to China's own pivot to its west. This is an intriguing and novel analysis of where China's interests lie.
''If we could tell what the Chinese were thinking, or what they were afraid of, we would see the Middle East right at the heart of it,'' he writes. ''A retreat from the Middle East will not free us to deal with China; it will constrain us in managing that competition.''
To bolster his argument, Nasr singles out a little-noticed trip in April 2012 by the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to Urumqi, the capital of China's far western province, Xinjiang, and home to the restive Muslim Uighur minority. It was the first visit by a Turkish leader to China in 27 years. Instead of criticizing China for its treatment of the Uighur separatists, the prime minister called for ''one China.''
Indeed, Erdogan's visit followed by a few months a trip to Turkey by Xi Jinping, then vice president and now the president of China. Turkey, Nasr concludes, is the launching pad for China's pivot west as it seeks ''to poach on the lucrative economic relations'' between the United States and the European Union, ''and to push into western Asia.''
Other countries are also increasingly engaged with China. Egypt's new president, Mohammad Morsi, visited the country in August last year, looking for economic investment he knows will no longer flow from the West. ''The Arab world's most important country, with the largest population, sitting at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe, thinks it has a thing or two to offer to China,'' Nasr notes. Then, of course, there are China's energy interests in the Middle East, which could make it over time the biggest player in the region.
Richard N. Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, the apex of the foreign policy establishment, so his call for getting America's domestic house in order should be listened to. His book ''Foreign Policy Begins at Home'' -- at 164 pages of text, it feels more like a smart extended pamphlet -- argues that for the next decade the United States needs to take stock after the folly of the Iraq war.
Like Nasr, Haass discounts those who say America is in decline. But clearly the country is ''underperforming.'' To correct this situation, Washington could adopt one of several doctrines, including the promotion of democracy, humanitarianism, counterterrorism or ''integration'' -- a policy that would be grounded in working together with China in regional and global institutions. But he dismisses this as unrealistic because China is not ready or (perhaps more accurately) not willing to play.
Haass opts instead for a doctrine of ''restoration'' that emphasizes ''rebuilding at home and refocusing abroad.'' Under this approach there should be limits on what military force the United States would commit on behalf of interests in the Middle East and elsewhere that are less than vital. Haass advocates doing less abroad -- or at least, doing it more discriminately. Given choices, he seems to differ with Nasr, leaning toward less involvement in the Middle East and more in the Asian Pacific.
Both of these writers know the global terrain, and both have served in Washington -- Haass much longer, and at more senior levels. How closely are those who occupy the seats of power in Washington listening?

BYLINE: By WIL S. HYLTON

 BODY:
It was a beautiful Thursday morning in May, and everything was going wrong. James Turrell had six days to prepare for the biggest museum exhibition of his life -- 11 complex installation pieces at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art -- but he didn't have a single work finished, and he was missing crucial parts.
He shuffled into the office of Lacma's director, Michael Govan, and flopped into a chair with a sigh.
''I'm pretty concerned,'' Turrell said. ''You know, the computer that came back from Russia was completely wiped.'' 
Govan tapped a foot underneath the table. The computer was essential. Much of Turrell's work consists of special rooms that are infused with unusual light, and the computer helps run the show. It had been in Russia for another exhibition, but something went awry in transit.
''There's nothing in it,'' Turrell said. ''Nothing's in it at all! Nothing.''
Govan shook his head calmly. ''That happens in Moscow,'' he said.
Turrell shifted uncomfortably in his seat. ''I guess,'' he said. ''I don't have a piece that's finished yet. You know, it's getting late on everything.''
''Has the lens left Frankfurt?'' Govan asked. This was another essential part.
''No, it hasn't left Frankfurt,'' Turrell said.
''I thought it did,'' Govan said.
''No, no,'' Turrell said. ''It has not left Frankfurt. I don't know what's going on.''
Now it was Govan's turn to sigh. ''You should have been a painter,'' he said. ''Five years of planning, three months of construction, and there's not one work of art.''
The plan had been simple on paper: Turrell would open three major shows inside a month. As soon as he finished the Lacma pieces, he would race to Texas for another huge installation at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and then to Manhattan, where he is opening a show at the Guggenheim next week. Taken together, the three-museum retrospective is the biggest event in the art world this summer. As the curator of the Houston exhibition, Alison de Lima Greene, put it, ''This is the first time that three museums have mounted exhibitions of this magnitude in conjunction, all devoted to a single artist.'' In total, the retrospective takes up 92,000 square feet.
Assembling any Turrell show is a complicated affair. Unlike a show of paintings and sculpture, every piece must be built on site, and even more than with most installation art, his work requires elaborate modifications to the museum itself. Windows must be blocked off or painted black to obscure the outside light; zigzagging hallways are constructed to isolate rooms; and each of the rooms has to be built according to Turrell's meticulous designs, with hidden pockets to conceal light bulbs and strange protruding corners that confuse the eye. Even the drywall must be hung and finished with exacting precision, so that each corner, curve and planar surface is precise to 1/64th of an inch. It can take hundreds of man-hours to finish a single room; he was erecting 11 at Lacma.
Turrell at 70 is a burly man with thick white hair and a snowy beard. He tends to dress in dark clothing, like Santa Claus in mourning. We had been spending a lot of time together as he prepared for the shows, and I had followed him to Los Angeles to see the final stages. After the conversation with Govan, I retreated outside and found a bench in the shade to do some reading. I expected to be there a while. Two hours later, I looked up and saw Turrell standing there with a smile. ''Well,'' he said, ''we've got one ready. Come on, let's take a look.''
I followed him inside the building, and we rode an elevator to the second floor. We stepped into a dim lobby filled with construction equipment. ''This way,'' he said, turning into a dark hallway. I walked behind, my hands groping for the walls. Turrell stayed a few steps ahead, muttering directions -- ''forward now, another step, this way, and turn'' -- until I rounded the final corner and saw the piece materialize before me. It was a looming plane of green light that shimmered like an apparition. The rush of blood to my head nearly brought me to my knees.
It is difficult to say much more about the piece without descending into gibberish. This is one of the first things you notice when you spend time around Turrell. Though he is uncommonly eloquent on a host of subjects, from Riemannian geometry to vortex dynamics, he has developed a dense and impenetrable vocabulary to describe his work. Nearly everyone who speaks and writes about Turrell uses the same infernal jargon. It can be grating to endure a cocktail party filled with people talking about the ''thingness of light'' and the ''alpha state'' of mind -- at least until you've seen enough Turrell to realize that, without those terms, it would be nearly impossible to discuss his work. It is simply too far removed from the language of reality, or for that matter, from reality itself.
The piece that day at Lacma, for example, was one of his ''Wedgeworks'' series. The room was devoid of boundaries, just an eternity of inky blackness, with the outline of a huge lavender rectangle floating in the distance, and beyond it, the tall plane of green light stretching toward an invisible horizon, where it dissolved into a crimson stripe.
I suppose it would be fair to say that all of this was an illusion. The shapes and contours I saw were made entirely of light, while the actual walls of the room were laid out in a way I could never have guessed. When, after a few minutes, a museum worker accidentally flipped on a bright light, I was surprised to see a small chamber in the back, with a workman's ladder propped against the wall. Turrell lurched toward the doorway in a panic, crying out, ''What the hell are they doing?''
Other pieces by Turrell are even more disorienting. His ''Dark Spaces'' can require 30 minutes of immersion before you begin to see a swirling blur of color, while some of his rooms are so flooded with light that the effect is instantly overpowering. Stepping into one of his ''Ganzfeld'' rooms is like falling into a neon cloud. The air is thick with luminous color that seems to quiver all around you, and it can be difficult to discern which way is up, or out.
Not everyone enjoys the Turrell experience. It requires a degree of surrender. There is a certain comfort in knowing what is real and where things are; to have that comfort stripped away can be rapturous, or distressing. It can even be dangerous. During a Turrell show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1980, several visitors to a piece called ''City of Arhirit'' became unsteady in the bright blue haze and tried to brace themselves against a wall made of light. Some of them fell down. A few got hurt. One woman, who broke her arm, sued the Whitney and Turrell for more than $10,000, claiming that the show made her so ''disoriented and confused'' that she ''violently precipitated to the floor.'' Another visitor, who sprained her wrist, sued the Whitney for $250,000. The museum's insurance company then filed a claim against Turrell, and although a member of the Whitney family put a stop to the suit, Turrell still gets sore thinking about it. He spent $30,000 to defend himself, but it's not the money that bothers him the most. It's the lingering feeling that the work didn't . . . work.
''On some level,'' he told me, ''you'd have to say I failed.''
We were at his townhouse on Gramercy Park in Manhattan. Like Turrell's other two homes, in northern Arizona and eastern Maryland, it was furnished mostly in the Shaker style. The walls were cream, with very little hanging art, and the furniture was all in cherry. Turrell sat at the center of a dining table and began to describe other incidents. One of his friends had taken a tumble at the same Whitney show. ''He was just standing there,'' Turrell said with a shrug, ''and he leaned back and fell.'' At a show in Vienna, another visitor took a running start and leapt into a Ganzfeld room, perhaps expecting to land on a bed of pillowy clouds. She smashed into a wall. And then there were the ''Perceptual Cells.''
The Perceptual Cells are Turrell's most extreme work. The visitor approaches a giant sphere that looks like an oversize Ping-Pong ball and lies down on something like a morgue drawer to be pushed inside. When the door is shut, the lights come on, so bright that it's almost pointless to close your eyes. As the colors shift and morph, you begin to see things that aren't there, like tiny rainbows floating in space and crisp geometric forms. It turns out that what you're seeing is the biological structure of your own eye, which, in the blinding intensity, has turned on itself.
Even Turrell describes the Perceptual Cells as ''invasive'' and ''oppressive.'' Some of his most avid fans prefer not to see the series. Andrea Glimcher represents Turrell at the Pace Gallery in Manhattan, but when she visited Lacma for the opening in May, she declined to view the Perceptual Cell. ''Just thinking about it makes me want to press a panic button,'' she told me. When one of the curators of this year's Guggenheim exhibition, Nat Trotman, viewed the Perceptual Cell at Lacma, he wrote me to say that it had ''rewired'' his thinking and was ''very aggressive and very hallucinatory.'' Before viewers climb into the Perceptual Cells, Turrell makes them sign waivers to certify that they are 18 years old, sober and sane.
The joke among Turrell's friends is that, to see his work, you must first become hopelessly lost. Though he is routinely listed among the signature artists of his generation (in 1984, he and Robert Irwin became the first visual artists to receive MacArthur ''genius'' grants), he has never enjoyed the widespread recognition of artists like Donald Judd, Jasper Johns and Chuck Close. In fact, Turrell has not held a major museum show in New York since the Whitney exhibition of 1980, or in Los Angeles since 1985.
Much of his art is located in the far corners of the earth. There is an 18,000-square-foot museum devoted to Turrell in the mountains of Argentina, a monumental pyramid he constructed in eastern Australia and an even larger one on the Yucatán Peninsula, with chambers that capture natural light.
Turrell's greatest work and lifelong fixation is an extinct volcano on his ranch in Arizona, where he has been developing a network of tunnels and underground rooms since 1974. The volcano has a bowl-shaped depression on its top and is known as Roden Crater. Turrell has never opened the crater to the public, and he is guarded about who sees it. An invitation to visit Roden is one of the most coveted tickets in American art.
''It has become, even unfinished, as important as any artwork ever made,'' Michael Govan said. ''I know I'm going out on a limb here a little bit, but I think it's one of the most ambitious artworks ever attempted by a single human being.''
Turrell's obsession with the crater is the stuff of legend, but he prefers not to analyze it. For a man driven by such a monomaniacal artistic impulse, he is startlingly uninterested in himself. Through dozens of conversations in multiple cities over perhaps a hundred hours, I found him willing to examine almost any idea, so long as it didn't require any self-reflection. I would ask, for example, about his place in the art world, or his faith, or lack of it, or how he feels about the crater as he grows older and the forces of obsession and mortality collide -- and each time he would nod and frown and say something like, ''Well, you know, you just have to accept things as they are.'' Then he would launch into a 30-minute dissertation on the geometry of sailboat hulls. The more questions you ask Turrell, the more elusive he seems. Growing up Quaker, he was always being told to nurture ''the light within.'' At 70, he seems more interested in the light without.
Some of Turrell's contemporaries view the mystery around him with a measure of envy. One day this spring, I stopped by the studio of Chuck Close in Lower Manhattan. There was a large, incomplete portrait of a woman hanging from one wall, with its lower half descending through a narrow gap in the floor. Close, who has been in a wheelchair since an arterial collapse in 1988, raises or lowers the canvas in order to reach the spot where he's working. A few years ago, Turrell invited him to visit Roden Crater.
''I was shocked when I got out there,'' Close said. First, that Turrell had made the crater wheelchair-accessible. ''He proudly put me in this four-wheel-drive golf cart and drove me all the way up into the thing.'' But when they reached the top, Close found another surprise. Turrell has spent years shaping the rim of the caldera in such a way that it seems to distort the contour of the sky. He calls this ''celestial vaulting,'' and he helped Close lie down to experience the phenomenon. Staring up, Close was struck in equal parts by the power of the illusion and its subtlety. ''He's an orchestrator of experience,'' Close said, ''not a creator of cheap effects. And every artists knows how cheap an effect is, and how revolutionary an experience.''
Close is among the most famous living painters, but when he looks at an artist like Turrell, it sometimes makes him skeptical of his own fame. ''It makes me wonder if I'm making pabulum for the masses,'' he said with a laugh. Close described how, in the 1960s, artists like Turrell and Robert Smithson and Walter de Maria ''wanted to go in the desert and dig a hole or ride a motorcycle in a circle, or dig a ditch, or put a bunch of spikes for lightning to hit. It was about not making a commodity. Not making it something that would go in a gallery.'' Many of those artists criticized Close for working in a more conventional medium. ''I've been arguing with Mel Bochner for years,'' he said, ''because Mel gave me tremendous grief for making stuff that hung on the wall, like I might just as well have been a prostitute inviting people up to my room.''
Close pointed out with a wry smile that most of those friends have since found a way to show their work. ''After a while, they thought, Oh, no one's going to see this stuff!'' he said. ''So then they take photographs. Then they frame the photographs and put them in a gallery.'' Still, he sometimes wonders if they were on to something back in the '60s -- and if Turrell, in his work at the crater, still is.
''I may be known by more people, but I'm often known for all the wrong reasons,'' Close said.
For his part, Turrell has begun to think more about what he'll leave behind. On a recent drive across the desert to see the crater, he turned to me and said, ''I was absolutely going to get this project done by the year 2000, so I'm a little embarrassed by it. There have been periods of euphoria. There have been times that I've been discouraged, and times when I've just gone out and enjoyed the place -- and realized that maybe this would be it. Maybe it wouldn't get any further.''
We were approaching the crater through a field of impossibly picturesque cattle, their long, straight backs and thick conformation the envy of any rancher. Turrell bounced along at the wheel of the truck, smiling at the herd. ''We've learned a lot about livestock,'' he said, ''but the biggest thing is learning about personnel. You know, you're not going to want artists to take care of your livestock.''
When Turrell first spotted the crater from an airplane in 1974, he had no intention of buying the land around it. He just wanted to dig into the volcano. He persuaded the Dia Art Foundation in Texas to purchase the site on his behalf. When the foundation spiraled into financial trouble a few years later, Turrell scrambled to take over the title. He applied for a loan, but the bank told him the ranch wasn't big enough to turn a profit. ''They said, 'This will just be a gentleman's ranch, and you'll lose money,' '' Turrell said. ''Which I now understand is true. They said: 'But there's one ranch over that's now for sale. If you buy that one, and you buy the one in between, we think we could negotiate -- we won't loan you a little, but we'll loan you a lot!' ''
Turrell by then was married with young children, and his wife opposed the purchase. ''My wife said at the time, 'You're mortgaging our children's future,' '' he said, ''and for that and other reasons, she left -- and I took the loan.''
By the time Turrell had signed the note for all three ranches and leased the public land between them, he was the proud, solitary overseer of a 155-square-mile property that could be supported only with livestock. He was 36 years old and had never raised a cow in his life.
Turrell was brought up in Pasadena in a devout Quaker family. ''It was like the conservative Mennonites,'' he said. ''I come from a family that does not believe in art to this day. They think art is vanity.'' Even as a child, Turrell was skeptical of the family's old-fashioned mores. Little things, like his mother's refusal to use household appliances, bothered him. ''My mother did not have a toaster oven and would toast bread in the oven, which I thought was stupid,'' he said. ''They didn't do cars and electricity, that kind of stuff.''
One of Turrell's aunts, Frances Hodges, lived in Manhattan and worked for a fashion magazine. When Turrell visited, Hodges would take him to concerts and museums, expounding upon the virtues of engagement with modern life. ''Her whole thought,'' Turrell said, ''was doing something society would contend with. That was her purpose in fashion. She didn't care if it was a vanity.'' On a trip to the Museum of Modern Art with Hodges in the 1950s, Turrell discovered the work of Thomas Wilfred, who experimented with projected light in the early 1900s. Turrell remembers staring at one of Wilfred's ''light boxes,'' in thrall to its shifting lines of shadow and color. Today, his home on Gramercy Park is next door to the one where Hodges lived.
In 1961, Turrell entered Pomona College to study math and perceptual psychology, but on the side, he continued to indulge his interest in art. He took courses in art history and signed up for studio classes. After graduation in 1965, he enrolled in a graduate art program at the University of California, Irvine. That wasn't to last. In 1966, he was arrested for coaching young men to avoid the Vietnam draft. He spent about a year in jail, and after his release in 1967, moved into a shuttered hotel in the Ocean Park section of Santa Monica. Over the next seven years, he would make a series of artistic breakthroughs that define his work today.
Turrell had discovered a strange optical effect in one of his projects for grad school. By placing a slide projector in an empty room and pointing its beam toward the corner, he found that he could make a cube of light that seemed to occupy physical space. As he settled into the rooms of the Mendota Hotel, he began to explore variations on the idea. Soon he was using colored slides and moving the projector around the room. He discovered that he could make pyramids and rectangles of light, which seemed to lean against the wall or float halfway to the ceiling. After a few months, he switched the bulb from tungsten to xenon, fascinated by the subtle difference in its effect. Over the next five decades, he would become an expert on light-bulb varieties, studying the distinctive character of neon, argon, ultraviolet, fluorescent and LEDs. For his 70th birthday last month, a friend gave him a bulb he'd never used before; Turrell was ecstatic.
By the late 1960s, he was also experimenting with outdoor light. He painted the windows of the hotel and scratched lines in the paint, allowing narrow slits of light to enter the room. He found that he could create patterns and illusions, much as he had with the projector. He called the series ''Mendota Stoppages,'' and he felt they had at least one advantage over the projection series: Because the light came from outside, there was no machinery in the room. He had created a gallery in which the art was made entirely of light.
Turrell wanted to keep the room empty but fill it with electric light. He realized that he could modify the walls to create hidden chambers for the bulbs. He called these pieces ''Shallow Space Constructions'' and tried a dozen permutations. In some, he tucked bulbs along a single edge of the room; in others, the whole frame of a wall glowed with brilliant color. One of the earliest Shallow Spaces, ''Raemar Pink White,'' is currently on display at Lacma. After 44 years, it still has the coruscating radiance of something from a future world.
By the early 1970s, Turrell was exploring another phenomenon with natural light. Instead of scratching paint on the windows, he cut large holes in the walls and ceiling of the old hotel to create a view of the open sky. With the right size of opening and the right vantage and some careful finish work, he found that it was possible to eliminate the sense of depth, so the sky appeared to be painted directly on the ceiling. Then he pointed electric lights at the hole, marveling at the dissonance between the light coming in and going out. He discovered that when he changed the color of the electric lights, he could change the apparent color of the sky. He called the series ''Skyspaces.''
Turrell's studio at the Mendota Hotel had become a locus for artists, curators and gallery owners who passed through Southern California. The founder of the Pace Gallery, Arne Glimcher, offered him a show. Turrell agreed, then changed his mind. The Italian collector Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo stopped in to ask if Turrell would cut a Skyspace into his villa near Milan. Turrell promised to do it soon. All he really wanted to do was stay in the old hotel, cutting his holes and building his walls and bathing in his light. But in April 1974, the hotel's owners threw him out. A terse note ordered Turrell to ''dispossess, quit, and surrender the premises.''
A few years earlier, he had scraped together enough money to buy a small airplane, which he kept in a nearby hangar and maintained himself. He'd also received a Guggenheim fellowship, which gave him some financial freedom. He packed his belongings onto his airplane and took off. For the next seven months, Turrell canvassed the Western skies. Each evening, he would land the plane wherever he happened to be, unfurling a bedroll to sleep beneath its wing. In the morning, he was back in flight, scanning the desert floor. He wanted to find a small mountain surrounded by plains, so the view from on top would resemble that of flight. Inside the mountain, he planned to carve tunnels and chambers illuminated by celestial light. He would bring together all his previous work in a new studio that no one could take away from him.
The day he spotted Roden Crater, he knew it was the one. The land wasn't for sale, but he persuaded the owner to let it go, and soon he had set up camp at the base of his own private volcano. By day, he traipsed the surface with a pile of surveying equipment, drawing topographic maps to guide his work. At night, he lay on the top and studied the stars. He tried to imagine how he would bring their light inside the mountain.
Even at a distance, it's easy to see why Turrell stopped at Roden Crater. The silhouette on the horizon is stunning, a topless pyramid floating on a sea of amber grass. As you draw close, the color begins to fill in, piles of deep red and charcoal cinder in heaps around the core.
Over the last 30 years, Turrell's ranching operation has only grown. What began as a concession to economics has become a private passion. The ranch now spreads across 227 square miles -- roughly 145,000 acres -- with a black angus herd of nearly 2,500 head. Most are certified ''natural'' and will produce prime-grade beef. ''When you're O.C.D.,'' Turrell said, ''you want the most beautiful animals.''
The ranch has also become part of the viewing experience at the crater. In the same way the eye must adapt to darkness in some of Turrell's museum pieces, the endless drive across the desert prepares a visitor for the singularity of Roden. Distance and isolation come naturally to Turrell, but he has also learned how valuable they are to his work. One of my favorite Turrell pieces is the Skyspace ''Tending (Blue),'' which is inside a small stone building behind the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas. To reach the piece, you pass through a Renzo Piano-designed building filled with northern light, then you cross the clean, clear lines of a landscape by Peter Walker. By the time you enter the Skyspace, the city of Dallas is long forgotten. I once lost the better part of a day inside, staring up as clouds lofted and flattened against the ceiling. But last year, a mirrored skyscraper went up nearby, reflecting glare into the building, killing plants in the garden and looming into view of the Skyspace. The museum had to close it.
At Roden Crater, Turrell has no such problems. The nearest town, Flagstaff, is home to the Lowell Observatory, and the city government has maintained ''dark sky'' ordinances since 1958. It is illegal to shine a searchlight in Flagstaff, and it has been for 55 years. In 2001, the city was selected by the International Dark Sky Association as the first ''Dark Sky City.'' Several years ago, Turrell joined forces with local and Navajo leaders to tighten the laws even further. Currently most of the outdoor lighting in the city and surrounding areas has to be shielded.
We were pulling around the base of the crater and began to climb the side. Halfway up, we turned into the parking area of a small lodge. The lodge is built mostly from local stone and leftover materials from the crater project. There is a small kitchen, a large common area and four bedrooms tucked into the back. Someday, Turrell hopes to build additional lodges and rent their rooms, so visitors can spend the night at the crater.
A few of Turrell's staff members had gathered inside the lodge, and the curators of the Guggenheim show, Nat Trotman and Carmen Giménez, had flown in from New York. Trotman and Giménez made an amusing pair. Trotman is tall and bulky with a tangle of dark hair, and is so well spoken that he sometimes seems to be reading from a script. Giménez is slight, energetic and impulsive. She is from Spain but speaks English with a French accent. Since 1989, she has been the museum's senior curator of 20th-century art. The two had been to the crater together once before, in the rain. Now they were back, as Trotman put it, ''to still our minds and immerse ourselves in what he's doing.''
Trotman really did wonder what Turrell was doing -- for months it had been a mystery. The show at the Guggenheim includes a piece that no one has ever seen. It is also Turrell's largest installation piece, and one that's difficult to classify: a 79-foot tower of light in the museum's central rotunda.
Any Turrell show asks a lot of a museum, but the tower, called ''Aten Reign,'' is in a league of its own. Nothing quite like it has ever been assembled in the Guggenheim, and neither Trotman nor Giménez could be sure what it would look like.
In simple terms, the tower is made from a series of metal rings, which are spaced 11 feet apart and wrapped in flexible plastic to form a cone. When it has been fully assembled in the rotunda, it will hang from the atrium ceiling, with the bottom edge dangling about 10 feet from the floor. Viewers will walk underneath the cone and look up at a show of light. In a sense, the piece is a Skyspace, because the light may enter through the glass roof; in another sense, it is a Ganzfeld, because the effect will be one of indistinct space and gloaming light. But in truth, nobody knows what it will be, except maybe -- hopefully -- Turrell.
''When you work with an artist like James,'' Giménez said one day as we stood in the center of the rotunda, ''the most important thing is to stand aside and make things possible for him.''
Trotman was trying to maintain the same perspective, but it wasn't easy. While Giménez spent most of her time in Madrid, he was responsible for coordinating the plans and logistics for a huge installation piece that he couldn't quite imagine. He had drawn renderings of the tower, but they were only speculation. Basic details were anybody's guess. It was unclear, for example, whether Turrell would leave the atrium window clear, or allow a small circle of light through, or block it off entirely. Whatever light did filter into the piece would change throughout the day, but Trotman had no idea how that would affect the color of the piece. In fact, he had no idea what color the piece would be. He hoped that Turrell would use a series of shifting hues that blurred from one to the next, but he didn't know if that would happen, and he didn't expect to know until a week or two before the opening, when the tower was in place and Turrell arrived to light it. When someone asked Trotman about the piece, he would usually shrug and say, ''I really don't know what he's going to do.''
To build the tower, the Guggenheim fabrication team rented a warehouse in New Jersey, and I joined Trotman there one afternoon for a look. The warehouse was a huge, grimy space lighted with fluorescent bulbs. In the center, the top portion of the tower dangled from hooks on the ceiling. A skin of white plastic was stretched around it, and a small crew of lighting assistants milled about, blasting different colors inside. Turrell's chief lighting expert, Matt Schreiber, stood below, looking up into the cone. Periodically, he would call out instructions, like, ''Can you make it cold white, and then start bringing it down?'' or, ''You know, the easiest is red -- when in doubt, make it red.''
Trotman stood to the side. During a pause, he approached Schreiber and asked, ''Do you have any way to know how bright it's going to be?''
Schreiber shook his head.
''You know,'' Trotman said, ''depending on what time of day it is, the light is going to change.''
''Yeah,'' Schreiber said. ''If we have time, we could make a night setting.''
Trotman smiled. ''That would be good,'' he said.
Schreiber called out, ''Make it blue,'' and stepped to the center of the ring. He turned to an assistant and said, ''This other blue, when you look at it next to a normal blue, looks white.''
Every curator who has worked with Turrell has been through an experience like Trotman's. It was a story I heard in museums and galleries all over the country. Richard Andrews, who ran the Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington for 20 years, told me about his own introduction to Turrell. It was 1981, and Andrews was a young artist himself. Like many artists, he was distressed that the galleries in town were not showing much contemporary work. He and his friends decided to rent an exhibition space of their own. It was a cavernous three-story warehouse with unfinished interiors, and on a whim, they asked Turrell to open their first show. To their shock, he agreed.
Turrell flew up to Seattle and began to help renovate the warehouse. He put together a list of pieces he wanted to show on the first floor, but as the months ticked past and the opening drew closer, he still had no plans for the upper level. ''I kept saying to him, 'So, what are you going to do?' '' Andrews recalled. ''And he basically, for months, said, 'I don't know.' ''
Finally, with only a couple of weeks remaining, Turrell had an idea. He asked the group to help him build a wall in the center of the room with three large rectangular holes. Then he climbed through the holes and began to hang fluorescent lights on the back of the wall. Andrews and his friends watched. They had no idea what Turrell was doing -- until at last he turned off the main lights and flipped on the ones he had installed. The rectangular windows exploded with brilliant light: an ethereal pink on the left, and a deep blue on the right, and in the middle a mélange of both colors that Andrews still can't quite explain. ''I can really only describe it as fog,'' he said. ''These two extraordinary colors moved toward each other and through each other, and it was just crazy.''
Today Andrews serves as the president of Skystone Foundation, a nonprofit organization that Turrell created to manage Roden Crater. One big part of Andrews's job is to raise enough money to finish the crater. Finding donors in the recession has been a daunting task, so Andrews has spent the past five years preparing for a future drive. One of the first things he knew he would need, if he wanted to raise several million dollars, was to know exactly what ''several'' means. When you're trying to solicit large amounts of cash, it's helpful to explain where the money is going. Earlier this year, Andrews and Turrell completed the first full set of blueprints for the crater -- detailing every screw, bolt, rod of reinforcing bar and cubic yard of concrete that the project will take.
Now that Andrews has the blueprints, he can estimate the costs; what remains is to grab the attention of the public and donors in a way that Turrell never has before. With so much of his work scattered across the globe, it can take years for a potential fan to discover Turrell. Even the best photography doesn't begin to capture the immersive experience. For those inclined to travel for art, the exhibitions this summer present the first opportunity to take in so much of his work at once. For Turrell, what his newly raised profile allows, maybe, is a chance to complete the crater, his life's work.
The afternoon sun was beginning to descend over Roden, and we left the lodge and followed a short path to the main entrance, a pair of high metal doors. As we stepped through, it was instantly apparent that none of my expectations had been right. For one thing, the room was several times larger than I had imagined. For another, it was as perfectly finished as the most elegant Midtown hotel.
We were in a circular room, with a slightly convex top, that Turrell calls the Sun and Moon Space. At the center of the room, a massive sheet of black stone rested on its edge. An eight-foot-diameter circle had been cut from the center and replaced with white marble. The seam where the two colors met was perfectly flush. One side of the slab faced the doors where we entered, which was precisely the direction of the rising sun at summer solstice. The other side faced the opening of a long tunnel, which rose gently into the distance. This was the direction of the moonset at its southernmost point in the lunar cycle. Every 18.61 years, the moon would align perfectly with the center of the tunnel, and Turrell had installed a five-foot diameter lens at the midpoint to refract its image onto the white circle. The next such occasion would be in 2025.
One by one, we walked up the tunnel. It was 854 feet long and 12 feet in diameter, with blue-black interior walls and ribs protruding every four feet. At the top, a great white circle of light beamed toward us. Or so it seemed. As we drew closer, the color changed from white to blue, and the shape began to shift, elongating from a circle to an oval and rising overhead, until it was clear that what had seemed to be a round opening at the far end of the tunnel was in fact an elliptical Skyspace in a large viewing room. A long, narrow staircase made of bronze ascended through it.
We climbed onto the top of the crater and stepped into the sun. Once again we were surrounded by a Martian landscape of crushed red stone. A cold wind blew across the caldera, and we lay down to view the sky, the clouds streaking overhead as the heavens vaulted.
Dusk was coming. We got up and followed a narrow ramp into another Skyspace. It was round, with a narrow bench around the perimeter. Turrell calls it ''Crater's Eye.'' We took seats on the bench and stared through the opening in silence. The color of the sky was deepening. It was rich with blue and darkness. It seemed to hover on the ceiling close enough to touch. No one spoke for 30 minutes. I glanced over at Turrell. His hands were folded in his lap, his eyes smiling at the sky. Whatever else the crater had become for him -- a job, a dream, an office, a persistent reminder of his own mortality -- it was clear that the Skyspace still had the power to lift him up from earth.
When the last hint of blue had vanished into night, Turrell and the others wandered outside. Trotman and I crept back into the crater. We passed the bronze staircase, glimmering in darkness, and we turned down the long tunnel toward the Sun and Moon Space. The white disc at the bottom glowed with ambient light, and Trotman walked toward it like a man in a trance. He disappeared from view. I stopped for a moment to stare down the tunnel. Then I turned around to face the sky through the ellipse. Something flashed at the corner of my eye and I glanced up. There was a tube of white light hovering in the air above me. It was thick and sturdy and looked as though I could grab it and climb into the stars. It streamed down the tunnel to the gleaming stone.
Back at the lodge, I took a seat beside Turrell at a table made of plywood. A few of his friends from town were preparing a dinner of beef from his ranch, and Turrell had brought several bottles of wine from another friend's vineyard. They all were whispering excitedly about what they'd seen. Turrell sat silently and sipped his wine. He didn't ask what I thought of the crater, and I didn't volunteer. It seemed as if we both knew that it was better not to say. The crater was perfect, and incomplete, and his time to finish it was winding down.
''You know,'' he told me earlier in the truck, ''I'd like to see it myself.''

HEADLINE: China Embarking On Vast Program Of Urbanization

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China is pushing ahead with a sweeping plan to move 250 million rural residents into newly constructed towns and cities over the next dozen years -- a transformative event that could set off a new wave of growth or saddle the country with problems for generations to come.
The government, often by fiat, is replacing small rural homes with high-rises, paving over vast swaths of farmland and drastically altering the lives of rural dwellers. So large is the scale that the number of brand-new Chinese city dwellers will approach the total urban population of the United States -- in a country already bursting with megacities.
This will decisively change the character of China, where the Communist Party insisted for decades that most peasants, even those working in cities, remain tied to their tiny plots of land to ensure political and economic stability. Now, the party has shifted priorities, mainly to find a new source of growth for a slowing economy that depends increasingly on a consuming class of city dwellers. 
The shift is occurring so quickly, and the potential costs are so high, that some fear rural China is once again the site of radical social engineering. Over the past decades, the Communist Party has flip-flopped on peasants' rights to use land: giving small plots to farm during 1950s land reform, collectivizing a few years later, restoring rights at the start of the reform era and now trying to obliterate small landholders.
Across China, bulldozers are leveling villages that date to long-ago dynasties. Towers now sprout skyward from dusty plains and verdant hillsides. New urban schools and hospitals offer modern services, but often at the expense of the torn-down temples and open-air theaters of the countryside.
''It's a new world for us in the city,'' said Tian Wei, 43, a former wheat farmer in the northern province of Hebei, who now works as a night watchman at a factory. ''All my life I've worked with my hands in the fields; do I have the educational level to keep up with the city people?''
China has long been home to both some of the world's tiniest villages and its most congested, polluted examples of urban sprawl. The ultimate goal of the government's modernization plan is to fully integrate 70 percent of the country's population, or roughly 900 million people, into city living by 2025. Currently, only half that number are.
The building frenzy is on display in places like Liaocheng, which grew up as an entrepôt for local wheat farmers in the North China Plain. It is now ringed by scores of 20-story towers housing now-landless farmers who have been thrust into city life. Many are giddy at their new lives -- they received the apartments free, plus tens of thousands of dollars for their land -- but others are uncertain about what they will do when the money runs out.
Aggressive state spending is planned on new roads, hospitals, schools, community centers -- which could cost upward of $600 billion a year, according to economists' estimates. In addition, vast sums will be needed to pay for the education, health care and pensions of the ex-farmers.
While the economic fortunes of many have improved in the mass move to cities, unemployment and other social woes have also followed the enormous dislocation. Some young people feel lucky to have jobs that pay survival wages of about $150 a month; others wile away their days in pool halls and video-game arcades.
Top-down efforts to quickly transform entire societies have often come to grief, and urbanization has already proven one of the most wrenching changes in China's 35 years of economic transition. Land disputes account for thousands of protests each year, including dozens of cases in recent years in which people have set themselves aflame rather than relocate.
The country's new prime minister, Li Keqiang, indicated at his inaugural news conference in March that urbanization was one of his top priorities. He also cautioned, however, that it would require a series of accompanying legal changes ''to overcome various problems in the course of urbanization.''
Some of these problems could include chronic urban unemployment if jobs are not available, and more protests from skeptical farmers unwilling to move. Instead of creating wealth, urbanization could result in a permanent underclass in big Chinese cities and the destruction of a rural culture and religion.
The government has been pledging a comprehensive urbanization plan for more than two years now. It was originally to have been presented at the National People's Congress in March, but various concerns delayed that, according to people close to the government. Some of them include the challenge of financing the effort, of coordinating among the various ministries and of balancing the rights of farmers, whose land has increasingly been taken forcibly for urban projects.
These worries delayed a high-level conference to formalize the plan this month. The plan has now been delayed until the fall, government advisers say. Central leaders are said to be concerned that spending will lead to inflation and bad debt.
Such concerns may have been behind the call in a recent government report for farmers' property rights to be protected. Released in March, the report said China must ''guarantee farmers' property rights and interests.'' Land would remain owned by the state, though, so farmers would not have ownership rights even under the new blueprint.
On the ground, however, the new wave of urbanization is well under way. Almost every province has large-scale programs to move farmers into housing towers, with the farmers' plots then given to corporations or municipalities to manage. Efforts have been made to improve the attractiveness of urban life, but the farmers caught up in the programs typically have no choice but to leave their land.
The broad trend began decades ago. In the early 1980s, about 80 percent of Chinese lived in the countryside versus 47 percent today, plus an additional 17 percent that works in cities but is classified as rural. The idea is to speed up this process and achieve an urbanized China much faster than would occur organically.
The primary motivation for the urbanization push is to change China's economic structure, with growth based on domestic demand for products instead of relying so much on export. In theory, new urbanites mean vast new opportunities for construction companies, public transportation, utilities and appliance makers, and a break from the cycle of farmers consuming only what they produce. ''If half of China's population starts consuming, growth is inevitable,'' said Li Xiangyang, vice director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics, part of a government research institute. ''Right now they are living in rural areas where they do not consume.''
Skeptics say the government's headlong rush to urbanize is driven by a vision of modernity that has failed elsewhere. In Brazil and Mexico, urbanization was also seen as a way to bolster economic growth. But among the results were the expansion of slums and of a stubborn unemployed underclass, according to experts.
''There's this feeling that we have to modernize, we have to urbanize and this is our national-development strategy,'' said Gao Yu, China country director for the Landesa Rural Development Institute, based in Seattle. Referring to the disastrous Maoist campaign to industrialize overnight, he added, ''It's almost like another Great Leap Forward.''
The costs of this top-down approach can be steep. In one survey by Landesa in 2011, 43 percent of Chinese villagers said government officials had taken or tried to take their land. That is up from 29 percent in a 2008 survey.
''In a lot of cases in China, urbanization is the process of local government driving farmers into buildings while grabbing their land,'' said Li Dun, a professor of public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
Farmers are often unwilling to leave the land because of the lack of job opportunities in the new towns. Working in a factory is sometimes an option, but most jobs are far from the newly built towns. And even if farmers do get jobs in factories, most lose them when they hit age 45 or 50, since employers generally want younger, nimbler workers.
''For old people like us, there's nothing to do anymore,'' said He Shifang, 45, a farmer from the city of Ankang in Shaanxi Province who was relocated from her family's farm in the mountains. ''Up in the mountains we worked all the time. We had pigs and chickens. Here we just sit around and people play mah-jongg.''
Some farmers who have given up their land say that when they come back home for good around this age, they have no farm to tend and thus no income. Most are still excluded from national pension plans, putting pressure on relatives to provide.
The coming urbanization plan would aim to solve this by giving farmers a permanent stream of income from the land they lost. Besides a flat payout when they moved, they would receive a form of shares in their former land that would pay the equivalent of dividends over a period of decades to make sure they did not end up indigent.
This has been tried experimentally, with mixed results. Outside the city of Chengdu, some farmers said they received nothing when their land was taken to build a road, leading to daily confrontations with construction crews and the police since the beginning of this year.
But south of Chengdu in Shuangliu County, farmers who gave up their land for an experimental strawberry farm run by a county-owned company said they receive an annual payment equivalent to the price of 2,000 pounds of grain plus the chance to earn about $8 a day working on the new plantation.
''I think it's O.K., this deal,'' said Huang Zifeng, 62, a farmer in the village of Paomageng who gave up his land to work on the plantation. ''It's more stable than farming your own land.''
Financing the investment needed to start such projects is a central sticking point. Chinese economists say that the cost does not have to be completely borne by the government -- because once farmers start working in city jobs, they will start paying taxes and contributing to social welfare programs.
''Urbanization can launch a process of value creation,'' said Xiang Songzuo, chief economist with the Agricultural Bank of China and a deputy director of the International Monetary Institute at Renmin University. ''It should start a huge flow of revenues.''
Even if this is true, the government will still need significant resources to get the programs started. Currently, local governments have limited revenues and most rely on selling land to pay for expenses -- an unsustainable practice in the long run. Banks are also increasingly unwilling to lend money to big infrastructure projects, Mr. Xiang said, because many banks are now listed companies and have to satisfy investors' requirements.
''Local governments are already struggling to provide benefits to local people, so why would they want to extend this to migrant workers?'' said Tom Miller, a Beijing-based author of a new book on urbanization in China, ''China's Urban Billion.'' ''It is essential for the central government to step in and provide funding for this.''
In theory, local governments could be allowed to issue bonds, but with no reliable system of rating or selling bonds, this is unlikely in the near term. Some localities, however, are already experimenting with programs to pay for at least the infrastructure by involving private investors or large state-owned enterprises that provide seed financing.
Most of the costs are borne by local governments. But they rely mostly on central government transfer payments or land sales, and without their own revenue streams they are unwilling to allow newly arrived rural residents to attend local schools or benefit from health care programs. This is reflected in the fact that China officially has a 53 percent rate of urbanization, but only about 35 percent of the population is in possession of an urban residency permit, or hukou. This is the document that permits a person to register in local schools or qualify for local medical programs.
The new blueprint to be unveiled this year is supposed to break this logjam by guaranteeing some central-government support for such programs, according to economists who advise the government. But the exact formulas are still unclear. Granting full urban benefits to 70 percent of the population by 2025 would mean doubling the rate of those in urban welfare programs.
''Urbanization is in China's future, but China's rural population lags behind in enjoying the benefits of economic development,'' said Li Shuguang, professor at the China University of Political Science and Law. ''The rural population deserves the same benefits and rights city folks enjoy.''
Leaving the Land: Articles in this series will look at how China's government-driven effort to push the population to towns and cities is reshaping a nation that for millenniums has been defined by its rural life.

BYLINE: By GREGORY COWLES

 BODY:
CREATION THEORY: ''My name is Odd Thomas. I have accepted my oddness. And I am no longer surprised that I am drawn to trouble as reliably as iron to a magnet.'' Thus proceeds ''Deeply Odd,'' the latest entry in Dean Koontz's popular series of goofy paranormal noir thrillers, which is new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 3. Koontz doesn't take himself too seriously: the villain in ''Deeply Odd'' is a long-haul trucker who dresses like a rhinestone cowboy and carries a .45 Sig Sauer instead of a guitar, while Odd Thomas, an unemployed fry cook determined to stop the trucker from killing three unknown victims, is accompanied on his travels by the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock. 
Beneath the sequins and the wisecracks, though, Koontz asks real questions about the nature of good and evil, and even proffers an aesthetic argument about the difference: ''Evil is not imaginative,'' he writes. ''It seeks to destroy, and destruction takes no imagination. Creation takes true imagination, the making of something new and wondrous, whether it's a song or an iPad, a novel or a new cooking surface more durable than Teflon, a new flavor of ice cream or spacecraft that can travel to the moon. The vibrant imagination of a fry cook with free will should easily trump the weak imagination of a demon anytime, anywhere.''
RUDDERLESS AMERICA: George Packer's new book, ''The Unwinding,'' climbs four places to No. 8 in its second week on the hardcover nonfiction list. A survey of the instability threatening America's institutions (financial, political, social, etc.), and the ways this ''unwinding'' affects ordinary people, the book has received largely admiring reviews: in the daily New York Times last month, Dwight Garner singled out Packer's ''Steinbeckian'' gifts and said it was ''close to a nonfiction masterpiece,'' while in the Book Review, David Brooks praised its narrative force even as he pined for a larger structural framework. But Maureen Tkacik, writing in The New York Observer, wouldn't have any of it. ''Depressing, depressing, depressing, despicable, depressing, annoying, depressing; repeat 8x,'' Tkacik summarized her take on the book. ''On some level this is Mr. Packer's point: rudderless, disconnected America needs a rudderless, disoriented book. Whatever; he's a hack.'' Packer can take some solace from the fact that his very appearance on the best-seller list casts doubt on at least one of Tkacik's claims: ''In Mr. Packer's defense,'' she wrote, ''his latest is not a book that seems designed to sell.''
NON-NATIVE SON: Philipp Meyer's second novel, ''The Son,'' enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 10. This book is the real deal: an old-fashioned, muscular epic that traces the history of Texas through the fortunes of one family, complete with Indian raids and oil wells. So it comes as a surprise to learn that Meyer grew up in a modest Baltimore neighborhood and worked as a derivatives trader for a couple of years before devoting himself to writing. ''I met these guys who knew all about Wall Street,'' he told The Austin American-Statesman recently, remembering his college career, ''and they were telling me about these guys who were 26 years old and making a half-million dollars a year. And that sounded like winning the lottery every year. So I decided whatever this takes, I'm going to do it.'' But the work made him unhappy, and Meyer eventually found his way to the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas. In researching his novel, he told the newspaper, he learned to track animals and drank buffalo blood at a ranch. ''It tasted musky,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Looser Tone, a Call to Take Risks and Be Engaged

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
A long, unpopular war had ended, but conflict brewed in the Middle East and the role of the United States in world affairs was in question. Months after his re-election, the president seemed to be in trouble amid revelations of government surveillance and secrecy.
This uncertain landscape of rapid change and deep unease greets the college graduates of 2013, just as it faced graduates in 1973. The parallels are striking. The apocalyptic mood that gripped the country when these graduates entered college (the Vietnam War and the draft for one generation, the financial meltdown and the recession for the other) had receded by graduation, and along with it a vocal protest movement.
Commencement speakers now and then worried about apathy born of cynicism and crisis fatigue. ''When my contemporaries ask me, 'What is the impact of the Watergate scandal on the young?' I have to reply, 'Very slight,' '' Kingman Brewster Jr., the president of Yale, said 40 years ago. ''They are not surprised. Their basic response is 'What would you expect?' That is too bad, but it's so.'' 
In each time, a profound, long-term change in social attitudes was under way, to the benefit of gays now and women and blacks then. In 1973, Princeton graduated the first class to have had women in it from the beginning; they numbered only in the dozens.
''The revolution which women are trying to make is one so long and so deep and so serious that it makes all the Watergates of the world seem like very small patriarchal episodes,'' Gloria Steinem told graduating students at Simmons College in Boston 40 years ago.
But the speeches have changed, and not just because a single topic, Watergate, dominated them in 1973. The speakers then were overwhelmingly white and male, addressing lofty matters in mostly impersonal terms.
The addresses of 2013 were much more personal, infused with self-deprecating humor, raunchy asides and references to the speakers' own humble or distant origins. The looser tone fits a looser time, and some speakers now work with neither prepared texts nor fear of grammatical error.
In an era of less rigid career and life expectations, the speeches are peppered with exhortations to take risks. There are acknowledgments that making a living could be hard, as well as an embrace of failure as a learning experience, that would have been hard to imagine in 1973.
But one central message has not changed: Be engaged in the world around you, politically and otherwise, for there is much work to do.

''None of us at Twitter thought during the earthquake and ensuing tsunami in Fukushima, Japan, that our service would be a great alternative communication platform if the mobile networks in Japan were spotty in the aftermath. And certainly none of us even hoped, let alone considered, that our platform would be one of those used to organize protests across the Middle East, in Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring.
Here's the amazing thing about what I've observed when I've witnessed all those things. Not only can you not plan the impact you're going to have, you often won't recognize it even while you're having it. ...
From here on out, you have to switch gears. You're no longer meeting and exceeding expectations. There are no expectations. There's no script. When you're doing what you love to do, you become resilient, because that's the habit you create for yourself. You create a habit of taking chances on yourself and making bold choices in service to doing what you love.
If, on the other hand, you do what's expected of you, or what you're supposed to do, and things go poor or chaos ensues -- as it surely will -- you will look to external sources for what to do next, because that will be the habit you've created for yourself. You'll be standing there, frozen, on the stage of your own life.''

''My parents were aghast. They had been told Columbia was a hotbed of communism. To me, that was a selling point. It was 1956, and I was in full James Dean rebellion mode in Corpus Christi, Tex. ...
Freshman orientation week, my adviser told me that he expected my time at Columbia to be brief. He thought my Texas public schools background had ill prepared me for the rigors of a Columbia education and that I had only been given a scholarship in a, he thought, misguided effort on the college's part to attract a more diverse student body and mitigate Columbia's reputation as the Jewish commuter college in the Ivy League. ...
We here today are so overprivileged it hurts. If we don't take advantage of the opportunity we have been given, we are true fools -- and callous ones at that. Columbia is a gift. It's so easy to matter, to make a difference. It's even easier not to do either. But then we have failed ourselves and this institution.''

Over the course of my scientific career, I would say that roughly three-quarters of the things I tried either failed or morphed into something oftentimes better.''

''If you're constantly pushing yourself higher, higher, the law of averages -- not to mention the myth of Icarus -- predicts that you will at some point fall. And when you do, I want you to know this, remember this: There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.
Now, when you're down there in the hole, it looks like failure. So this past year I had to spoon-feed those words to myself. And when you're down in the hole, when that moment comes, it's really O.K. to feel bad for a little while. Give yourself time to mourn what you think you may have lost, but then here's the key: Learn from every mistake because every experience, encounter and particularly your mistakes are there to teach you and force you into being more who you are. And then figure out what is the next right move. And the key to life is to develop an internal moral, emotional GPS that can tell you which way to go.''

''A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate -- these are the folks who reap the largest rewards.
The only way for even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world and to share their luck with others.''

''There was a group of kids that used to hang in the lobby of my building. ... One in particular, he reminded me of my dad. He had that quick wit, that great swagger. ...
One month into my time as mayor, I got another call for a shooting. It was on Court Street in our city, and I go down there and I do the same thing. I'm going to people, telling them about our plans, telling them that we had to pull together, that we were going to fight through this crime, that we were going to drive down the violence. I barely paid attention to the dead body on the sidewalk and another one being rolled into an ambulance.
After that night of being important, of being mayor of New Jersey's biggest city, I went back to my home in the high-rises of Brick Towers. I sat there with my BlackBerry reviewing the incident reports of the day, and then it came to that shooting on Court Street. And I looked at that BlackBerry, and I saw the name of the murder victim. It was the kid from my lobby. It was the young man who was my father. It was this smart and charismatic young man who God had put in front of me every single day.
I looked at my BlackBerry praying that the name would somehow change, praying that it was a mistake or maybe not the same young man, but it was him. ... How could we all crowd a funeral home for his death? Where were we for his life? God had put him right in front of my face, but I was charging off, to do important things. I could not see what was right in front of me.''

''All too often, those big ideas run up against the challenge of the everyday: in particular, how to find work that pays the bills. A lot of the time, meaningful work becomes necessary work, and passions are forced to fade. The easy part is knowing that you should follow your heart and do something important; the hard part is coping with the world as it is today at the same time as you invent how it should be in the future.
But inventing the future -- in spite of the greatest recession since the Great Depression -- is exactly what our generation does. If there's any core attribute that connects you to me to everyone else of our age, it's this conviction that we do not have to take the world as it is; in fact, it's up to us to make it what it should be. ...
If there's one thing you do after graduating today, create some habit that makes it easier for you to get out of your bubble. Follow someone you disagree with on Twitter. Buy a subscription to a newspaper or a magazine that will tell you the most important news of the day. Install an app on your phone that doesn't just filter the news by your social network, but by what you need to read. Not only will these habits make you a better citizen, they'll make you a more interesting husband or wife, and certainly a more informed job applicant.''

''Of course, all the hype about how connected you are has contributed to a counternarrative -- that, in fact, your generation is increasingly disconnected from the things that matter. The arguments go something like this: Instead of spending time with friends, you spend it alone, collecting friend requests. Rather than savoring your food, you take pictures of it and post them on Facebook.
I want to encourage you to reject the cynics who say technology is flattening your experience of the world. ...
Technology is just a tool. It's a powerful tool, but it's just a tool. Deep human connection is very different. It's not a tool. It's not a means to an end. It is the end -- the purpose and the result of a meaningful life -- and it will inspire the most amazing acts of love, generosity and humanity. ...
I want you to connect because I believe it will inspire you to do something, to make a difference in the world. Humanity in the abstract will never inspire you in the same way as the human beings you meet. Poverty is not going to motivate you. But people will motivate you.''

We need your help in closing the yawning gaps in inequality so that your lot in life is not determined by what you inherit but by what you earn. We need you to change our culture so that we no longer accept so many men and women having children out of wedlock -- dads as well as moms must step up and end this epidemic.
In the Civil War, the sons of affluent merchants fought alongside field hands who had left their plows. Together, they became brothers. We must restore that sense that we are all one family -- that we are in this together. And yours is the generation that can get us there.''

In fact, some of you may be his actual heirs -- we're still testing the DNA.
If you must find your own path, and we have left you no easy path, then decide now to choose the hard path that leads to the life and the world you want.

HEADLINE: Even Pessimists Feel Optimistic Over Economy

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
For more than a decade, the economy has failed to grow the way it once did. Unemployment has not stayed this high, this long, since the 1930s.
But could the New Normal, as this long economic slog has been called, be growing old?
That is the surprising new view of a number of economists in academia and on Wall Street, who are now predicting something the United States has not experienced in years: healthier, more lasting growth.
The improving outlook is one reason the stock market has risen so sharply this year, even if street-level evidence for a turnaround, like strong job growth and income gains, has been scant so far.
A prominent convert to this emerging belief is Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University near Washington and author of ''The Great Stagnation,'' a 2011 best seller, who has gone from doomsayer to a decidedly more optimistic perspective. 
He is not predicting an imminent resurgence. Like most academic economists, Mr. Cowen focuses on the next quarter-century rather than the next quarter. But new technologies like artificial intelligence and online education, increased domestic energy production and slowing growth in the cost of health care have prompted Mr. Cowen to reappraise the country's prospects.
''It's better than it looked,'' Mr. Cowen said. ''Technological progress comes in batches and it's just a little more rapid than it looked two years ago.'' His next book, ''Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation,'' is due out in September.
Certainly, there are significant headwinds that will not abate anytime soon, including an aging population, government austerity, the worst income inequality in nearly a century and more than four million long-term unemployed workers.
These and other forces prompted some leading economists, led by Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern, to conclude not long ago that the arc of American economic growth for centuries was over, to be replaced by decades of stagnation. Productivity might grow steadily, Professor Gordon argued, but the benefits will not flow to most Americans.
Other analysts are challenging that perspective, which they said was colored, in part, by the severe downturn that hit the global economy more than five years ago. And some of them now see a brighter outlook right around the corner, not just far into the future.
Two widely followed economic forecasters, Morgan Stanley and IHS Global Insight, have both increased their estimates for growth in recent days.
''It's been a long time coming,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. ''There is more optimism about the U.S. and in particular about the second half of this year and 2014. Three months ago, we wouldn't have come to that same conclusion.''
Indeed, a number of forecasters are now predicting that the expansion, which began in 2009 and has remained subpar ever since, might prove to be far more durable than the typical five-to-six-year growth cycle, in part because of the absence of the traditional boom, then bust pattern.
The optimistic view is hardly universal and there have been premature proclamations of better days before, most famously the ''green shoots'' spotted by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, in 2009.
Whether or not the economy is poised to grow faster in the months ahead will be the central question when Federal Reserve policy makers meet this week, with more volatility expected on Wall Street as traders look for any sign the Fed is ready to taper back its huge stimulus efforts.
Whatever the Fed's conclusion, many analysts insist the more upbeat view is justified this time.
In particular, Mr. Behravesh and other economists said, the economy has shown greater resilience than expected in the face of tax increases and spending cuts in Washington. As the impact from this fiscal tightening eases, the overall growth rate should pick up.
Mr. Behravesh now expects the annual growth rate to rise to 2.9 percent in 2014 and 3.5 percent in 2015. If he's right, it would mark the fastest annual growth since 2005, when the economy expanded by 3.1 percent. It is also well above the 2 percent rise in output the economy has averaged over the last three years.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also sees relatively fast growth of 3.4 percent next year, and 3.6 percent between 2015 and 2018.
A few other private economists are even more bullish. Jim Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan Chase's commercial bank, estimates the economy could expand by 4 percent in both 2014 and 2015. If that were to come to pass, it would be the strongest back-to-back annual growth since the late 1990s.
''I think 2014 will be the real deal,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''If we get to that level, which I feel pretty confident about, economists will say it's about time.''
Mr. Cowen, who is also an occasional contributor to the Sunday Business section of The New York Times, is more skeptical about a short-term takeoff, focusing instead on what he sees as a brightening, longer-term picture of the United States economy.
The recent surge in domestic oil and gas production signals ''the start of a new era of cheap energy,'' he said, while less expensive online education programs could open the door to millions of people who have been priced out of more traditional academics.
At the same time, Mr. Cowen said, he now expects subtler improvements in the country's economic well-being that will not necessarily be reflected in statistics like gross domestic product, but will be significant nonetheless.
For example, slower growth in the cost of health care will be a boon for the government and businesses, but will actually subtract from reported economic activity. ''It's like the music industry,'' he said. ''Revenues are lower at record companies but the experience for listeners is better.''
Martin Neil Baily, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton, said he has always been skeptical of Professor Gordon's long-term view but has recently become more hopeful about the short-term as well.
''I don't buy the historical wave theory,'' he said. ''He's right that there are headwinds like slowing population growth but the tech revolution is still very much happening.''
In terms of the immediate future, ''I thought there was a distinct possibility that spending cuts and tax increases might stall the economy,'' he said. ''I'm more optimistic now because we seem to be weathering it. There is a sense that we are going to get through this.''
The current debate has turned out to be one of the most important ones in years among economists, who half-jokingly refer to their field as the dismal science. Some well-known experts challenge the new optimists. J. Bradford DeLong, an economics professor at University of California at Berkeley, sees few signs of a rebound, adding that Washington's austerity policies only ''dig the hole we are in deeper.'' The percentage of workers in the labor force remains at lows not seen for a quarter-century.
''The great stagnation will end for a lot of people but not everyone,'' Mr. Cowen said. ''I think there will be great breakthroughs but the distribution of those gains will go to owners of capital and intellectual property.''
How big will these breakthroughs really be? That issue is crucial for Professor Gordon of Northwestern, arguably the most influential pessimist among academic economists today.
While computers and the Internet hold revolutionary possibilities, he said, they will not affect living standards or productivity the way the innovations of the last 150 years did, citing developments like railroads, electrification, indoor plumbing and the like.
''Electronics has already had its revolution with the Internet, the personal computer and e-commerce,'' he said. ''Advances in the future will doubtlessly be impressive, but the real impact of the electronic revolutions has already occurred.''
Whether pessimists or optimists, economists do not have a great track record of predicting the future. Many feared the Great Depression might return after World War II ended, only to see the economy boom in the postwar era. Similarly, few foresaw the financial crisis of 2008 or the depth of the most recent recession.
Mr. Bernanke said that the near-term outlook remains murky but nonetheless put himself firmly in the optimists' camp in a commencement speech last month at Bard College at Simon's Rock in Massachusetts.
Acknowledging Mr. Gordon's point that living standards have not advanced since the 1960s the way they did in the previous 50-year period, he nevertheless echoed Mr. Cowen's newfound optimism about innovation.
''Both humanity's capacity to innovate and the incentives to innovate,'' he said, ''are greater today than at any other time in history.''

HEADLINE: Carving a Career

BYLINE: By CHARLES BENGOCHEA. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Havana, but in 1959 my family left Cuba as the political regime was changing. I later became a naturalized American citizen.
I grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with my older brother, Arturo, who was named after my paternal grandfather, the president of Cuba's winter baseball league at the time of our move.
I shared that love of baseball and played in summer leagues and at school in Florida. I was an all-state catcher in high school. I also played on the baseball team and was recognized as an academic All-American at Cornell, where I graduated in 1979 with a degree in economics. 
My first job was as a General Electric financial management trainee in Portsmouth, Va. Later, I became an analyst for the company's television business division.
In 1987, I went to work in Atlanta for the Coca-Cola Company's fountain division, which sold directly to restaurants and fast-food chains. I moved up to become the division's controller.
In 1995, Coke asked me to be chief financial officer for its bottling operations in Spain. I spoke Spanish and it was a great opportunity, but it would have meant moving my family. That wasn't an option since my two oldest children were pursuing their love of baseball.
So I left Coke, and came to work for HoneyBaked Ham in Georgia as director of retail operations. I was promoted through the ranks, and was named president in 2003. Three years later, I succeeded Linda van Rees as chief executive of the Georgia division and she became our chairwoman.
Linda is the granddaughter of Harry Hoenselaar, who invented a spiral-slicing machine and, in 1957, opened the first HoneyBaked Ham location in Michigan. He later split the company among his daughters into four divisions: Georgia, Ohio, Michigan and New England.
Last fall, HoneyBaked Ham of Georgia bought the New England operation, so now there are three divisions. We have 70 people in Alpharetta, and well over 1,000 in our stores. During peak seasons, our numbers grow fivefold; about 60 percent of our sales are made in November and December, and an additional 10 percent are made in advance of the Easter holidays.
We sell through company and franchise stores, catalogs and the Internet, which is a growing percentage of our business. We share a Web site with the other divisions. In advance of the big holidays, we also have pop-up stores inside some major grocery chains.
I am looking forward to our first international venture this fall: selling our bone-in hams in Japan, in partnership with Toranomon Ham.
Like other companies, HoneyBaked Ham of Georgia had difficult times in the economic downturn, which began to hit us in 2007. We had to close some stores then, but since 2009, we have grown each year, expanding to 200 franchise stores and nearly 115 company stores. We are in the middle of a three-year renovation of our company stores, adding dining areas to many of them.
My top priority is still my family. My wife, Laurie, and I have been married for 37 years. We have two boys and two girls, ages 21 to 33. One son is in the business, running two of our HoneyBaked cafe franchises.
I'm a born-again Christian, serving as chairman of the elders at the Fellowship Bible Church in Roswell, Ga. I have served on the boards of several local ministries.
I like to compete in triathlons. I have completed eight Ironman competitions, which means swimming 2.4 miles, bicycling 112 miles and running 26.2 miles -- all in the same day. Training is grueling and takes a lot of time, but competing is an amazing, rewarding experience.

HEADLINE: Where the Bridal Bouquet Is All Around You

BYLINE: By CAROLE OTTESEN

 BODY:
The ever-present risk of a thunderstorm or insect swarm aside, for those who delight in moonlight and stars, the first day of summer or the dazzle of a fall day, nothing will do but a garden wedding.
But as with marriages themselves, committing to a garden wedding represents a leap of faith and often a sizable wallet. Such events also require a knack for planning and, for some, a strong back and green thumb.
Ellen Myer remembered her garden wedding in a friend's backyard in Washington: ''It was a private space, personal, nondenominational, full of color and yet calm, it represented new beginnings and growth, it was intimate,'' she said. ''It was romantic in the grander sense and fun to dress up in garden party clothes. I had a beautiful garden dress and big basket of flowers.''
She recalled running to the garden center for flowers, ''to stuff the bare places and hang baskets everywhere.'' 
Joan Aghevli, also from Washington, has one daughter who married in a garden and another who plans to do so next year. Garden weddings, Ms. Aghevli said, reach back subconsciously ''to a mythical -- but no less powerful for that -- perfection, a sort of Garden of Eden, of perfect and blameless innocence, a fresh start.''
A home garden wedding, intimate and economical, demands planning and, often, planting. Cindy McNatt, a gardener in Orange County, Calif., spent only $40 for seeds in preparation for her daughter's wedding, starting the seeds 14 weeks in advance of the event. But don't try this unless you do the grunt work she did first: deadheading perennials, pruning shrubs, digging compost deeply into the soil, concocting a special fertilizer to ''push'' plants into bloom and, when desperate, using tinfoil to reflect heat and light.
In addition, it may be necessary to rent chairs, tables, linens and, yes, portable toilets.
In sunny yards, advised Anne Brooks, a Maryland floral designer, ''Figure the angle of the sun at the time of the wedding'' so that guests won't have to squint at the bride. In a wooded yard, check for tree roots and poison ivy. And you might also consider asking neighbors to allow guests to park in their driveways.
Today, the staffs at most sylvan public and private gardens will decorate for you. All you need is a checkbook and a date.
Popular sites book quickly. LongHouse Reserve in East Hampton, N.Y., the estate of the textile designer, author and collector Jack Lenor Larsen, hosts only one wedding each year. The response to the question ''Is the garden free this year, and, if so, what is the fee?'' was a terse ''No; $25,000.'' And then a click.
A call to the Japanese Garden at the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys, Calif., got a more eloquent reply. Designed by the landscape architect Koichi Kawana, who died in 1990, the garden demonstrates that a sewage-treatment plant can be an extremely popular wedding location.
''It is beautiful,'' said Jennifer Robinson, who lucked into another couple's cancellation to book her and her husband's wedding there last year.
The Victorian Garden at the Queens Botanical Garden in Flushing calls to mind an open-air church -- planted urns line a long stone aisle leading to a pergola ''altar.'' Darcy Hector, its director of marketing and development, said that it must ''be reserved a year in advance for a really desirable date.''
Last April, when Ms. Aghevli's daughter Kimi Aghevli and her fiancé, Ned Darrell, of Baltimore, began searching for a garden space for their June 2014 wedding, they found many desirable dates already booked. ''We had a romantic attachment to the full moon, or Midsummer's Eve,'' Joan Aghevli said.
The couple have yet to decide on the date, but the wedding may take place at the classical yet whimsical Ladew Topiary Gardens in Monkton, Md. The formal gardens at Ladew, once the hunt-country estate of Harvey S. Ladew, whose passions were fox hunting and topiary, showcase quirky topiaries, including one evoking a hunt scene complete with a top-hatted rider and hounds in hot pursuit of a fox.
Mr. Darrell said that he likes the convenience of the ''one-stop shopping'' offered by Ladew, whose chef would prepare a tasting menu to help the couple decide what to serve.
''Whimsy is just the right word'' for Grounds for Sculpture, said Melissa Martynenko, who had her wedding reception at Rat's (think of ''The Wind in the Willows''), the restaurant at this 42-acre sculpture garden and exhibition space in Hamilton, N.J. Wedding photos show the bride and her groom, Jeffrey Hodge, embedded in one of the artist Seward Johnson's three-dimensional works, ''Sailing the Seine,'' a takeoff on Manet's ''Argenteuil.'' Fanciful sculptures by Mr. Johnson and others, Ms. Martynenko said, are what ''takes it down a notch from something so formal.''
Couples need to be aware that large public gardens may stay open to the public during the ceremony. At a May wedding in Glen Echo Park, a former amusement park in Glen Echo, Md., a wedding planner frantically cleared a path for the wedding party's entrance through a crowd attending an art opening.
Some people, like Mary Jean Port, an enthusiastic Minnesota gardener who was married in September 2000, create a wedding garden after their events as a way of commemorating them. In lieu of more traditional wedding presents, Ms. Port asked her guests for gifts of plants to establish a wedding garden in the couple's front yard. One gift, the rose Diana, Princess of Wales, she thought was a rather laughable addition to a wedding garden, considering the fate of the princess' marriage. ''But I have a dark sense of humor,'' she said.
Each year, the couple celebrate their anniversary by planting another peony.
Planting a ceremonial tree, a wonderfully romantic wedding ritual, succeeds in the right place -- usually not a small yard where mowing around it may turn memento into annoyance.
Should the marriage end, the tree may grow on as a monument to disaffection. Such was the case with the Jenny Sanford Wedding Garden at the Governor's Mansion in Charleston, S.C., a permanent reminder of the very public divorce of Gov. Mark Sanford and Jenny Sanford.
Reflecting on the Sanford garden and divorce, a Wisconsin nurseryman, Neil Diboll, offered this haiku: ''Garden beds we made, / For matrimonial bliss, / Flowers gone too soon.''
If the stormy weather of late has not served as enough of a reminder, Ms. Brooks, a conservative by virtue of experience, said, ''Garden weddings are wonderful, but hoping for good weather on the big day adds extra anxiety.'' A backup plan, be it a tent with a floor or an inside space, she added, ''is the only rule I live by.''
This year, those planning a garden wedding anywhere between North Carolina and Connecticut share another emerging concern: cicadas, the so-called 17-year locusts. Peaking in June, billions of cicadas are expected to produce a mating roar and coat trees, shrubs and lawns with crunchy exoskeletons. Harmless but annoying, cicadas are unstoppable.
For those seeking advice on how to contend with them, most agree that there appear to be only two good choices.
One, plan a destination wedding to someplace where the cicadas won't be and where the roses flower all summer -- like the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay.
The other? Find a louder band.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Many Nest Eggs Look Fragile

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
MANY Americans don't have enough money to carry them through retirement -- and many of them know it.
That's clear from recent studies, and it's evident in the responses to last week's Strategies column, ''For Retirees, a Million-Dollar Illusion.''
The column showed that in this environment of ultralow interest rates, a retired couple could easily exhaust a $1 million bond portfolio, even with relatively modest withdrawals. 
Most households only wish they had that kind of money. As I wrote on the Bucks blog in an initial response to readers, the column focused on $1 million because of its symbolic power, not because it represents the savings of a typical American family.
In fact, the median financial net worth of American households of all ages, excluding homes and cars, is $10,890, as estimated by Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. For households headed by those in the 55-to-64 age bracket, it's $61,300. A large majority of Americans are in far worse straits than the millionaire households.
Some readers asked how to protect their financial nest eggs. Others observed that in this economy, saving more and spending less wasn't always possible. I'll return to challenges like these in future weeks.
But first, it's worth examining some of the systemic issues that led to this state of affairs. My previous column didn't directly address the big picture -- and that picture is troubling.
As Jack VanDerhei, research director of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute, puts it, ''very large numbers of people are at risk of running out of money in retirement.'' In a recent study, the institute found that roughly 44 percent of households in the baby boom and Gen X generations -- those born from 1948 to 1975 -- were likely to run short of cash in their retirement years.
And forthcoming research from the institute finds that low bond yields are worsening the situation. These low rates are unlikely to continue indefinitely; global markets last week were in disarray over speculation that the Federal Reserve might take action that could lead to higher rates. But if current low yields did persist indefinitely, Mr. VanDerhei has found, 56.7 percent of boomer and Gen X households would find themselves at risk of running through all their assets in their lifetimes.
Many people sense that they're heading toward danger. In an October survey by Pew Research, 38 percent of adults said they were ''not too'' or ''not at all'' confident that they would have enough income and assets for retirement, up from 25 percent in late February and March of 2009. Strikingly, more than half of those in their late 30s were in the not-confident categories, compared with only about one-third of those in their early 60s.
One reason for this disparity may be that many people in their 30s have barely been exposed to the traditional pensions -- known as defined-benefit pensions -- that were the dominant retirement vehicles until the late 1980s. Older people often have rights to what's left of those traditional pensions.
In the private sector, when retirement plans exist at all, old-fashioned pensions have largely been supplanted by 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans. While the introduction of default options has improved matters, how much to save and how to invest the money are fundamentally the responsibility of employees, who are directly affected by the vicissitudes of the markets.
''It's crazy that we ended up with this as our retirement system,'' said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The 401(k), she says, was intended as a supplement to a traditional pension and to Social Security. ''It was supposed to be money that you could use to go to Paris,'' she said. ''Instead, it's become our basic system.''
Because we depend on accounts like 401(k)'s, she said, we should strengthen them through measures like mandatory automatic enrollment and incentives for employee contributions of at least 10 percent of wages, with an employer match equal to half of those paycheck deductions.
BUT 401(k)'s are only part of the problem. When people leave a job, they often ''roll over'' their accumulated workplace holdings into an individual retirement account, for which they bear sole responsibility. By now, I.R.A.'s are the biggest repository of private sector retirement assets. In the fourth quarter last year, according to Federal Reserve figures, I.R.A.'s contained $5.4 trillion, compared with $4.1 trillion for defined-contribution plans and only $2.5 trillion for defined-benefit plans.
Yet many people are ill equipped to manage these vital assets. And because asset management firms aren't all required to follow a uniform fiduciary standard, individuals may not always be getting advice that is solely in their best interests.
Then there's Social Security. Mr. VanDerhei says it's essential. It should prevent older people from becoming entirely destitute if all else fails, even if medical and nursing care drains their cash in retirement. If Social Security benefits were eventually cut, as is sometimes contemplated, many more people would find themselves in distress. How would society cope then? ''That's the $64,000 question,'' he said.
So what is to be done? The problems are huge and may require big solutions. Individuals can weigh in on these public policy issues, and they can take measures to improve their own prospects. Professor Munnell's institute provides guidelines for how much you might try to save, how much you might be able to spend safely and when you can afford to retire. (The numbers look better when you save early and retire later.)
Mr. VanDerhei has helped build an online calculator that gives a ballpark estimate of ''approximately how much you need to save to fund a comfortable retirement.'' Many financial firms offer such calculators, too, though they may use them as marketing devices to sell their services.
How to navigate the markets -- and how to maximize your chances with the assets you've accumulated -- is a major concern of this column. Over time, expect further answers.

HEADLINE: Unintentional Motherhood

BYLINE: By JOSHUA LANG

 BODY:
S. arrived alone at a Planned Parenthood in Richmond, Calif., four days before Christmas. As she filled out her paperwork, she looked at the women around her. Nearly all had someone with them; S. wondered if they also felt terrible about themselves or if having someone along made things easier. She began to cry quietly. She kept reminding herself that she felt secure in her decision. ''I knew that that was going to be the right-wrong thing to do,'' she told me later. ''I was ready for it.''
After S. urinated in a cup, she was led into a small room. She texted one of her sisters, ''Do you think God would forgive me if I were to murder my unborn child?'' It was the first time anyone in her family knew she was pregnant.
''Where are you?'' her sister asked. ''Are you O.K.?'' 
''I'm at Planned Parenthood, about to have an abortion.''
''God knows your heart, and I understand that you are not ready,'' her sister texted back. ''I think God will understand.''
The pregnancy had crept up on S. She was a strong believer in birth control -- in high school she was selected to help teach sex education. But having been celibate for months and strapped for cash, she stopped taking the pill. Then an ex-boyfriend came around. For months after, she had only a little spotting, but because her periods are typically light, she didn't think much of it at first. Then she started to worry. ''I used to press on my stomach really hard thinking maybe it would make my period come,'' she said.
Around Thanksgiving in 2011, S., then 24, took her first pregnancy test -- a home kit from Longs Drugs. S. (her first initial) lived alone, with her dog and her parrot, and it was late at night when she read the results. She stared into space, past the plastic stick. She'd never been pregnant before. ''I cried. I was heartbroken.'' Her ex had begun a new relationship, and she knew he wouldn't be there to support her or a child. She was working five part-time jobs to keep herself afloat and still didn't always have enough money for proper meals. How could she feed a baby? She kept the news to herself and made an appointment at Planned Parenthood.
At the clinic, a counselor comforted S. and asked her why she had come, if anyone had coerced her into making this decision. No, S. explained, she was simply not ready to have a child. The woman asked how far along she thought she might be. S. estimated that she was about three months pregnant.
In the exam room, a technician asked her to lie down. She did an ultrasound, sliding the instrument across S.'s stomach: ''Oh . . . it shows here that you are a little further along.'' She repeated the exam. S., she estimated, was nearly 20 weeks pregnant, too far along for this Planned Parenthood clinic. S. felt numb: ''I was thinking, If it is too late here, it is probably too late other places. . . . And I was like, Oh, my God, now what?''
Planned Parenthood gave S. a packet of information, including two pieces of paper -- one green, for adoption, and one yellow, for other abortion providers. S. still wanted to have an abortion. She called a clinic in Oakland and took the first available appointment, just after Christmas. ''I was a ticking time bomb, running out of days,'' she told me. On the Internet, another of S.'s sisters also found a place called First Resort, which provided abortion counseling. S. didn't know that First Resort's president once said that ''abortion is never the right answer.'' (A spokeswoman for First Resort says that while the organization ''takes no public stand on legalized abortion,'' it ''does not provide abortions or abortion referrals.'')
S. went to First Resort the day before her appointment in Oakland, unsure what to expect. It provided a free ultrasound. The nurse asked S. if she wanted to see the baby and turned the monitor toward her: ''Look! Your baby is smiling at you.'' S. was shaken, convinced she also saw the baby smiling. The nurse told her that she was at least a week further along than the Planned Parenthood estimate (ultrasound estimates can be off by several days either way). S. sobbed all the way to her car and called the clinic in Oakland, giving it the First Resort estimate. If it was correct, they told her, she would be past its deadline. S. never made it to the Oakland clinic and in a matter of days gave up looking for another clinic that could perform a later procedure. She was out of gas money, hadn't eaten a decent meal in weeks and resigned herself to the fact that, no matter what she wanted or how it would affect her life, she was going to have a baby.
When Diana Greene Foster, a demographer and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, first began studying women who were turned away from abortion clinics, she was struck by how little data there were. A few clinics kept records, but no one had compiled them nationally. And there was no research on how these women fared over time. What, Foster wondered, were the consequences of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term? Did it take a higher psychological or economic toll than having an abortion? Or was the reverse true -- did the new baby make up for any social or financial difficulties?
''It's not that the study was so hard to do,'' Foster says. But no one had done it before. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, the debate over abortion has focused primarily on the ramifications of having one. The abortion rights community maintains that abortion is safe, both physically and psychologically -- a position most scientists endorse. Those on the anti-abortion side argue that abortion is immoral, can cause a fetus pain and leads to long-lasting negative physical and psychological effects in the women who have the procedure. There is no credible research to support a ''post-abortion syndrome,'' as a report published by the American Psychological Association in 2008 made clear. Yet the notion has influenced restrictive laws in many states. In Alabama, women who seek an abortion must have an ultrasound and be offered the option to view the image; in South Dakota, women must wait at least 72 hours after a consultation with a doctor before having the procedure. ''The unstated assumption of most new abortion restrictions -- mandatory ultrasound viewing, waiting periods, mandated state 'information,' '' Foster says, ''is that women don't know what they are doing when they try to terminate a pregnancy. Or they can't make a decision they won't regret.'' Lost in the controversy, however, is the flip side of the question. What, Foster wondered, could the women who did not have the abortions they sought tell us about the women who did?
Most studies on the effects of abortion compare women who have abortions with those who choose to carry their pregnancies to term. It is like comparing people who are divorced with people who stay married, instead of people who get the divorce they want with the people who don't. Foster saw this as a fundamental flaw. By choosing the right comparison groups -- women who obtain abortions just before the gestational deadline versus women who miss that deadline and are turned away -- Foster hoped to paint a more accurate picture. Do the physical, psychological and socioeconomic outcomes for these two groups of women differ? Which is safer for them, abortion or childbirth? Which causes more depression and anxiety? ''I tried to measure all the ways in which I thought having a baby might make you worse off,'' Foster says, ''and the ways in which having a baby might make you better off, and the same with having an abortion.''
Foster began by gathering data locally. She ran the study out of her office at U.C.S.F. (I am a student in the U.C. Berkeley-U.C.S.F. Joint Medical Program but did not know Foster before reporting this article.) When the counselors at a nearby abortion clinic received a woman who was too far along to terminate her pregnancy, they called Foster, who would run over and arrange to interview the patient. Given the stigma attached to seeking an abortion later in pregnancy, Foster expected that many women would be reluctant to be part of her study. But four out of five women agreed to participate. ''Sometimes, if you tell them that their experience is valuable, that it might help other people in their situation, they will come through,'' she says.
Initially, Foster's study was confined to women whose pregnancies were in a narrow band of time on either side of this particular clinic's gestational limit -- two weeks under or three weeks over. (In California, state law allows an abortion up to what a physician considers viability, but clinics can set their own limits.) Eventually Foster received multiple foundation grants that allowed her to hire additional staff and recruit more subjects. The study, which is ongoing, encompasses 30 clinics from 21 states across the country. The clinics' gestational limits vary from 10 weeks to the end of the second trimester, with a vast majority falling in the second trimester, typically defined as Weeks 14 to 26 of pregnancy. Women turned away from these ''last stop'' clinics had no other options within 150 miles. Of some 3,000 women who were asked to participate, 956 have completed a baseline interview and agreed to follow-up interviews every six months. Of those women, 452 were within two weeks of their facility's cutoff and received an abortion, and 231 missed the cutoff by up to three weeks and were turned away. About 20 percent of the turnaways received an abortion elsewhere. Foster compared the remaining women who carried their pregnancies to term with the near-limit abortion patients. (The 273 other women in the study received a first-trimester abortion and acted as a control group. In the United States, 88 percent of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks, and Foster wanted to be sure that the near-limit abortion patients did not differ significantly in their outcomes from first-trimester abortion patients.) Of the turnaways in Foster's study who gave birth, 9 percent eventually put their children up for adoption.
There are many reasons women are turned away from an abortion clinic -- lack of funds (many insurance plans don't cover abortion) or obesity (excess weight can make the procedure more complicated) -- but most simply arrive too late. Women cite not recognizing their pregnancies, travel and procedure costs, insurance problems and not knowing where to find care as common reasons for delay. These are the women for whom ''society has the absolute least sympathy,'' Foster acknowledges. While a majority of Americans (53 percent) agree with Roe, many of those who support abortion rights draw the line at later stages of pregnancy. And the law reflects this view. Roe v. Wade guarantees a woman's right to abortion only up to the ''viability'' of a fetus, with exceptions for danger to a woman's health. (Viability varies depending on the medical expert you ask, typically at 23 weeks or more.) But the widespread discomfort with abortions near viability is reflected in recent bans on so-called partial-birth abortions. And many clinics, reacting to state law, set their own gestational limits -- often 20 to 22 weeks -- making later-term abortion more difficult to find in some states than in others. (In the U.S., 87 percent of counties have no abortion provider at all.)
''Usually the only difference between making it and not is just realizing you are pregnant,'' Foster says. ''If you're late, abortion gets much harder to find. All the logistic concerns snowball -- money, travel, support.'' Women who seek abortions tend, in general, to be less well off than those who don't, and those seeking second-trimester abortions tend to be ''particularly vulnerable,'' given the difficulties of finding an appropriate clinic and the higher cost of a later procedure.
As the argument that abortion harms women gains political traction, it is especially critical to look at how turnaways fare. ''All past studies of women denied abortion in the United States have been hospital-specific and local, focusing on a brief amount of time, without a control group,'' says Roger Rochat, former director of the division of reproductive health at the C.D.C. and a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University. ''Foster's turnaway study had a sample across the United States that she followed over a long period of time. It is the best science we have ever done on the subject. ''
Foster's study does have a precedent -- of a sort. In 1957, Czechoslovakia liberalized its abortion laws, while maintaining significant restrictions. Women were required to apply to an abortion commission and could be denied for a host of reasons -- if they were past 12 weeks' gestation, presented ''false or insufficient'' reasons or had had an abortion too recently. Women denied by the first commission could appeal to regional review boards. Some were denied twice and thus carried their pregnancies to term.
An eminent American psychologist, Henry David, took note of this and embarked on a pioneering study. Between 1961 and 1963, 24,989 Czech women applied for abortions; 638 of the applications were denied after initial application and appeal. With a team of Czech colleagues, David enrolled 220 of the women who were twice denied the abortion they sought and 220 women who never pursued an abortion. For the next 35 years, he followed their children, making regular inquiries and comparisons between the two groups.
The first results examined the children at age 9. David reported that the children born of unwanted pregnancies had significant disadvantages. They were breast-fed for shorter periods; were slightly but consistently overweight; had more instances of acute illness and lower grades in Czech. They seemed less capable in socially demanding situations; they were less popular among peers and teachers and even, if sons, with their own mothers. David concluded that ''the child of a woman denied abortion appears to be born into a potentially handicapping situation.'' After David published his first round of data, Czechoslovakia made first-trimester abortion available on demand.
In the course of interviewing the mothers about their children, David's research suggested that whether the mother wanted the child was a significant predictor of the child's future negative qualities, independent of the effect of the mother's personality. But he did not have a proper control group to determine if a child's unwantedness rather than a poor family environment was the source of the trouble. David called it ''the Achilles' heel'' of his work.
Foster's study, by contrast, seeks to isolate the impact of abortion by comparing two groups of very similar women: there are few differences in their educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, and they all sought an abortion. Only 6.6 percent of near-limit patients in the study and 5.6 percent of turnaways finished college (nearly 30 percent of adult American women have a bachelor's degree). One in 10 were on welfare, and approximately 80 percent reported not having enough money to meet basic living needs. A majority, in both groups, already had at least one child.
Foster hoped that their similarities would allow her to answer more fully how abortion affects women's mental health and emotional states. The A.P.A. report from 2008 concluded that, among adult women with unplanned pregnancies, the ''relative risk of mental-health problems is no greater if [women] have a single elective first-trimester abortion than if they delivered the pregnancy.'' But it did not go beyond the first trimester. It also noted the ''complexity of women and their circumstances'' and suggested that further study was needed to ''disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives.''
Foster saw that most abortion studies failed to acknowledge that women seeking abortions are likely to have mixed emotions -- regret, anger, happiness, relief. They also often failed to separate the reaction to pregnancy from the reaction to the abortion. She has designed her study to do both, relying on a series of questions and periodic interviews, and initial results, to be published in the fall, show that the emotion that predominates right after an abortion is relief.
When she looked at more objective measures of mental health over time -- rates of depression and anxiety -- she also found no correlation between having an abortion and increased symptoms. In a working paper based on her study, Foster notes that ''women's depression and anxiety symptoms either remained steady or decreased over the two-year period after receiving an abortion,'' and that in fact, ''initial and subsequent levels of depressive symptoms were similar'' between those who received an abortion and those who were turned away. Turnaways did, however, suffer from higher levels of anxiety, but six months out, there were no appreciable differences between the two groups.
Where the turnaways had more significant negative outcomes was in their physical health and economic stability. Because new mothers are eligible for government programs, Foster thought that they might have better health over time. But women in the turnaway group suffered more ill effects, including higher rates of hypertension and chronic pelvic pain (though Foster cannot say whether turnaways face greater risk from pregnancy than an average woman). Even ''later abortions are significantly safer than childbirth,'' she says, ''and we see that through lower complications and low incidence of chronic conditions.'' (In the National Right to Life's five-part response to preliminary findings of Foster's study, which were presented at the American Public Health Association conference last year, the group noted that the ill effects of abortion -- future miscarriage, breast cancer, infertility -- may become apparent only later. Reputable research does not support such claims.)
Economically, the results are even more striking. Adjusting for any previous differences between the two groups, women denied abortion were three times as likely to end up below the federal poverty line two years later. Having a child is expensive, and many mothers have trouble holding down a job while caring for an infant. Had the turnaways not had access to public assistance for women with newborns, Foster says, they would have experienced greater hardship.
Though S. is not part of Foster's turnaway study, she is in many ways typical. The same month that she realized she would be having her baby, she was confronted with a host of financial hurdles. She couldn't move in with her parents because they'd lost their home to foreclosure. By late March, S., exhausted by the pregnancy, had stopped working. Everyone moved into her older sister's house -- a three-bedroom, one-bathroom -- where now seven people would be living. There was a family meeting. S. and her baby would take one room; her sister's daughter would move into the small playroom; the parents would move into the garage. Their parents brought 20 years of belongings with them; S. sold, gave away or threw out everything she could but brought her parrot and her dog.
S., who had never seriously considered adoption, was overwhelmed when Baby S., a healthy girl, was born in May 2012. ''It was like, whoa!'' S. recalled. ''That first night was terrible. I was tired, and she was so hungry, and she had a very loud cry. They don't tell you how hard it is to nurse your baby. You don't know how painful it is for something to eat off you, and it's pulling your skin.'' She developed plugged ducts, a condition in which the breasts become painfully engorged with milk.
It's not unusual for new mothers to have trouble breast feeding, but S. felt overwhelmed in other ways too. ''This baby is such a crybaby, and I didn't know what was going on,'' she said. ''I felt like she didn't love me, like maybe she was mad at me.'' S. watched bitterly as her family members held a contented Baby S. When S. held her, the baby would begin to cry. It went on like that for weeks. S. sometimes buried her head in her pillow, crying, when the baby cried. ''Her tone was negative,'' one of S.'s sisters remembers. ''She would become angry, saying she wished the baby would shut up.''
S. wanted to be a good mother, so she kept trying to nurse even when she began to develop sores on her breasts. Perhaps because of S.'s difficulty breast-feeding, Baby S. wasn't gaining weight. Her physician threatened to call social services. Through a federal program -- Women, Infants and Children (W.I.C.) -- S. found a lactation consultant, who rented her a breast pump and provided her with information on baby formula. Once she stopped breast-feeding, Baby S. began to gain weight.
One day, when Baby S. was nearly 3 months old, S. left her on a pillow at the center of her bed while she went to the bathroom. She was gone for about a minute. When she came back, Baby S. was on the floor, lying face up, whimpering softly. S. and her mother took the baby to the hospital. It turned out nothing was wrong, but like many new parents in that situation, S. was terrified. The thought of losing Baby S. made her sick. From that point on, she no longer buried herself under the pillow when her baby cried. She didn't let Baby S. out of her sight.
S. now says that Baby S. is the best thing that ever happened to her. ''She is more than my best friend, more than the love of my life,'' S. told me, glowingly. There were white spit-up stains on her green top. ''She is just my whole world.''
When I told Foster S.'s story, she wasn't surprised that S. ended up bonding with her baby. ''That would be consistent with our study,'' Foster said. ''About 5 percent of the women, after they have had the baby, still wish they hadn't. And the rest of them adjust.'' S.'s experience is also consistent with one of the most striking statistics from Henry David's Czech study. David found that nine years after being denied abortions, 38 percent of women said they never sought one in the first place.
Some would use these data as justification to further restrict abortion -- women rarely regret having a child, even one they thought they didn't want. But as Katie Watson, a bioethicist at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, points out, we tell ourselves certain stories for a reason. ''It's psychologically in our interest to tell a positive story and move forward,'' she says. ''It's wonderfully functional for women who have children to be glad they have them and for women who did not have children to enjoy the opportunities that afforded them.''
Yet it is still true that being denied an abortion resulted in some measurable negative effects for S. She had to give up work and her apartment, and her precarious finances became more precarious. When women seek abortion, you have to ask yourself, Foster says, what is the alternative they are trying to avoid? And how might the life of a turnaway look if she'd had the abortion she sought? ''You would need to look at the people who managed to get the abortion and find whether a woman who started out similarly is now in school, building a stable relationship, career or, possibly, that later she had a baby she was ready for.''
Talking with Foster, I was reminded of a woman I met at a ''last resort'' clinic in New Mexico. J., as I will call her, lived in Kansas with her partner and teenage son. She was 38, one of the long-term unemployed, and struggling to support the child she had. She thought she was too old to become pregnant. When she missed her period, she and her partner drove to a nearby abortion clinic, in Oklahoma, knowing that they couldn't afford another baby. The clinic estimated that J. was five weeks pregnant, but when they tried to perform an abortion, the procedure was not successful.
Two weeks later, J. and her partner went to a more specialized clinic in Tulsa and were told that J. was actually 23 weeks pregnant, past the clinic's gestational limit. J. cried in the parking lot. She and her partner drove to Texas, where she missed the gestational limit again. Finally, in New Mexico, J. was able to terminate her pregnancy. A month later J. got a job operating heavy machinery at a manufacturing plant for $15 an hour. She had been applying for the past six months. If she had had the baby, she said, she wouldn't have been able to take the job. ''They wouldn't have even looked at me.''
Given some of the negative outcomes for turnaways, Foster's study raises an uncomfortable question: Is abortion a social good? Steven D. Levitt, a University of Chicago economist and co-author of the book ''Freakonomics,'' famously argued that the passage of Roe v. Wade led directly to a sharp drop in crime during the early '90s: women who were able to plan their families gave birth to better-adjusted children. The study was widely criticized, but the extent to which it was discussed shows the intensity of the desire to understand abortion's effect on society. ''It's offensive,'' Foster said of the Levitt study. ''Let people have abortions or they will breed criminals?'' If there is a social good to abortion, Foster prefers to frame that good in terms of positive alternatives. ''Maybe women know what is in their own and their family's best interest,'' she said. ''They may be making a choice that they believe is better for their physical and mental health and material well-being. And they may be making a decision that they believe is better for their kids -- the kids they already have and/or the kids they would like to have when the time is right.''
S.'s baby turned 1 on May 13. She still qualifies for W.I.C. benefits and is still living with her sibling and parents, working two days a week. Of her living arrangement, S. says: ''We have had family talks and pretty much come to the conclusion that we are trying to move by the end of the year. But we haven't really found a place to go.'' What will happen when she leaves her sister's house and she has to support herself and her baby? And what about Baby S.? Will Henry David be right that being ''born unwanted'' is a predictor of poor development?
There is a chance, of course, that S. and her baby will thrive. How Foster's turnaway subjects will be affected long-term is still unclear. In assessing how women like S. and J. fare over time, Foster plans to look at several variables: mother-child bonding; whether women who carry unwanted pregnancies to term face lasting economic difficulties; how the children of turnaways compare with children who are born later to women who once had abortions. The purpose of Foster's study is not to set policy by suggesting new or uniform gestational limits. She notes, however, that there are ways to reduce the number of women seeking abortion at an advanced gestational age by improving access to reproductive health care. But Foster sees herself as a scientist, not an advocate. She did not set out, she says, to disprove that abortion is harmful. ''If abortion hurts women,'' she says, ''I definitely want to know.''

HEADLINE: Schooling Ourselves in an Unequal America

BYLINE: REBECCA STRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: To regain our lead in educational achievement, we&#8217;ll have to work from the bottom up. 

 BODY:
Averages can be misleading. The familiar, one-dimensional story told about American education is that it was once the best system in the world but that now it's headed down the drain, with piles of money thrown down after it.
The truth is that there are two very different education stories in America. The children of the wealthiest 10 percent or so do receive some of the best education in the world, and the quality keeps getting better. For most everyone else, this is not the case. America's average standing in global education rankings has tumbled not because everyone is falling, but because of the country's deep, still-widening achievement gap between socioeconomic groups.
And while America does spend plenty on education, it funnels a disproportionate share into educating wealthier students, worsening that gap. The majority of other advanced countries do things differently, at least at the K-12 level, tilting resources in favor of poorer students. 
Historically, the role of the federal government, which takes a back seat to the states in education, has been to try to close achievement gaps, but they have continued to widen. Several changes in federal education policy under President Obama have actually increased the flow of scarce federal dollars toward those students who need it less, reinforcing inequities and further weakening overall educational performance. Reversing America's slide in international education rankings will require turning that record on its head.

America's relative fall in educational attainment is striking in several dimensions. American baby boomers ages 55 to 64 rank first in their age group in high school completion and third in college completion after Israel and Canada. But jump ahead 30 years to millennials ages 25 to 34, and the United States slips to 10th in high school completion and 13th in college completion. America is one of only a handful of countries whose work force today has no more years of schooling than those who are retiring do.
On international tests, American students consistently score in the middle of the pack among advanced countries, but America underperforms most on two measures - preschool enrollment and college on-time completion. Nearly all 4-year-olds in Japan, France, Britain and Germany are enrolled in preschool, compared with 69 percent in the United States. And although the United States is relatively good at getting high school graduates into college, it is horrible at getting them to graduate on time with a college degree. With more than half of those who start college failing to earn a degree, the United States has the highest college dropout rate in the developed world.
On average, money is not the problem. Given the country's relative wealth, per-pupil spending on elementary and high school is roughly on track with other advanced countries. At the college level, the United States spends lavishly, far more than any other country.
The problem is that the United States is not spending its education dollars effectively. At every point along the education track, from preschool to college, resources are skewed to wealthier students.
The wealthy inhabit an educational realm very different from what national averages suggest. Consider these examples. If ranked internationally as nations, low-poverty Massachusetts and Minnesota would be among the top 6 performers worldwide in fourth-grade math and science. Among 15-year-olds, Asian-Americans, who also tend to be more affluent, are the world's best readers; white Americans are third only to Finns and New Zealanders. In a 2012 Harvard Business School survey, high-quality universities were rated the country's chief competitive advantage. The world's brightest students clamor to attend them.
But educational excellence is increasingly the preserve of the rich. Everyone - black, white, rich, middle class and poor - is testing better and enrolling more in college than the previous generation. But rich students, and particularly rich girls, are making bigger gains than everyone else. Strikingly, these achievement gaps exist when children first begin elementary school and are locked in place all the way through to college.
Wealthy Americans have an advantage in the admission process for elite colleges, and despite the few who may slip in on family legacy, the advantage is largely based on academic merit. Students from families in the highest income quintile are now eight times more likely than students in the bottom quintile to enroll in a "highly selective" college, one that requires a high school transcript filled with As in advanced placement courses, SAT scores in the 700s and a range of enriching extracurricular activities.
Those who get in are doing better than ever. The best colleges are seeing their dropout rates fall to near-zero levels, especially for women. The education they offer is generally better than what students get at less selective schools, too. One very revealing fact is that even for equally qualified students, academic outcomes at selective colleges are better across the board and their graduates earn more and are more likely to progress toward an advanced degree.
The real quality crisis in American higher education - where the dropout rate is sky high and climbing - is in community colleges and lower-tier public universities. They have also absorbed most of the historic increase in college enrollment and disproportionately serve minority and low-income students. Money is a big reason for their worse performance.
At the college level, the divergence in per-pupil spending is staggering. Since the 1960s, annual per-pupil spending at the most selective public and private colleges has increased at twice the rate of the least selective colleges. By 2006, the funding chasm in spending per student between the most and the least selective colleges was six times larger than in the late 1960s.
In short, more money is being spent on wealthy students who have never been more prepared to excel in college. Meanwhile, poorer students who are less prepared - those who a generation ago would not have even enrolled in college - are getting a smaller slice of higher education spending. According to a study by the demographer John Bound and his colleagues, lack of institutional resources explains up to two-thirds of the increase in dropout rates at lower-tier colleges.
Of course, this divergence in educational investments begins long before college. Wealthy parents are piling on cognitive enrichment activities outside of school from preschool on up, and at a rate that is leaving everyone else in the dust. Schools could make up some of the difference by intensively investing in poor children, and the majority of richer countries do just that - spending more per pupil in lower-income districts than in higher-income districts. But it is the reverse in the United States, in large part because, unlike most other advanced countries, revenues for public schools continue to be raised mostly from local property taxes.
This record is a harsh indictment of the federal government's efforts to promote greater educational equality. Out of the civil rights era of the 1960s and early 1970s sprang a host of federal programs whose sole objective was to close achievement gaps. One is Head Start, which now serves close to one million low-income 3- and 4-year-olds and has tried for many years, with modest success, to make sure they're ready for kindergarten. For K-12 public schools, the federal government apportions money, called Title I and IDEA grants, to school districts based on the number of low-income or special-needs students they serve. Then there is the huge Pell grant program to help low-income students pay for college, which is the single largest component of the Department of Education's budget.
Reversing the long-term trend toward education inequality would be an impressive feat for the Obama administration, which has tried to intelligently reform federal programs that serve low-income students. Nonetheless, some of the biggest changes in federal funding priorities have favored wealthy students.
On the plus side, the Obama administration has pushed for more cost and quality accountability for education providers who cater to low-income children, while also developing better ways to measure and evaluate quality. The worst Head Start preschools are being forced to re-compete for federal funding under a more rigorous set of standards. States are being encouraged, through No Child Left Behind waivers and the Race to the Top competitive grant program, to improve teacher evaluation techniques, to invest in data systems for tracking teacher performance and student achievement, and to refocus reform efforts squarely on the worst-performing K-12 schools.
At the postsecondary level, for the first time vocational college programs could soon be held directly accountable for a "gainful employment rule," where they will lose federal accreditation if the programs' costs outweigh labor market benefits for their graduates. In other words, programs would shut down if their graduates don't land good jobs. There are also new initiatives promoting more transparency at all postsecondary institutions. The hope is that parents and students armed with better information will be better consumers and will punish schools with a record of charging too much or delivering too little.
Yet some of the administration's most ambitious ideas for reducing education inequality have not been implemented. In spite of research that shows that high-quality preschool can make a positive - and ultimately cost-effective - impact on children's cognitive development, President Obama's call for universal preschool is going nowhere in Congress, mostly because it would be extremely expensive. The Obama administration has made no attempt to expand Head Start enrollment, even though half of all impoverished children are not enrolled in any preschool program.
At the college level, while Mr. Obama has placed community colleges higher on the federal agenda than any of his predecessors, his funding promises have gone unfulfilled. In his first term, he proposed three new community college funds totaling $25 billion and then a further $12 billion in stimulus. But in the end only $2 billion in direct aid for community colleges was appropriated.
What is most disappointing about the Obama administration's oversight of educational programs, though, is the way the administration has arranged its funding priorities. Real baseline funding has been flat for Head Start, Title I and IDEA grants, and their financing will be cut by 5 percent under sequestration. It's true that the number of Pell grant recipients has surged recently because more students are opting for college in the tough labor market, but Pell grant eligibility has been rolled back, with stricter limits put in place on income and lifetime eligibility. And even after a recent increase in the maximum Pell grant size, it still covers a much smaller share of a student's college expenses than in the 1970s. The Pell grant program is also chronically underfinanced; it faces a $7 billion budget shortfall in 2014.
Where federal education policies have become much more generous, the benefits have disproportionately flowed to the wealthy. The administration has eased repayment terms for student debt, and the biggest gains will go to borrowers with the largest debt, who tend to be graduate or professional students with more earning potential. These already well-off graduates could end up receiving a federal subsidy that is four times larger than that provided to low-income students through Pell grants. Meanwhile, a new, more generous college tax credit also extended tax write-offs to families earning between $120,000 and $180,000. They reap most of the credit's $10 billion in annual benefits.
These education-spending decisions are hard to justify. The politics are understandably tricky; middle- and upper-class families want relief from skyrocketing tuition bills, and poor families have a small fraction of their political clout. But a smarter allocation of scarce resources would focus on boosting lower achievers. Because sometimes averages don't lie. Historically, broad educational gains have been the biggest driver of American economic success; hence the economist's rule of thumb that an increase of one year in a country's average schooling level corresponds to an increase of 3 to 4 percent in long-term economic growth.
In his first State of the Union address, in 2009, President Obama set a goal: America would regain the top spot internationally in the percentage of students graduating from college. No matter how much wealthier children keep gaining, there are not enough of them to raise that number. The only way America will again rise to the top in education is by lifting every student up.

HEADLINE: Lines Blur in U.S.-Europe Debate on Austerity

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Andrew Higgins and Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As President Obama begins an annual meeting with the leaders of some of the world's richest nations on Monday in Northern Ireland, the economic-policy gulf that has divided them since the global crash in 2008 has narrowed significantly -- just not exactly in ways that the White House would have liked.
The Europeans lately have slightly eased their austerity policies, after four years of deep spending cuts and rising taxes that many economists blame for keeping the Continent in recession long after America's ended.
And the Obama administration, after years of pressing Europe to adopt American-style stimulus measures, is now presiding -- if reluctantly -- over European-style austerity that is measurably slowing its recovery. 
Much of that austerity is in the form of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that were forced by Republicans in Congress. But Mr. Obama supported an end this year to both a temporary payroll-tax cut, which the Congressional Budget Office and private analysts credited with spurring consumer spending and creating jobs, and the Bush-era income tax cuts for the wealthy. What stimulus remains in the American economy can be credited to the expansionary monetary policies of the independent Federal Reserve System.
That new reality in the United States reduces the president's already limited leverage in his fiscal debate with Europeans, analysts on both sides of the Atlantic say, even as Europe's woes continue to act as a drag on its trading partners, including the United States.
''President Obama will continue trying to lead by persuasion rather than by example,'' said Eswar Shanker Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and a former official of the International Monetary Fund. ''The U.S. is likely to push other countries towards adopting measures to support growth, including a slowdown in the drive for fiscal austerity, but against the backdrop of its own premature fiscal tightening.''
With the United States ''just beginning to solidify its recovery, the last thing it needs right now is a major shock emanating from Europe,'' Mr. Prasad added. ''But the reality is that the U.S. can only jawbone. It cannot really influence policies in any substantive way.''
American and European officials said in interviews that arguments over austerity versus stimulus, so prominent at international gatherings in recent years, are likely to be muted at the two-day summit conference of the Group of 8 industrialized countries that is being held at the lakeside Lough Erne resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Besides Mr. Obama, participants include the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia -- countries that account for about half of the world's economic activity.
The reduced emphasis on stimulus versus austerity occurs even as unemployment remains at double digits in much of Europe, stoking unrest especially among the young. In part it reflects the fact that this spring, in advance of the summit conference, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and his counterparts among European financial ministers hashed out their differences so the heads of state could focus elsewhere. Also, the Group of 8 agenda is set by the gathering's host -- for this meeting, the conservative and pro-austerity prime minister of Britain, David Cameron.
Yet even Mr. Cameron's agenda, on international taxation, tax transparency and trade, is likely to be overshadowed by the allies' intensifying debate over whether and how to intervene in Syria's worsening civil war.
That likelihood was suggested late Friday by a summary from Mr. Cameron's Downing Street office about his pre-summit videoconference with Mr. Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President François Hollande of France and Prime Minister Enrico Letta of Italy. They discussed ''how G-8 countries should all agree to work together on a political transition to end the conflict'' in Syria, according to the statement from London. But significantly, the call did not include President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Syria's most important ally and arms provider.
Administration officials say that Mr. Obama is likely to make his most fulsome economic arguments against Europe's continued emphasis on budget cutting -- and for the relatively successful American model -- after the Group of 8 meeting, when he flies to Germany. On Wednesday he is to be in Berlin for a state visit with Ms. Merkel.
The German chancellor, as the leader of Europe's biggest and strongest economy, has had an outsize influence on the economic direction of the European Union. She and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, have insisted that Greece, Portugal and other so-called peripheral economies among the 17 European Union nations that use the euro must continue to cut their budgets and to restructure costly labor, health and retirement programs for long-term fiscal stability. Providing additional bailouts without such budget pressure would only encourage further profligacy, the Germans contend, and it could set off inflation.
Germany recently acquiesced, however, to give France, Portugal, Italy and Spain two more years to reduce their deficits to the European Union's target, freeing them to perhaps loosen spending and cut taxes in the short term with the aim of increasing consumer demand and business activity. The administration, while applauding the concession, would have preferred that the Germans had instead allowed the other countries to increase their deficits, not just delay their deficit reductions.
Mr. Prasad, the international economist, said Mr. Obama would have ''a tough sell'' with Ms. Merkel.
''But I think even Merkel has come around to the view that pushing too hard on fiscal policy in the short term is going to be potentially counterproductive,'' he added. ''The complication is that she faces elections in the fall, and the notion of continuing to subsidize the euro zone periphery economies is not something that would sell in Germany.''
At the Group of 8, the opening session is for discussing the global economy. Previewing the summit meeting on Friday, Caroline Atkinson, Mr. Obama's chief adviser for the event, acknowledged that ''the context for that discussion has changed a lot over the past year,'' given economic developments in both Europe and the United States.
''In Europe, for example, financial tensions have eased considerably, but large parts of Europe remain in recession and unemployment in some countries is at record highs,'' Ms. Atkinson said. ''In the U.S., our recovery is under way. We've successfully avoided the fiscal cliff and our budget deficit is declining rapidly. But of course we have more work to do to create jobs.''
She added, ''We expect that G-8 leaders will express a consensus that growth and jobs are a top priority.''
The problem is that the Americans and the European leaders continue to define what produces growth in different ways -- differences that have a parallel in the domestic debate between Mr. Obama and Republican lawmakers. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Cameron say that reducing deficits and debt to reassure lenders eventually will bring growth. The Americans say that the United States' recovery shows that, in a crisis, stimulus should come first and deficit reduction can follow once growth is restored.
''If Europe had done like we did, they may not be in the situation they're in,'' said Tony Fratto, a Treasury official during the George W. Bush administration. ''Europe went straight to austerity before growth,'' he added. ''They're actually still in a sustained recession -- and in some countries it's a sustained depression.''
The European Union's top economic policy maker, Olli Rehn, has signaled a softening of austerity recently as a long-promised recovery failed to materialize. But in an interview last week, the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, seemed to rule out a program of economic stimulus.
Mr. Barroso challenged calls by Washington and also by many in Europe for a retreat from policies of austerity.
''Let's not forget why we came to this situation: in many cases because of high levels of public debt and we have seen that growth fueled by debt is simply not sustainable,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Plugs Border in Arizona, Crossings Shift to South Texas

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and JULIA PRESTON; Laura Tillman contributed reporting from McAllen, Tex.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A surge in migrant traffic across the Southwest border into Texas has resulted in a milestone: the front line of the battle against illegal crossings from Mexico has shifted for the first time in over a decade away from Arizona to the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.
This shift has intensified a bitter debate under way in the Senate over whether the border is secure enough now, or ever will be, to move ahead with legislation that could give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants already here.
On Monday, the Senate was scheduled to resume a long series of votes on an immigration bill that is promising to end a cycle -- playing out since the early 1990s -- in which each time the Border Patrol cracks down in one enforcement zone along the border, migrants move to another. 
Now the Rio Grande Valley has displaced the Tucson enforcement zone as the hot spot, with makeshift rafts crossing the river in increasing numbers, high-speed car chases occurring along rural roads and a growing number of dead bodies turning up on ranchers' land, according to local officials.
''There is just so much happening at the same time -- it is overwhelming,'' said Benny Martinez, the chief deputy in the Sheriff's Department of Brooks County, Tex., 70 miles north of the border, where smugglers have been dropping off carloads of immigrants who have made it past Border Patrol checkpoints.
The increase in Texas is taking place even as the Obama administration says it has achieved unprecedented control over the border with Mexico. The administration, President Obama said last week, has ''put border security in place,'' with illegal crossings ''near their lowest level in decades.''
Apprehensions at the Mexican border -- the single best indicator of illegal traffic -- are still far below their peak: there were 356,873 last year, compared with 1.6 million in 2000.
But after nearly a decade of steady declines, the count has started to rise again over the past year, driven by the rise in the southern tip of Texas, where the numbers so far this fiscal year are up 55 percent. Since October, 94,305 individuals have been apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley alone, topping the count in Tucson for the first time since 1993.
Critics of the Senate legislation, including Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, point to the influx in the Rio Grande Valley enforcement zone as proof that the bill must explicitly mandate ''full operational control'' of the border within a decade before any immigrants who were once here illegally could be allowed to proceed toward citizenship.
''If we don't guarantee to the American people that we actually are going to get serious about stopping the flow of people illegally crossing our Southwestern border,'' Mr. Cornyn said last week on the Senate floor, ''I think we guarantee the failure of bipartisan immigration reform.''
Supporters of the bill say the surge in Texas is small compared with the steep overall decline in recent years, and the Senate legislation, while not formally mandating control all along the Mexican border, would provide at least $4.5 billion over five years for enforcement tools to help finish the job -- a significant improvement that would come after two years of budget cutting.
''I have been on the border in Arizona for the last 30 years,'' Senator John McCain, a Republican from that state who is one of the eight authors of the overhaul bill, said during the debate last week. ''To somehow say there have not been significant advancements in border security defies the facts.''
The homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, acknowledged to a Senate committee this spring that in South Texas, ''we have a problem there right now which we are fixing.''
The chief of the Border Patrol, Michael J. Fisher, said in an interview that he had begun last year to shift agents and surveillance equipment to the region, anticipating that an enforcement campaign in Tucson would push the illegal flow toward Texas. He said the patrol had sought to build up in Texas without diminishing its effort in Arizona.
''We did it smartly,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''We wanted to maintain some discipline and not move our resources from our primary focus in Arizona.''
Even though more planes and helicopters have been sent to the Rio Grande area, the effort has been slowed considerably by recent federal budget cuts, which have created severe fuel shortages and other complications that have at times grounded border aircraft. Agents have also had to double up in patrol vehicles, or have been ordered to sit in their vehicles without driving. Several parts of the border, like one 25-mile stretch west of McAllen, are at times not being watched, so the number of migrants who cross from Mexico without getting caught is surging, too, three agents said in interviews last week.
''It's really demoralizing because there's so much traffic passing through here and we can't do anything about it,'' one agent said Friday while on patrol, asking that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''And when you try to do something and they won't let you do it,'' he added, having been ordered during recent shifts not to drive his truck, ''it's just really demoralizing.''
Corruption has also been a problem: two Homeland Security auditors, until recently based in McAllen, were indicted in April on charges that they falsified documents when they were supposed to be investigating a string of cases in which Border Patrol agents had been helping smuggle illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.
Mike Salinas, an alderman in La Joya, Tex., a tiny city on the Rio Grande, said border agents there were frequently outnumbered. Last week, a single agent tried to round up a group of 20, most of whom he watched scatter and get away.
''People are just crossing without fear,'' Mr. Salinas said, recalling crowds right in his backyard in recent weeks.
The holding cells at the McAllen Border Patrol station are often filled beyond capacity, and dozens of migrants are temporarily held in a truck garage. As many as 50 adults are detained for up to a week in a single holding area, with no shower, agents said.
A Homeland Security spokesman in Washington acknowledged that fuel shortages and overcrowding had been a problem, and he said the agency was working to distribute migrants it apprehended among different area stations.
The surge in South Texas is driven mostly by immigrants originating not from Mexico but from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, officials said. The Mexican border city of Reynosa is the end of a railway that begins in southern Mexico, and many migrants ride the roofs of freight trains to reach the United States.
Scholars who study migration say surveys show that it is most unlikely the migrants have been spurred by news that Congress is considering legalization for illegal immigrants already here. Tom K. Wong, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, said other factors appeared to be driving them.
''You see this uptick at the same time when the U.S. economy as a whole is also improving,'' Mr. Wong said. Researchers said criminal violence in Central America was also a factor in the surge, which began more than a year ago, before the debate in Washington started.
The hundreds of miles of border defined by the Rio Grande are difficult to patrol, with citrus groves, dense fields of rippling sugar cane and thickets of mesquite trees that make it impenetrable to the long-range surveillance cameras affixed to tall towers, which have been effective in parts of Arizona. The river's winding course and soggy terrain -- as well as the potential for flooding -- make building fences impractical in certain places.
Late last year, the Rio Grande Valley had 2,546 Border Patrol agents, up from 1,484 a decade earlier. Most new graduates of the Border Patrol Academy are being sent to the Rio Grande Valley, said Mr. Fisher, the Border Patrol chief. Agents have received surplus equipment from the Department of Defense, like night vision goggles, while they wait for money to buy their own gear.
Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents part of the region, said the Homeland Security Department should have acted sooner. ''They haven't been nimble enough,'' he said. ''They would have been in a much better situation if they were playing offense instead of defense.''
The Senate bill would authorize spending on sophisticated mobile surveillance trucks, additional fencing and more border agents, advocates of the measure noted. They said other enforcement tools in the bill, like a mandate that all employers verify the work authorization of new hires, were needed to help eliminate magnets for migrants.
Mr. Fisher said he expected more fluctuations in illegal border crossings as enforcement expanded. ''Across the Southwest border you always are going to have one location -- right now it is Rio Grande Valley -- where the traffic is rising,'' he said.
Mr. Martinez, the chief deputy sheriff in Brooks County, said that cycle was worrisome to local residents. ''This is a humanitarian issue,'' he said. ''People are dying right out on the land here.''

HEADLINE: Success of Cuomo's Plan for More Casinos Relies on His Power of Persuasion

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and CHARLES V. BAGLI; Jesse McKinley reported from Albany, and Charles V. Bagli from New York.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- If Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's plan to expand full-scale casino gambling in New York is to become a reality, he is going to have to hit a three-part parlay.
The first part of his bet is that he can persuade the Legislature, which is split by regional rivalries and under pressure from competing gambling interests, to place a referendum on the ballot authorizing such casinos. The governor quite likely has only a few days -- the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for the year on Thursday -- and he will then have to persuade the state's voters, who are currently split over casinos, to approve the referendum, most likely in November. And even then, Mr. Cuomo will have to persuade casino companies to make big investments in upstate New York, a region that has been regarded with skepticism by some developers and industry analysts.
None of these challenges, it seems, have dulled the governor's enthusiasm for casino gambling, which he promotes as a bold move to bring jobs and tourism to economically depressed regions, thus addressing a problem that has dogged New York leaders for decades. 
''If you want tomorrow to be different than yesterday, then do something different,'' Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in announcing one version of his plan in May. ''This is a big idea that we believe could bring economic energy to upstate New York that needs it desperately.''
New York already has five full-scale casinos, all run by Indian tribes upstate, and the state also allows limited electronic gambling at nine racetracks, including Aqueduct Racetrack and Yonkers Raceway, both of which are highly successful. Mr. Cuomo wants the Legislature to ask voters to allow as many as seven full-scale, nontribal casinos, but said that over the first several years there would be fewer, and all of them would be upstate.
The prospect of expanded gambling in New York has sparked an avalanche of spending by the gambling industry. In 2011 and 2012, gambling interests spent $17.8 million on lobbying and political contributions, up 36 percent from the previous two years, according to an analysis by Common Cause.
But not all of that money is supporting expanded gambling. Operators of the slot parlors at nine racetracks spent nearly $10 million in Albany, and those groups are seeking either to obtain casino licenses themselves, or prevent others from getting them.
The New York State Gaming Association, which represents the racetrack slot parlors, said last week that it would not support the governor's legislation. But negotiations have continued, and over the weekend the governor introduced a new twist: he proposed to allow more slot parlor operators in New York City if a referendum failed.
The governor's spokeswoman, Melissa DeRosa, said that, absent approval of upstate casinos, more city slot parlors would ''combat the loss of revenue to neighboring states and secure new funding for our schools.'' But new slot parlors would also mean more competition for the existing racinos. ''No racino was granted a lifetime monopoly,'' Ms. DeRosa said. ''We were elected to act in the best interest of the people, not politically connected racino owners.''
Mr. Cuomo has already used the prospect of expanded gambling to find more revenue for the state, brokering three recent deals with Indian tribes to settle contract disputes and other issues. The deals, most recently with the Seneca Nation, will bring the state hundreds of millions of dollars from the tribes in exchange for geographic exclusivity.
The debate over casinos is likely to become even more complicated if the Legislature agrees to put the referendum on the ballot. Myriad deep-pocketed state and national players would most likely be involved in any fall referendum battle, and it remains unclear how much of a campaign against the measure opponents of expanded gambling would muster.
Mr. Cuomo, who failed last year in his plan to build a $4 billion convention and expanded gambling complex in Queens, appears eager to make a deal this year. On Friday, he said he would consider issuing four casino licenses upstate, up from his original three, in a possible effort to appease lawmakers from the Catskills, a former resort area with a depressed economy. (Hours after the governor's shift, Senator John J. Bonacic, a Hudson Valley Republican who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Racing, Wagering and Gaming, suggested there should actually be five upstate casinos.)
Even if expanded casino gambling is approved by the Legislature and by voters, it is not clear how many casinos can obtain financing and survive in lesser populated upstate areas.
Mr. Cuomo has said he imagines ''resort gaming destinations'' -- complete with hotels, shops, entertainment venues and four-star restaurants -- upstate. He would allow casinos -- in the short term -- in three regions, including the Albany region, the south-central area bordering Pennsylvania, and the Catskills. The Catskills, in particular, have long appealed to some casino developers, including the The Mashantucket Pequot Indians, who own the Foxwoods casino resort and who announced last week a desire to build a $500 million casino resort in Liberty, N.Y.
Among the optimists are Emanuel R. Pearlman, chairman of Empire Resorts Inc., which operates a slot parlor at the Monticello Raceway, about 90 miles northwest of Manhattan. Mr. Pearlman said his company -- which has ties to the same Malaysian family that controls Genting, the megacasino company -- had received preliminary approval to build a resort that would include a water park, a new racetrack and, he hoped, a casino.
''We are hopeful that it will be the catalyst to stimulate the redevelopment of the Catskills,'' Mr. Pearlman said.
Executives from Caesars, a big name in the casino world, have toured upstate cities and are interested in a location outside of the Catskills. But several other major casino companies that specialize in large-scale developments -- including Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts -- insist that they are only interested in building casinos in or around New York City. ''The money is where the tourists are,'' said the Rev. Richard McGowan, an adjunct associate professor of economics at Boston College who writes about the gambling industry.
Mr. Cuomo has argued that upstate casinos could create tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in investment. But Alan R. Woinski, the president of Gaming USA Corporation, which publishes industry newsletters, said, ''You're not going to get people to invest a billion and a half, two billion dollars upstate. Because you're not going to get the return on it.''
Mr. Woinski and other analysts noted the problem of potential casino saturation in the Northeast, where there are now dozens of places to gamble. Casinos in Atlantic City and Connecticut have seen revenues fall steadily as legal gambling has proliferated in the region. Revenues at the 12 casinos in Pennsylvania have been hurt by the Yonkers and Aqueduct slot parlors, as well as by new casinos in Ohio and Maryland. And slots, craps and roulette are on the way in Massachusetts, which is in the process of licensing three casinos.
Any referendum campaign would likely involve education funding; the racinos, which pay a tax rate of more than 60 percent, much of which is earmarked for education, contend that they will have a hard time competing with the new casinos, which Mr. Cuomo has suggested would pay a 25 percent tax rate. That, the racinos say, means there will be less money generated for education. The administration disputes that, saying that more revenue will be produced under their plan.
A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month showed 48 percent of voters support amending the Constitution to allow expanded casino gambling. Support was weaker in New York City -- a problem for advocates of expanded gambling, because the mayor's race in New York means turnout in the city is likely to be higher than in other parts of the state this year.

HEADLINE: Large Risks in Erdogan's Harsh Stand

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON | REUTERS

 BODY:
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey seems to like the concept of choking things. Over the weekend, Mr. Erdogan sent riot police into an Istanbul park with tear gas and water cannons to clear out the protestors. A week earlier, he had threatened to ''choke'' an alleged ''high-interest-rate lobby'' of speculators who wanted to push interest rates up and suffocate the economy.
Mr. Erdogan's harsh actions against protesters and harsh words against investors could backfire economically. The country depends on foreign investors to fund its big current account deficit. If they turn tail in response to the mounting unrest, interest rates will indeed have to rise. 
The protests, which began two weeks ago over allegations of authoritarianism on Mr. Erdogan's part, set off by his insistence on bulldozing one of Istanbul's few public parks, initially alarmed investors. The stock market plunged; the Turkish currency, the lira, fell; and government bond yields increased. Then, after the central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market and Mr. Erdogan offered concessions last week, investors calmed down.
But the use of riot police over the weekend stoked a conflict that had seemed on the point of resolution.
The problem is not so much that speculators have an incentive for jacking up interest rates. That would be perverse. Foreign investors own $140 billion worth of Turkish bonds and equities, according to Standard Bank. They will lose money if interest rates rise.
The risk rather is that investors will pull out their money if they lose confidence. The U.S. Federal Reserve's indication that it may slow its bond-purchasing program has exacerbated that risk, as some of the money the Fed has been pumping into U.S. bonds has seeped into emerging markets like Turkey.
What is more, the Turkish economic miracle is not quite as good as it seems. The economy grew 2.6 percent last year, down from 8.5 percent the previous year, and the central bank had to increase interest rates because the economy was overheating and inflation reached 8.9 percent last year.
Turkey's biggest economic weakness is its current account deficit, a sign that consumption has been growing faster than is sustainable. The deficit did fall to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product last year, after a 9.7 percent gap the previous year, as the economy slowed. But it is rising again this year. The April trade deficit was $10.3 billion, up from $6.6 billion last year.
Indeed, the sell-off in Turkey's financial markets began a week or so before the police crackdown on protestors in Taksim Square on May 31. For example, two-year bond yields rose to 6 percent at the end of the month from 4.8 percent on May 17; and the stock market fell 8 percent between May 22 and the end of the month.
Until now, international investors have been happy to finance the deficit. Not only were they attracted by the strong economic growth, but they also liked Mr. Erdogan's pro-market approach, the political stability they thought he had brought and the prospect that Turkey's march toward a market democracy would be anchored by negotiations to join the European Union, said Timothy Ash, Standard Bank's head of emerging markets research.
The ''interest rate lobby'' also liked the fact that the government's debt was at 35 percent of G.D.P. and that banks had strong balance sheets, partly because they had been seared by the Turkish financial crisis at the start of the millennium. Meanwhile, the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch recently raised the country to investment grade.
The problem is that the unrest is casting doubt on some of these positive factors. For a start, Turkey no longer looks so stable politically. Then there is the doubt being sown by Mr. Erdogan's attack on speculators about the depth of his commitment to markets. Furthermore, the crackdown on protestors may undermine Turkey's chances of joining the E.U. Last week, Germany suggested delaying the next round of negotiations.
The unrest could harm growth if tourists are deterred from visiting and Turkish consumers become more cautious.
A particular weakness is that the current account deficit has been largely paid for with so-called hot money: foreign investment chasing short-term returns. The share accounted for by foreign direct investment -- long-term money that cannot easily run away -- has been falling, according to Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, the share made up by debt has been on the rise.
One measure of Turkey's vulnerability to a loss of confidence is that it has an ''external financing requirement'' of $205 billion -- about a quarter of its G.D.P. -- over the next year, according to Standard Bank. This financing requirement is the sum of its current account deficit and the maturing debt it needs to repay or roll over. A more extreme measure of vulnerability would add the $140 billion of foreign-held bonds and shares. If this tries to flee, the lira could plunge.
Against this, the central bank has $130 billion worth of reserves, into which it dipped last week when it helped to stabilize the foreign exchange market. This war chest, though, is small compared with Turkey's external financing needs. And the net reserves, after excluding foreign exchange deposited by the banking system, are $46 billion, according to Standard Bank.
So the central bank could not hold the line if the ''interest rate lobby'' really did run for the exits. In that case, Turkey would have to raise interest rates, which would damage economic growth.
And then the economic miracle, which Mr. Erdogan has presided over and which is one of the main sources of his popularity, might look like a conjuring trick. Instead of choking protesters, Turkey's prime minister should try to make a genuine peace with them.

HEADLINE: European Commission President Criticizes Opposition to Globalization

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS and STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The head of the European Union's executive arm said that Europe must shun ''reactionary'' opposition to globalization as he criticized French-led efforts to protect the Continent's movie and television industries in advance of trade talks with the United States.
The European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, speaking in an interview ahead of a meeting Monday with President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations, offered strikingly robust criticism of efforts in France to limit the scope of a trade pact.
Discussion of the proposed trans-Atlantic trade accord is expected at the Group of 8 meeting, as a result of an agreement that European Union trade ministers worked out in a lengthy bargaining session on Friday in Luxembourg. 
Mr. Barroso scorned a view, which France's Socialist government successfully argued at that session, that Europe's movie and television industries must be excluded, at least initially, from the trade negotiations in order to protect the region's cultural diversity.
''It's part of this anti-globalization agenda that I consider completely reactionary,'' Mr. Barroso said, adding that he believed in protecting cultural diversity but not in sealing off Europe. ''Some say they belong to the left, but in fact they are culturally extremely reactionary.''
But while largely in sync with Washington on the merits of free trade, Mr. Barroso took issue with the United States over its electronic surveillance program. He also defended Europe's emphasis on austerity economics, which the Obama administration views as counterproductive. And Mr. Barroso called for tougher measures against multinational companies that use aggressive tax avoidance methods.
The battle against illegal tax evasion, as well as the legal but questionable tactics that big companies use to avoid taxes, will be a central topic during a two-day meeting of the Group of 8, which comprises the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and four European countries.
The meeting is to start Monday in Northern Ireland at a luxury golf resort, which itself became a victim of Europe's financial crisis when it entered insolvency proceedings in 2011 after a crash in property prices.
With this meeting, Mr. Barroso will have attended nine Group of 8 summit meetings, more than any of the other leaders scheduled to be there.
Speaking in his 13th floor office in Brussels, Mr. Barroso voiced alarm at recent reports that a secret United States surveillance program had invaded the privacy of Europeans. The program, known as Prism and revealed by a former National Security Agency contractor, Edward J. Snowden, ''certainly raises serious concerns in Europe,'' he said.
''While we understand certainly the concerns of security that we share with our friends and allies regarding the serious threat that terrorism represents,'' he said, ''we believe that it cannot be done in clear violation of fundamental rights, namely of people who have nothing to do with this kind of threat.''
The fight against terrorism, Mr. Barroso added, hinges on ''the moral superiority of democracies'' and must be ''based on the respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.''
He said, ''I think we should not lose that moral ground when we deal with this threat, which is terrorism.''
Mr. Barroso also challenged calls by Washington and from many in Europe for a retreat from policies of austerity. The push for fiscal discipline that has dominated the European Union's response to what began as a financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 has grown into a broader economic debacle that has plunged much of the region into recession and left more than 26 million Europeans unemployed.
''We should keep the fiscal consolidation,'' said Mr. Barroso, referring to the budget cuts and tax increases that are the main pillars of austerity.
Debate over Europe's response to the crisis has fed into a wider discussion over the impact of globalization and whether, at a time of deep economic malaise, a proposed trade pact with the United States would relieve or only add to Europe's problems.
Mr. Barroso shrugged off comments by the Greek-born French film director Costa-Gavras, a longstanding critic of global capitalism, that the commission president is a ''dangerous man'' for European culture.
Mr. Barroso insisted that cultural diversity is an important pillar of the European Union and said that the threat from America had been overblown by those who ''have an anti-global agenda.''
Such critics, he said, have ''no understanding of the benefits that globalization brings also from a cultural point of view, also in terms of opening horizons and broadening our perspectives and also the sentiment of belonging to the same mankind, which I think is a very important concept against all forms of narrow nationalism and protectionism.''
At the meeting of European Union trade ministers Friday in Luxembourg, France cleared the way for the European Commission to begin negotiations with Washington on a free-trade pact. But the French trade minister, Nicole Bricq, secured a pledge that the talks, at least initially, would not cover movies, television shows and other audiovisual products.
France's ''cultural exception'' policy includes quotas and subsidies for such productions, which promote locally and regionally produced content.
Discussion of protection of state-sponsored film and television industries is not completely off the table but will require a further decision by European Union states at a later stage.
Mr. Barroso's comments were made before the ministers had agreed on the elaborate compromise late Friday.
This agreement, reached after 12 hours of tense talks, does not end the debate but does lift a cloud hanging over Monday's Group of 8 meeting.
Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, the host of the meeting, hopes to inaugurate negotiations on the trans-Atlantic trade deal and to get commitments from the other Group of 8 countries to agree to cooperate more closely on issues including taxation and the transparency of multinational companies' earnings.
On Saturday, 10 British territories and self-governing regions, including Bermuda, agreed to join an international convention on the exchange of information on taxes, which is already supported by more than 50 countries, and to produce plans on how to shine more light on the ownership of so-called shell companies.
Nonetheless, critics of the Group of 8 question the credibility and relevance of the forum. It was conceived at the height of the cold war and later expanded to include Russia, but it is still focused on the West.
Mr. Barroso, one of two top European officials who will attend the meeting -- the other is Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, where national governments meet -- defended the format as worthwhile, despite the emergence of the Group of 20, which includes more economically dynamic countries like China and Indonesia.
''While the G-20 is certainly more representative, the G-8, I think, allows leaders to have a more intimate discussion and more in depth,'' Mr. Barroso said. Success in Northern Ireland, he added, ''can in fact relaunch the G-8 process.''
Some experts argue that despite the inclusion of Russia, whose democratic credentials fall far short of those of other members, the Group of 8 could still prove valuable as an influential caucus of developed, free-market economies.
''Two years ago people would say that the G-8 was on its way out,'' said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, a research institute in London. ''The G-8 is rediscovering a little of its mojo, having been put to in the shadows by the postcrisis centrality of the G-20 at a time when we needed everyone to pull together.''
The rise of China had concentrated minds, giving momentum to moves to push for a trans-Atlantic trade pact.
''This agenda has acquired intensity because Europe and America have woken up to the competitive challenge of China,'' Mr. Niblett added.
Mr. Cameron will press Group of 8 leaders to coordinate efforts to deal with tax avoidance by big multinational companies.
Last week, an influential parliamentary committee in Britain criticized the tax affairs of Google, saying that the company had generated $18 billion in revenue from Britain between 2006 and 2011 but paid the equivalent of just $16 million in British corporation taxes in the same period.
Mr. Barroso declined to comment on the Google case but said he supported plans for European rules to force transparency on multinationals' tax affairs.
''We are of course against all practices of aggressive -- what we call aggressive -- tax planning, of tax avoidance,'' he said. ''We recognize that some of these practices are legal, but that does not mean they are right.''

HEADLINE: Drone Sales Flourish in a Time of Austerity

BYLINE: By DANIEL SOLON

 BODY:
The use of unmanned drones for surveillance and targeted anti-guerrilla strikes has recently been a focus of ethical and political controversy.
Yet for all the criticism, and at a time when austerity budgets are causing deep cuts in orders for manned combat, transport and tanker aircraft, drone builders are thriving.
For defense planners and military strategists, the multiple mission capabilities of drones, their sophisticated technologies and their suitability for unconventional warfare gives them a clear edge over manned aircraft programs, which increasingly look like a holdover from Cold War planning. 
Ranging in size from hand-launched reconnaissance units for urban combat to giant experimental solar-powered surveillance craft intended to remain aloft for as long as five years, drones, formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or U.A.V.'s, are not cheap, but they are increasingly ubiquitous.
David Kilcullen, a counterinsurgency adviser who worked with Gen. David Petraeus of the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, said 70 nations were already involved with drones in some fashion.
Michael Richter, head of aerospace and defense investment banking for the investment bank Lazard, in Los Angeles, said the U.S. budget sequestration law would cut U.S. defense spending to $551 billion next year from $587 billion this year, with a further fall in prospect to $505 billion in 2015 and 2016.
Still, cybersecurity and drone programs are likely to be relatively resistant to cuts because of their perceived critical importance, he said.
U.S. drones already in operational use include the hand-launched AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven, effectively a flying camera that provides support for troops in close combat, and the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, which can be programmed to operate almost autonomously, without a land-based controller. The Global Hawk can take off from California, fly across the United States to map the state of Maine, and then return to California.
More familiar to the public because of high-profile strikes against Al Qaeda and other targets are General Atomics' MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper.
Development programs include the Northrop Grumman X-47B, an experimental carrier-based combat drone. The program took a step forward recently with a catapult launching from the U.S. aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush, following successful on-shore tests of landings using arresting wires.
Micah Zenko, a fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, said he expected that armed drones would be capable of carrying out carrier-based missions five years from now.
Another high-technology venture is Boeing's Solar Eagle research program, slated to start testing next year and intended to develop an aircraft that could stay airborne for up to five years.
Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm based in Fairfax, Virginia, said he expected the 2014 U.S. budget to propose reductions in existing drone programs in favor of ''next generation systems, stealthier, with more power, and capable of operating autonomously if jammed by opponents.''
Among major competitors to the U.S. drone makers, Mr. Finnegan lists Israeli companies -- in some cases working with Indian partners -- and Brazilian programs aimed at that country's need to patrol far-flung jungle borders and a long Atlantic coastline.
Also emerging as future competitors, in Mr. Finnegan's view, are Turkish Aerospace Industries; Denel, the South African state-owned aerospace and defense technology group; and some Chinese companies.
In the more traditional field of piloted military aircraft, some new players are aiming at niche segments with substantial long-term potential. A case in point is Embraer, of Brazil, which is adding both conventional military and unmanned flight capabilities to its core commercial aviation business. On the conventional military front, its KC-390 twin-jet tactical airlift and tanker plane is scheduled to make its first flight by the end of 2014, with entry into service planned for 2016.
The KC-390 is aimed at a potential global market as large as $50 billion, according to Luiz Carlos Aguiar, head of Embraer's defense and security division. Mr. Aguiar said that the company was projecting $1.25 billion in military revenue this year, a 25 percent increase from 2012. His staff has identified 2,000 older aircraft in the KC-390's market segment, of which 723 are within Embraer's potential reach, leaving out markets closed to it by export controls or other factors. The program already holds 60 letters of intent from air forces in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic and Portugal.
''We will soon announce possible future partnerships, including a joint study with Boeing,'' Mr. Aguiar said.
On the unmanned aircraft front, Embraer holds a controlling interest in a joint venture with Avibras of Brazil and an Israeli company, aiming to build and sell drones for surveillance work to strengthen Brazilian border controls.
For manned military aircraft, in contrast, the outlook is dour.
For Lockheed Martin's F-35, the stealthy so-called fifth generation multirole fighter plane that is the world's largest current military development program, Richard Aboulafia, a vice president at Teal Group, anticipates that the U.S. Air Force procurement is ''likely to fall to around 1,200 to 1,400 units,'' barely half of current plans to buy more than 2,400 and far below the initially projected 3,100. The U.S. Marine Corps could take another 420, modified for conventional carrier or short-takeoff and vertical landing operations, and the U.S. Navy 260, he said.
Britain, which is a partner in the program -- BAE Systems has a 12 percent stake -- has agreed to buy 138 units.
Other buyers, for now, include Turkey, which could take 116 and potentially as many as 200; Australia, as many as 100; Italy, 90; Canada, 65; the Netherlands, 60 to 85; Norway, 56; Japan, 42; Denmark, 30; and Israel, 20.
Several customers are reported to be unhappy about delayed deliveries and rising prices, however, and all of those numbers may still change. Italy has already cut its order from 131 and Denmark from 48.
Looking outside the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said most European military programs have limited potential.
France has already announced a reduction in its total procurement of Dassault Aviation's Rafale fighter to 225 from 286. India, meanwhile, early last year named the Rafale as its first choice for 126 planes -- but has not committed to an order.
With the economies of Southern Europe in full austerity mode, the Eurofighter Typhoon is also seeing cutbacks in projected purchases by Spain, which confirmed in August it planned to defer its procurement of 12 of the planes.

HEADLINE: For Airlines, Savings Could Come in Midsize Packages

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Development of a new airplane takes time. No one knows that better than Hideo Egawa, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Aircraft, who has had to tell buyers of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, the company's first commercial airplane since the 1960s, that take-off will be delayed.
''Development is difficult,'' Mr. Egawa said in New York when asked why delivery of the jet to All Nippon Airways had been delayed twice. The first deliveries, initially planned for this year, are now scheduled for 2015. 
The difficulties do not come from a lack of manufacturing experience. Over the years, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Aircraft's parent company, has produced components for McDonnell Douglas fighter planes and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The challenge, Mr. Egawa said, has been focusing such diverse expertise on ''one plane.''
In seeking to introduce a smaller plane to fly between secondary cities, or between such cities and airports at major hubs, Mitsubishi Aircraft is joining a crowded field dominated by Boeing and Airbus and with smaller competitors on nearly every continent.
By the time the Mitsubishi Regional Jet flew for the first time, in April last year, Bombardier of Canada had about 2,500 jets and turboprop commuter planes in service around the world. The Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, meanwhile, has 1,700 commercial jets in operation worldwide. The Sukhoi Superjet -- a joint project of Sukhoi Civil Aircraft of Russia and the Italian company Alenia Aeronautica -- has far fewer sales to its credit but is in use by airlines in Bermuda, Indonesia and Mexico, among others. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, meanwhile, is working on its ARJ21 aircraft, although that project also has been delayed.
The boom in regional jet production began 20 years ago as airlines sought to replace turboprop planes with longer-range, faster jets, typically with 50 passenger seats. To maximize the economic viability of the aircraft, they were often flown by subcontractors who paid pilots less than the airlines would. Carriers like Air Canada also used regional flights to feed passengers to its more-lucrative long-distance and international flights, said Calin Rovinescu, chief executive of the airline. ''If you can get the right number of seats, it is a creative way to reduce your costs,'' he said.
In the early 2000s, when the price of jet fuel rose sharply, the revenue from filling a 50-seat plane generally no longer covered the cost of the fuel burned to fly it. A more fuel-efficient regional jet -- larger than a 50-seater but smaller than the smallest Boeing and Airbus airliners -- was deemed a potential solution, but only if airlines could persuade their pilots to allow regional pilots to fly larger planes. The airlines wanted more seats on regional jets, said David Krieger, manager of economic and financial analysis at the Air Line Pilots Association in Washington. ''Bigger is what they would rather see.''
Carriers agreed to restrict the number of larger planes they would fly and on what routes; in exchange, airline pilots accepted having regional airlines fly jets with more than 50 seats. More recent regional jets typically have between 70 and 100 seats.
''Labor agreements contributed to the design of the airplane,'' said Chet R. Fuller, senior vice president at Bombardier Commercial Aircraft which manufactures five models of regional jet, including the 50-seat CRJ 100 and the 104-seat CRJ1000.
Even as the market has opened for larger regional jets, Mr. Fuller said, the potential for smaller planes has not faded. ''Fifty-seat markets are still there, you just can't economically serve them with the current airplane,'' he said. With larger aircraft, airlines can often save money by reducing the number of flights on a particular route.
As carriers strive to fill every seat on all flights, regional aircraft of various sizes are being deployed on longer routes, said Nawal Taneja, an airline consultant and emeritus professor of aviation at Ohio State University. ''If they can fly a lower-capacity airplane across the country 20 percent cheaper,'' he said, an airline might be able to turn a profit on a route that is unprofitable when using a 250-seat airplane.
One example is Ethiopian Airlines, which uses wide-body Boeing aircraft including the Dreamliner for its 72 long- haul international routes but flies 13 Bombardier Q400 turboprops, which seat about 80 passengers, on shorter routes to expand its network in Africa.
''It doesn't make sense for us to have a regional plan and deploy a 787 or a 777 or a 737,'' said Hailu Teklehaimanot, a spokesman for the airline. ''You need a smaller, narrow-body 100-seater, or less, to cater to that regional capacity with more frequency.''
Mr. Krieger of the Air Line Pilots Association said that figuring out what planes to buy, and where to fly them, required nuanced calculations. Carriers must take into account factors including fuel prices, passenger demand and labor restrictions.
''There is a very high ratio of fixed costs,'' he said, adding that some airlines regretted the purchase of 50-seat jets. ''They're stuck with them. The market value is low over time,'' he noted.
Mitsubishi thus finds itself entering a complicated and difficult market, and sales of its passenger jet have so far been limited to Japan and two U.S. companies, Trans States Airlines and SkyWest Airlines.
Even when a manufacturer thinks it understands what the market wants, unexpected developments can throw calculations out of joint. The lackluster European economy is just one example. ''By no means are we interested only in Japan and America,'' Mr. Egawa said. But, he added, ''Europe's economy is not recovering at a good pace and we are not seeing an intent to buy by the European airlines.''

HEADLINE: After Plans Stall for Talks With South Korea, the North Sends an Invitation to the U.S.

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea proposed high-level talks with the United States on Sunday, saying that it was ready to discuss easing tensions and, eventually, removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
The North's proposal indicated that it was moving toward negotiations after months of bellicose language, including threats to launch nuclear strikes at the United States and South Korea.
In the past few weeks, North Korea has invited a special envoy from Japan and sent one to China, where he told leaders there that Pyongyang was willing to return to the negotiating table. North Korea also proposed discussions with South Korea, though the initial agreement to hold talks in Seoul collapsed last week because of differences over the level of seniority of the delegations. 
Washington has been skeptical of such overtures, given North Korea's history of alternating between provocations and engagement.
''We have always favored dialogue and, in fact, have open lines of communication'' with North Korea, Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
''Our desire is to have credible negotiations with the North Koreans, but those talks must involve North Korea living up to its obligations to the world, including compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and ultimately result in denuclearization,'' Reuters quoted Ms. Hayden as saying. ''We will judge North Korea by its actions, and not its words, and look forward to seeing steps that show North Korea is ready to abide by its commitments and obligations.''
A spokesman of the North's National Defense Commission said Sunday that the United States should not impose preconditions if it is sincere in its efforts to defuse tensions on the peninsula.
In a ''crucial statement'' carried by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, the commission's spokesman said the United States could choose the site and date of any talks.
The commission is the North's top governing agency and is led by Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.
By mentioning the security of the ''U.S. mainland,'' North Korea has appeared to challenge Washington to appease the North with dialogue and concessions or face the prospect that North Korea will continue to expand its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs.
Washington has said that North Korea is trying to build intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of reaching the United States, and nuclear warheads that are small enough to mount on them, although American intelligence agencies differ over how close the North is to mastering such technologies. North Korea successfully launched a satellite into orbit on a three-stage rocket in December and conducted its third nuclear test in February in what it called an attempt to ''miniaturize'' a warhead.
Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said he did not ''see any fundamental change in the North Korean position'' in the latest statement.
The North's statement also said that the denuclearization of the peninsula must include ''totally ending the U.S. nuclear threats,'' essentially repeating the North's long-held position that it would discuss dismantling its nuclear weapons programs but only as part of broader nuclear arms reduction talks in the region.
The latest North Korean overture comes after the summit meeting between President Obama and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, this month. Mr. Xi is scheduled to meet with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea by month's end.
Both Washington and Seoul have been trying to enlist the help of China, the North's traditional ally, to check the North's nuclear ambitions. Some analysts view North Korea's recent proposals of dialogue as attempts to create a rift between Beijing, which favors a negotiated end to the North's nuclear crisis, and Washington and Seoul, which insist that diplomacy as well as economic sanctions are necessary to change the North's course.
Professor Kim said that with Sunday's overture toward Washington, North Korea was telling the South that if it did not engage in discussions, the North would try to talk directly to Washington.
The United States and North Korea reached an agreement in February 2012 in which Washington promised 240,000 tons of food aid and the North agreed to place a moratorium on uranium enrichment and nuclear and missile tests. But that deal quickly collapsed when the North launched a long-range rocket in April 2012 and the United States, seeing the launching as a provocative test of missile technology, scrapped the food aid and led efforts at the United Nations to tighten sanctions against the North.
That experience hardened Washington's position. ''The United States will not engage in talks merely for the sake of talks,'' the State Department's senior envoy on North Korea, Glyn T. Davies, said Friday in a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Mr. Davies said Washington was open to improved relations with North Korea ''if it is willing to take concrete actions to live up to its international obligations and commitments, though given the events of this past year, the bar for a resumption of meaningful engagement is certainly now higher.''
Mr. Davies is scheduled to meet with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Washington this week to discuss North Korea.

HEADLINE: Fight The Future

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week the International Monetary Fund, whose normal role is that of stern disciplinarian to spendthrift governments, gave the United States some unusual advice. ''Lighten up,'' urged the fund. ''Enjoy life! Seize the day!''
O.K., fund officials didn't use quite those words, but they came close, with an article in IMF Survey magazine titled ''Ease Off Spending Cuts to Boost U.S. Recovery.'' In its more formal statement, the fund argued that the sequester and other forms of fiscal contraction will cut this year's U.S. growth rate by almost half, undermining what might otherwise have been a fairly vigorous recovery. And these spending cuts are both unwise and unnecessary. 
Unfortunately, the fund apparently couldn't bring itself to break completely with the austerity talk that is regarded as a badge of seriousness in the policy world. Even while urging us to run bigger deficits for the time being, Christine Lagarde, the fund's head, called on us to ''hurry up with putting in place a medium-term road map to restore long-run fiscal sustainability.''
So here's my question: Why, exactly, do we need to hurry up? Is it urgent that we agree now on how we'll deal with fiscal issues of the 2020s, the 2030s and beyond?
No, it isn't. And in practice, focusing on ''long-run fiscal sustainability'' -- which usually ends up being mainly about ''entitlement reform,'' a k a cuts to Social Security and other programs -- isn't a way of being responsible. On the contrary, it's an excuse, a way to avoid dealing with the severe economic problems we face right now.
What's the problem with focusing on the long run? Part of the answer -- although arguably the least important part -- is that the distant future is highly uncertain (surprise!) and that long-run fiscal projections should be seen mainly as an especially boring genre of science fiction. In particular, projections of huge future deficits are to a large extent based on the assumption that health care costs will continue to rise substantially faster than national income -- yet the growth in health costs has slowed dramatically in the last few years, and the long-run picture is already looking much less dire than it did not long ago.
Now, uncertainty by itself isn't always a reason for inaction. In the case of climate change, for example, uncertainty about the impact of greenhouse gases on global temperatures actually strengthens the case for action, to head off the risk of catastrophe.
But fiscal policy isn't like climate policy, even though some people have tried to make the analogy (even as right-wingers who claim to be deeply concerned about long-term debt remain strangely indifferent to long-term environmental concerns). Delaying action on climate means releasing billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere while we debate the issue; delaying action on entitlement reform has no comparable cost.
In fact, the whole argument for early action on long-run fiscal issues is surprisingly weak and slippery. As I like to point out, the conventional wisdom on these things seems to be that to avert the danger of future benefit cuts, we must act now to cut future benefits. And no, that isn't much of a caricature.
Still, while a ''grand bargain'' that links reduced austerity now to longer-run fiscal changes may not be necessary, does seeking such a bargain do any harm? Yes, it does. For the fact is we aren't going to get that kind of deal -- the country just isn't ready, politically. As a result, time and energy spent pursuing such a deal are time and energy wasted, which would be better spent trying to help the unemployed.
Put it this way: Republicans in Congress have voted 37 times to repeal health care reform, President Obama's signature policy achievement. Do you really expect those same Republicans to reach a deal with the president over the nation's fiscal future, which is closely linked to the future of federal health programs? Even if such a deal were somehow reached, do you really believe that the G.O.P. would honor that deal if and when it regained the White House?
When will we be ready for a long-run fiscal deal? My answer is, once voters have spoken decisively in favor of one or the other of the rival visions driving our current political polarization. Maybe President Hillary Clinton, fresh off her upset victory in the 2018 midterms, will be able to broker a long-run budget compromise with chastened Republicans; or maybe demoralized Democrats will sign on to President Paul Ryan's plan to privatize Medicare. Either way, the time for big decisions about the long run is not yet.
And because that time is not yet, influential people need to stop using the future as an excuse for inaction. The clear and present danger is mass unemployment, and we should deal with it, now.

HEADLINE: The Forgotten 50,000

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
More than 50,000 New Yorkers slept in city homeless shelters and on the streets last night. About 21,000 were children. These numbers are huge and appalling, higher than they were in 2002, when Mayor Michael Bloomberg took office, higher than in the dismal days of the fiscal crisis, the Reagan '80s and the surly administration of Rudolph Giuliani.
New Yorkers who have no permanent place to live form a small city unto themselves -- an abandoned one. The shelter population has risen 61 percent while Mr. Bloomberg has been mayor, propelled by a 73 percent increase in homeless families, according to the Coalition for the Homeless, whose relentless advocacy has been provoking mayoral fury since the 1980s. These surging numbers -- of families with children, especially -- undercut claims that New York is steadily becoming a better place to live, and that its government has gotten better at helping its most vulnerable citizens meet their most basic needs. 
The next mayor will have to do better by them than Mr. Bloomberg. He once proposed energetic and aggressive initiatives on behalf of the homeless. Now he speaks of them with resentment: ''You can arrive in your private jet at Kennedy Airport,'' the mayor said recently, ''take a private limousine and go straight to the shelter system and walk in the door and we've got to give you shelter.''
He is right that city law grants a right to shelter, the result of a hard-fought legal battle that Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly tried to undermine. But he is wrong to imply that the greatest strains on the shelter system come from out-of-towners who have no city roots, or that this crisis is somehow the fault of lawyers and judges.
That isn't true, and it is a diversion from the real problem. His administration is meeting its legal obligation by filling the city's shelters to bursting. But it has failed to keep its promises to significantly shrink the shelter population by giving people the means to live independently and enough paths to permanent housing.
Previous mayors tackled the problem with the assistance of federal programs, helping families in shelters obtain Section 8 rent vouchers and federal public-housing apartments managed by the New York City Housing Authority. So did the Bloomberg administration, for a while. But it broke with those policies in 2005, substituting short-term rent subsidies, which it then abruptly terminated in 2011. That was when homeless families started returning to shelters at an accelerating rate and at great expense. It costs taxpayers an average of $36,799 a year to shelter a family, according to city data, far more than it would to simply subsidize its rent.
With six months left in Mr. Bloomberg's 12-year tenure, the crisis will be the next mayor's to solve. The problems of housing and homelessness are intertwined, fed by many unrelated things: joblessness and the lagging economy, deficiencies in mental-health and addiction care that force vulnerable men and women onto the streets, the simple lack of affordable units and a widening gap between incomes and market rents. The mayoral candidates need to offer solutions that are multifaceted, too, in an era of ever-dwindling federal and state aid.
A coalition of more than a hundred community organizations and advocacy groups, created in April to call attention to the growing crisis, has called for restoring rent subsidies and legal services to protect families from eviction and foreclosure, giving the homeless priority access to low-income housing, and expanding supportive housing for the disabled and mentally ill -- all good ideas. Mr. Bloomberg's Homebase program, begun in 2004 to help residents of some high-poverty neighborhoods avoid eviction, now serves about 11,000 families a year -- a worthwhile effort but only a piece of the broader solution.
The Democratic candidates generally agree on some approaches, like getting developers to include affordable housing in their projects. Comptroller John Liu has proposed a rental-voucher program that he says could save the city $237 million annually in shelter costs. The city's public advocate, Bill de Blasio, has laid out perhaps the most comprehensive housing plan; he wants to create 100,000 and preserve 90,000 affordable housing units in eight years, in various ways, including converting thousands of illegal units into rent-stabilized apartments. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn also wants a new rental subsidy program for homeless families and promises to build 40,000 ''middle income'' units. William Thompson Jr. has an antipoverty plan that includes more Section 8 vouchers for homeless families. Anthony Weiner talks of cutting red tape to get more affordable units built.
Joseph Lhota and John Catsimatidis, Republican candidates, speak of market solutions. So does the Republican George McDonald, who has spent years aiding homeless New Yorkers through his charity, the Doe Fund, which offers job training as a path to a paycheck and an apartment. He says the Doe Fund's approach should be vastly scaled up, which is one reason he is running for mayor.
The city looks cleaner, safer and richer in gentrifying neighborhoods, many lined with luxury high-rises and new amenities, like rental bicycles. But it looks vastly different from the intake center for homeless families in the South Bronx, or the shelter for men on East 30th Street, or the other sites where tens of thousands of New Yorkers are languishing, out of sight and out of mind of the larger city.

HEADLINE: A Latter-Day American Answer to Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring'

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif. -- Mark Morris, the first dance figure to be artistic director of the annual Ojai Festival, has chosen a repertory that largely emphasizes American composers: notably, Henry Cowell, John Cage and Lou Harrison. In Ojai, Calif., Mr. Morris's dancers performed a selection of the works he has made to their music over the decades; he also conducted concerts.
But the one new dance he created -- for the second part of the festival, known as Ojai North and occurring on the University of California campus here -- was to Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' This piece, ''Spring, Spring, Spring,'' had its world premiere on Wednesday at Hertz Hall. On Thursday, in a public interview with the writer Wendy Lesser before the second performance, he said that it was an accident he had turned to this score on the occasion of its centenary. He knew and wanted to collaborate with the jazz trio the Bad Plus, whose pianist, Ethan Iverson, used to be his musical director. The trio first performed ''On Sacred Ground,'' its jazz adaptation of ''Rite,'' two years ago and played it in concert on the first day of the main Ojai Festival, on June 6. 
At the performances of the new dance, the Bad Plus played its version on the Hertz Hall audience's left-hand side. The jazz rendition makes few departures from Stravinsky's score; in most respects it's an electrifying and remarkably close transcription. There are several hair-raising effects: the bassist Reid Anderson plays pizzicato trills that sound like a transposed balalaika; David King, percussionist, produces high-squeaking hums by stroking slow circles around the surface of his cymbal; and on piano Mr. Iverson isolates separate ideas, sonorities and rhythms in his left and right hands as if he were at least two instrumentalists.
The music begins with a five-minute recorded overture, played in complete darkness. Then lights suddenly come on; the Bad Plus, live, continues the score, and the dancers take the stage. The music concludes with not Stravinsky's usual brisk anticlimax but with a more prolonged suggestion of chaos, a quotation from the trio's own ''Physical Cities.''
Mr. Morris's dance begins to give us a latter-day American answer to the score's original Russian primitivist scenario. Barefoot, his dancers are dressed (by Elizabeth Kurtzman) to look like Californian devotees of alternative cultures. The women, wearing flower garlands in their hair and two-toned (white and saffron) calf-length smocks, might be followers of Isadora Duncan (who came from the Bay Area) and 1960s flower power. The men, bare-chested in brightly colored jeans with vine leaves in their hair, might be Berkeley student rebels of the 1960s. Mr. Morris, bearded, wore vine leaves in his hair and red clothes when he took bows.
Yet these Dionysiac suggestions are kept in bizarrely firm Apollonian check by Mr. Morris's virtually plotless choreography. This is a far less violent work -- less primitivist, too -- than his 1993 Lou Harrison ''Grand Duo'' (which seems to depict both neurological turmoil and rites of an ancient tribe) or the witches' coven of his ''Dido and Aeneas.'' The original ''Rite'' scenario is of a ritual that builds to a chosen maiden dancing herself to death; most other versions have featured aspects of violence, whether self-harming, social, biological or sexual. In ''Spring, Spring, Spring,'' however, nobody dies or suffers. Nobody loses control or seems even remotely agitated.
Mr. Morris uses 15 dancers, deploying them largely in three teams -- four men; five women and three male-female couples. Various geometries develop. Though the social units sometimes merge, this occurs without real stress. When groups move in different meters at the same time, the stage picture remains one of harmony: a pattern that easily contains divergent impulses.
The image of greatest tension is also the one of greatest concord. Facing front, the three lines stand close together. Arms and torsos bend to and fro so that the lines intermesh like an impersonal mechanism. But this is not the harsh implacable machine of Nijinska's 1923 Stravinsky ballet, ''Les Noces''; it's more like a beautiful loom.
At the end the dancers turn to us, almost as if ready to take bows. Instead, as the Bad Plus version of the music ends on its brooding low cacophony, they sink to the floor in squatting positions (each with one leg extended): a picture of deflation, without teams or pattern or purpose. It's so odd an anticlimax that, as the lights fell, the first audience sound after the second performance was a single laugh -- ''Ha!''
More than any other choreographer today, Mr. Morris loves to stud a work with repeated movement motifs. Those here include jumps on the spot in which the dancers jut their heads forward at the apex, and various flattened sideways walks in the idiom of Nijinsky's 1912 ''L'Après-Midi d'un Faune.'' You can't miss these, but it's hard to know what points Mr. Morris hopes to make about the music with them. And it's hard to say how ''Spring, Spring, Spring'' adds up. It's the most contained response to Stravinsky's ''Rite'' I've ever seen.
Far more rewarding in both Berkeley performances was the 20-year-old work that preceded it, Mr. Morris's ''Mosaic and United'' (1993). This dance quintet, set to -- and taking its title from -- Mr. Cowell's string quartets No. 3 and 4 (1935 and 1936), was accompanied by the American String Quartet, playing -- superbly -- on the audience's right. Here is a work in which Mr. Morris's motifs, rhythms and structures fall into perfect balance.
Movement and music often work in separate meters and formats, but in a harmony in which sight and sound deepen each other. The motifs are haunting -- as when a dancer looks fixedly up at one wrist while swinging the other arm behind him -- like clues in a mystery story.

HEADLINE: Our Schools, Cut Off From the Web

BYLINE: By LUIS A. UBIÑAS. 
Luis A. Ubiñas is president of the Ford Foundation.

 BODY:
ON June 6, at a middle school in Mooresville, N.C., President Obama set a goal of high-speed Internet in nearly every public school in America in five years. It was a bold and needed pronouncement -- except that in 1996 President Clinton said virtually the same thing, calling for libraries and classrooms to be ''hooked up to the Information Superhighway by the year 2000.''
Many people reading this article are probably doing so on a smartphone, tablet or computer. They might not know that half of Americans don't own a smartphone, one-third lack a broadband connection and one-fifth don't use the Web at all. 
Since 2007, when I was named president of the Ford Foundation, we've given $44.5 million to dozens of organizations -- like Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, the Mozilla Foundation and the Media and Democracy Coalition -- to make the Internet more accessible, affordable and mindful of privacy.
But as I prepare to step down in September, I must acknowledge that there has been little real progress on this issue. Like any effort to develop our national infrastructure, success demands more than the dedication of the nonprofit sector alone.
The factors that will drive our national future -- educational achievement, a healthy population, broad political participation and economic opportunity for all -- depend in significant ways on how we structure and manage our spreading digital frontier. About 19 million Americans still lack access to high-speed broadband; many more can't afford it.
Virtually all of America's schools are connected to the Internet today. But that success is a lot like trumpeting, a century ago, that virtually every town in the country was reachable by road. Then, as now, the question is quality. Children who go to school in poor neighborhoods are connected to the Web at speeds so slow as to render most educational Web sites unusable. The exploding world of free online courses from great academies is closed to those who lack a digital pathway.
In 1996, when Mr. Clinton predicted that the Internet would revolutionize education, the future seemed full of possibility. The Telecommunications Act that year established E-Rate, which subsidizes Internet connections for schools and libraries. The program, capped at $2.25 billion a year, is inadequate -- many schools are connected but lack classroom connections, essential hardware and funds for maintenance. Only 63 percent of 150,000 eligible schools were participating as of 2009; some fear bureaucratic hassle or can't afford the required matching funds. Eighty percent of schools financed by E-Rate report that their broadband connections fall short of their needs.
Since the mid-1990s, a generation of American children has passed through our schools with substandard access to the online world. This is how an information underclass begins to take root -- a disturbing contribution to our era of inequality, when jobs and economic opportunity flow to those with the best-honed digital skills.
Mr. Obama was right to call attention to this problem. A good first step in addressing it would be to overhaul E-Rate to make sure it gets the Web into every classroom and library, not just a school, either through cable or Wi-Fi, and with sufficient financing for upkeep. Second, a subset of teachers and librarians need to be trained as champions of digital education. Without such advocates, the pedagogical impact of broadband won't be fully realized. Third, any conversation on national infrastructure must put broadband as a priority alongside aviation, bridges, energy, highways, ports, rail and water.
Our future depends on the ability of every American to participate fully in our digital economy and democracy. As Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ''We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.''

HEADLINE: The Declining Demand for Husbands

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The marriage market might work better if men were more flexible about changing gender roles and more willing to help out with family care, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Once upon a time women seemed more eager than men to marry. Today such generalizations no longer apply.
Is it women's preferences (the demand for husbands) or men's preferences (the supply of husbands) that are driving the trend toward less marriage? It's hard to tell, but some gender asymmetries are apparent. For instance, a recent poll of unmarried blacks of prime marrying age found that only 25 percent of women were seeking a long-term relationship compared with 43 percent of men.
Some people may dislike application of concepts like supply and demand to the search for potential lifetime partners. After all, we like to think of ourselves - and our partners - as unique individuals, not as substitutes or next-best choices. 
But the concept of a marriage market offers some useful insights into the evolution of marriage as an institution. It also helps explain why markets don't always generate efficient adjustments to new circumstances.

As a contractual commitment, marriage has a price. It offers both costs and benefits to potential partners. The contract involves commitments for financial support and family care on terms that can be completely egalitarian.
But the terms can also be more advantageous to men or to women. For example, Anglo-American law traditionally gave men greater rights than women in marriage, and some religious traditions today encourage wives, but not husbands, to promise obedience.
Economic prospects matter: not just the relative earnings of men and women but also their relative contributions of time and energy to domestic work and family care.
Women are willing to pay a higher price for marriage than men if they have few alternatives, as when their opportunities for economic independence are restricted. An increase in the supply of women who want to marry drives the price of marriage down for men.
In these circumstances, as the economist Shoshana Grossbard puts it, husbands can pay a low "quasi-wage" for domestic services.
If the supply of women who want to marry decreases, the terms of marriage move in favor of women. They are likely to receive a larger share of joint income and leisure time. Husbands become more likely to relinquish some decision-making power and do more housework and child care.
Marriage market dynamics mean that a bride's bargaining power is partly determined by the number of other choices her groom has (and vice versa). The changing terms of marriage complicate the effects of women's improved economic position. On the one hand, men should like the prospect of sharing income with a high-earning woman. On the other hand, they may find it difficult to adjust to a new social role.
Considerable research suggests that gender roles are, in fact, pretty sticky. In a recent article, Marianne Bertrand, Jessica Pan and Emir Kamenica offer evidence that wives often try to enact traditional gender roles in an apparent effort to reassure their husbands that they are not a threat. (The New York Times took note of their findings in an article and a commentary.)
These economists also contend that couples in which the wife earns more than the husband are less satisfied with their marriage and are more likely to divorce. But as the sociologist Philip Cohen points out, this assertion is based on data more than 20 years old and disregards a large body of sociological research.
Some attitudes have recently changed in the United States. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, only about 28 percent of respondents this year agreed that "it was generally better for a marriage if a husband earns more than his wife," compared with 40 percent in 1997.
Economic factors may shape the pace of attitudinal change. In a fascinating study of nonmarriage among women college graduates in Japan, Jisoo Hwang observes that men whose mothers were employed have less traditional attitudes than other men and were also more likely to marry. She hypothesizes that the relatively recent and abrupt increase in female employment in that country made it more difficult for men there to adjust.
Some evidence from the United States suggests that class and education also influence role flexibility. Affluent couples are more likely to marry than other Americans, perhaps because they don't need to renegotiate gender roles; they can purchase substitutes for wives' traditional domestic work in the form of restaurant meals, child care and cleaning services.
Higher education may give students more familiarity with normative change and more experience negotiating differences. In the Pew survey referred to above, adults with a college degree were only half as likely as those with only a high school diploma to say it is generally better for a marriage if a husband out-earns a wife.
The demand for long-term commitments seems to be steadily declining among both women and men. Philip Cohen persuasively asserts that we should stop bemoaning this change and adapt to a world in which fewer adults marry.
But it is also worth noting that inflexible rules and sticky gender roles impede adjustments that could help increase both the demand for and supply of potential spouses. The sociologist Kathleen Gerson develops this position in some detail in her book "The Unfinished Revolution."
As same-sex couples have profoundly demonstrated, the demand for marriage is not based on some natural sexual division of labor, but on the desire to give personal commitments public recognition.
Men and women who get this point probably enjoy a distinct advantage in finding a partner, whether or not they are lucky enough to achieve long-run equilibrium with someone they love.

HEADLINE: Telefonica Denies Talk of Takeover Bid From AT&T

BYLINE: RAPHAEL MINDER and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Speculation about a possible $93 billion bid comes as a number of international companies circle European telecommunications assets. 

 BODY:
MADRID - Telefónica denied a report on Monday that AT&T had made a $93 billion approach for the Spanish telecommunications giant
The denial came after a report by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that the American company had been thwarted in a potential bid for Telefónica after the Spanish government told AT&T it would oppose such a deal for national strategic reasons.
 AT&T's prospective deal would also have included the assumption of Telefónica's 52 billion euros in debt, according to El Mundo. 
In Madrid, shares of Telefónica rose as much as 3.9 percent on Monday before paring back gains. They were up 2.6 percent in late morning trading.
Telefónica has been hurt by an increasingly difficult economic environment and has been looking to unload or spin off assets to reduce its debt levels. The company has been weighed down by a lengthy recession in Spain, which still represents a third of its operating profit but where it lost more than three million customers last year. 
Despite Europe's gloomy outlook, the phone, wireless and cable sector has been one of the few bright spots in the moribund mergers and acquisitions market, as several American players, including John C. Malone's Liberty Global, continue to hunt for assets. 
The Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helúhas acquired companies like the Dutch cellphone operator KPN and its Austrian counterpart, Telekom Austria. Mr. Malone's Liberty Global also recently completed its $16 billion takeover of the British cable company Virgin Media. 
Rumors also abounded that Verizon was planning a $100 billion approach to buy the 45 percent stake it did not already own in Verizon Wireless from its British partner, Vodafone.
In a brief statement, Telefónica said it had not been approached by AT&T.
"In relation to press rumors published today, Telefónica states that it has not received any approach, nor any indication of interest, neither verbal nor in written form, from any party," the company said.
A representative for AT&T declined to comment
The Spanish economy's problems, coupled with Telefónica's mountain of debt after a decade of aggressive investments in Latin America and Europe, raised concerns last year over how the company would be able to continue servicing its debt. Recent divestments, though, have helped alleviate such concerns. So did the decision by Telefónica to scrap its dividend payment for 2012. The company is aiming to cut its debt to below 47 billion euros by the end of this year from about 52 billion euros now. 
As part of debt-reduction efforts, Telefónica spun off its German subsidiary, Telefónica Deutschland, raising $1.9 billion in Europe's largest initial public stock offering last year.
The company also sold its $1.4 billion stake in China Unicom back to the Chinese firm, while it continues to consider a potential listing for its Latin American divisions.
More than half of the assets of Telefónica are in Latin America, where its main competitor has been América Móvil, controlled by Mr. Slim.
AT&T reduced its stake in América Móvil to 9 percent this month, but remains the second-largest shareholder in the company after Mr. Slim and his family. Any deal with Telefónica would therefore probably raise antitrust issues in Latin American markets. 
The Spanish government also denied on Monday that it had vetoed a takeover approach by AT&T. José Manuel Soria, the industry minister, told Spanish national television that he held talks with the management of AT&T at a conference in Barcelona earlier this year, but that the American executives had not made any mention of Telefónica as a possible target as part of their expansion plans in the European market. 
 Mark Scott reported from London.

HEADLINE: Telefonica Shares Climb

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Telef&#243;nica shares climb after a report of an AT&#038;T takeover bid. | Weyerhaeuser is buying 645,000 acres of timberland. | The last remaining private equity unit of JPMorgan Chase is being spun out. | A planned sale of synthetic collateralized-debt obligations falls apart. 

 BODY:
Shares of the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica climbed on Monday after a report in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that AT&T had made a $93 billion offer for the company that was rejected by the government. But Telefónica was forced to deny the report. "In relation to press rumors published today, Telefónica states that it has not received any approach, nor any indication of interest, neither verbal nor in written form, from any party," the Spanish company said in a statement. In Madrid, shares of Telefónica rose as much as 3.9 percent on Monday before paring back gains. They were up 2.6 percent in late morning trading, DealBook's Mark Scott writes.
The Spanish industry minister, José Manuel Soria, said on Monday that he had no knowledge of an offer by AT&T for Telefónica, but acknowledged that he had met with the chairman of AT&T, Randall L. Stephenson, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, The Financial Times reports.
THE BIG FORESTRY DEAL | Weyerhaeuser said on Sunday that it planned to acquire Longview Timber from Brookfield Asset Management, gaining 645,000 acres of timberland, for about $2.65 billion. The company added that it was weighing a sale or spinoff of its home-building unit, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. 
The deal expands Weyerhaeuser's holdings in the Pacific Northwest by 33 percent, to 2.6 million acres, and increases its overall holdings in the United States to 6.6 million acres. Weyerhaeuser is paying for the deal by raising about $2.45 billion in debt and equity, including through loans from Morgan Stanley. The company also plans to raise its quarterly dividend to 22 cents a share from 20 cents. According to Bloomberg News, it is the third-largest forestry acquisition in North America.
Weyerhaeuser is also considering a potential sale or spinoff of its home-building division, the Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company, which includes Pardee Homes. But the company may also decide to hold onto the unit, which reported nearly $1.1 billion in revenue last year, a 28 percent increase from 2011.
JPMORGAN TO SPIN OUT PRIVATE EQUITY UNIT | The last remaining private equity unit of JPMorgan Chase, One Equity Partners, is being spun out into a separate company and is raising its next fund as an independent firm. "The move comes as banks are facing regulatory pressure to reduce their exposure to risky businesses, but the divestment of One Equity, which manages $4.5 billion of the bank's money, was not in response to that, according to a person briefed on the matter," DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. "Instead, this person said, the decision is a reflection of JPMorgan's emphasis on its client businesses rather than making investments off the firm's balance sheet."
"One of the bank's reasons for de-emphasizing its private equity investments - especially the ones that were made by its largest unit, JPMorgan Partners - is that it didn't want to be in businesses that directly competed with some of its prized private equity clients, like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts," Mr. Lattman continues.
ON THE AGENDA | Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, is being honored at the annual gala of Harlem RBI and Dream Charter School, starting at 5 p.m. in Manhattan. The lawyer H. Rodgin Cohen of Sullivan & Cromwell is on Bloomberg TV at 7:45 a.m. Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m.
A DERIVATIVES DEAL FALLS APART | JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were planning a sale of "synthetic collateralized-debt obligations," derivative investments that were at the heart of the financial crisis. But the attempt failed after investors balked at buying some of the products being offered, The Financial Times reports. The bankers had been looking to revive the synthetic C.D.O.'s "after receiving inquiries from some investors hungry for higher-yielding investments," the newspaper writes.

HIGHLIGHT: Twitter introduces analytics and Facebook introduces hashtags. Old Spock battles the new Spock (in a well-received new commercial). Do you think the cloud is more secure than your own environment? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 Must-Reads 
Kevin Colleran discusses the troubles of raising an entrepreneur. Cullen Roche says these are the three worst financial predictions from the past five years, and David Rotman explains how technology is destroying jobs.
 Economy: Is Bernanke the Best? 
The government's finances continue to get better, Standard & Poor's upgrades its outlook for government debt, but the United States hits the debt ceiling anyway. Housing gains may be setting off an uneven small-business recovery. Dan Ritter lists four reasons that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, may be the world's best central banker. Mortgage applications increase and mortgage rates are the highest since March 2012. Retail sales (pdf) also increase. But machine tool orders drop, the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index continues to show worse-than-average conditions, and there were still 3.8 million job openings on the last business day of April (little changed from 3.9 million in March). Robert Reich wants a national economic strategy for better jobs. 
 Small Business Week: The Complete Schedule 
Here's the Small Business Administration's complete schedule for Small Business Week. ADP will be a co-sponsor of some events and contribute to panel discussions on the new health care law. The UPS Store is also showing the love. The National Federation of Independent Business reports a rise in small-business confidence, and another survey says three of four small-business owners expect revenues to increase in the next year. But a Pew study shows that 70 percent of small-business owners see threats to their businesses and the economy from the lack of retirement security. The Hartford finds small-business owners are playing it safer.

HEADLINE: Telefonica Shares Climb

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Telef&#243;nica shares climb after a report of an AT&#038;T takeover bid. | Weyerhaeuser is buying 645,000 acres of timberland. | The last remaining private equity unit of JPMorgan Chase is being spun out. | A planned sale of synthetic collateralized-debt obligations falls apart. 

 BODY:
Shares of the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica climbed on Monday after a report in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that AT&T had made a $93 billion offer for the company that was rejected by the government. But Telefónica was forced to deny the report. "In relation to press rumors published today, Telefónica states that it has not received any approach, nor any indication of interest, neither verbal nor in written form, from any party," the Spanish company said in a statement. In Madrid, shares of Telefónica rose as much as 3.9 percent on Monday before paring back gains. They were up 2.6 percent in late morning trading, DealBook's Mark Scott writes.
The Spanish industry minister, José Manuel Soria, said on Monday that he had no knowledge of an offer by AT&T for Telefónica, but acknowledged that he had met with the chairman of AT&T, Randall L. Stephenson, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, The Financial Times reports.
THE BIG FORESTRY DEAL | Weyerhaeuser said on Sunday that it planned to acquire Longview Timber from Brookfield Asset Management, gaining 645,000 acres of timberland, for about $2.65 billion. The company added that it was weighing a sale or spinoff of its home-building unit, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. 
The deal expands Weyerhaeuser's holdings in the Pacific Northwest by 33 percent, to 2.6 million acres, and increases its overall holdings in the United States to 6.6 million acres. Weyerhaeuser is paying for the deal by raising about $2.45 billion in debt and equity, including through loans from Morgan Stanley. The company also plans to raise its quarterly dividend to 22 cents a share from 20 cents. According to Bloomberg News, it is the third-largest forestry acquisition in North America.
Weyerhaeuser is also considering a potential sale or spinoff of its home-building division, the Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company, which includes Pardee Homes. But the company may also decide to hold onto the unit, which reported nearly $1.1 billion in revenue last year, a 28 percent increase from 2011.
JPMORGAN TO SPIN OUT PRIVATE EQUITY UNIT | The last remaining private equity unit of JPMorgan Chase, One Equity Partners, is being spun out into a separate company and is raising its next fund as an independent firm. "The move comes as banks are facing regulatory pressure to reduce their exposure to risky businesses, but the divestment of One Equity, which manages $4.5 billion of the bank's money, was not in response to that, according to a person briefed on the matter," DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. "Instead, this person said, the decision is a reflection of JPMorgan's emphasis on its client businesses rather than making investments off the firm's balance sheet."
"One of the bank's reasons for de-emphasizing its private equity investments - especially the ones that were made by its largest unit, JPMorgan Partners - is that it didn't want to be in businesses that directly competed with some of its prized private equity clients, like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts," Mr. Lattman continues.
ON THE AGENDA | Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, is being honored at the annual gala of Harlem RBI and Dream Charter School, starting at 5 p.m. in Manhattan. The lawyer H. Rodgin Cohen of Sullivan & Cromwell is on Bloomberg TV at 7:45 a.m. Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m.
A DERIVATIVES DEAL FALLS APART | JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were planning a sale of "synthetic collateralized-debt obligations," derivative investments that were at the heart of the financial crisis. But the attempt failed after investors balked at buying some of the products being offered, The Financial Times reports. The bankers had been looking to revive the synthetic C.D.O.'s "after receiving inquiries from some investors hungry for higher-yielding investments," the newspaper writes.

HEADLINE: 1984, Hungarian Edition

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Big Brother is watching. 

 BODY:
My Princeton colleague Kim Lane Scheppele, who has been tracking political developments in Hungary, weighs in with the latest, after the jump.
1984 Redux, Hungarian Edition
Kim Lane Scheppele
16 June 2013
The Hungarian parliament recently passed a new national security law that enables the inner circle of the government to spy on people who hold important public offices. Under this law, many government officials must "consent" to being observed in the most intrusive way (phones tapped, homes bugged, email read) for up to two full months each year, except that they won't know which 60 days they are under surveillance. 
Perhaps they will imagine they are under surveillance all of the time. Perhaps that is the point. More than 20 years after Hungary left the world captured in George Orwell's novel 1984, the surveillance state is back. 
Now, if the Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán finds something it doesn't like - and there's no legal limit to what it may find objectionable - those under surveillance can be fired. The people at the very top of the government are largely exempt from surveillance - but this law hits their deputies, staffers and the whole of the security services, some judges, prosecutors, diplomats, and military officers, as well as a number of "independent" offices that Orbán's administration is not supposed to control. 
The Orwellian aspirations of governments are obviously not confined to Hungary. The disclosure of two giant data collection programs carried out by the US National Security Agency shows that too many governments still aspire to know too much about too many people. I'm already on record as a critic of the American warrantless wiretapping programs, since I filed an amicus brief in Clapper v. Amnesty International, the case before the US Supreme Court this term that attempted to challenge the program. The US Supreme Court refused to grant the plaintiffs standing so the program has so far escaped judicial review. Many excellent legal analysts are writing about law underlying this program so I won't add to that in this post. For one particularly insightful and nonobvious take on the relevant law, see here. 
Of course, one of the many negative consequences of the American surveillance program is that other governments will claim the right to follow in the US's footsteps. But an overreaching surveillance regime in the US does not justify a horrible copy elsewhere. I will concentrate in this post on the new Hungarian national security law, offered as a set of amendments to the 1995 law on the same topic, amendments which passed shortly before the US surveillance scandals broke. 
Under Hungary's new national security law, certain authorized government officials may initiate intrusive surveillance on their higher-level underlings through asking for a surveillance order. Generating a surveillance order doesn't require that the target be suspected of doing anything illegal. Any old reason will do. 
And who approves surveillance orders? No judicial warrants are needed. The only required approval comes from the Minister of Justice, a feature which keeps control of the program within the inner circles of the government. (Readers of my earlier posts may recall that this is the same person who has to approve much of the secret surveillance carried out by the Counter-Terrorism Police, or TEK.) 
How can surveillance lead to a person being fired? The national security law creates a new qualification for whole series of jobs in the Hungarian government. All listed employees must now pass annual surveillance tests in order to remain in their jobs. Now that the law has passed, potential targets of surveillance must sign a "consent" form. If the targets have spouses, the spouses must sign consent forms, too. And if the targets or their spouses don't consent to this surveillance, the targets lose their jobs. In short, this "consent" is not optional and the whole family is fair game for surveillance. 
The primary goal of this program appears to be gathering "dirt" on particular people and holding this information against them when their superiors find it useful to do so. That may explain why the surveillance program collects the content of all communications as well as the results of audio and video monitoring inside people's homes, and the information may be stored for 20 years. Though the program allegedly evaluates people for fitness to work, the surveillance is not limited to what people do at work. Instead, it examines every detail of employees' lives "with a particular view to their behavior outside their employment, personal relationships, material or income status, or relationship with a person who, to their knowledge, has been sentenced for a criminal offence." So says the law. There are no provisions for the redaction of irrelevant information, something that would be hard to do with no definition of relevance in the law. 
Who is now subjected to this surveillance requirement? Here's the list: 
Hungarian ambassadors and heads of consulates, anywhere in the world.
Judges and prosecutors who work either with information gathered through secret surveillance or with information that might result in accepting a defendant's cooperation with the government in exchange for not being prosecuted (plea bargains).
State commissioners, who are people appointed on an ad hoc basis to manage specific high-level tasks in the government.
Deputy state secretaries, who are people working directly under government ministers and their state secretaries.
Heads of the autonomous and self-regulating government agencies, a designation that includes the public procurement office, the office of economic competition, the equal treatment authority, the data protection office, national media council, the financial supervisory authority and the energy and public utilities authority.
Heads of "government offices," their deputies and people of equivalent rank, a designation that includes regional offices of the central government, the central statistical office, national atomic energy agency, national office of intellectual property and the national tax and tariff office.
Senior staff in the Parliament's central office.
Senior staff in the office of the President of the Republic.
The chief of the army, generals and others with equivalent rank.
All heads of police departments (national, regional and local).
All heads of state-owned companies.
All employees of all of the security services, including the new Counter-Terrorism Police (TEK), the new Parliamentary Guard, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (domestic intelligence), the Information Office (foreign intelligence), the National Security Expert Service (signals intelligence), the Military National Security Service, and the internal affairs unit of the police. 
Since surveillance includes both sides of all communications, anyone who interacts with any of these people may have their words and deeds captured for 20 years as well. If state employees on this list are found to be doing something that the inner circle of the Fidesz government objects to, they can be classified as national security risks, a classification which disqualifies them from their jobs. 
The surveillance is carried out by the National Security Expert Service (NSES) which has the technical capacity to wiretap, install bugs and intercept electronic communications. The law gives the Office for Constitutional Protection (OCP) responsibility for assessing the information collected in the surveillance sweeps to determine whether someone poses a danger to national security. Since all of the employees of both the NSES and the OCP can be put under intrusive surveillance themselves for up to two months each year, this must make for some interesting office politics. 
When the OCP is finished with its assessment of each target of surveillance, it turns the results over to the official who ordered the surveillance and that official makes the decision about whether the target is to be blacklisted. But the national security law provides no guidance either to the Office for Constitutional Protection or to the official who makes the decision because it does not indicate what they should be looking for or what procedures they must follow in making such determinations. Under the law, the targets of the surveillance have no right to appear at a hearing, nor do they have an opportunity to explain or provide additional evidence before the fateful determination is made. In fact, the targets won't even know when they are under surveillance or when the results are being assessed, so they can hardly insist on participating in a secret process. The law only says that the targets are to be informed when they have been blacklisted and given the reason why they have been so classified. But that reason may also be withheld from the target if the reason is classified as a state secret. 
How may a state employee who has flunked the surveillance test get the assessment reconsidered? It depends on which office the person occupies. In general, the official at the top of the employee's workplace hierarchy can be asked to review the judgment. So, for example, if a blacklisted employee works in the central office of the Parliament or in the Parliamentary Guard, the Speaker of the Parliament can be asked to reconsider the classification; if the blacklisted person works in the office of the President of the Republic, the President can be asked to reassess the risk. The president of the National Judicial Office evaluates the blacklisted judges. The Chief Public Prosecutor evaluates the blacklisted prosecutors. Anyone working for the security services can appeal up to the Interior Minister. 
The Prime Minister himself is the judge of last resort for the rest: the heads of the autonomous and self-regulating agencies, the heads of the government offices, diplomats, deputy state secretaries, state commissioners, military personnel, heads of the police and owners of state-owned enterprises. 
According to the law, decisions at this ministerial level are final and cannot be appealed to any court. 
Once a person has been blacklisted, however, she will no longer be eligible for her job. This will lead to a termination procedure through which the person is formally fired. But outcome of this procedure is not in doubt. The official who presides over the firing process will only be able to reach one conclusion: the blacklisted person must be fired because she no longer meets the qualifications for her job. 
Any fired state employee can appeal her dismissal to a labor court. But since the decision to blacklist someone cannot be second-guessed by the labor court judge either, there is not much that the court can do. Judicial review of the procedure in these cases is very nearly meaningless. 
Before someone moves into any of the positions that are flagged for the two-month surveillance each year, she must go through a background check, an elaborate process that can be carried out for up to 45 days. In addition to the jobs on the list above, government ministers, state secretaries and the members of Parliament who are on the intelligence committees must also go through a background check before they take office, even though they cannot be spied on again once they are in those jobs. 
To begin the background check, the applicant fills in a questionnaire that requires, among other things, information about the foreign contacts of both the would-be job holder and the spouse. This then triggers a thorough investigation in which intelligence officers ask people for information about the target, gather information about the target from communications and data storage systems (like phone companies and internet service providers), record the person in public places, engage the target with secret informers, create fake organizations and documents to make the target believe she is interacting with someone else and engage in the disturbing option of "creating traps that do not cause physical harm." (A direct quote from the law.) Of course, if someone flunks the background check, then she doesn't get the job in the first place. 
Those specifically exempted from either the background checks or the intrusive surveillance include the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, Constitutional Court judges, the Speaker of the Parliament, the president of the Supreme Court (Curia), the president of the National Judicial Office, the Chief Public Prosecutor, the ombudsman and his deputies, the head of the data protection agency and members of the European Parliament. 
The Hungarian government argues that the new national security law protects state secrets and guards against corruption. But the law doesn't limit the surveillance to looking for evidence of leaked secrets or bribes. Instead, anything that might be compromising seems to be in its remit. If the Hungarian government decides to fire a public official for having an extra-marital affair or refuses to appoint a public official who is too friendly with the political opposition, the national security law could provide cover. 
Officials of the Hungarian government will say that what they are doing is nothing novel. Other countries, they will point out, have ways to determine whether high-level officials have played fast and loose with state secrets or whether people holding the public trust are corrupt. The US government has now been shown to be gathering up everyone's phone calls and emails, so how can anyone be critical of what the Hungarian government is doing?
I'm deeply critical of the US programs too, but the existence of the US programs should not give license for every other government on earth to spy on people without any concrete suspicion. Given that the Hungarian surveillance program involves listening to the content of phone conversations, reading emails and bugging the houses of state officials to see what they are doing, there are particular dangers here. What is to prevent the Hungarian government from simply blackmailing people with what they find? What keeps the Hungarian government from acting on purely political information (firing someone for criticizing the government, for example)? The law contains no meaningful protections against the use of the information for political and personal reasons and it offers no procedures that would reliably correct mistakes. 
European Union law requires that the collection of personal information about individuals be examined by an independent data privacy officer who has the power to review government policies and actions in this area without fear of political interference. At the moment, the European Court of Justice has before it an infringement action brought by the European Commission that challenges the Hungarian government's firing of the previous data protection ombudsman, but the decision has not been announced. While the data privacy officer himself is on the list of persons exempted in the national security law, his office is still on the list of those whom the Prime Minister can put under surveillance. With this sort of legal ambiguity at the heart of the law, who is to oversee those who are collecting all of this information and who is to guarantee that these surveillance checks are not abused?
When Orwell wrote his famous novel in 1949 about the all-seeing surveillance state, the Cold War was rapidly closing in. Those on the eastern side of Europe were consigned to states in which personal privacy could never be taken for granted. A country that had been through that experience might be expected to have a particular sensitivity to what it means to turn citizens into spies against each other, especially a country whose leaders now pronounce their anti-communist sympathies at every turn. But the current Hungarian government seems to have learned little from its country's recent past. Those who refuse to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. In Hungary, it is now approaching 1984 again.

HEADLINE: In China, a Push for Cleaner Air

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: An ambitious package of measures to combat air pollution and a summit meeting between President Obama and President Xi Jinping might have been overshadowed by Edward J. Snowden and his disclosures about the National Security Agency&#8217;s cyberactivities. 

 BODY:
China's State Council announced an ambitious package on Friday of 10 measures to combat air pollution. On Monday, Jun Ma, chief economist for greater China at Deutsche Bank and the author of the June 9 report "Big Bang Measures to Fight Air Pollution," wrote in a note:
It is the most aggressive policy effort to address air quality issues in China's history. Within these 10 broad measures, there are nearly 20 more specific actions. We believe these measures represent the beginning, rather than the full package, of China's anti-air pollution campaign. Its sectoral implications will include a reduction in coal consumption growth; faster growth of clean energies such as gas, solar, wind and nuclear; faster growth in the adoption of environment-related technologies; faster growth of public transportation; and a faster reduction in polluting and technologically outdated capacities in the steel, cement, aluminum and glass sectors. 
Air pollution is a major problem in China (remember the January "airpocalypse"?) and steps to alleviate the problem are vital to the government's stated goals of building a "beautiful China" and improving people's welfare. Implementation in China, however, tends to lag behind lofty policy pronouncements, and a recent academic study found that investment in environmental projects lowers mayors' career prospects.
Still, Vance Wagner, an American clean transportation engineer with long experience in China, found reason to be optimistic about these new measures. He argues that the language in the official Chinese announcementof the new measures "indicates for the first time that local leaders in China will be on the hook not just for vague, gameable targets like total emissions reductions, but actual improvements in measured ambient air quality."
Any efforts to address one of China's environmental crises is welcome but progress will come over decades, even with aggressive implementation.
The same State Council meeting also promised support for China's solar industry through easier financing and policies to increase demand for electricity generated from solar. The industry is one of many struggling with significant overcapacity and it now faces a possible trade war with Europe.
Perhaps the most concrete announcement from the Sunnylands summit meeting between President Obama and President Xi Jinping wasan agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions by committing to phase out the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. 
But whatever good will generated at the summit meeting might have been quickly overshadowed by Edward J. Snowden.
Mr. Snowden's disclosures of the National Security Agency's cyberactivities and his flight to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China have been a boon for Beijing. Official media is starting to have a bit of a field day with his revelations.
A Xinhua columnist wrote that as a whistle-blower he was "welcome in China" in an online article accompanied by a cartoon of a rat dressed as the Statue of Liberty peeking into a computer covered by a Chinese flag. Another cartoon, this one in The China Daily, showed the Statue of Liberty with the shadow of a spy with eavesdropping equipment.
What is more serious, the official People's Daily on Mondaypublished a commentary on Mr. Snowden's leaks under a pseudonym frequently used to express the paper's foreign policy views. The author wrote that Mr. Snowden had helped to expose American hypocrisy and that America's "exceptionalism is an impediment to the transformation of international relations."
The effect on American business in China from Mr. Snowden's actions are unclear. Over the years, there have been occasional discussions in Chinese media about the risks to national security from a reliance on United States software, networking and telecommunications hardware.
Just as Huawei is now effectively blocked from selling its networking equipment in the United States, we should not be surprised to see more aggressive moves from Beijing to shut out American firms like Cisco Systems, which one Chinese news report on Monday noted had significant market share in core parts of Chinese networks.
Mr. Snowden's disclosures may also explain why certain parts of the United States government have been so concerned about Huawei; they fear the Chinese government could use Huawei to do what the N.S.A. already does. Protests from Washington will be much harder to take seriously now if American technology firms start getting "Huawei'd" in Beijing on national security grounds.
Accusations that Mr. Snowden may be a Chinese spy are beginning in Washington. The former Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox Newsthat Mr. Snowden was a traitor and possibly a spy. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York,told MSNBC that he suspected Mr. Snowden could be "in cahoots with the Chinese government" because, among other reasons, he studied Chinese. This is clearly a serious case, but we should hope it does not lead to "Red Scare 2.0" on Capitol Hill.
To Washington, Mr. Snowden may be an enemy of the state, and to civil libertarians, he may be a hero. To Beijing, he is at least a significant propaganda prize, if not much more.

HEADLINE: The Current U.S. Economy: Text and Subtext

BYLINE: JARED BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: An International Monetary Fund report paints a picture of a tepid American economy, a situation that would be better if not for policy mistakes and misplaced priorities, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
The International Monetary Fund just published its most recent assessment of the United States economy. Its summary, below, is clear and incisive. Yet, there's another layer to all of this so I've added annotations - the numbers in brackets - intended to peel back the economic onion a bit, as it were. 
The United States recovery has remained tepid over the last year [1], but underlying fundamentals have been gradually improving [2]. The modest growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2012 [3] reflected legacy effects from the financial crisis, fiscal deficit reduction [4], a weak external environment [5], and temporary effects of extreme weather-related events. These headwinds notwithstanding, the nature of the recovery appears to be changing. In particular, house prices and construction activity have rebounded, household balance sheets have strengthened, labor market conditions have improved, and corporate profitability and balance sheets remain strong, especially for large firms [6]. With the sizable output gap and well-anchored inflation [7] expectations keeping inflation subdued, the Fed appropriately continued to add monetary policy accommodation over the past year by increasing its asset purchases and linking the path of short-term rates to quantitative measures of economic performance, thus helping to maintain long-term rates at exceptionally low levels [8]. Overall financial conditions have eased, as risk spreads narrowed, stock market valuations surpassed their pre-crisis peak [9], and bank credit conditions gradually eased.

[1] We are stuck in a sloggy, backward-leaning L-shaped recovery: The United States economy, with considerable prodding from fiscal, financial (the bailouts), and monetary help, exited a historically deep recession in the second half of 2009, but has been growing relatively slowly since then. In other words, there was no "bounce-back," no V-shaped pattern, where we fall hard but quickly make up our losses. So, why did those policy interventions help break the recession but not move growth from an L to a V? Because they ended too soon. 

[2] Whose fundamentals you talkin' about? At times like this, there's a risk that the economy's doing well, except for most of the people in it. To understand how the recovery is playing out in different people's lives, you've got to ask: just whose fundamentals are improving?

[3] Current growth rates are not fast enough to put much downward pressure on the unemployment rate. When the economy grows at around 2 percent, the unemployment rate tends to stay about where it is as that's just fast enough growth to balance the flows of people coming into the job market and cycling out of unemployment into work. But it's not fast enough to really make a big dent in the stock of about 20 million who are un- and underemployed. Moreover, the I.M.F. predicts slower growth (1.9 percent) this year.

[4] Wait a minute - they said things are improving ... so why slower growth!? Because of too much "fiscal deficit reduction." Our policy makers may not be the austerions that are whacking away at European economies right now, but we too have reduced government spending too quickly, far more so, as the Fed governor Janet Yellen points out, than in past recoveries. Basically, the public sector handed the growth baton to the private sector before it was ready to run with it.

[5] The "weak external environment" refers to slower growth in some of our export markets, like Europe, which absorbs about 20 percent of our exports. But the problem runs deeper: our persistent trade deficits have essentially exported demand and jobs for years, often to countries that manage their currencies to maintain a price advantage over us. Policy makers who want to reverse that need to address this currency issue if we are to make serious progress on increasing net exports.

[6] All true, and all helpful developments, especially the housing part, but there's a large imbalance between improving labor market conditions and corporate profitability. When the lightly unionized American job market is too slack, as it's been for years now, low- and middle-wage workers have too little bargaining power to claim much of the growth they're helping to create. It's a very different story for large multinationals who can trot the globe seeking profits (and tax shelters). In fact, the compensation share of national income is at a 48-year low, the profit share at an all-time high.

[7] "Well-anchored inflation?" Inflation is running at around a measly 1 percent, in no small part because of the growth slog and absence of labor market pressures. True [8], this should keep the Fed in the easing game for a while, and that in turn could perhaps calm excessively skittish equity markets (they're worried the Fed will begin to "taper" its bond buying program). But faster inflation right now is less a function of expectations and more of weak demand and stagnating wages. A bit faster price growth would thus be a welcome sign.

[9] Stock market valuations way up. Though a rising stock market benefits some in the broad middle class, mostly through retirement and pension savings, the vast majority of its gains go to the wealthiest (80 percent of the value of the market is held by the richest 10 percent of households). It's actually very simple to describe what's wrong here: since the recovery began, adjusted for inflation the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 57 percent while median household income is down 5 percent.
The picture painted in broad strokes by the I.M.F. is correct and not at all without hope. As they say, things are improving, albeit too slowly. But in every case, we could be doing better were it not for policy mistakes, ones that are having profound and lasting impacts on the living standards of working families. In this regard, it's important to peel back the economic onion, even if it makes you tear up.

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Tries Creative Approach Against Fannie and Freddie Bailout

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: Shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are relying on a constitutional argument against the government rescue of the two to try to recover money from the government, the author writes. 

 BODY:
Shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises bailed out by the government, have some hubris. 
Like some shareholders of the American International Group, the Fannie and Freddie shareholders have stooped to lawsuits as a way of trying to garner millions from the same government that rescued the entities. As was the case with the A.I.G. shareholders who have sued, they ought to know better. 
 In the case involving Fannie and Freddie, the shareholders acknowledge that the government takeover of the two entities likely saved Western civilization,but they still blame the government for bailing the two entities out.
Maybe that's a bit of an oversimplification, but it has a kernel of truth.
The thrust of the argument in the lawsuit is that during the financial crisis, the government first enacted a new conservatorship process for the government-sponsored enterprises, put those enterprises into that process and finally provided lots of new money to the two at a senior level in the capital structure (relative to the old shareholders) to keep the companies afloat.
The result of those actions has been that the previous preferred and common shareholders have been in a kind of limbo ever since. It's not clear that there is much value left for their junior interests, especially since many politicians would rather shut down and liquidate the two.
There is a kind of high-risk, high-reward play at work with regard to the preferred shares, but the common shares are largely thought to be entirely out of the money as a result of the bailout. 
In such a situation, it makes some sense to see whether there might not be some other source of value that might at least put a good face on a lousy outcome. Hence the litigation.
The complaint tries to suggest that there were many other options available to the government, including the notion that Fannie and Freddie didn't really need to be rescued. That is an argument that seems to ignore the twin threat that they presented to both the global financial system, because of the ubiquity of their securities, and the entire American home lending system. 
But ultimately, the complaint boils down to a single claim that the conservatorship process amounts to an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment, although sometimes the claim seems to slide into a due process claim, too.
The conservator process was enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. That law does not indicate which power Congress was using when it enacted the act. Arguably, the conservatorship provisions might be deemed an exercise of power under the Bankruptcy Clause, which gives Congress the power to enact bankruptcy laws.
While the Supreme Court has held that laws enacted under the Bankruptcy Clause are subject to the limits of the Fifth Amendment, it has done so only in cases involving secured creditors. Our plaintiffs here are not even unsecured creditors; they are shareholders, meaning that they are at the bottom of the capital structure in the event of a bankruptcy.
Therefore, it's not even clear that the plaintiffs have an interest in "property" that is protected by the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. That would seem to be kind of important if one is bringing a takings claim.

HEADLINE: Change We Can Believe In?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A recent poll shows a massive plunge in President Obama&#8217;s approval ratings. 

 BODY:
President Obama just had an enthusiastic reception in Belfast following an inspiring speech to the youth of Northern Ireland. But perhaps the president should worry more about his standing with a similar constituency back home-the young Americans whose energy and votes helped bring him back to office last fall. 
Anew poll by CNN shows that a huge 17-point drop among Americans under age 34 fueled a serious 8-point hit to Mr. Obama's overall approval rating over the past month. I wasn't particularly surprised that Mr. Obama's numbers dipped after a month of endless scandal-mongering. But these numbers are still striking; for the first time in Mr. Obama's presidency, CNN said, more than half of those surveyed said they don't believe he is honest or trustworthy.
Mr. Obama can pass some of that blame on to the Republicans, who have been hammering him on every subject they can find: the IRS scandal, Benghazi, health care reform, and the list goes on. But the poll suggests that maybe his public statements and overall demeanor are hurting him more.

The poll shows, for example, that while majorities of Americans think the government has snooped on their personal Internet traffic and collected data on their telephone calls, they are fine with that happening - by significant margins. Still, when asked if they approved of Mr. Obama's handling of government surveillance, 61 percent said no.
And right when Mr. Obama might actually achieve consensus on immigration reform, 56 percent disapproved of his handling of illegal immigration.
Part of Mr. Obama's problem is his administration's endless dithering. Their performance on Syria last week was a good example - confused, indecisive, and lacking any explanation around why they found the deaths of 100-150 people from chemical weapons to be so profoundly more unacceptable than the 93,000 other casualties of Syria's brutal civil war. There were endless reports in the press about divisions within his administration regarding whether we should do more than arm rebel groups in Syria.
Those were the headlines when the CNN poll was taken. Not coincidentally, Mr. Obama got a failing grade on foreign policy among Americans between 18 and 34, with a 55 percent disapproval rating. Fifty-seven percent disapproved of his handling of the economy, and a whopping 67 percent disapproved of his handling of the budget deficit.
More profoundly, younger Americans included in this poll gave a pretty negative assessment of Mr. Obama's character: 51 percent do not see him as honest and trustworthy; 53 percent don't think he agrees with their views on the size and power of government. 
Perhaps worst of all, about half say he's just another typical politician.

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Is Congress Broken?

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Robert G. Kaiser, a veteran Washington Post reporter and author, explains how the Dodd-Frank bill inspired his pessimism about Congress&#8217;s ability to address big problems. 

 BODY:
On Sept. 18, 2008, with the nation on the precipice of a financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to gather a bipartisan group of lawmakers that very day. Congress quickly passed the bailout, but it was not until July 2010 that President Obama signed a sweeping overhaul of the financial system meant to prevent another Great Recession.
The story of that overhaul, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, serves as a case study of "how America's essential institution works, and how it doesn't" - the subtitle of the latest book by Robert G. Kaiser, a veteran Washington Post reporter. While reporting the book, "Act of Congress," Mr. Kaiser had unusual access to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut; Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts; and, crucially, their staff members. He talked to The New York Times about the roots of his pessimism and his prognosis for a more functional future for Congress.
 Q. 
 One of the major takeaways from your book is that there is something fundamentally broken about Washington. But it's also about Congress responding to a crisis by successfully passing a sweeping bill. Isn't that how it's supposed to work? 
 A. 
Yes, indeed, but as I write, you can't draw any optimistic conclusions from this example. Dodd-Frank was only enacted because of extreme circumstances created by the Great Crash of 2008 and the big Democratic majorities in Congress that it helped produce. The political stars aligned for just long enough to allow for the enactment of health care reform and Dodd-Frank. The 2010 elections wiped out the Democratic majority in the House and reduced it in the Senate, and now, obviously, we have gridlock again.
 Q. 
 We usually think of lobbying and campaign cash as the villains in politics - your own 2010 book, "So Damn Much Money: The Triumph of Lobbying and the Corrosion of American Government," certainly captured this theme. But lobbyists did not appear to have been particularly influential on the Dodd-Frank bill. What are some of the other obstacles to effective legislation? 
 A. 
Lobbyists, especially those working for the big banks, were weaker this time because their clients were so unpopular. I think my readers may be surprised by how many obstacles there now are. Partisan warfare dominates Congress. Few members have strong policy interests, and even fewer have real policy expertise. Staff has to do most of the work - 95 percent of it, Ted Kennedy wrote in his memoir. The inside story of Dodd-Frank confirms the accuracy of Kennedy's observation. The culture of the modern Congress is hostile to compromise, but compromise is the only route to enacting big bills.
 Q. 
 Many members of Congress involved in the Dodd-Frank bill seemed to lack both the expertise needed to understand the complicated financial legislation and the ambition to solve big problems, rather than stick to partisan strategy. Is this really all that different from the past? Have some issues just become too complex for politicians to handle? 
 A. 
When I covered Congress in the 1970s, I think there were many more members with strong policy interests and real expert knowledge. I think the quality of the membership has declined. This isn't surprising. Being a member today is not an appealing job, especially to the kinds of people I think most Americans would like to have in Congress: smart, practical people who want to address big issues. Instead, the people attracted to run today are more likely to be partisan warriors eager to do battle with the enemy. But, of course, you are right - some issues today are enormously complicated.
 Q. 
 You shed light on the immense influence of unelected staff members. Do they wield too much power? 
 A. 
What is "too much"? In the case of Dodd-Frank, I realized after seeing the bill get put together from the inside, the staff were indispensable. There would have been no bill without them, literally. I was pleased to have the opportunity to give these talented, dedicated people credit for what they did. Usually staff are invisible in accounts of the legislative process. Dodd and Frank allowed their staff members to talk to me throughout the process on the record. This allowed me to give a much fuller account of the real legislative process than reporters can usually get.
 Q. 
 There's a striking moment when a top Democratic aide is appalled by an especially harsh speech by Senator Richard Shelby, which he delivered despite efforts by Mr. Dodd to co-write the measure with him and cultivate a strong personal relationship. "How could you?" the aide asks Mr. Shelby, who replies, "It's just politics." How often are such speeches "just politics," and how can voters tell? Do the politicians themselves always know the difference? 
 Q. 
Such speeches are now a routine part of the everyday partisan warfare on Capitol Hill. Bright politicians like Shelby certainly know the difference, but a lot of members are not as bright as he is. I was struck by the way some members could stick to partisan talking points even when they pretty obviously clashed with reality. "Reality" has become another relative term in today's Congress, sadly.
 Q. 
 Do you see any parallels between Dodd-Frank and the current immigration debate that might help predict that bill's outcome? 
 A. 
I see one possible parallel. Dodd-Frank passed, narrowly, because just enough members thought the political reasons for supporting it were compelling. Immigration reform is a possibility now, I think, only because of the results of the 2012 election. Some Republicans have decided that they are in danger of losing the Latino vote for a generation or more if they can't show some support for the one issue that most animates Hispanic voters. So politics really matters, and may mean that we get immigration reform. But, obviously, Republican members don't all agree about this. Will enough agree to pass a bill? Stay tuned.
 Q. 
 To become functional again, does Congress need to return to old traditions, or does it need to be innovative, find a new way of doing business? 
 A. 
I think it needs one of two things: either one party has to win enough seats to have effective control of both houses, as the Democrats did in 2009-10, or the Congress needs a new culture, which would have to be based on a profound change in attitudes, and probably in membership. My experience working on this book left me quite pessimistic. As I wrote in the last line of my book, our Congress is broken.

HEADLINE: How Cyberwarfare and Drones Have Revolutionized Warfare

BYLINE: TIM HSIA AND JARED SPERLI


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Hsia and Jared Sperli write that the next few decades will be dominated by advancements in software and hardware (cyber and robotics, including drones) just as the last decade was dominated by counterinsurgency. 

 BODY:
Since World War II there have been many advances in military weaponry, communications and technology. In early May 1942, naval forces from Imperial Japan and the allied forces of Australia and the United States fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea. That engagement was the first battle in which naval ships did not shoot upon or even see the opposing force. Aircraft carriers directly engaged one another using aircraft, with their long-distance reach, as their sole offensive weaponry. This new type of warfare, the carrier versus carrier, was an inevitable escalation of the air, radio and radar technology of the day. It was viewed as a revolution in military affairs.
There is a tendency within military circles to call a particular advancement in technology a "revolution." That was the case when former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld trumpeted technological advances as enabling the United States to wage war in Afghanistan and Iraq without significant numbers of troops. More often than not, an advancement in technology ends up only incrementally changing how war is fought. 
But there have been true revolutions in military affairs since the Battle of the Coral Sea, including the development of nuclear and space weapons. And now there is much discussion over two recent advancements in United States military capabilities: cyberwarfare and drones. 
We believe the next few decades will be dominated by advancements in software and hardware (cyber and robotics, including drones) just as the last decade was dominated by counterinsurgency. We also believe that historians will look back and see advancements in cyberwarfare and robotics as the first two revolutions in military affairs of the 21st century.
While we were deployed overseas, we saw firsthand the impact of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, in a counterinsurgency fight. Drones enabled headquarters to break through the fog of war swiftly, giving commanders greater command and control over the battlefield. At the same time, our ability to undermine the enemy's communications network was important in the counterinsurgency fight. Often this involved using basic jammers to disrupt insurgents' abilities to trigger improvised explosive devices using cellphones. While on the lower end of the technological spectrum, those jammers saved lives.
Just as aircraft carriers allowed naval battles to extend their strike distance to the point of aircraft versus aircraft warfare, drones are increasing the strike distance of the military. Nanorobots will further increase the ability to deal precise damage. Drones are often the preferred choice of policymakers because they place no American lives at risk. 
Cybertechnology also extends the reach of the military, with the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear weapons program serving as a prime example. Thanks to the Internet, cyberwarriors can reach immediately not only into the Web-connected world, but also into computers without direct Internet access - all without putting Americans in harm's way. 
But these advances will require policymakers to rethink the economic, political and moral calculus for when and how to deploy robots, or when to commence a cyberattack. Not only do the advanced technologies eliminate the problems with having troops die on foreign soil, but they also greatly decrease the cost of weapons. Weaponized drones are far less expensive than manned jets. Drone costs will continue to fall and their capabilities will continue to increase as robotics technology advances. Why buy the costly F-35 fighter jet when the military can instead buy a fleet of weaponized drones? 
Moreover, many people believe that all robots are airborne weapons. But they have long been used by explosive ordnance soldiers when defusing bombs. As robotic technology advances, the Terminator movies might seem less like science fiction.
In the cyberrealm, the big costs - the satellites and fiber cables - have already been paid for. With that infrastructure in place, a few thousand lines of code can now be an effective weapon to inflict disarray and damage. But that also means that securing the network is more important than ever, underscored by the publishing of classified military and diplomatic documents by WikiLeaks and the more recent leaks of National Security Agency records by Edward J. Snowden.
Decreasing costs can be a double-edged sword. Just as I.E.D.s became the highly effective yet inexpensive weapons of choice for insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan, robots and cyber technology could be the same for adversaries seeking to attack the United States. As costs have declined, these dual-purpose technologies have already become widely available to both state governments and nonstate actors.
This new type of warfare will make it harder to identify the source of an attack using either unmanned vehicles (land, air or sea) or cyber technology. Yet after the intelligence failures in Iraq, it will perhaps be more important than ever for the government to be able to assure its citizens that its intelligence is accurate about the identity of an attacker. 
Yet as rapidly as this technology is developing, Americans are just beginning to think hard about the policy implications. Many Americans have begun expressing concerns regarding domestic drone use at home and the potential for lasting foreign policy damage caused by the drone war in Pakistan. And the recent leaks about NSA surveillance programs and the debate over the proposed Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which would make it easier for tech companies to share information about computer security threats with government agencies, seem to have kindled concerns among many Americans that their own privacy is at stake. 
These new kinds of warfare seem likely to further empower the executive branch at a time when our nation no longer declares war, potentially making the War Powers Actseem even less constraining and thus more outdated. Ultimately, it seems possible that these major changes will make it easier to wage war because the risks to American servicemen have been minimized. Wars will be fought not only by soldiers with boots on the ground but also by soldiers sitting in front of computer and video monitors. Tomorrow's future warriors could very much resemble today's civilian Xbox video gamers.
We are glad to see that the U.S. government is now taking an active role in developing those future warriors with cyber competitions. This is a tactic long used by other countries, like China. However we are concerned about how the government expects to field a large cyber force quickly. Although efforts are underway to train new security and cyber professionals, there is currently an inadequate number of leaders and experienced engineers to expand this force. The government will either have to develop its own experienced officers, or continue to use private contractors - like Mr. Snowden, who worked for one of the N.S.A.'s principal contractors, Booz Allen Hamilton. And filling the ranks will be difficult, too: there is intense competition for experienced engineers in both the cyber and robotics industries.
The future will require a nimble military that will be able to wage full spectrum warfare from counterinsurgency in remote outposts in Afghanistan's tribal regions to a cyberwarfare campaign possibly initiated in the basement of a state or nonstate actor. Like other major technological changes facing society today, the problem will not be whether or not technology can accomplish a certain feat but whether our nation's leaders fully understand the moral, social and political consequences of utilizing such technologies.

HEADLINE: Britain's Top Fraud Office Aims to Add Bite to Its Bark

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: David Green, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, plans to revive the agency&#8217;s reputation with a criminal investigation into the rigging of the Libor. 

 BODY:
David Green, the director of Britain's Serious Fraud Office, is in a combative mood.
On his desk at his office, a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square in London, sits a souvenir plaque commemorating the signal that Admiral Horatio Nelson sent to his fleet on the eve of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It says, "England expects that every man will do his duty."
 Mr. Green says his duty is to revive confidence in his office as a top-tier prosecutor of serious fraud and corruption. And he plans to do that with the help of one of the biggest cases the organization has ever taken on: the investigation into the rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
His office plans to bring criminal fraud charges against Thomas Hayes, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, as early as Tuesday, according to a person briefed on the case. Mr. Hayes, who was charged with fraud late last year by the United States Justice Department, is seen as a central character in the rate-rigging scheme. His role figured prominently in the case against UBS, which under a settlement pleaded guilty to one count of felony wire fraud and paid about $1.5 billion in fines. The criminal charges against Mr. Hayes would be the first brought by British prosecutors for suspected manipulation of Libor. 
"What people look to is success in the very big headline cases, and inevitably Libor comes to mind," Mr. Green, 59, said in an interview this month. "I am in the business of doing justice and restoring public confidence in the rule of law. The public need to have confidence that white-collar criminals are dealt with as criminals, that they are not given some special rosy path with a cop-out sentence at the end of the day."
When Mr. Green took over as director of the fraud office in April last year after 25 years as a prosecutor and defense lawyer, he found an agency whose reputation was in shambles and whose staff morale had hit rock bottom. Two London businessmen, the Tchenguiz brothers, Robert and Vincent, had dragged the office to court over a botched investigation into their connections with failed banks in Iceland. The fraud office apologized and started an internal investigation but also ran up huge legal costs that might continue to grow.
Additional embarrassment came in 2011, when the office decided against investigating Libor and shifted responsibility instead to the Financial Services Authority. While the Justice Department started to delve into the Libor case from abroad, the fraud office said it would only be a further drag on its already stretched resources.
Despite an increase of publicity-friendly dawn raids on suspected wrongdoers and some saber-rattling speeches, the fraud office had built an image of a prosecutor that barked but would not bite. So bad was its reputation that when the government started to change the way it regulated the financial industry after the financial crisis, it seriously considered abolishing the office.
Mr. Green is well aware of these problems. One of the first things he did when he arrived was to clearly define the mission of the organization, he said. Unlike his predecessor, Richard Alderman, he is not in the business of giving guidance and striking deals with defendants. "The sentence is a matter for the judge," he said. "I am here to prosecute."
"There was a general perception in this country and abroad that the S.F.O. lacked somehow the stomach to prosecute and preferred the easier route of civil settlement," he said. "There was a perception that the S.F.O. had dumbed down and has taken easier, less-complex cases."
But those times are over, he said, and his message to criminals is clear: "If your conduct is criminal and comes within the purview of the S.F.O., we will go after you."
When he took over, Mr. Green simplified the office's structure by setting up two divisions for fraud and two divisions for bribery and hired new senior staff members, including Geoffrey Rivlin, a retired judge feared and respected for being a stickler for detail, to help prepare cases for court.
John Fingleton, chief executive of Fingleton Associates, which advises clients on regulatory issues, said Mr. Green "hired some good people and tries to tidy up the place." But the job is not easy, Mr. Fingleton said.
"The S.F.O. has been heavily starved of resources, and crime enforcement in Britain is generally far more difficult than in the U.S.," where there are fewer burdens on the prosecution and plea bargains are commonplace, he said.
Mr. Green takes particular issue with the suggestion that the fraud office would refuse to open an investigation because it was too expensive. "Absurd," he said, before adding, "disgraceful."
"I will not stay in this job and do that," he emphasized.
The Libor inquiry is the largest of the fraud office's 67 active cases and a vast undertaking that required Mr. Green to double the investigation team to 60 this year. Another handful of investigators are on loan from the tax authority, and there is some staff from large accounting firms and foreign regulators. A deal to swap staff with the Justice Department is in its final stages, he said.
As determined to prosecute and passionate about his work as Mr. Green is, he is reluctant to talk about his private life or even his earlier legal cases. His father worked for a bank while his mother brought up the children. After studying history at Cambridge University, Mr. Green took an interest in criminal law and worked for a while for his brother-in-law, a lawyer.
He then worked as a prosecutor and defense lawyer on cases that included financial crime and murder. He said he defended financial organizations for regulatory and criminal offenses in the past but would not give any names.
His main prosecution work included cases involving the importation of heroin from places like Afghanistan, organized crime and fraud, but he declined to give any detail. In 2005, he was named director of revenue and customs prosecutions, successfully prosecuting money-laundering groups and cigarette smugglers. More than 90 percent of the cases secured a conviction.
Alison Graham-Wells, a lawyer who worked under Mr. Green in the 1990s, said he stood out in court for his ability to explain complex cases of financial fraud in simple terms to a jury. "He has a very good court presence," she said.
Whether Mr. Green, now at the fraud office, is successful will depend on the outcome of the Libor investigation. Some analysts said he was taking a risk by focusing on Libor and pointed out that with a prominent international case like this, the likelihood of prosecution could be taken out of his hands.
But Mr. Green is defiant. "A risk-averse person should not be doing this job," he said. "I've been a trial lawyer all my life. The whole process is about assessing and managing risk. Do I ask this question? Do I raise this point? What is the clearest way of presenting this to a jury?"
Next to the Nelson quote plaque on his desk, Mr. Green keeps another one, which he picked up during a trip to Washington and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. It is closely associated with the Apollo 13 mission and reflects what Mr. Green really thinks about his mission at the fraud office: "Failure is not an option."

HEADLINE: Unfazed by 2012, G.O.P. Is Seeking Abortion Limits

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After Republicans lost the presidential election and seats in both the House and the Senate last year, many in the party offered a stern admonishment: If we want to broaden our appeal, steer clear of divisive social and cultural issues.
Yet after the high-profile murder trial of an abortion doctor in Philadelphia this spring, many Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country seem eager to reopen the emotional fight over a woman's right to end a pregnancy. Their efforts will move to the forefront on Tuesday when House Republicans plan to bring to the floor a measure that would prohibit the procedure after 22 weeks of pregnancy -- the most restrictive abortion bill to come to a vote in either chamber in a decade.
The bill stands no chance of becoming law, with Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House. Republican leaders acknowledge that its purpose is to satisfy vocal elements of their base who have renewed a push for greater restrictions on reproductive rights, even if those issues harmed the party's reputation with women in 2012. 
But beyond Washington, advocates on both sides of the issue say the chance to limit abortion in the near future is very real. Republican-dominated state legislatures in South Carolina and Wisconsin are weighing bans similar to the one the House will vote on, which would impose the 22-week limit based on the scientifically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development can feel pain.
The measures stand a reasonable chance of passing in both states as well as in Texas, where last week Gov. Rick Perry added abortion restrictions to the Legislature's agenda. Conservatives are pushing for a vote by next week.
Already this year, Arkansas and North Dakota have passed even more restrictive bans in attempts to directly challenge Supreme Court precedent.
Much of the movement in recent weeks can be linked to the outcry over the case of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the Philadelphia physician who was convicted last month of first-degree murder for cutting the spines of babies after botched abortions.
His case, coming on top of successful efforts to curtail reproductive rights in several states over the last three years, has reinvigorated the anti-abortion movement to a degree not seen in years, advocates on both sides of the issue said.
''These laws are flying through,'' said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortions. ''The attention has really been at the state level around abortion issues. Now what you also see at the federal level is very disturbing, and it shows that abortion opponents are very emboldened.''
Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee, called the House bill ''the most significant legislation on abortion'' at the federal level since 2003, when Congress passed a ban on a type of late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.
On the eve of the House vote, the Obama administration released a statement late Monday opposing the bill, saying it ''shows contempt for women's health and rights.''
Aware of the risks inherent in abortion politics, Republican leaders have moved to insulate themselves from Democrats' criticism that they are opening a new front in the ''war on women.'' Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, will manage the debate on the bill when it reaches the House floor, a role that would customarily go to the sponsor, Representative Trent Franks of Arizona.
And in a last-minute revision, House leaders slipped in a provision that would allow for a limited exception in cases of rape or incest, but only if the woman had reported the crime.
Still, the re-emergence of abortion as a driving issue among the conservative base has left some moderate Republicans baffled.
''I think it's a stupid idea to bring this up,'' said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. ''The economy is on everybody's minds. We're seeing stagnant job numbers. Confidence in the institution, in government, is eroding. And now we're going to have a debate on rape and abortion.''
Mr. Dent said the party risked opening itself up to another ''Akin eruption,'' a reference to Todd Akin, a Missouri congressman who was defeated last year in a Senate race after saying women's bodies could block a pregnancy after ''a legitimate rape.''
Indeed, Republicans had an unpleasant reminder last week of how perilous the politics of reproductive rights can be when Mr. Franks defended his bill's lack of an exception for rape by saying incidents of pregnancy after rape were ''very low.'' This occurred at a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee, which Democrats noted with some satisfaction contained not a single woman on the Republican side.
But most of the Republican rank and file and their leaders in Congress are solidly behind the bill, arguing that voters back home are clamoring to see something done after the Gosnell case.
''We're hearing from a lot of people who are appalled,'' Ms. Blackburn said, pointing to surveys showing that nearly two-thirds of the public opposes legal second-trimester abortions. ''They feel like this is an appropriate step in this discussion.''
Unlike other major policy questions that Democrats and Republicans are fighting over this year, like same-sex marriage and background checks for gun buyers, Democrats do not find themselves with either overwhelming public opinion on their side or a favorable shift in sentiment.
House Republicans reject the notion that they are ignoring the lessons of 2012 by not focusing on a message of ''growth and opportunity,'' as the party's introspective postelection report recommended.
''While we continue to be focused on that,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said in defense, ''there are other important issues that we have to deal with. And after the Kermit Gosnell case and the publicity that it received, I think the legislation is appropriate.''
One thing is certain -- the bill is a violation of Supreme Court precedent. The court has ruled that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus could live outside the womb, generally starting around 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The bill before the House, called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, would ban abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization. In the most common way of measuring pregnancies, that is equal to 22 weeks, because pregnancies are typically dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period.
Similar laws that banned abortions at or near 22 weeks have been enacted in 11 states since 2010. In Georgia, Idaho and Arizona, which enacted an 18-week postfertilization ban, courts have blocked them.
These measures are very different from previous attempts to limit abortion because they are based on an argument that is rooted in the belief, held by a minority in the medical community, that fetuses begin to feel pain around 20 weeks. Most scientists, however, believe that the nervous system is not developed enough to register pain until later in pregnancy.
The first law of this kind passed in Nebraska in 2010. And after the Republican wave of victories in elections that year, more states began passing them.
In 2011, 92 laws limiting the procedure went into effect. The previous record had been fewer than 40. Last year there were 43, according to Guttmacher.
The House has taken up abortion regulations in the last few years, but none have been as expansive or restrictive since Congress passed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003.
And there are signs that the anti-abortion push will continue. Last month, the House Judiciary Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent separate queries to all 50 states about abortion practices and the enforcement of current laws.
''We look at these projects somewhat long-term,'' said Mr. Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee.

HEADLINE: The Leisure Pack Is Back

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
It was after midnight, and Leilanie Ramos just wanted clean clothes.
An event planner for a satellite communications company, Ms. Ramos was halfway through a stretch of back-to-back trade shows that kept her on the road for nearly two weeks. She checked into her hotel in Tampa, Fla., after a late-night arrival from Istanbul with plans to do her laundry at the hotel's facility, figuring she would have the machines to herself at that hour.
''There were two other people doing laundry at almost 1 o'clock in the morning,'' she said. Since there were only two washing machines, Ms. Ramos had to wait, finally getting to bed around 3 a.m., she said. 
''There's a lot more people where you don't expect them to be,'' she said.
For a few years, business travelers had lobbies and lounges (not to mention laundry rooms) to themselves. It was a silver lining of sorts, even if the economic outlook was grim, consumer confidence was shaken and personal finance experts promoted the benefits of the ''staycation.''
This summer, that trend is over. The U.S. Travel Association says leisure travel will hit a record high this year, while belt-tightening in the hotel and airline industries means packed houses all around. ''Now, it's a free-for-all,'' said Jeff Butler, an engineer for a company that makes broadband equipment whose work takes him on the road three to four days a week.
''Leisure travel is back, and it's back stronger,'' said Alex Tonarelli, general manager at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.
Scott Berman, principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers Hospitality and Leisure, said that from a hotel industry perspective, that's good news. ''People are feeling better about themselves,'' he said, making them more likely to indulge in a vacation this summer.
PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that the average hotel occupancy in the United States this year will reach 62.2 percent, the most crowded that hotels have been since 2007. Planes are also ''chockablock full,'' said the airline industry analyst Robert W. Mann Jr., who predicted domestic flights would be 84 percent full this year. ''It means everyone is sharing an armrest,'' he said.
Business travelers wistfully remember when they had elbow room -- or even an entire row to themselves -- on flights that left at inconvenient times. ''The early morning flights that used to be just business travelers are now filled with people on a discount fare,'' Mr. Butler said.
What's more, he said, the Transportation Safety Administration lines aren't as fully staffed at odd hours, making the wait to be screened even longer. ''It never used to be that bad,'' he said.
Ms. Ramos said she remembered when ''you'd have empty seats next to you for those red-eyes and long international flights; you could easily stretch out.'' But on her international trips so far this year, she said, ''All of the seats were taken.''
Barry Richards, a vice president for production at a company that creates media for hospital marketing, said he was seeing a lot of completely full flights.
''The thing I always watch out for is families and school groups and anybody who doesn't look like they have much experience traveling,'' he said. ''I don't want to be behind somebody that requires a lot of re-scanning.''
Business travelers say they find themselves stuck in long lines more often at hotels, too. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, Mr. Butler said his hotel's front desk was overwhelmed, even with five people working behind it. Most of his fellow travelers didn't appear to be visiting the city on business, he said, adding, ''They were folks that were there to have fun in Vegas.''
''It was crazy getting through,'' he said. ''I probably waited close to an hour at check-in.''
In some cases, business travelers can't even get a room. ''We seem to encounter more and more sold-out hotels,'' Mr. Richards said. ''In the past, we haven't run into that a whole lot.'' He said in his 15 years of business travel, the competition for rooms was never this fierce.
The shortage of hotel rooms is a combination of two factors, Mr. Berman said. Demand is booming, but few hotels are opening because the credit crisis left developers unable to get financing to build them.
To avoid the noise that is an inevitable part of more crowded hotels, business travelers say they request rooms in less-trafficked parts of hotels: upper floors and corner rooms far from elevators, ice and vending machines.
Sometimes, though, business travelers find it's impossible to escape. At a recent stay in New York City, Mandy Arnold, an advertising company president, said she had been looking forward to unwinding in the evenings on the hotel's roof deck but was thwarted by a noisy, boisterous group of about a dozen people ''taking over the area as if it was their living room,'' she said. ''They were out there every night. It was a bit of a letdown.''
The revelers had gone so far as to bring a cooler and set up a portable grill in the ostensibly shared space. ''As a business traveler, you get annoyed when you can't relax,'' she said. ''It's that additional noise in the background.''
Hotel managers have to walk a tightrope to keep freewheeling vacationers and stressed-out business travelers happy.
At the Loews Miami Beach, Mr. Tonarelli said the hotel restaurant had some quieter sections away from the banquettes where families are seated.
''If we've got a busy family weekend but we have a convention in-house and we see two or three businesspeople that come down with their iPads and their suits, we identify that and we'll do everything possible to seat them in those areas,'' he said.
Knowing his hotel's typical traffic pattern helps his staff anticipate waves of business or leisure travelers, said Mark Pardue, general manager at the Grand Hyatt New York.
''There are instances where, on the weekends we'd use an empty meeting space for kids' movies and games.'' Doing this, he said, ''keeps our hallways free and clear and the tranquillity of our hotel intact.''

HEADLINE: Rumor Denial

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
MADRID -- Telefónica denied a report on Monday that AT&T had made a $93 billion approach for the Spanish telecommunications giant.
The denial came after a report by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that the American company had been thwarted in a potential bid for Telefónica after the Spanish government told AT&T it would oppose such a deal for national strategic reasons.
AT&T's prospective deal would also have included the assumption of Telefónica's 52 billion euros in debt, according to El Mundo. 
In Madrid, shares of Telefónica rose as much as 3.9 percent on Monday before paring back gains. They were up 2.6 percent in late morning trading.
Telefónica has been hurt by an increasingly difficult economic environment and has been looking to unload or spin off assets to reduce its debt levels. The company has been weighed down by a lengthy recession in Spain, which still represents a third of its operating profit but where it lost more than three million customers last year.
Despite Europe's gloomy outlook, the phone, wireless and cable sector has been one of the few bright spots in the moribund mergers and acquisitions market, as several American players, including John C. Malone's Liberty Global, continue to hunt for assets.
The Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú has acquired companies like the Dutch cellphone operator KPN and its Austrian counterpart, Telekom Austria. Mr. Malone's Liberty Global also recently completed its $16 billion takeover of the British cable company Virgin Media.
Rumors also abounded that Verizon was planning a $100 billion approach to buy the 45 percent stake it did not already own in Verizon Wireless from its British partner, Vodafone.
In a brief statement, Telefónica said it had not been approached by AT&T.''In relation to press rumors published today, Telefónica states that it has not received any approach, nor any indication of interest, neither verbal nor in written form, from any party,'' the company said.
A representative for AT&T declined to comment
The Spanish economy's problems, coupled with Telefónica's mountain of debt after a decade of aggressive investments in Latin America and Europe, raised concerns last year over how the company would be able to continue servicing its debt. Recent divestments, though, have helped alleviate such concerns. So did the decision by Telefónica to scrap its dividend payment for 2012. The company is aiming to cut its debt to below 47 billion euros by the end of this year from about 52 billion euros now.
As part of debt-reduction efforts, Telefónica spun off its German subsidiary, Telefónica Deutschland, raising $1.9 billion in Europe's largest initial public stock offering last year.
The company also sold its $1.4 billion stake in China Unicom back to the Chinese firm, while it continues to consider a potential listing for its Latin American divisions.
More than half of the assets of Telefónica are in Latin America, where its main competitor has been América Móvil, controlled by Mr. Slim.
AT&T reduced its stake in América Móvil to 9 percent this month, but remains the second-largest shareholder in the company after Mr. Slim and his family. Any deal with Telefónica would therefore probably raise antitrust issues in Latin American markets.
The Spanish government also denied on Monday that it had vetoed a takeover approach by AT&T. José Manuel Soria, the industry minister, told Spanish national television that he held talks with the management of AT&T at a conference in Barcelona earlier this year, but that the American executives had not made any mention of Telefónica as a possible target as part of their expansion plans in the European market.
Mark Scott reported from London.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tricky Ways To Pull Down A Skyscraper

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
TOKYO -- There are many ways to demolish a building, and some of them are spectacular: blowing it up from the inside so it collapses on itself, or smashing it to bits with a two-ton wrecking ball.
But here in Tokyo, a cheek-by-jowl city with many outdated high-rises and tough recycling and environmental restrictions, Japanese companies are perfecting what might be called stealth demolition. Some tall buildings are dismantled from the top down, the work hidden by a moving scaffold, others from the bottom up, the entire structure being slowly jacked down.
At times the techniques seem to defy gravity, or at least common sense, for although the buildings appear intact, they slowly shrink. The methods, which make for a cleaner and quieter work site, may eventually find favor in New York and other cities as aging skyscrapers become obsolete and the best solution is to take them down and rebuild. 
The latest Tokyo high-rise to get the stealth treatment is the Akasaka Prince Hotel, a 40-story tower with a distinctive saw-toothed facade overlooking one of the city's bustling commercial districts. Since last fall, its steel and concrete innards have been torn apart, floor by floor, starting near the top, by hydraulic shears and other heavy equipment. The building has been shrinking by about two floors every 10 days; this month it will be gone, to be replaced by two new towers.
Hideki Ichihara, a manager with Taisei Corporation, which developed the system being used to tear down the hotel, said the technique had environmental benefits and allowed for more efficient separation of metal, concrete and other recyclable materials. Another advantage is visual: The vanishing building looks normal for as long as possible. ''We want people not to really see the demolition work,'' he said.
Mr. Ichihara was speaking in the bowels of the hotel on a late winter day while, about 250 feet above, workers were demolishing two floors, removing the exterior aluminum and glass, cutting up the steel beams and pulverizing the concrete slabs. But none of the work was visible to passers-by -- the top four floors were shrouded in a scaffold that hung from the intact roof and was covered in panels that mimicked the facade.
When the two floors are gone, the roof and scaffold cap slowly descends, thanks to computer-controlled jacks on each of 15 temporary columns. Then the columns are lowered into new positions, and the workers start taking apart the next two floors.
The cap helps keep noise and dust down compared with more conventional methods of demolishing tall buildings, which involve erecting a scaffold all the way up and around the structure but leaving the top exposed. ''All the work is inside the covered area,'' Mr. Ichihara said. ''The noise level is 20 decibels lower than the conventional way, and there's 90 percent less dust leaving the area.''
Aside from the cap, though, the Taisei system is similar to other methods in that the structure is taken apart from the top down. Another Japanese company, Kajima Corporation, has developed a bottom-up approach, cutting a building's steel columns at ground level and jacking the entire structure down as each floor is removed. Since all the demolition work is done on or near the ground, there is no need to place heavy equipment, or workers, at the top of the building.
''The idea is to keep the building as intact as possible,'' said Ryo Mizutani, an official with Kajima, which in January finished demolishing a 24-story office tower, the Resona Maruha building, near the Imperial Gardens. Huge hydraulic jacks supported the building's 40 columns, and workers cut 30 inches from each column, over and over, to allow the structure to be slowly lowered.
The Resona Maruha building was completed in 1978, the Akasaka Prince tower in 1982. Ordinarily, a building that is 30 or 40 years old should have many years of life left, if properly maintained. The Empire State Building, for example, is 82 and doing just fine after major renovation work.
But the Tokyo buildings fell victim to the vagaries of commercial real estate here, where high property values, changing design standards and other factors have conspired to create a bull market for demolition.
''There are many ways to renovate,'' said Tsuyoshi Seike, an associate professor at the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of Tokyo. ''But with buildings in the middle of Tokyo, they think it's better to demolish.'' About a dozen high-rises have been torn down so far, Dr. Seike said.
The boom in Japan's economy in the 1970s spawned scores of dull, cookie-cutter office towers in Tokyo. Now many of those buildings are obsolete, with relatively low ceilings (height standards were increased in 1990) that have become even more cramped by having to accommodate the infrastructure of information technology.
The Akasaka Prince, a gleaming showpiece designed by one of Japan's most famous architects, the modernist Kenzo Tange, had low ceilings, too, but it also succumbed to economic pressures brought on by the influx of more upscale hotels run by foreign companies. (The new complex to be built on the site will include office and retail space, residences and, on the top floors of a 590-foot tower, luxury hotel suites.)
Tokyo's situation may be unique, but New York and other cities may eventually face the need to demolish some high-rises. A recent study by Terrapin Bright Green, a New York consulting firm, suggested that many office towers in Manhattan needed to be overhauled or demolished. These structures were built from the late 1950s to the early '70s and have low ceilings, tight column spacing that limits floor layouts, and inefficient heating and cooling systems.
Bill Browning, a partner in Terrapin, said that some of these buildings, built in an era of cheap energy, had facades of single-glazed glass, and the structures could not support the weight of additional insulating glass to make them more energy-efficient. Other buildings might be able to be renovated, but it would take decades for the investment to pay for itself.
In those cases, Mr. Browning said, it might make better economic sense to take the building down and build a new tower that would have more space at higher rents and use the same energy, or less.
While there are probably several hundred buildings that are outdated, Mr. Browning said, only a handful might actually be demolished. ''I think we'll see a few around Midtown and a few in Lower Manhattan,'' he said.
Still, that would be a change for the city, where the tallest demolition project remains the 1908 Singer Building in Lower Manhattan. More than 600 feet tall, the building nonetheless had relatively little usable floor space and was torn down 45 years ago. Since then, only a few buildings over 300 feet have been demolished, including the 565-foot Deutsche Bank building, which was damaged in the destruction of the World Trade Center towers.
It is unclear whether demolition contractors in the United States will adopt any of the Japanese methods; even in Tokyo many buildings are demolished in more conventional ways. (With the new techniques, setting up the project can be more expensive, but the demolition often takes less time than with conventional methods.)
Herb Duane, a semiretired demolition consultant who writes frequently on the topic, said that Kajima's ground-up technique might be problematic in a city like New York, where the weight of buildings is greater.
Bill Moore, a past president of the National Demolition Association and marketing director of Brandenburg Industrial Services, a demolition company, said that an Italian contractor had tried to interest American companies in a top-cap system that is similar to Taisei's, to little effect. ''Our environmental regulations are not that strict,'' Mr. Moore said, and dust can be effectively contained by spraying with water.
One thing is clear, Mr. Moore said: Implosion by use of precisely placed explosives would not be used, nor would a wrecking ball. Both methods are largely forbidden in New York because of safety and environmental concerns, although this month officials allowed the first implosion in more than a decade, of an old Coast Guard apartment building on largely isolated Governors Island.
(In general, although implosion makes for great YouTube videos, it is appropriate in fewer than 2 percent of projects, Mr. Duane said. It is also occasionally unsuccessful, as it was last month in Brisbane, Australia, when a concrete silo had to be delicately nudged over by an excavator after explosive charges left it leaning precariously.)
Implosion is also outlawed in Tokyo, which is even more densely packed than New York. But the main impetus there for the new demolition techniques, said Dr. Seike of the University of Tokyo, was a recycling law that took effect in 2002.
In addition to valuable metals like steel, aluminum and copper, the law required that wood and concrete waste be recycled, even if the demolition contractors had to pay to do so. ''People started to take recycling seriously,'' Dr. Seike said. ''And things have changed quite drastically with demolition.''
For greater efficiency, recyclable materials need to be separated at the site, he said. By creating controlled work environments, both Japanese methods allow for on-site separation.
At the Akasaka Prince, Mr. Ichihara said, the sorting starts at the top, and the concrete and steel are brought down by separate cranes. With the Kajima bottom-up method, Mr. Mizutani said, all of the debris is created on the ground level, allowing for efficient sorting.
Mr. Mizutani said his company's method had an added advantage in that hazardous materials like asbestos did not have to be removed from the site separately, before the structural demolition began. Rather, as the materials are stripped from each floor they can be left there until that floor reaches the ground and they can be safely carted away.
But the Kajima method has one major disadvantage: In earthquake-prone Tokyo, a building that is cut loose from its foundation could easily topple when the ground shakes. The company's solution is to build temporary concrete structures, about three stories high, within parts of the building's steel frame. Locking devices that would activate quickly in an earthquake would tie the frame to the concrete structures, presumably keeping the building stable.

HEADLINE: In Embattled Detroit, No Talk of Sharing Pain Between Retirees and Bondholders

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
When New York City threatened to declare bankruptcy in 1975, the idea so terrified everyone that it forced the city, its workers and its recalcitrant bankers to sit down and find ways to share the pain.
Now another large city, Detroit, appears to be on the brink of filing for bankruptcy, but there is little talk of sharing the pain. Instead, the fiscal crisis in Michigan is setting up as a gigantic clash between bondholders and city retirees.
The city's proposals, which could give some bondholders as little as 10 cents on the dollar, are making some creditors think they would be better off in bankruptcy. They see the specter of a federal judge imposing involuntary losses as less ominous than it was for New York.
''The haircut is so severe,'' said Matt Fabian, a managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, ''I think it's scaring them into bankruptcy, rather than away from bankruptcy.'' 
But city retirees, facing the prospect of sharply reduced benefits whether in bankruptcy or under Detroit's restructuring proposal, think they stand squarely on the moral high ground because despite the poverty of many current and retired members, they have already offered big concessions.
''It's not the employees that are costing the city money,'' said Edward L. McNeil, an official with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees who is leading a coalition of 33 unions that will be affected by any restructuring of Detroit's debts, which total roughly $17 billion. Just last year, he said, those unions offered concessions that could have saved the city hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But Detroit ''botched the implementation,'' he said.
And Michael VanOverbeke, interim general counsel for the general workers' retirement plan, said bondholders were investors hoping for returns, who should expect ''a certain amount of risk.''
''Planning for retirement and working for employers was not an investment into the market,'' he added. ''These are people who are on a fixed income at this point in their life. They can't go back to work and start all over again.'' He said it was unthinkable to cut retirees' pensions outside of bankruptcy.
A bankruptcy in Detroit would have no precedent, despite an unusual flurry of municipal bankruptcies after the financial crisis. Rhode Island hurriedly passed a law giving municipal bondhholders priority over other creditors, including retirees, just before the small city of Central Falls filed for bankruptcy. That helped Central Falls resolve its bankruptcy quickly, but no one thinks Michigan could pass such a law. In Jefferson County, Ala., a large majority of the financial trouble grew out of debt issued to rebuild a sewer system, not pensions or other employee benefits. The rights of public workers and bondholders are in conflict in the bankruptcy of Stockton, Calif., but that case is not yet far enough along to be of any guidance to Detroit.
With talks on labor issues scheduled for Thursday, municipal bond market participants say one of their main concerns is that the city's proposal would flatten the traditional hierarchy of creditors, putting say, a retired librarian on par with an investor holding a general obligation bond. That does not square with the laws and conventions of the municipal bond market, where for decades small investors have been told that such bonds are among the safest investments and that for ''general obligation'' bonds cities could even be compelled to raise taxes, if that's what it took to make good. The ''full faith and credit'' pledge was supposed to make such bonds stronger than the other main type of muni -- revenue bonds, which promised to pay investors out of project revenue.
Public finance experts have warned that broad societal problems could follow a loss of faith in municipalities' commitments to honor their pledges. In a major report on the state of the muni market last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned that communities would find it increasingly costly to raise money, throwing into question the time-honored practices of building and financing public works at the local level.
Detroit's proposal shows how much things have changed since the days when the municipal bond market consisted of two types of debt and little else. The emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, issued a complicated list of debts with a wide range of gradations, with general obligation bonds now inferior to revenue bonds.
Mr. Orr classified Detroit's general obligation bonds into two groups -- secured and unsecured -- with the secured ones backed by outside sources of money, like state aid or federal block grants. The unsecured bonds are those that rely only on Detroit's ''full faith and credit'' pledge. As a practical matter, much of Detroit's bond debt is insured, so bondholders will feel no immediate pain as the city moves forward with its planned defaults. But the bond insurers have the right to do battle in the bondholders' place, and other market interests are likely to join them.
Mr. Fabian said bondholders knew perfectly well that Detroit was broke and could not raise taxes and fees enough to cover all its bonds, but were still shocked by the proposed treatment.
''It's not that people just want to get more money out of Detroit,'' he said. ''It's the violence that's being done to the city's capital structure. It creates a new paradigm for investing in Michigan bonds.''
In the past, he said, the ratings agencies included the various debt structures in their evaluations of municipal bonds. An ''unlimited-tax general obligation bond,'' for instance, might be rated one or two notches higher than a ''limited tax'' version of the same bond. Investors would look at the rating, know what they were getting and pay more for the safer debt.
''Michigan is saying all that will go out the window,'' Mr. Fabian said. ''In effect, they're saying that structure only matters when you don't need it'' -- when everything is normal and the debt is being repaid.
''And when you need to rely on those legal differences, then they don't matter,'' he added. ''It's distressing.''
Municipal market participants are also rattled by a big, sudden increase in Mr. Orr's measurement of Detroit's pension shortfall, which he is also classifying as unsecured, leaving workers and bondholders to compete for whatever pool of money is left over. As of June 30, 2011, the city's most recent actuarial snapshot showed that its two big pension funds were in pretty good shape -- short by just $644 million, because the city had issued securities called ''certificates of participation'' in 2005 and 2006, and put the proceeds into the pension funds.
But Mr. Orr's report said that estimated shortfall had been ''substantially understated'' through aggressive assumptions and other distortions. After correcting those, the two funds' shortfall was closer to $3.5 billion.
And as for those certificates of participation, issued to produce money for pensions, they turn out to be among Detroit's shakiest debts. The city already skipped a payment due last Friday, and Mr. Orr said the city had found ''certain issues related to the validity and/or enforceability'' of the debt. His report did not specify what the issues were, but said further investigation might be warranted.
The report said that to some extent, the trustees who sit on Detroit's pension boards had worsened the pension trouble by promising workers ''ad hoc sweeteners'' and diverting investment income to other uses. As state-appointed emergency manager, Mr. Orr has authority to remove pension trustees.
But Mr. VanOverbeke said the trustees were not going anywhere. In fact, they have already set aside $5 million for a legal challenge in case Mr. Orr puts them ''in a position that they would not have the resources necessary'' to protect the pensioners, Mr. VanOverbeke said.
''It wasn't put aside to do battle,'' he said. ''They were set aside so that as fiduciaries they can make the appropriate decisions and take the necessary actions as it is deemed appropriate.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Talks On Trade Set for July

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
ENNISKILLEN, Northern Ireland -- European Union leaders and President Obama announced on Monday the start of negotiations for a far-reaching trans-Atlantic trade deal, but French indignation over recent remarks by a high-ranking Brussels official created a sideshow here at the Group of 8 meeting.
Mr. Obama said that the first round of talks would begin next month in Washington between the United States and the 27-nation Europe Union. ''The U.S.-E.U. relationship is the largest in the world -- it makes up almost half of global G.D.P.,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to gross domestic product. ''This potentially groundbreaking partnership would deepen those ties.'' 
But President François Hollande of France expressed disbelief at comments José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, made over the weekend. In an interview, Mr. Barroso had criticized as ''reactionary'' France's insistence on protecting its film and television industries as a condition of supporting the trade negotiations.
''I do not want to believe that the president of the European Commission could have made the statements about France, or even about the artists, that were made,'' Mr. Hollande said, according to the Web sites of several French news organizations.
Mr. Hollande did not appear in a media tent here at the Lough Erne Resort when Mr. Obama and Mr. Barroso -- with Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and David Cameron, the British prime minister -- announced the timing of the trade negotiations. French reporters said Mr. Hollande was busy preparing for his meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
Aside from trade, the two-day Group of 8 meeting was likely to be dominated by the civil war in Syria. Other financial issues on the agenda were measures to clamp down on tax evasion and the legal ruses multinational companies use to limit their tax liabilities.
Mr. Cameron, the host of the meeting, was by far the most effusive of the leaders who spoke about their trade ambitions. ''We're talking about what could be the biggest bilateral trade deal in history, a deal that would have a greater impact than all the other trade deals on the table put together,'' he said.
A trade pact between the United States and the European Union has long been an ambition of policy makers. According to the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, such a deal would allow European companies to sell an additional 187 billion euros, $250 billion, worth of goods and services a year to the United States.
The angry French response highlighted the delicacy of the negotiations, which will aim to reduce trans-Atlantic tariffs and streamline regulations to stimulate economic growth in the United States and Europe.
Last Friday, after a campaign by French artists and politicians, European Union trade ministers agreed to accede to France's demands to protect the audiovisual sector.
In his interview after the agreement, Mr. Barroso said France's Socialist government was advocating an ''anti-globalization agenda'' that was ''completely reactionary.''
Mr. Barroso's comments were described as ''scandalous and dangerous'' in a statement on Monday from the French Socialist Party.
In addressing reporters on Monday, Mr. Barroso took no questions and did not comment on the French reaction.
Speaking in Brussels, Olivier Bailly, a spokesman for the European Commission, said that Mr. Barroso's comments had referred not to the French government but to those who had ''made personal attacks'' against him before the negotiations. Mr. Bailly did not identify them.
In response to the French objections, some Europeans worry that the United States will seek to exclude financial services from the talks, reducing their scope significantly.
Mr. Obama acknowledged those concerns. ''There are going to be sensitivities on both sides,'' he said. ''There are going to be politics on both sides. But if we can look beyond the narrow concerns to stay focused on the big picture -- the economic and strategic importance of this partnership -- I'm hopeful we can achieve the kind of high-standard, comprehensive agreement that the global trading system is looking to us to develop.''

HEADLINE: Justices Rule for the F.T.C. in a Generic Drug Case

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Pharmaceutical companies that pay rivals to keep less-expensive generic versions of best-selling drugs off the market can expect greater federal scrutiny after a Supreme Court ruling on Monday.
In a 5-to-3 vote, the justices effectively said that the Federal Trade Commission can sue pharmaceutical companies for potential antitrust violations, a decision that is likely to increase the number of generic drugs in the marketplace and benefit consumers.
Specifically, the justices threw out lower-court rulings that said the agreements were legal, provided that a deal did not keep a generic drug off the market beyond the term of the brand-name drug's patent. 
The decision is likely to create considerable uncertainty in the drug business and shift an important balance of power to the generic companies, industry analysts said. Drug developers may now find it harder to ward off generics, which typically cost about 15 percent of the brand-name's price and cause the original to quickly lose up to 90 percent of its market share.
Consumer groups, drug retailers, wholesalers and insurance companies, which all benefit from the lower prices of generic drugs, could also step up their challenges to the agreements under antitrust laws.
The court did not address whether the agreements, called pay-for-delay or reverse payments, were unlawful on their face. In a standard patent infringement lawsuit, a settlement payment would be made by an infringer to the patent holder.
In the case, Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, No. 12-416, the agency said that a payment to Actavis by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the holder of a patent on a testosterone gel known as AndroGel, represented an unlawful restraint of trade because it was intended to keep Actavis from producing its generic version of AndroGel for a certain number of years.
Solvay's deal with Actavis is known as a reverse-payment agreement because payment flows from the brand-name drug company to the generic competitor that is challenging the patent.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the majority, said that ''a court, by examining the size of the payment, may well be able to assess its likely anticompetitive effects along with its potential justifications without litigating the validity of the patent.''
The stakes in the case are significant. Pharmaceutical sales in the United States totaled roughly $320 billion in 2011, according to IMS Health, a research company whose statistics the trade commission cited in its arguments. Brand-name drugs accounted for 18 percent of the total prescriptions written by doctors in 2011 but 73 percent of consumer spending, IMS reported.
''No other decision this term will have as much impact on consumers' pocketbooks,'' said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer and a former Federal Trade Commission policy director.
''It clearly maps out how the F.T.C. can use the law to stop these anticompetitive schemes and make sure consumers receive the full benefits of a competitive marketplace,'' Mr. Balto added. ''At the same time it permits the broad range of settlements that pose few competitive concerns.''
Officials at the trade commission, which has fought against the pay-for-delay agreements for several years, were predictably enthusiastic.
''The Supreme Court's decision is a significant victory for American consumers, American taxpayers and free markets,'' said Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the F.T.C. ''With this finding, the court has taken a big step toward addressing a problem that has cost Americans $3.5 billion a year in higher drug prices.''
Executives at Actavis played down the decision's significance. ''The F.T.C. did not win anything with this decision,'' said Paul M. Bisaro, president and chief executive of Actavis. ''We think these settlements will continue, and we will continue to enter into these kinds of settlements. We believe all of our agreements were pro-competitive.''
Justice Breyer's decision, which was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, reversed a decision of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which had thrown out the F.T.C.'s case. The appeals court said that because the exclusion of the generic drug did not extend beyond the term of the brand-name drug's patent, a ''quick look'' could determine that there was no anticompetitive effect.
The Supreme Court's decision adopted a different standard, known as the ''rule of reason,'' which states that the agreements must be considered in the context of their possible benefits for consumers.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused himself from the case.
In their dissent, the justices pointed out that the agreement between Solvay and Actavis allowed for the generic drug to come to market five years before the scheduled expiration of Solvay's patent. The majority's decision will discourage the settlement of patent litigation, the justices said.
Congress has encouraged generic drug makers to challenge the patents protecting lucrative brand-name drugs through the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.

HEADLINE: H.I.V. Tests Urged for 800 Million in India

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Despite India's enormous population, it would be cost-effective to fight its growing AIDS epidemic by testing all 800 million sexually active adults in the country every five years and treating all those infected, a new statistical study has concluded. 
The study, published online in May by PLoS One, notes that testing there costs only $3.33, and that first-line antiretroviral therapy is about $100 a year. The World Health Organization measure for a medical intervention's cost-effectiveness is whether it saves one year of life for less than three times the per capita gross domestic product. In India's case, that is $3,900 per year-of-life saved.
Testing as often as every year would be cost-effective in high-risk groups like drug injectors, gay and bisexual men, female prostitutes, migrants and visitors to S.T.D. clinics, the study found. Treatment makes people with H.I.V. less infectious, so early treatment would prevent the virus's spread to others.
With an organized medical system, cheap drugs and relatively low-paid doctors, India is probably one of the most cost-effective places for fighting AIDS, said the study's lead author, Dr. Kartik K. Venkatesh of the Alpert Medical School at Brown University. African countries import cheap Indian drugs, but their medical systems often must be propped up by foreign donors and doctors.
Only 0.3 percent of Indian adults have H.I.V., but because the population is so large, it has the world's third-largest epidemic, after South Africa and Nigeria.
In 2005, Dr. Venkatesh noted, a similar analysis of the American epidemic published in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that screening much of the American population every three to five years would be cost-effective. But the United States has never come close to that goal, and new infections have held steady at 50,000 per year.

HEADLINE: Protecting Europe's Privacy

BYLINE: By VIVIANE REDING

 BODY:
Here we go again: Another violation of the basic right to privacy. Another public outcry. Another blow to citizens' trust in the security of their personal data. Yet more evidence that something fundamental has to change if we want to stop citizens from worrying about somebody watching every time they visit a Web site or write an e-mail.
The Prism scheme allows the national security agencies of the United States to access E.U. citizens' personal data. While the scale of the program is not yet entirely clear, Europeans are being put at a severe disadvantage compared with U.S. citizens. Through Prism, American national security authorities are able to survey E.U. citizens in a way that would likely be unconstitutional if applied to U.S. nationals. What is more, E.U. citizens are not even given a chance to use American courts to attain any kind of remedy or recourse. 
This is a wake-up call for all those who have been blocking the European Commission's reform of Europe's data protection rules -- ignoring just how much consumers worry about attacks on their right to privacy. The vast majority of citizens have long suspected that their data held by companies could be used -- or abused -- without them knowing about it.
This lack of trust is highly damaging to citizens' faith in the rule of law. It is also damaging to economic growth, as vast swaths of our economy depend on citizens entrusting business with their data. Those who ignore people's concerns are putting a lot more at stake than they probably realize.
The European Commission has answered such concerns. Europe is one of the few places in the world that already has strong data protection rules, dating from 1995. And we have proposed to reform the E.U.'s data protection rules to make them even stronger -- and to set clear rules for the flow of data beyond Europe. The reform, adopted by the commission in January 2012, still needs to be adopted by member states sitting on the council and by the European Parliament to become law. Only if we enact this reform will citizens regain their trust in the way their personal data is handled.
People must be given greater control over their data, with a reinforced right to be forgotten and a right to data portability. People need to know that staying silent is not the same as giving consent to have your data processed. And they need a guarantee that when their privacy has been violated, they are not the last ones to find out about it, via leaks in the media.
The Prism scandal caused a storm in Europe because it hit a raw nerve. Europeans care about their privacy. They want rules that can help prevent violations of their rights by companies or law enforcement agencies from Europe and beyond.
The tools to enable us to deal with this kind of scenario are contained in the European Commission's proposal. It's time that governments as well as members of the European Parliament show their commitment to protecting citizens' data. It's time they start working with the commission in a sober, constructive way to make sure the proposals are adopted swiftly.
The E.U.'s draft law contains four key building blocks for a system of strong data protection.
The first one is a clear provision on the territory where the rules apply. It has to be made certain that companies from outside Europe abide by E.U. data protection laws when they offer and sell products and services to consumers in the Union. If you want to play in our backyard, you have to play by our rules.
Secondly, we need a broad definition of personal data. This should include not just the content of e-mails and phone calls, for example, but related traffic data as well, such as information on where something was sent from or how long somebody spent talking on the phone.
Thirdly, we must not limit the rules to those companies that collect citizens' data. Rather, we have to include processors of those data as well -- such as cloud providers -- because, as the Prism scandal shows, they also present an avenue for those who want to access data. The E.U. needs specific rules on the obligations and liability of those processors.
And finally we must have safeguards against the unfettered international transfer of data. The rules must ensure that E.U. citizens' data are transferred to non-European law enforcement authorities only in situations that are well defined, exceptional and subject to judicial review.
The Prism scandal has sparked a debate about civil liberties in general and privacy in particular. Politicians in Europe and beyond should show that they have listened. Trust is something that is earned, not given. The E.U.'s data protection reform is the right tool to earn citizens' trust. It is within our reach. It is time to act.
Viviane Reding is vice president of the European Commission and the E.U. justice commissioner.

HEADLINE: Regional Carriers Finding Larger Planes More Economical

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- When Delta Air Lines took over a regional carrier, Pinnacle Airlines, last month, it was the latest example of changing dynamics in the U.S. regional airline industry: As consolidation continues, network carriers are exerting ever more control over their regional partners. 
Last year, Delta provided the financially strapped Pinnacle, then based in Memphis, Tennessee -- and now in Minneapolis -- with $74.3 million in financing and agreed to strengthen its fleet with fuel-efficient, 76-seat Bombardier CRJ-900 NextGen large regional jets -- on the condition that Pinnacle slash its labor costs.
After Pinnacle filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and negotiated new labor agreements, Delta agreed to invest another $52 million when it emerged from bankruptcy -- which it did, May 1 -- and to further expand Pinnacle's fleet of large regional jets to replace its older 50-seat aircraft.
Commenting in April on the Pinnacle deal, Delta's chief executive, Richard Anderson, said it would bring Delta ''a very significant competitive advantage'' in the regional market.
The deal fits into a plan for Delta, which itself emerged from bankruptcy in 2007, to cut its legacy fleet of 50-seat planes to 125 from about 350, replacing them with larger, fuel-efficient aircraft.
United is another network carrier that is shifting up from 50-seat regional planes; since April, it has announced the purchase of 70 Embraer 175 aircraft, which seat 70 to 80 passengers.
''The increase in jet fuel prices since 2000 has undermined the operating economics of the 50-seat and smaller regional jets, the predominant aircraft type used by U.S. regionals,'' said Daniel M. Kasper, a senior consultant to Compass Lexecon, which has been involved in restructuring U.S. airlines.
''At the same time, the restructuring of large network airlines in bankruptcy over the past decade has forced them to focus much more on reducing costs wherever possible, which included squeezing the margins paid to their regional airline affiliates,'' he added.
That squeeze is likely to get tighter. ''As existing contracts between regional airlines and network carriers expire in the coming years, the network airlines have the flexibility to change regional carriers, with the lowest cost regional carriers the likely winners,'' said Michael Derchin, senior airline analyst for CRT Capital Group. ''This favors regionals that have gone through bankruptcy and negotiated the most competitive contracts,'' like Pinnacle, he said.
Mr. Derchin and Mr. Kasper both said they expected the merger of US Airways and AMR, American Airlines' parent company, formally announced in February, to lead to a restructuring of their combined regional airline networks.
Henry Harteveldt, analyst for Hudson Crossing, a travel consulting company, said a key question in such a restructuring would be whether to go ahead with a long-considered spinoff of American Eagle, American's regional operation, or ''keep it as a business unit and look for ways to make it more cost-effective.''

HEADLINE: Iran President-Elect Wants to Ease Strains With U.S., but Sees No Direct Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- President-elect Hassan Rowhani of Iran, speaking Monday for the first time since his election victory, said he wanted to reduce tensions with the United States but ruled out direct talks between the two estranged nations.
In his first news conference after winning Friday's presidential election promising more freedoms and better relations with the outside world, Mr. Rowhani called the issue of nonexistent relations between Iran and the United States ''an old wound, which must be healed.'' 
Iran, he said, wants to reduce tensions between the two countries, which have no diplomatic relations and are at odds over the nature of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. Echoing similar statements from the departing administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr. Rowhani said there would be no direct talks until the United States stopped ''interfering in Iran's domestic politics,'' respected what he called Iran's nuclear rights and lifted economic sanctions.
''All should know that the next government will not budge from defending our inalienable rights,'' Mr. Rowhani told reporters. He emphasized that, like those of his predecessors, his government would not be prepared to suspend uranium enrichment, something he had done as a nuclear negotiator in 2004 as a trust-building measure in discussions with European countries.
''We have passed that period,'' he said of that time. ''We are now in a different situation.''
Instead, Mr. Rowhani, who will take office on Aug. 3, offered more openness concerning Iran's nuclear program, saying that was his way of working to end the sanctions that have severely damaged the Iranian economy.
Mr. Rowhani's victory has been received with cautious optimism at the White House, which issued a statement on Saturday congratulating Iranians on ''making their voices heard'' and reaffirming an American willingness to ''engage the Iranian government directly'' to resolve the nuclear dispute.
President Obama appeared to go further in an interview with Charlie Rose on Sunday before the president left for a summit meeting in Northern Ireland.
''Clearly you have a hunger within Iran to engage with the international community in a more positive way,'' Mr. Obama said in the interview, broadcast Monday night on PBS. ''I do think that there's a possibility that they decide, the Iranians decide to take us up on our offer to engage in a more serious, substantive way.''
Iran has always contended that its uranium enrichment is for peaceful purposes, rejecting Western suspicions that the country is seeking the ability to build weapons. ''First, we are ready to increase transparency and clarify our measures within the international framework,'' Mr. Rowhani said.
''Of course our activities are already transparent, but still we increase it,'' Mr. Rowhani said. ''Second, we will increase the trust between Iran and the world.''
Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have repeatedly sought access to the military site of Parchin, near Tehran. But Iran has denied such a visit by saying that military sites are not part of its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iranian diplomats often refer to as the ''international framework.''
But indirectly underlining the effects of the sanctions, Mr. Rowhani said he was already working with the departing government to prevent food shortages. ''People are in instant need of basic staples,'' he said. The government would increase domestic production to stabilize prices and rising unemployment, he said without elaborating.
Mr. Rowhani, who is nicknamed the ''diplomat sheik'' in Iran for his white turban and pragmatic streak, said his victory and the high turnout in Friday's election had altered the view that other countries had of Iran.
''On a global level, our image has changed,'' he said. ''The atmosphere in the global opinion has changed, and this provides new opportunities for us.'' Interaction with the rest of the world -- except for Israel, which Iran does not recognize -- is important, he emphasized.
He paid special attention to neighboring countries, especially the Persian Gulf kingdoms that reduced relations with Iran under Mr. Ahmadinejad's presidency. ''The priority of my government's foreign policy will be to have excellent relations with all neighboring countries,'' he said. He singled out Iran's biggest regional rival, the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which supports rebels in Syria while Iran supports the government of Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad.
''We are not only neighbors but also brothers,'' he said. ''Every year hundreds of thousands of Iranian pilgrims visit Mecca. We have many common points with Saudi Arabia.''
On Syria, he made the same points offered by Iranian diplomats over the last two years, that the Syrian people should decide their own fate in the presidential election in 2014. ''It's up to them to decide,'' Mr. Rowhani said, without commenting on the military support to Mr. Assad provided by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite organization that is financed by Iran. ''We hope that peace will return to this country with the help of all countries,'' he said. ''Until the next election in Syria in 2014, the current government must be officially recognized by the world countries.''
He noted the street parties that erupted Saturday after his official victory, saying the ''time of sadness for Iranians'' was finished. But he did not offer any clear examples of the measures he would take to lift the security atmosphere that has pervaded the country during Mr. Ahmadinejad's presidency.
Mr. Rowhani said he would never forget the promises he made during his campaign. ''But we need to set our priorities first,'' he said. ''We need time.''
Toward the end of the news conference, a spectator yelled for the release of Mir Hussein Moussavi, the opposition leader who is under house arrest. Mr. Rowhani made no comment.

HEADLINE: Markets Rise on Thought That Fed Will Continue Stimulus

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Investors are in a game of wait-and-see with the Federal Reserve. On Monday, they sent stocks higher as they guessed that the Fed would continue trying to prop up the economy.
The major stock indexes all rose about 1 percent in early trading and stayed there for most of the day before dipping slightly in the afternoon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,639.04. It had been up as much as 20 points.
The market's gains were broad. Telecommunications was the only one of the 10 industry sectors in the S.& P. 500 to post a loss. Netflix did better than any other stock in the S.& P. 500 after announcing that it would run original TV series from DreamWorks Animation. 
There were few big company announcements or economic reports, and trading was light. Investors will have to keep guessing about the Fed's future actions until Wednesday, when the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, holds a news conference at the end of a two-day policy meeting.
Investors sent stocks up Monday because they think Fed policy makers will determine that the economy is not recovering fast enough. A still-weak economy would influence the Fed to continue its programs intended to stimulate the economy: keeping interest rates low to encourage borrowing, and buying bonds to push investors into stocks.
Doug Lockwood, branch president of Hefty Wealth Partners in Auburn, Ind., said it was not rational for the stock market to regard bad news as good, and to be yanked back and forth more by the actions of a central bank than the underlying fundamentals of the economy.
The market has been in flux since May 22, when Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed would consider pulling back on its bond-buying program if measures of the economy, especially hiring, improve. The comment, made in response to a question from the Joint Economic Committee in Congress, was not expected. In the 17 trading days since then, the Dow Jones industrial average has swung by triple digits 11 times.
On Monday, the Dow rose 109.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 15,179.85. The Nasdaq composite rose 28.58, or 0.8 percent, to 3,452.13.
The price of crude oil rose throughout the day but ended 4 cents lower at $98.03 a barrel in New York. Gold edged down $4.50 to $1,383.10 an ounce.
In the market for government bonds, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 13/32 to 96 7/32, bringing the yield up to 2.18 percent from 2.13 percent late Friday.
Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust in Chicago, said Mr. Bernanke would seek to ''walk back'' on some of his previous comments, and reassure investors that the Fed will not pull back on stimulus until it is sure the economy is ready. The surprise factor, more than the substance of Mr. Bernanke's comments, might have been what unnerved investors, McDonald said.
The fact that Mr. Bernanke is now expected to regard the economy as still weak enough to need stimulus stems from a jobs report and low inflation since his testimony, analysts said.
This month, the government reported that the United States added 175,000 jobs in May -- not enough to cut into the unemployment rate. And on Friday, the government said that a crucial measure of inflation -- the producer price index, which measures wholesale prices -- rose just 0.1 percent after stripping out the volatile costs of food and gas. That is important because the Fed knows that its stimulus measures can stoke inflation; if inflation is low, the central bank has more flexibility to keep pumping money into the economy.
Two measures of economic data released on Monday were positive, though both are considered less important gauges of the economy. A report on manufacturing in New York State showed a pickup, and a survey of American home builders said they were more optimistic about sales than they had been in seven years.

HEADLINE: Firebrand for Science, and Big Man on Campus

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa -- As the car pulled into the parking lot of a Starbucks, William Sanford Nye unknotted his trademark bow tie and slipped it off.
''This might buy us a couple of minutes,'' he said.
Roughly two minutes later, before his drink was ready, he was recognized anyway. Two awed young women approached to ask if he was really Bill Nye the Science Guy. Like more than a dozen other college students who would approach him over the next several hours, they asked if they could take a picture with him. He smiled, took a proffered iPhone, scooched the students in and, in a practiced gesture, stretched out his arm to take a shot of the three of them that you just knew was totally going on Facebook.
Mr. Nye had come to talk to them, and a few thousand of their friends, at Iowa State University. If he were a politician, college students would be his base. Instead, he is something more: a figure from their early days in front of the family TV, a beloved teacher and, more and more these days, a warrior for science. They, in turn, are his fans, his students and his army. 
They have gone from watching him explain magnetism and electricity to defending the scientific evidence for climate change, the age of the earth and other issues they have seen polemicized for religious, political and even economic reasons.
He takes on those who would demand that the public schools teach alternative theories of evolution and the origins of the earth -- most famously, in a video clip from the site BigThink.com that has been viewed some five million times. In it, he flatly tells adult viewers that ''if you want to deny evolution and live in your world -- in your world that's completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe -- that's fine. But don't make your kids do it, because we need them. We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the future.''
In any given week, you're likely to see Mr. Nye, 57, somewhere on television, calmly countering the arguments made by people like Marc Morano, the former Republican Senate staff member whose industry-funded organization, climatedepot.com, disputes the increasingly well-understood connection between rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and warming. In an exchange several months ago on ''Piers Morgan Tonight'' on CNN, Mr. Morano denied that warming is occurring, and scoffed that Mr. Nye's arguments were ''the level of your daily horoscope.''
Mr. Nye quietly rebutted his opponent with the gravity of scientific consensus. ''This will be the hottest two decades in recorded history,'' he said. ''I've got to disagree with you.''
Sometimes his advocacy can step out in front of scientific consensus, however. In May, after a monster tornado devastated large parts of Moore, Okla., he took a jab on Twitter at one of that state's United States senators, James Inhofe, who has written a book calling climate change ''the greatest hoax.'' He mused: ''Has anyone asked Oklahoma Senator Inhofe'' about the frequency of such destructive storms? Yet a link between climate change and tornado activity has not been established.
On the night the tornado hit Moore, Mr. Nye explained to Mr. Morgan that ''you can't say from any one storm that 'this is a result of, let's say, climate change.' '' But he noted that ''if there's more heat driving the storm, then there's going to be more tornadoes,'' and added that the question ''is worth investigating.''
Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, said that he considered Mr. Nye ''among my best friends'' and complimented him for ''hitting controversial topics head on.''
But, he said, his own style is a bit less confrontational: ''I'm looking to stimulate curiosity so most people can go out there and learn on their own.''
Phil Plait, the creator of the Bad Astronomy blog at Slate.com and a fierce advocate himself, is more like Mr. Nye, willing to take the gloves off in rebutting those who might deny that men landed on the moon, or the evidence for human effects on climate change.
Mr. Plait said admiringly of Mr. Nye, ''He will very calmly tear them apart,'' adding, ''His big advantage is, he's right. We know that climate change is real. We know creationism is wrong. These are no longer scientific controversies.''
''When people call these 'controversial topics,' that's misleading,'' he continued. ''They are only controversial politically. And politics is not necessarily evidence-based.''
There was nothing in Mr. Nye's early days that suggested he might be a firebrand for science. Born in Washington, D.C., he studied mechanical engineering at Cornell, where he got to know a professor named Carl Sagan. He moved out West to do engineering for Boeing, where he spent some three years designing a hydraulic tube for the 747 that served to dampen vibration in the steering mechanism. He refers to it lovingly as ''my tube.''
He tried his hand at stand-up comedy -- his first time onstage was during a Steve Martin look-alike competition, which he won. He would achieve escape velocity from Boeing with an idea for a television program that would teach science to children in a wacky way. The best-known version of ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' ran from 1992 to 1996, and won 18 Emmys in five years.
Mr. Nye's past teaching and present crusading have made him a rock star for scientifically inclined students across the country. That celebrity has allowed him, as executive director of the Planetary Society, to push for the kind of interplanetary exploration that, he said in an interview, ''leads to the reverence that we have for our place in the cosmos.''
''Space,'' he added, ''brings out the best in us.''
On the day of Mr. Nye's visit to the Iowa State campus, students began lining up by midafternoon to make sure they got into the evening lecture. Stephens Auditorium holds about 3,000 people, and as many as a thousand would ultimately be turned away.
They came, many said, because ''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' helped shape their lives. ''He was probably the one who inspired me to keep going in the science career track,'' said Betsy Salmon, the first person in line at one entrance to the auditorium. She majored in animal ecology.
Kaci McCleary, an ''aspiring neurobiologist, or neuro-something,'' said that Mr. Nye was ''a very inspiring person in the field of science -- he tells people to make science part of their lives, even if it's not their career.'' Ms. McCleary, who knitted as she waited to be let in, said a friend had joked to her, ''I hope to be able to touch the hem of his lab coat, so he could cure me of my stupid.''
Mr. Nye did not disappoint. In a lecture that gave evidence of his stand-up roots, he started out with rambling asides on his his family and its generations-long fascination with sundials. He talked about the bluish tinge of shadows on Earth compared with the orangy shadows on Mars, and described the sundial that he convinced NASA to send up with the Curiosity rover. He got a little risqué with a joke about the gnomon -- the part of the sundial that sticks up, you know -- and bounced into a discussion of the hellish heat of Venus and that planet's high concentration of greenhouse gases.
He told the students that if they figured out ways to solve problems like greenhouse gases and global warming, ''You could -- dare I say it? -- change the world!'' And what's more, he added, throwing his head back for a hearty mad-scientist laugh, ''you could get rich!''
Over the hour-and-a-half talk, those statements started out as a laugh line that got funnier through increasingly manic repetition. But he shifted his tone gradually, from goofy to fervent. By the end of his speech, it was an exhortation, a command: Change the world.
During the question-and-answer session, a student brought up Mr. Nye's comments on evolution and creation. The problem, he explained, is that some people advocate requiring public schools to teach religious apologia as science.
''The earth's not 4,000, 6,000, 10,000 years old,'' he said. ''I've got no problem with anybody's religion. But if you go claiming the earth is only 10,000 years old, that's just wrong.''
The students roared their approval. As the audience streamed out -- did those dudes really rip off their shirts to show that they had painted, in all capital letters, ''Bill Nye'' on their chests and ''science'' on their backs? -- Mr. Nye looked like someone who had just run a triathlon. And then it was time for more pictures.
Earlier in the day, he had marveled at the chain of events that made him the Springsteen of the nerds. ''I was making a TV show. It had commercials for toys.'' Yet, he noted, ''It stands the test of time. It's very gratifying.''
What he did then, and what he does now, are all part of the same crusade, he said. ''There's nothing I believe in more strongly than getting young people interested in science and engineering,'' he said -- ''for a better tomorrow, for all humankind.''
He stopped, realizing that sounded grandiose, or at least corny.
''I'm not kidding,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Britain's Top Fraud Office Aims to Add Bite to Its Bark

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
David Green, the director of Britain's Serious Fraud Office, is in a combative mood.
On his desk at his office, a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square in London, sits a souvenir plaque commemorating the signal that Admiral Horatio Nelson sent to his fleet on the eve of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It says, ''England expects that every man will do his duty.''
Mr. Green says his duty is to revive confidence in his office as a top-tier prosecutor of serious fraud and corruption. And he plans to do that with the help of one of the biggest cases the organization has ever taken on: the investigation into the rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
His office plans to bring criminal fraud charges against Thomas Hayes, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, as early as Tuesday, according to a person briefed on the case. Mr. Hayes, who was charged with fraud late last year by the United States Justice Department, is seen as a central character in the rate-rigging scheme. His role figured prominently in the case against UBS, which under a settlement pleaded guilty to one count of felony wire fraud and paid about $1.5 billion in fines. The criminal charges against Mr. Hayes would be the first brought by British prosecutors for suspected manipulation of Libor. 
''What people look to is success in the very big headline cases, and inevitably Libor comes to mind,'' Mr. Green, 59, said in an interview this month. ''I am in the business of doing justice and restoring public confidence in the rule of law. The public need to have confidence that white-collar criminals are dealt with as criminals, that they are not given some special rosy path with a cop-out sentence at the end of the day.''
When Mr. Green took over as director of the fraud office in April last year after 25 years as a prosecutor and defense lawyer, he found an agency whose reputation was in shambles and whose staff morale had hit rock bottom. Two London businessmen, the Tchenguiz brothers, Robert and Vincent, had dragged the office to court over a botched investigation into their connections with failed banks in Iceland. The fraud office apologized and started an internal investigation but also ran up huge legal costs that might continue to grow.
Additional embarrassment came in 2011, when the office decided against investigating Libor and shifted responsibility instead to the Financial Services Authority. While the Justice Department started to delve into the Libor case from abroad, the fraud office said it would only be a further drag on its already stretched resources.
Despite an increase of publicity-friendly dawn raids on suspected wrongdoers and some saber-rattling speeches, the fraud office had built an image of a prosecutor that barked but would not bite. So bad was its reputation that when the government started to change the way it regulated the financial industry after the financial crisis, it seriously considered abolishing the office.
Mr. Green is well aware of these problems. One of the first things he did when he arrived was to clearly define the mission of the organization, he said. Unlike his predecessor, Richard Alderman, he is not in the business of giving guidance and striking deals with defendants. ''The sentence is a matter for the judge,'' he said. ''I am here to prosecute.''
''There was a general perception in this country and abroad that the S.F.O. lacked somehow the stomach to prosecute and preferred the easier route of civil settlement,'' he said. ''There was a perception that the S.F.O. had dumbed down and has taken easier, less-complex cases.''
But those times are over, he said, and his message to criminals is clear: ''If your conduct is criminal and comes within the purview of the S.F.O., we will go after you.''
When he took over, Mr. Green simplified the office's structure by setting up two divisions for fraud and two divisions for bribery and hired new senior staff members, including Geoffrey Rivlin, a retired judge feared and respected for being a stickler for detail, to help prepare cases for court.
John Fingleton, chief executive of Fingleton Associates, which advises clients on regulatory issues, said Mr. Green ''hired some good people and tries to tidy up the place.'' But the job is not easy, Mr. Fingleton said.
''The S.F.O. has been heavily starved of resources, and crime enforcement in Britain is generally far more difficult than in the U.S.,'' where there are fewer burdens on the prosecution and plea bargains are commonplace, he said.
Mr. Green takes particular issue with the suggestion that the fraud office would refuse to open an investigation because it was too expensive. ''Absurd,'' he said, before adding, ''disgraceful.''
''I will not stay in this job and do that,'' he emphasized.
The Libor inquiry is the largest of the fraud office's 67 active cases and a vast undertaking that required Mr. Green to double the investigation team to 60 this year. Another handful of investigators are on loan from the tax authority, and there is some staff from large accounting firms and foreign regulators. A deal to swap staff with the Justice Department is in its final stages, he said.
As determined to prosecute and passionate about his work as Mr. Green is, he is reluctant to talk about his private life or even his earlier legal cases. His father worked for a bank while his mother brought up the children. After studying history at Cambridge University, Mr. Green took an interest in criminal law and worked for a while for his brother-in-law, a lawyer.
He then worked as a prosecutor and defense lawyer on cases that included financial crime and murder. He said he defended financial organizations for regulatory and criminal offenses in the past but would not give any names.
His main prosecution work included cases involving the importation of heroin from places like Afghanistan, organized crime and fraud, but he declined to give any detail. In 2005, he was named director of revenue and customs prosecutions, successfully prosecuting money-laundering groups and cigarette smugglers. More than 90 percent of the cases secured a conviction.
Alison Graham-Wells, a lawyer who worked under Mr. Green in the 1990s, said he stood out in court for his ability to explain complex cases of financial fraud in simple terms to a jury. ''He has a very good court presence,'' she said.
Whether Mr. Green, now at the fraud office, is successful will depend on the outcome of the Libor investigation. Some analysts said he was taking a risk by focusing on Libor and pointed out that with a prominent international case like this, the likelihood of prosecution could be taken out of his hands.
But Mr. Green is defiant. ''A risk-averse person should not be doing this job,'' he said. ''I've been a trial lawyer all my life. The whole process is about assessing and managing risk. Do I ask this question? Do I raise this point? What is the clearest way of presenting this to a jury?''
Next to the Nelson quote plaque on his desk, Mr. Green keeps another one, which he picked up during a trip to Washington and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. It is closely associated with the Apollo 13 mission and reflects what Mr. Green really thinks about his mission at the fraud office: ''Failure is not an option.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Solar-Powered Plane Faces the Human Factor

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
CHANTILLY, Va. -- Nearing the end of a cross-continent flight powered by solar electricity, the designers of the Solar Impulse airplane are looking at the challenge of flying around the globe but focusing on the weak spot in their cutting-edge technological effort: human frailty.
The solution, they say, is more technology. 
Solar Impulse stands out among airplanes partly because its range is limited not by fuel but the stamina of the pilot.
The single-seat airplane's cabin is unpressurized, so the pilot must wear an oxygen mask. It has no bathroom. With a grand total of 40 horsepower, the average cruising speed is 38 knots, or about 44 miles an hour, so progress is slow. Even if a pilot can tolerate 26 hours in the tiny cockpit -- the record so far -- an oceanic flight is hard to imagine.
''The seat is like a really bad economy seat on an airliner,'' said Gregory Blatt, a managing director of the company, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland. ''The next version will be like a good business-class seat.''
That version, which is supposed to be able to fly five or six days at a time, will have a bigger seat, a cabin large enough to move around in, some plumbing and various other upgrades, like an autopilot. But that means a heavier plane that will require more efficient solar cells, electric motors and other improvements.
A Solar Impulse plane, an eye-catching proof-of-concept vehicle, arrived at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum's branch at Dulles Airport over the weekend from St. Louis, part of a photovoltaic barnstorming tour. The plane's designers say the successor airplane, already under development, needs crucial but incremental improvements.
The four motors on the existing model, for example, are 90 percent efficient in turning current into torque, far better than most motors on the ground. But the new ones are 94 percent efficient, said Bertrand Piccard, chairman of the company and one of the two pilots. (Some inefficiency is desirable, because the energy that does not go into turning the propellers instead becomes heat, which is needed to keep the motors and the batteries warm at cruising altitude, around 29,000 feet. The batteries are tucked into the pods under the wings that hold the motors.)
The solar cells on the wings and the horizontal tail, from the SunPower Corporation of San Jose, Calif., are about 22.7 percent efficient, Mr. Blatt said. New cells will be better than that, he added. The existing plane carries 11,628 solar cells.
The existing cells are of a type already in use, but they are used in Solar Impulse in a new way. They do not cover the skin of the wing, but rather are the skin of the wing: thin monocrystalline cells, given a slight bend so the wing creates lift. The wingspan is huge, about the same as a Boeing 747. The whole plane weighs only about 3,500 pounds, so what aeronautical engineers call ''wing loading,'' or force of the air on the wing, is low.
The lithium-polymer batteries, from Kokam, a Korean company, are also a commercial product.
Ernest Moniz, the Energy secretary, who visited the hangar on Monday to look at the plane, praised it not only for using new technology but for integrating it into a useful package.
''Energy efficiency and system integration are enormously important areas,'' he said. Efficiency is crucial because the propulsion system is not quite as big as one on a large motorcycle.
One innovation is the foam used in the structure of the plane, which has unusually small pores. Dan Reicher, a former assistant secretary of energy now at Stanford Law School, said that the foam had already found its way into refrigerators, because it is a better insulator.
The plane is scheduled to end its tour at Kennedy International Airport in New York early next month, depending on weather. Because it is so light and has such a large wingspan, it is vulnerable to gusts at low altitude, said André Borschberg, the company chief executive and the other pilot.
As a result, it takes off and lands at night, when there is no solar warming of the earth, which produces wind. And landing is an elaborate problem. Its main landing gear is a single wheel, and to keep its wing tips from scraping on the ground, the team deploys two people on electric bicycles to sweep in and hold the wings up as the plane touches down.
With a touchdown speed of 26 knots, about 30 m.p.h., this is not difficult. But it requires a runway without much other traffic, or it becomes like riding a bicycle on an interstate highway. At Kennedy, the plan is to circle at low altitude near the runway until there is a big gap in the traffic, Mr. Piccard said.

HEADLINE: Maxine Stuart, 94, Dies; Acted on Stage, Film and TV

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Maxine Stuart's stage, film and television career spanned more than six decades, including a recurring role on the soap opera ''The Edge of Night'' and a guest spot on a memorable episode of ''The Twilight Zone.''
But she was equally well known to readers of Helene Hanff's nonfiction books ''84, Charing Cross Road'' and ''Underfoot in Show Business'' as Ms. Hanff's deliciously dizzy sidekick in their attempts to make it on Broadway in the 1930s and '40s. 
Ms. Stuart, who died on June 6 at 94, makes several cameo appearances in ''84,'' as the book is known to its ardent fans. First published in 1970, it is an epistolary memoir of Ms. Hanff's long correspondence with the staff of a London bookshop. (In the 1987 film version of the book, starring Anne Bancroft as Ms. Hanff, Ms. Stuart is played by Jean De Baer.)
In ''Underfoot,'' Ms. Stuart is a genuine co-star. That book, published in 1962, recounts Ms. Hanff's years in New York as a struggling playwright in tandem with Ms. Stuart's as a struggling actress.
The warm, adventurous, impecunious friendship of the two young women began in the late 1930s in the backstage ladies' room of the Morosco Theater, after Ms. Hanff saw one of the many flops in which Ms. Stuart seemed condemned to appear.
Her description of Ms. Stuart's daily life -- the voice and diction lessons (which entailed screaming ''Oh, NO!'' at top volume in the bathroom of her parents' apartment); the audition rounds; the elation of being cast; the deflation of closing -- is a window onto the existence of a working, and sometimes out-of-work, actor in the years before television devoured Broadway.
The book is also a visitors' manual to a vanished New York -- the New York of Schrafft's, the Automat and residential hotels for nice young women -- in which it was actually possible to live by the young Ms. Stuart's credo, ''Nothing should cost anything.''
In Ms. Stuart's resourceful hands, even Broadway cost nothing. Several nights a week, the two friends, wearing no coats, would arrive at a theater of their choice in time for the Act 1 intermission.
On the sidewalk, they mingled with audience members who had gone outside to smoke. (Even in the coldest weather, no self-respecting New York theatergoer on a cigarette break bothered with a coat.)
Drifting inside, the young women made for the best seats without coats on them and sat down. They saw many plays -- minus the first acts -- and caught many colds.
Maxine Shlivek was born on June 28, 1918, in Deal, N.J., and reared in Lawrence, on Long Island, and Manhattan.
Her film credits include ''Days of Wine and Roses'' (1962) and ''Private Benjamin'' (1980). On television, she portrayed the stenographer Grace O'Keefe on ''The Edge of Night.''
Ms. Stuart was seen on dozens of other shows, including ''Perry Mason,'' ''Dr. Kildare,'' ''Chicago Hope'' and ''The Wonder Years,'' for which she received a 1989 Emmy nomination as Kevin's piano teacher.
She had a pivotal guest role in ''Eye of the Beholder,'' a ''Twilight Zone'' episode first broadcast in 1960. Ms. Stuart played a hospital patient -- her face, never seen, is swathed in bandages -- who endures repeated failed operations in an attempt to correct her freakish appearance.
When the bandages are removed, doctors pronounce the latest operation a failure too. The patient's face is disclosed to be that of a beautiful woman, from that point on played by Donna Douglas. The doctors and nurses are revealed to have hideous, porcine faces.
That Ms. Stuart was deemed not pretty enough to play the unveiled patient in a show about beauty as a socially constructed concept was an irony not lost on her, she said in interviews.
After a brief early marriage that ended in divorce, Ms. Stuart married Frank Maxwell, an actor. Their marriage ended in divorce; Ms. Stuart's third husband, David Shaw, a playwright and screenwriter, died in 2007.
Ms. Stuart is survived by three daughters, Chris Ann Maxwell, who confirmed her mother's death, at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.; Ellen Shaw Agress; and Liz Shaw Baron; four grandchildren; and a great-grandchild. Ms. Hanff died in 1997, at 80.
Before moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s, Ms. Stuart made repeated, if short-lived, outings on the New York stage.
''Maxine appeared in 11 Broadway plays, most of which opened on a Tuesday night,'' Ms. Hanff wrote. ''On Wednesday came the flop notices, on Thursday an empty house, on Friday the closing notice went up, on Saturday the show closed and on Sunday Maxine slept it off.''
''And so, on Monday,'' Ms. Hanff continued, ''she was once more to be found in her parents' apartment on West End Avenue ready to resume the normal daily life of a glamorous young actress by screaming 'Oh, NO!' in the bathroom.''

HEADLINE: At Paris Show, Some Signs of Renewed Demand for Big Jets

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
LE BOURGET, France -- After several years of intense demand for smaller, single-aisle workhorses, the European plane maker Airbus on Monday secured a customer for its twin-deck A380 superjumbo jet, in a deal the company hoped would signal a revival in interest in larger passenger jets.
The agreement with a little-known German leasing company, Doric Asset Finance, was for 20 planes, and was valued at $8.1 billion at list prices. Doric was Airbus's first new customer in nearly two years for its superjumbo plane, which typically seats around 525 passengers. 
The order came on the opening day of the Paris Air Show amid a flurry of announcements of orders for wide-body planes made by Airbus's American rival, Boeing, including a planned stretch model of its flagship 787 Dreamliner and a long-range version of its popular 777 jet.
Airbus has struggled to garner new orders for the A380, which entered commercial service in 2007, after a series of development snags. Airbus, which has sold 282 of the planes, has said it hopes to deliver 750 over the 25-year superjumbo program. Currently, nine airlines operate just over 100 of the planes.
The A380 has been a particularly tough sell to leasing companies because airlines have tended to seek extensive and costly customization of its interior to differentiate themselves from competitors. Such work can be an onerous proposition for lessors, which often roll a plane over to different airlines during its lifetime. Two years ago, International Lease Finance Corporation, one of the world's largest aircraft lessors, dropped plans to buy 10 superjumbos as the global economic slowdown drove airlines to rein in seat capacity.
But Doric, which is based in Offenbach, near Frankfurt, said on Monday that it was talking with several potential customers for the A380 jets.
''We see how airlines that do not yet have the A380 are interested in it and approach us and ask questions, which shows us that there is pent-up demand for this aircraft,'' said Mark Lapidus, Doric's chief executive. He said he expected his company would easily place the planes with two or three airlines.
''If anything, we are perhaps under-ordering'' the jets, he said.
Another leasing company, GE Capital Aviation Services, planned to order up to 10 models of a stretch version of Boeing's 787, which the American manufacturer was expected to commit to building this week. The larger 787 is expected to seat 320 passengers, compared with the 210 to 290 seats in the Dreamliners currently in production.
Analysts said they were skeptical about a fundamental change in the market for planes with more than 400 seats, like the A380 and Boeing 747.
''Long term, the financial future for the A380 looks pretty weak,'' said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst for StrategicAero Research in London. ''It's a very small niche market.''
Despite the dearth of recent A380 orders, ''the basics haven't changed,'' said Christopher Emerson, Airbus's senior vice president for marketing. He attributed the slower-than-expected uptake of A380s to bad timing, noting that the first deliveries came less than a year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which set off the global financial crisis and subsequent recession.
''Now that we are coming out of the downturn, you will start to see traffic growing faster,'' Mr. Emerson said. ''Now is the time for the A380 to do what it was designed to do: capture growth.''

HEADLINE: How the Revival of Postwar Germany Began

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Germany&#8217;s economic recovery began 65 years ago this week when a strong-willed economist laid out the path forward and the United States, Britain and France followed it, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Sixty-five years ago this week, in June 1948, a remarkable economic transformation took place in Germany. Almost overnight, the economy went from stagnation to revival. Most of the credit goes to the German economist Ludwig Erhard. 
In 1948, the German economy was a basket case, not merely because of the damage from war but because economic policy was thoroughly confused. Some in the West, including the United States Treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, thought Germany's industrial capacity should be completely dismantled to prevent it from ever again becoming a military threat.
This was a minority point of view, however. The rising Soviet threat overwhelmed any desire for vengeance against Germany and required that it be built up as quickly as possible. The big problem was that Germany was divided into four occupation zones after the war, one each controlled by Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States.
Action required agreement among the four powers, which was difficult not only because of Soviet intransigence. In 1945, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain's Conservative Party had lost his position to Clement Attlee of the Labor Party, who quickly moved to nationalize industry in Britain and adopt other socialist policies. Some new British leaders wanted their socialist ideas implemented in Germany as well.
Thus there were political, ideological and diplomatic divisions among the allies that prevented action in Germany, with economic policy remaining on automatic pilot. Ironically, this led to the continuation of Nazi economic controls, because there was no agreement on what should replace them.
In 1947, the United States and Britain decided to unify the administration of their occupation zones into an area called Bizonia. Mr. Erhard, a respected German business economist from Bavaria, was named economic minister.
In 1948, Britain, France and the United States agreed to end their occupation and establish an independent German state with or without inclusion of the Soviet zone. The handover of power was set to begin on June 15, thus setting up a confrontation with the Soviets.
As soon as German economic autonomy was restored, Mr. Erhard wanted to institute sweeping economic reforms, especially currency reform. Because of inflation, the Germany currency was virtually worthless and the economy largely functioned on barter, which was extremely inefficient and severely hindered the growth of industry.
Introduction of a new German mark was set for June 20, 1948. As word of the currency reform leaked out, stores closed until the effects of the new currency could be determined. Simultaneously, the Soviets cut off supplies for Berlin, which was deep in their zone of occupation but administered jointly by the four powers. The Western powers responded by airlifting supplies to the city, the beginning of the famous Berlin Airlift, one of the most dramatic events in postwar history.
A key part of Mr. Erhard's plan was the elimination of price controls, which was essential for the currency reform to be effective. He needed permission from the allies to change any of the price controls, but Mr. Erhard concluded that he did not need their consent to simply abolish them. As he wrote in his 1958 book "Prosperity Through Competition":
It was strictly laid down by the British and American control authorities that permission had to be obtained before any definite price changes could be made. The Allies never seemed to have thought it possible that someone could have the idea, not to alter price controls, but simply to remove them.
Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the United States commander in Germany, was well aware of what Mr. Erhard was up to and could have stopped him. But General Clay's personal economic adviser, the American businessman Joseph Dodge, urged him not to and the general wisely followed his advice, turning a blind eye to Mr. Erhard's actions. (Mr. Dodge, an extraordinarily important but virtually unknown figure in postwar economic policy, also played a key role in advising Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the United States commander in Japan, on reforming its economy as well.)
Mr. Erhard instituted many other reforms as well, including a 33 percent cut in income taxes. On June 26, the French, British and American authorities ratified Mr. Erhard's actions. This led the Soviets to tighten the isolation of Berlin, creating a severe political and economic crisis. The allied airlift quickly ratcheted up. By July 4, 362 American and British planes brought 3,000 tons of food into the city in a single day, an amazing accomplishment given the limited landing and takeoff facilities in Berlin.
By August, the Communists were organizing demonstrations against Mr. Erhard and his reforms, but General Clay stood behind him. Fortunately, tangible signs of economic recovery were becoming evident. Rationing was ended completely in September. In October, a bumper crop of potatoes was cheered, with production up 60 percent over 1947.
By November, it was clearly apparent that the western zone of Germany was taking off, economically, leaving the eastern zone, still under Soviet control, behind. According to an article in The New York Times, industrial production was "far better than even the most optimistic economic planners envisaged when currency reform went into effect."
The strong economic growth in the west was a major factor leading the Soviet Union to call off its blockade of Berlin on May 12, 1949, and the airlift ended.
A year after the Erhard reforms, they were generally viewed as an unqualified success. C.L. Sulzberger of The New York Times interviewed Mr. Erhard in July 1949 and he pointed with pride to the fact that the quality of German goods was rising, prices were falling and the standard of living was improving. On July 20, Mr. Sulzberger wrote, "Germany is coming back."
The West German economy continued to expand, aided by the Marshall Plan, and Mr. Erhard remained as the nation's economics minister until 1963, when he became West Germany's second chancellor. He died in 1977.

HEADLINE: From Nepal, a Push to End Human Trafficking

BYLINE: SUE-LIN WONG


HIGHLIGHT: Human trafficking is a blight that nevertheless flourishes in the world; in Asia, where more than half the victims are from, Nepal&#8217;s laws against it are a model for the region, but they are poorly implemented. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Human trafficking is one of the world's fastest-growing crimes, the United Nations says, with nearly 21 million people falling victim each year. More than half of the victims of forced labor are from the Asia-Pacific region, the International Labor Organization estimates. It's a major policy challenge and in Asia, Nepal is leading the way in terms of legislation, according to the San Francisco-based Asia Foundation.
Yet passing laws and implementing them are two different things, lawyers and activists say. In its 2012 report, the U.S. State Department warned that anti-trafficking laws were "not well implemented" in Nepal. 
Six years after the country passed landmark legislation to fight trafficking, the challenge is how to enforce it, said Sapana Pradhan Malla, one of the prime architects behind Nepal's Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act.
We caught up with Ms. Pradhan Malla, a lawyer and advocate at Nepal's Supreme Court, this month after she received a Lotus Leadership Award from the Asia Foundation in New York for her work against human trafficking.
Here is an edited version of the telephone interview:
Q: What projects are you currently working on?
A: Back in 2000, we found 118 legal provisions in Nepalese law that were discriminatory against women. While we've made significant progress, we are still working to tackle the two discriminatory laws left in Nepal: polygamy and citizenship. Compared to other Asian countries, Nepal has strong laws against human trafficking. But now the challenge is how to implement the human trafficking law.
Q: What are key challenges?
A: There are some serious problems with policy in Nepal. For example, in order to protect women from being trafficked, the government has a restrictive policy for foreign employment. Because of this, women who want to seek foreign employment are forced to use fake passports to illegally move to another country.
Another issue is how to measure justice for survivors. I recently worked on one case involving the trafficking of six girls from Nepal. The trafficker was sentenced to 117 years' imprisonment. When we asked the victims if they were satisfied with the length of the sentence, they said, "Yes, but what about us? The accused doesn't have any property and the government doesn't have any mechanism to compensate us." Justice is collectively demanded and individually experienced. Even if we have laws, how do we ensure that survivors feel like justice is being achieved?
Most importantly, the root cause needs to be addressed - the poverty, illiteracy, corruption. In many human trafficking cases, people are lured by economic benefits.
Q: How many cases have been reported using Nepal's human trafficking act?
A: I have represented hundreds of cases, but the number is still very low. An International Labor Organization study found 12,000 to 15,000 women are trafficked in Nepal every year but no more than 180 cases are reported each year.
Q: What are the reasons for the low levels of reporting?
A: Victims sometimes don't want to go to court because they worry it will further stigmatize them.
Intimidation is another problem. We've had six or seven cases where, during their hearing of their case, the victim either changed their statement or didn't appear as a witness. We've found that in the majority of cases victims are either threatened with their lives or lured by economic benefits.
We don't have the resources to provide adequate security and protection for victims and witnesses.
Q: Are there men who use Nepal's human trafficking act to press charges?
A: It used to be that sexual exploitation was the main form of trafficking in Nepal. But now there are lots of cases of trafficking for cheap labor, forced labor, trafficking for marriage, trafficking for organ transplants. The law is gender neutral, but the majority of cases still involve women and girls.
Q: What is the current situation of human trafficking from Nepal into China?
A: There are a lot of reported cases of Nepalese women being trafficked into Tibet. Sometimes they migrate for work, but other times they end up in the sex industry. A lot of Nepalese have been deported, but we haven't been able to initiate any bilateral arrangement to deal with this.
Q: Do you have bilateral arrangements with other countries?
A: No, unfortunately. But at least with India, we have informal mechanisms between N.G.O.'s. There are also some mechanisms that exist for joint investigation and legal assistance. But those informal mechanisms don't exist with other countries.
Q: Are you hoping for similar informal mechanisms with N.G.O.'s operating out of Tibet?
A: We don't know if there are any N.G.O.'s working on this issue there. I think it has to be government to government. India and Nepal have a different type of problem because of the open-border policy.
Even though Nepal shares a long border with China, it isn't very accessible, particularly compared to the Indian border. The Chinese government hasn't paid any attention to the issue. We need to implement cross-border mechanisms to monitor and implement strict work permits. It's the early stages and if we take it seriously, there is a possibility we can work with China to handle the situation.
Q: What is the most important thing Nepal can do to fight human trafficking?
A: Nepal is currently in a very politically fragile state. When a country is in transition, women will also be in transition, justice will also be in transition.
We need to create political stability in the country. It is most important to create opportunities inside the country, especially opportunities for economic empowerment.

HEADLINE: Britain Charges Former Trader in Libor Inquiry

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: British prosecutors have filed eight fraud charges against a former UBS trader in the first criminal case in London in connection with the manipulation of benchmark interest rates. 

 BODY:
 12:22 p.m. | Updated 
LONDON - British prosecutors have filed eight fraud charges against a former UBS trader in the first criminal case in London in connection with the manipulation of benchmark global rates.
The case against the trader, Tom A.W. Hayes, comes after United States charges brought against him and a fellow trader late last year. UBS is one of more than a dozen global banks that have been ensnared in a multiyear investigation by United States, British and other authorities into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Such benchmark rates help determine the borrowing rates for trillions of dollars of mortgages, business loans, credit cards and other financial products
 With the latest criminal charges, Britain has now escalated its part in the global crackdown on rate-rigging. The Serious Fraud Office of Britain said on Tuesday that Mr. Hayes had been charged that morning at a police station in London's financial district with offenses of conspiracy to defraud in connection with the continuing Libor investigation. Mr. Hayes is scheduled to appear before a London magistrates' court on Thursday morning, the agency said. 
"He attended Bishopsgate police station this morning where he was charged by City of London Police with eight counts of fraud," the Serious Fraud Office said in a statement.
A lawyer for Mr. Hayes, Lydia Jonson, declined to comment.
The charges are the latest blow to Mr. Hayes, 33, a British national who worked in Tokyo. Mr. Hayes and another former UBS trader, Roger Darin, 41, of Switzerland were already charged with conspiracy by the United States Justice Department in a criminal complaint that was unsealed in December. The Justice Department also charged Mr. Hayes with price fixing, stemming from an allegation that he collaborated with another bank to rig interest rates.
The fresh round of charges comes nearly a year after the first settlement in the Libor case, when Barclays of Britain agreed to pay $450 million to British and American authorities. American and British authorities later struck a settlement with Royal Bank of Scotland, which agreed in February to pay $612 million over its role in the Libor scandal.
Mr. Hayes, who also previously worked for Citigroup, figured prominently in a separate case against UBS, whose Japanese subsidiary pleaded guilty last year to one count of felony wire fraud as part of a settlement with the Justice Department. Under a broader deal with American, British and Swiss authorities, UBS paid $1.5 billion to settle the case.
But while American and British authorities built these cases over several years, the Serious Fraud Office often appeared uninterested in the Libor investigation, at times irritating other prosecutors. Now, the British action against Mr. Hayes will test the somewhat tenuous relationship between the office and its American counterparts, setting up a potential turf battle over where the former trader will stand trial.
When announcing the first charges against Mr. Hayes last year, people close to the Justice Department in Washington privately expressed concern about extraditing the former trader to the United States. With the Serious Fraud Office issuing its own charges against Mr. Hayes, the Justice Department's chances at trying a case in the United States grew even dimmer.
David Green, who took over the Serious Fraud Office last year, has said that cooperation with the United States is important, but that Britons who worked for British companies should be tried in Britain.
Mr. Hayes was one of three individuals arrested and questioned by the police and staff members of the Serious Fraud Office last December. Two employees of the brokerage RP Martin Holdings were also held, but all three were released on bail pending further investigations.
Mr. Hayes, who is from Surrey in southeast England, started his career as a trainee for the Royal Bank of Scotland, before joining UBS in 2006, where he became one of the highest-earning traders.
But he was also at the center of the rate-rigging activity, according to the Justice Department's complaint, which cites his own instant messaging conversations as evidence of his actions. In a November 2006 instant message sent to a junior UBS employee, for example, Mr. Hayes explained that he and a colleague "generally coordinate" and "skew the libors a bit."
Mr. Hayes, prosecutors say, later spread the scheme to other firms, enlisting the help of middlemen at brokerage firms. The brokers, prosecutors say, convinced other banks that set Libor to tamper with rates.
In an August 2008 e-chat, Mr. Hayes expressed appreciation for one broker's effort, saying, "Yeah, I reckon I owe" this person "a lot more." Another broker responded that the person was "ok with an annual champagne shipment," and "a small bonus every now and then."
Mr. Hayes ultimately left UBS and joined Citigroup, where he was a trader based in Tokyo. At Citigroup, he earned a director title, but spent less than six months trading. The bank suspended him in 2010 after he was suspected of approaching a London trading desk about improperly influencing the yen-denominated Libor rates, a person briefed on the matter said. He left Citigroup later that year, and the bank reported his suspected actions to authorities.
 Julia Werdigier reported from London; Ben Protess reported from New York.

HEADLINE: How Our Sales Process Broke Down

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: In part two of a series, an owner explains how he concluded that his sales process had gone off the tracks and that he needed to do something about it. 

 BODY:
 Editor's note: Paul Downs is writing this week about his decision to hire a sales consultant. The series started with this post. 
At the beginning of 2012, I had set a sales target of $200,000 a month, and in the first two months of the year, we hit that number. But March came in weak: we sold only $135,732. April was almost as bad, with just $146,677 in new orders. And May was even worse: $114,042. By the end of May we were $200,000 behind our target, and I was worrying about running out of work.
We can generally handle a down month now and then without difficulty, as these are often followed by months in which we far exceed the quota. But three weak months in a row means a serious mismatch between our production capacity and the amount of work we actually have on hand. That's bad in two ways: first, the missing sales mean less cash coming in from deposit payments, and second, we will eventually have no work to do. I had hired five people in 2011 to ensure that I could get $200,000 worth of work out the door each month. That was now looking like a big mistake. Would I have to lay off all of those people? 
Naturally, I spent a lot of time thinking about what was happening, and eventually I decided that my problem was the economy. In the spring of 2012, there was quite a lot of chatter in the media about poor job growth and the possibility of a double-dip recession. I latched on to that story and convinced myself that the problem was out of my hands. I was ignoring the possibility that we simply weren't doing a good job with sales, mostly because my method had worked well in the past. I hadn't changed anything about how we made sales, and it just seemed as though that couldn't be the problem.
But now, when I look back at what was happening, it's clear to me that there were danger signs I ignored. In particular, I downplayed a couple of big jobs that slipped through our fingers. One, for a large company in California, had seemed to be a lock. Our contact at that company had even told us that we had the job and promised a deposit the following week. But it never came. Instead, I got a call from an office furniture dealer who was providing furniture for the rest of the project, a major office expansion.
He had seen our proposal and said he was very impressed. He called to see if there was some way we might work together on future projects. Or so he said. I spoke to him about how we might collaborate and left with the impression that we would work together soon. But I never heard back from him, and the job we had been counting on didn't come through either. Eventually, we heard from the client that it "had decided to go in another direction." The dealer had simply bought the job out from under us. Having seen our product and our pricing, he had come up with a competing offer and price that the client accepted.
In another instance, we put a great deal of time into working with a military client, doing extensive design work, revision after revision, that the client took and used as the basis for its bid package. It went on to award the job to another company, one it had worked with previously. Both of those jobs were large enough that, had we received either of them, we would have exceeded our targets for April and May. And in that case, I might not even have noticed we had a problem. But we are vulnerable when we lose the big ones, because a bunch of smaller orders may not take us to our target. And in this case being played for chumps made a real difference.
As I wrote in my posts last fall about my AdWords debacle, I took my sales problem to my Vistage group in May 2012 andgot some good advice - namely, that the problem was not the economy and that I needed to look within my own organization. At this point in my AdWords posts, I spoke about what I did with my campaign to restore a particular type of incoming call.
But I left out the other big change I made in response to a recommendation from one of the members of my Vistage group, Sam Saxton. Mr. Saxton owns a custom stair-making company, Salter Spiral Stair, that is in many ways similar to mine. It manufactures custom items and sells them over the Internet. He told me that he had hired a sales consultant who had helped him double his sales volume in the previous two years, and he suggested that I follow his path.

HEADLINE: Structural Excuses

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No substitute for macroeconomic policy. 

 BODY:
I promised in an earlier post to say something about why these days I tend to get annoyed when I hear the phrase "structural reform", especially in Europe. 
Part of the reason is that the phrase sounds good, but could mean lots of things. In many cases "structural reform" is code for eliminating worker protections and/or sharply cutting social benefits. Sometimes this may be necessary - let's face it, France has made it much too attractive to retire at 55 - but such things should be called by their proper names, not wrapped in vague language that conceals the nature of the pain.
That brings me to a second problem: whenever some catchphrase becomes part of what Very Serious People say because it sounds Serious, it's time to stop using the phrase, to force the VSPs to talk about what they really mean. In the US context, "entitlement reform" is VSP boilerplate - I mean, who can be against reform? But there's a world of difference between trying to move away from fee for service medicine - a reform I support - and, say, raising the Medicare age, which would be a terrible policy. These things should not be lumped together.
But the main thing about "structural reform" in Europe is the role it plays in discussion of macroeconomic policies. Instead of reflecting on the fact that Europe is sinking deeper into depression five years into the slump, and clearly needs less austerity and more aggressive monetary expansion, the usual suspects start talking about the need for structural reform. And my sense is that this talk of reform has, in practice, become less a real demand for specific actions than an excuse for not facing up to the reality of macroeconomic disaster, and a way to avoid discussing the responsibility of Germany and the ECB, in particular, to help end this disaster.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The 'Car 54, Where Are You?' Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Carbon Motors, which was planning to manufacture police cars in Indiana, filed for bankruptcy this month, and several of its former executives are suing the company. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 The would-be police car manufacturer, Carbon Motors, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. Motor Trend reported in 2009 that the company had received 10,000 preorders for its custom super cruiser, but Carbon failed to qualify for an Energy Department and later said it would deliver a tactical van model in lieu of cruisers. It was not long before Carbon quietly disappeared from Indiana, where it had promised to build a factory and create jobs in an economy desperate for work. What became of public money associated with Carbon and its planned factory is somewhat murky. David Hester, reporting for The Truth About Cars, said that three Carbon vice presidents filed suit against the company, which he surmised might reveal more about whether any wrongdoing was involved in the company's demise. (The Truth About Cars)
 The Walter P. Chrysler Museum in Auburn Hills, Mich. said that although it would not be open to the public, its collection would remain intact. Amid financial problems, the museum had closed in January after being open since 1999. Museum officials said the museum, which has about 60 functional classic and concept cars, including 1941 Chrysler Town & Country barrelback to the workaday K-car, would continue to host special events.(Hemmings Motor News) 
 Many new cars come with backup cameras as a safety feature, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has yet to rule on whether they should be required on new cars. Legislation has been proposed, but the backup camera issue is only one of 17 regulatory changes under review. Some of the other proposed rules deal with side impact safety, requiring ways for people to better hear electric cars and data recorder standards. Citing a need to review each issue thoroughly, N.H.T.S.A. said it did not have a time frame for when it would decide upon the regulations. (The Detroit News)
 Audi may be the Cadillac of the Chinese auto market, but the real Cadillac has its sights set on reclaiming that title. Audi outsells Cadillac 14-to-1 in China, but Cadillac said it planned to introduce a new model every year through 2016, which it hoped would triple sales by 2015. The luxury automaker already plans to build another assembly plant in China, and Dan Akerson, the chief executive of General Motors, said that Cadillac would be a priority in the company's China investment plan. (Bloomberg)
 Mike Harmon, a Nascar driver, has been charged with stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cars and other racing-related gear from Jennifer Jo Cobb, who had driven on David Novak's team until last year. Novak and Cobb had a messy parting of ways, and the resulting he-said, she-said equipment dispute ended in a judge telling Novak that he was not entitled to several items - including several cars and a car hauler - Novak claimed were his, but were in Cobb's possession. Novak and Harmon denied taking back the equipment, but several of the vehicles Cobb had reported as stolen were later found on Harmon's property, stripped down. Harmon turned himself in to authorities in North Carolina on Monday afternoon. (Autoblog)

HEADLINE: A Deadline Missed

BYLINE: JANE GROSS


HIGHLIGHT: More than a month has passed since home care workers were to have been given minimum-wage protections. 

 BODY:
Legions of home health aides continue to toil for less than minimum wage, the only American workers not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. More than a month has passed since May 14, when President Obama could have ended this exclusion and, with the stroke of a pen, forced a new regulation into effect. All legal deadlines and extensions in this sclerotic regulatory process have been exhausted. 
Of course, this is not the only federal regulation in limbo. Executive inaction has left many significant rules, which the administration had called a priority, awaiting action long past legal deadlines. The number has risen sharply since 2011 because of a variety of factors, including high-level job vacancies and election-year politicking.
Federal records show that the Obama administration was on pace with previous administrations - already a very low bar - in its first three years. But in 2012, an election year with the economy the focus, the number of rules issued dropped to the lowest since the complex process was initiated in 1993.
Deane Beebe, media relations director for PHI, which advocates for the home care workers, confirmed in an interview that "the regulatory process is one with a timetable and deadlines'' but "no teeth,'' absent executive action. "Obama can indeed speed up this process to make issuing the final rule finally happen,'' she added.
The president's original choice to run the office reviewing proposed regulations, Cass Sunstein, resigned last August, succeeded by an interim director. The choice for permanent replacement, Howard A. Shelanski, now the top economist at the Federal Trade Commission, acknowledged at his confirmation hearings last week that the backlog was unacceptable, thwarting Mr. Obama's policies and failing to meet the standards of a 1993 executive order by President Clinton meant to streamline the process.
A rule change would benefit more than three million aides and countless clients. As the population ages, the need for these workers is expected to grow to 1.6 million by 2020. At the moment, though, nearly half of these aides are so poorly paid they must rely on public benefits like food stamps.

HEADLINE: Consumers Help Slow Growth in Health Spending

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Growth in health care spending is expected to slow next year, a new report finds. 

 BODY:
Growth in health care spending is expected to slow next year, in part because of a shift in consumer behavior, a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers's Health Research Institute predicts. 
The institute, the research arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers's health care consulting practice, forecasts overall medical inflation of 6.5 percent in 2014 - down from the institute's estimate of 7.5 percent for this year. The growth rate - which reflects changes in the actual cost to treat patients, and is influenced mostly by the cost of products and services as well as the number of services used - is often a crucial factor used by insurance companies in setting health insurance premiums.
The estimate is based on medical costs in the large employer market, which covers about 150 million Americans who have insurance through their jobs.
The net growth in spending - after employers tweak their packages of health benefits, such as by raising deductibles for workers - is expected to be about 4.5 percent.
The slower growth is notable, said Ceci Connolly, the institute's managing director, because in the early 1990s, double-digit medical inflation was the norm. But changes in the health care delivery system - some driven by consumers, who are bearing more of the cost of their medical care - as well as some provisions of the new Affordable Care Act, are helping to slow the rate of increase.
As employers have shifted health care costs to workers by increasing their deductibles - the portion of care they must pay for, before their plan starts paying - consumers are becoming more interested in prices. "When consumers move into high deductible plans, they behave differently," Ms. Connolly said. "They're starting to become savvy shoppers."
They are asking, for instance, whether care can be provided at a retail clinic rather than at a hospital, and requesting lower-cost generic drugs.
When the recession began, consumers started to cut back on medical care or to seek lower-cost options, like retail medical clinics, Ms. Connolly said. But even as the economy has improved, consumers have stuck with the clinics, which typically offer convenient hours as well as lower cost, she said.
According to the report, a visit to a retail clinic costs about $76, compared with about $120 for a visit to a traditional physician's office.
Consumers are likely to continue seeking more affordable ways to get care, since medical costs aren't falling, they're just not going up as fast. Patients can also expect to get more direction from their employers about where to seek medical care, as companies contract directly with "high-value" health systems - those that are seen as delivering quality care at lower cost - to treat their covered employees who need complex care, like heart surgery, the report found.
Have you altered the way you seek medical care because of rising costs? What changes have you made?

HEADLINE: Brazil Cement Giant Is Said to Cancel Planned I.P.O.

BYLINE: DAN HORCH


HIGHLIGHT: Brazil&#8217;s largest cement producer, Votorantim Cimentos, was expected to raise as much as $4.7 billion in what would have been one of the largest I.P.O.&#8217;s globally in 2013. 

 BODY:
Brazil's largest cement producer, Votorantim Cimentos, canceled its multibillion-dollar initial public offering on Tuesday amid worsening market conditions, a person closely involved with the operation said. 
The I.P.O. was expected to raise as much as $4.7 billion in shares offered both on the BM&F Bovespa in São Paulo and the New York Stock Exchange. It would have been one of the largest offerings anywhere in the world for 2013.
"Investors were offering less than the target price range. The company would not consider that possibility even for a moment," said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Since the I.P.O. was announced May 31, the main São Paulo stock index, the Ibovespa, has fallen more than 7.5 percent in Brazilian currency and more than 9 percent when converted to dollars. Since then, the Central Bank of Brazil has had to intervene repeatedly to support the currency.
Emerging markets in general have suffered from speculation that the Federal Reserve will reduce its monetary easing, potentially reducing global liquidity available.
The target price range of the deal was 16 to 19 reais for shares in São Paulo and $15.59 to $18.51 per American depositary receipt that would have represented one common and two preferred shares.
The deal had been expected to be priced on Wednesday, with the first day of trading scheduled for Thursday.
Eduardo Carlier, a portfolio manager with Schroder Investment Management Brazil, said that from the start, Votorantim Cimentos was looking for a price that he considered "a little too high." As market conditions worsened in recent days, the owners' target range became impossible.
"The company is very good; the question has always been about the price," Mr. Carlier said.
Brazil's economy is expected to grow only 2.5 percent this year, and investors are losing confidence that the government has a realistic plan for sustainable growth.
Six I.P.O.'s have been held in Brazil so far in 2013, including the biggest one in the world to date this year, when the insurance giant BB Seguridade raised $5.74 billion at the end of April.
Votorantim Cimentos's I.P.O. is the first to be canceled in Brazil this year. The person involved in the operation said the company had not yet decided whether it would try to go to the market again later this year.
Itaú BBA, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Securities, Credit Suisse, BTG Pactual, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Banco Bradesco BBI, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, Banco do Brasil and Banco Votorantim were listed as the underwriters of the offering.

HEADLINE: British Commission Calls for New Laws to Prosecute Bankers for Fraud

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: As part of a 600-page report, the British parliamentary commission on banking standards is urging new laws that would make it a criminal offense to recklessly mismanage local financial institutions. 

 BODY:
LONDON - British lawmakers are calling for criminal prosecutions of senior bankers who cause the collapse of financial institutions, as Parliament is set to undertake a major overhaul of the country's banking sector.
The lawmakers, which were part of the British parliamentary commission on banking standards created last year in response to a series of scandals, outlined plans for greater responsibility over how British banks were managed in a report published on Wednesday in London.
The commission includes senior figures from the British establishment, including the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and a former chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Some of the recommendations will be incorporated into proposed banking legislation that is expected to come into effect next year. 
British banks have faced savage criticism from politicians and the public after a series of scandals cast doubt on London's reputation as a center of global finance.
Regulators in Britain, the United States and elsewhere have uncovered wrongdoing at the majority of the country's largest financial institutions, including HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. The investigations into the trading scandals and the continued high pay for some of Britain's bankers have also led to widespread public anger and calls for more regulation.
"Recent scandals have exposed shocking and widespread malpractice," said Andrew Tyrie, a British politician who leads the banking commission. "Taxpayers and customers have lost out. The economy has suffered. Trust in banking has fallen to a new low."
After questioning leading global bankers and regulators, including Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, the British lawmakers laid out a series of controversial reforms aimed at improving accountability at the country's largest banks.
Central to the overhaul are recommendations to make it a criminal offense to recklessly mismanage local financial institutions.
The move follows the multibillion-dollar government bailouts of the Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland after the firms' senior management carried out a number of mistimed acquisitions and profligate lending that led to major losses for the British lenders.
By aiming at senior executives for criminal charges related to financial mismanagement, British lawmakers said the new legislation would force bankers to be less cavalier with risky trading and lending activities.
"The fact that recklessness in carrying out professional responsibilities carries a risk of a criminal conviction and a prison sentence would give pause for thought to the senior officers of U.K. banks," the British banking commission said.
In a statement, the British government welcomed the lawmakers' recommendations, adding that some of the changes would be incorporated into banking legislation being written by lawmakers.
The 600-page report also took aim at the culture at many of the banks operating in London. The British politicians said that excessive bonuses, high-risk trading strategies and an assumption that taxpayers would bail out lenders continued to prevail in London's financial district. The attitude still permeates even as many banks have announced drastic job cuts in the wake of the financial crisis.
To counter these problems, the lawmakers called for changes to how bankers were paid, including the use of long-term financial incentives and potential clawbacks of compensation packages following illegal behavior.
"A lack of personal responsibility has been commonplace throughout the industry," said Mr. Tyrie, the British politician. "Senior figures have continued to shelter behind an accountability firewall."
The European Union has already announced plans to cap bankers' bonuses that will begin with 2014 payouts. And many banks across the Continent have changed how they pay top earners to focus on the long-term effects of their financial decisions.
Yet since the financial crisis began, several British banks have been unable to rescind large payouts to either senior executives or midlevel traders who carried out risky activity that led to major losses at the financial institutions.
Public anger in Britain has focused on Fred Goodwin, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, who received a large retirement package despite overseeing the near collapse of the British lender. Mr. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood last year in light of his role in the fiasco.
Many British bankers, according to the lawmakers' report, remain too focused on securing large payouts for themselves, and do not think about the consequences of their actions on the wider society.
"Banking culture has all too often been characterized by an absence of any sense of collective responsibility to uphold the reputation of the industry," the parliamentary commission's report said.
As part of the proposed major overhaul, the British politicians also called for assigning specific responsibilities to banks' senior manager in a bid to increase accountability when problems arise.
In a number of recent scandals, including the attempted manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, top executives at some of Britain's leading banks denied knowing that the activities had taken place.
The parliamentary banking commission's report comes ahead of a major speech by George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who will outline changes to the banking sector on Wednesday.
The future of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds is expected to be high on the agenda, as investors and analysts expect the government to start selling its stakes in the banks as early as next year.
In their banking report, the British lawmakers said that the Royal Bank of Scotland, which remains 81 percent owned by taxpayers, could benefit by separating the toxic assets from the firm's healthy retail banking operations. They also called for an analysis to be conducted by the end of September to potentially divide R.B.S. into two units.
Analysts, however, say the potential breakup of the bank remains unlikely, as the British government still favors selling its entire holding in the lender in a privatization process that could take the rest of the decade.
"R.B.S. continues to be weighed down by uncertainty over the government as its main shareholder," the politicians said in the report. "Such problems for one of the U.K.'s largest banks weaken confidence and trust in banks."

HEADLINE: A Reality Check on a Plan for a Swift Post-Fossil Path for New York

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A journal that published an ambitious plan for New York State to go fossil free in a few decades now runs a critique. 

 BODY:
Energy Policy, the journal that recently published a paper laying out an ambitious plan to end fossil fuel use in New York State within a few decades, has now published a short critique by four researchers in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University.
The New York energy analysis, led by Mark Jacobson of Stanford University, has become a popular talking point among foes of expanded natural gas drilling in the state. When it was published, I noted that it was more akin to a thought experiment than a roadmap, given that the analysis did not consider real-world sources of friction from economics and politics. 
The new paper describes a mix of technical and policy factors that the authors say were skirted by Jacobson et al.
[Sept. 5, 3:50 p.m.: The journal has now posted a staunch defense of the original work and by Jacobson and his co-authors.]
[June 22, 9:42 a.m.: Jacobson and his co-authors have posted a blistering response.]
Read on for a summary of the main points by Nate Gilbraith, the lead author, and Paulina Jaramillo, who directs the school's RenewElec Project, which works to identify and overcome hurdles to integrating renewable energy sources like wind and solar panels into electricity grids: 
The general message of our response is threefold. First, reliability is an important aspect to consider when designing future energy systems. Current energy systems provide much more than the total amount of energy we consume - these energy systems meet power demand (the rate we consume energy) and we, among many others, argue that potential energy systems must measure up in terms of meeting power demand. While the distinction between energy (e.g., the amount of chemical energy in a gallon of gasoline) and power (how fast the chemical energy in that gallon of gasoline is consumed) seems like a topic only engineers would quarrel over, this distinction is crucial for energy systems. Constraints on the rate at which energy can be provided are extremely common in energy systems. For example, only so much natural gas can be pushed through a given sized pipe and only so much electricity can be transmitted thought a given sized transmission line. It is important to recognize these constraints because energy systems provide or enable almost every aspect of a modern economy, and the consequences of an energy systems failure (e.g., a power outage) are dramatic.
A second issue relates to cost. A complete energy transition to water, solar and wind would require significant infrastructure investments in order to guarantee a reliable supply of energy. While Jacobson et al. provided a high level discussion about the economics of a wind, water, and solar energy system, they did not provide enough detail on the methods and data they used to provide a convincing argument that the transition will not be extremely costly. The absence of a cost estimate for the proposed hydrogen infrastructure was a striking example of the oversimplifications we believe were made.
Finally, energy systems must balance the value of energy with the consequences of energy production and consumption - is a change feasible? While accounting for the likely and potential impacts of global climate change should be taken into account when making energy systems decisions, many other considerations also exist. A thorough accounting of how such considerations interact is key to planning our future energy systems. A salient example can be seen in the Adirondacks. (You recently highlighted how the Adirondacks represented a balance between human and natural systems.) [ link ]
The people of New York have decided they value the (known and unknown) benefits that a wilderness landscape provides. We argue that we should at least consider the impacts of developing this wilderness landscape relative to the reduced risk of damages to other human and wilderness landscapes (Jacobson et al. state that New York's energy transition is necessary to prevent a collapse of the Arctic ice sheets). If Jacobson et al. did make such considerations, they were not clear (i.e., discussed) in the paper.
Here's the abstract and a link to the rebuttal, "Comments on Jacobson et al.'s proposal for a wind, water, and solar energy future for New York State," published by the Carnegie Mellon team:
In a recent paper published in Energy Policy by Jacobson et al. (2013) [ link ], the authors claim that it is "feasible" that the entirety of New York State's (NYS) energy consumption could originate from wind, water, and solar sources by 2030. The current paper is similar to several papers that the authors previously published regarding the use of wind and solar resources to meet global energy demands (Delucchi and Jacobson, 2011; Jacobson and Delucchi, 2011). Like Trainer (2012, 2013), we suggest that the analysis performed by Jacobson et al. (2013) is insuf\xAC\x81cient to provide a reasonable defense of this claim. In an energy systems context, three metrics have emerged to evaluate the feasibility of proposed policies or actions: technical potential, economic potential, and social potential. The technical criterion outlines the limits of what current or likely future technology could achieve given no other constraints (e.g. ignoring the cost of the technology). The economic criterion limits action to what is economically viable; for example, in many cases only actions that provide a positive net present value are likely to be adopted. Finally, the social criterion poses additional constraints and considerations due to society's values.
The feasibility analysis performed by Jacobson et al. (2013) is incomplete and scienti\xAC\x81cally questionable from both the technical and economic perspectives, and it implicitly assumes, without suf\xAC\x81cient justi\xAC\x81cation, that social criterion would not produce even larger feasibility barriers.
For convenience, here's a link to the original paper:

HEADLINE: Maxine Stuart, 94, Actress on 'Edge of Night'

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Maxine Stuart's stage, film and television career spanned more than six decades, including a recurring role on the soap opera ''The Edge of Night'' and a guest spot on a memorable episode of ''The Twilight Zone.''
But she was equally well known to readers of Helene Hanff's nonfiction books ''84, Charing Cross Road'' and ''Underfoot in Show Business'' as Ms. Hanff's deliciously dizzy sidekick in their attempts to make it on Broadway in the 1930s and '40s. 
Ms. Stuart, who died on June 6 at 94, makes several cameo appearances in ''84,'' as the book is known to its ardent fans. First published in 1970, it is an epistolary memoir of Ms. Hanff's long correspondence with the staff of a London bookshop. (In the 1987 film version of the book, starring Anne Bancroft as Ms. Hanff, Ms. Stuart is played by Jean De Baer.)
In ''Underfoot,'' Ms. Stuart is a genuine co-star. That book, published in 1962, recounts Ms. Hanff's years in New York as a struggling playwright in tandem with Ms. Stuart's as a struggling actress.
The warm, adventurous, impecunious friendship of the two young women began in the late 1930s in the backstage ladies' room of the Morosco Theater, after Ms. Hanff saw one of the many flops in which Ms. Stuart seemed condemned to appear.
Her description of Ms. Stuart's daily life -- the voice and diction lessons (which entailed screaming ''Oh, NO!'' at top volume in the bathroom of her parents' apartment); the audition rounds; the elation of being cast; the deflation of closing -- is a window onto the existence of a working, and sometimes out-of-work, actor in the years before television devoured Broadway.
The book is also a visitors' manual to a vanished New York -- the New York of Schrafft's, the Automat and residential hotels for nice young women -- in which it was actually possible to live by the young Ms. Stuart's credo, ''Nothing should cost anything.''
In Ms. Stuart's resourceful hands, even Broadway cost nothing. Several nights a week, the two friends, wearing no coats, would arrive at a theater of their choice in time for the Act 1 intermission.
On the sidewalk, they mingled with audience members who had gone outside to smoke. (Even in the coldest weather, no self-respecting New York theatergoer on a cigarette break bothered with a coat.)
Drifting inside, the young women made for the best seats without coats on them and sat down. They saw many plays -- minus the first acts -- and caught many colds.
Maxine Shlivek was born on June 28, 1918, in Deal, N.J., and reared in Lawrence, on Long Island, and Manhattan.
Her film credits include ''Days of Wine and Roses'' (1962) and ''Private Benjamin'' (1980). On television, she portrayed the stenographer Grace O'Keefe on ''The Edge of Night.''
Ms. Stuart was seen on dozens of other shows, including ''Perry Mason,'' ''Dr. Kildare,'' ''Chicago Hope'' and ''The Wonder Years,'' for which she received a 1989 Emmy nomination as Kevin's piano teacher.
She had a pivotal guest role in ''Eye of the Beholder,'' a ''Twilight Zone'' episode first broadcast in 1960. Ms. Stuart played a hospital patient -- her face, never seen, is swathed in bandages -- who endures repeated failed operations in an attempt to correct her freakish appearance.
When the bandages are removed, doctors pronounce the latest operation a failure too. The patient's face is disclosed to be that of a beautiful woman, from that point on played by Donna Douglas. The doctors and nurses are revealed to have hideous, porcine faces.
That Ms. Stuart was deemed not pretty enough to play the unveiled patient in a show about beauty as a socially constructed concept was an irony not lost on her, she said in interviews.
After a brief early marriage that ended in divorce, Ms. Stuart married Frank Maxwell, an actor. Their marriage ended in divorce; Ms. Stuart's third husband, David Shaw, a playwright and screenwriter, died in 2007.
Ms. Stuart is survived by three daughters, Chris Ann Maxwell, who confirmed her mother's death, at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.; Ellen Shaw Agress; and Liz Shaw Baron; four grandchildren; and a great-grandchild. Ms. Hanff died in 1997, at 80.
Before moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s, Ms. Stuart made repeated, if short-lived, outings on the New York stage.
''Maxine appeared in 11 Broadway plays, most of which opened on a Tuesday night,'' Ms. Hanff wrote. ''On Wednesday came the flop notices, on Thursday an empty house, on Friday the closing notice went up, on Saturday the show closed and on Sunday Maxine slept it off.''
''And so, on Monday,'' Ms. Hanff continued, ''she was once more to be found in her parents' apartment on West End Avenue ready to resume the normal daily life of a glamorous young actress by screaming 'Oh, NO!' in the bathroom.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Place To Call His Own

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Ludo Lefebvre was always the chef without a restaurant, though it did not seem to have hurt him any. For six years, he commandeered empty spaces across Los Angeles as stages for the pop-up restaurants he called LudoBites, quick runs that lasted a few weeks or months. He built a base of intensely loyal fans who stormed the reservation line at the first whisper of the next LudoBites incarnation.
But at age 42, Mr. Lefebvre, a father of 2-year-old twins who lives in suburban Sherman Oaks, is settling down in a restaurant he won't have to pack up in three months, renting an old pizza parlor off Melrose Avenue. It is part of a striking collaboration with Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Animal, a nose-to-tail restaurant buzzing every night with, for the most part, hipster food enthusiasts. 
Trois Mec, with its name intentionally misspelled, is being closely watched as a sign of changing restaurant tastes in this ever-churning food city. It was Mr. Lefebvre, a classically trained French chef with wrist-to-elbow tattoos that include the names of his children, who pioneered the notion that a chef (a contestant on ''Iron Chef'' and ''Top Chef Masters,'' no less) did not need a brick-and-mortar restaurant. Mr. Shook and Mr. Dotolo, meanwhile, have been the champions of unpretentious if ambitious small-plate dining.
This new restaurant embodies the argument of these three chefs (the Trois Mec, or three guys) that eating sensibilities are changing, that a brightening economy and the maturing of their clients have prompted a desire for more cultivated dining. Not white tablecloth, but certainly less casual.
''Sometimes I think it's gotten too casual,'' said Mr. Lefebvre (pronounced le-FEV). ''We need to bring a little more refinement back into the restaurant industry. I want good service. I want good hospitality. But in a casual way. Like you're in a kitchen.''
''I think fine dining rooms are coming back,'' he said. ''People want to have a good experience when they go to restaurants now. Not a froufrou like a three-star Michelin restaurant. But people want an experience.''
Trois Mec is easing back to a formality in cooking and presentation that is more Burgundy than Berkeley. ''This is something new for us,'' Mr. Shook said. ''The service. The reservations. The food. The tasting menu only.''
There are no small dishes. There are no choices; rather, a set five-course menu cooked by Mr. Lefebvre. And a reservation alone is not enough: diners are required to pay in advance the $97 cost of the meal, which includes tax and tip but not wine.
The other night, the restaurant staff seemed to outnumber the diners, a suggestion of the caliber of service promised. ''Everyone in here is a professional food person,'' said Krissy Lefebvre, Mr. Lefebvre's wife and muse. ''We don't have any actors, we don't have any part-time people.'' The wine list is offbeat French (no California pinots here), and most of the bottles are priced considerably north of $100. Mr. Lefebvre has given up cooking in a T-shirt, bringing back the traditional white chef's jacket.
''I'm French, I'm French,'' he said. ''I forgot where I was from.''
This does not mean he's a modern-day André Soltner. Trois Mec has 24 seats, 8 of them at a counter. ''You can hear the dish machine while you are here for dinner,'' Mr. Dotolo said.
The restaurant is tucked away at the back of a glum blot of a strip mall that it shares with Yum Yum Donuts and Tasty Thai. The sign over its frosted windows is a holdover from the last tenant, Raffallo's Pizza, in all its yellow-and-red garish glory. That night, patrons waited for their table on the sidewalk, across the street from a gas station, enduring the bleating of a car alarm at the restaurant's front door.
Inside, there was quiet, intimate elegance. Diners and cooks shared the same small, mostly candlelit space, with white marble floors and a wall of mirrors letting everyone see the kitchen (where Mr. Lefebvre scolds his sous-chefs on some nights, in his best television-chef manner).
Mr. Lefebvre moved quickly in front of his grill and burners, and joined his waiters in delivering dishes to the table in the kind of four-plates-down-at-once synchronized service reminiscent of a French Michelin-rated restaurant.
The background music was French rap.
The restaurant had barely opened when Jonathan Gold, the restaurant critic for The Los Angeles Times, put it on his list of the top 101 restaurants in town. ''There could not be a less convenient way to dine,'' Mr. Gold wrote. ''But it may be worth the trouble to get into Trois Mec.'' He went on to describe Mr. Lefebvre as ''one of the greatest pure chefs ever to cook in Los Angeles.'' LA Weekly gave it four stars.
Mr. Lefebvre described his food as a celebration of the more traditional French cooking of his youth, though this was only partly true. Dinner began with a rush of a half-dozen amuse-bouches, including a crunchy cup of toasted buckwheat popcorn to scoop up with your fingers or drink from the cup in which it was served.
There was butter-poached white asparagus from the Netherlands, served with chicken wing confit, English peas and a dab of chicken liver mousse. A carrot was blackened on the kitchen grill and dashed with a bracing sauce of orange juice, vinegar and curry on a plate napped with yogurt. A pulped potato was vibrant with Salers cheese cut from a wheel the chef had shown off the day before in his small walk-in refrigerator, and sprinkled with bonito and onion soubise.
Mr. Lefebvre prepared a grilled rib cap in an earthy shallot broth, topped with fermented black walnuts. ''That's what I want to cook,'' he said. ''Very natural. Super natural.'' At that, his wife's eyebrows shot up and she assumed her role as public relations counselor and interpreter. (Mr. Lefebvre speaks with a heavy accent.)
''But not natural, tree-hugger natural,'' she told him.
Mr. Lefebvre appeared confused.
''You need to be careful because it's going to sound like you are opening one of those vegan health places,'' she said.
They both grimaced.
Mr. Shook and Mr. Dotolo have worked with Mr. Lefebvre on other projects, including a night at Animal devoted entirely to dishes with foie gras, a protest against what was at the time the impending ban on the use of that ingredient in California. With their restless energy and carefully cultivated cutting-edge images, they are surely among the most influential restaurateurs in this city these days.
Mr. Shook and Mr. Dotolo worked with Mr. Lefebvre in developing the concept of a restaurant, ''trying to think what L.A. needs, what L.A. is lacking,'' Mr. Shook said. Their three names on the marquee reflect the kind of sure-footed marketing sense of a culinary supergroup, a chef's version of the band Cream.
Thus a name for their restaurant nodding to their collaboration, though as any high school French student knows, it is grammatically incorrect: trois (which means three) calls for the plural mecs. But Ms. Lefebvre said she was concerned that if it were spelled that way, customers would mispronounce it ''Trois Mex.''
Mr. Shook and Mr. Dotolo are renowned for menus honoring meat and fat, but that affection is hard to discern here. Mr. Lefebvre is the main culinary force, though he said Mr. Dotolo was instrumental in conceiving the carrot dish -- which, Mr. Lefebvre said, his customers love. (''People are freaking out over it,'' he said.)
Mr. Lefebvre clearly enjoys having, at last, a restaurant to call his own. He said he more or less stumbled onto the idea of pop-ups after he took over a restaurant space to cater a dinner. He quickly realized the benefits: almost no overhead meant minimizing risks and maximizing profits.
It took longer to realize the disadvantages. You do not have to be a professional chef to know the strain of trying to cook an ambitious meal in someone else's kitchen.
''I am finished, I am tired of that,'' Mr. Lefebvre said. ''Finally I go every day in my kitchen and everything is in the same place, the same stuff. It's my house. I don't live in a hotel anymore.''

HEADLINE: In Partisan Vote, House Approves Ban on Abortions After 22 Weeks

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday approved the most restrictive ban on abortion considered by Congress in a decade, a largely symbolic vote that laid bare the deep ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans.
The measure, which would ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the medically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development are capable of feeling pain, passed in a 228-to-196 vote that broke down mostly along party lines. Reflecting how little common ground the two parties share these days, just six Republicans voted against the bill; six Democrats voted for it.
''I'm not waging a war on anyone,'' said Kristi Noem, Republican of South Dakota, offering a rejoinder to the Democratic assertion that Republicans have waged a war on women, a line of attack that harmed conservative candidates in 2012. ''Regardless of your personal beliefs, I would hope that stopping atrocities against little babies is something we can all agree to put an end to.'' 
The bill has no chance in the Democrat-controlled Senate and was put forward by the House Republican leadership in response to demands from anti-abortion lawmakers.
The tableau in the House chamber on Tuesday was intentionally far different from the scene last week at a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee at which all 19 of the Republicans arguing for and then voting to approve the bill were men. Republican leaders made sure that their female members were front and center for the debate this time.
Representative Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina conservative and Tea Party favorite, and Representative Marsha Blackburn, a longtime abortion opponent from Tennessee, were assigned to manage the floor debate. Representative Candice S. Miller of Michigan and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, one of the Republican conference's more moderate members, controlled the gavel.
But the simple math was difficult to ignore. Only 19 of the 234 Republican House members are women. Nearly all of them spoke on Tuesday. Only three Republican men were allowed to participate in the debate. Notably, Trent Franks of Arizona, the bill's sponsor who last week caused an uproar after claiming that instances of pregnancy after rape were ''very low,'' said nothing from the floor.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, brought with her a blown-up photo of the Republican side of the room during last week's Judiciary Committee meeting. Gesturing to it with her hand, she cried out, ''Where were the women?''
As politically charged as the debate was, it was also at times heavy with emotion. Ms. Foxx nearly broke down in tears at one point.
''May we mourn what abortion reveals about the conscience of our nation,'' she said, her voice quivering as she noted that none of her colleagues had acknowledged that half of those aborted are female. ''We go to extraordinary lengths to save not only human beings but even animals because we value life so much. However, there are many who do not hold the unborn in the same esteem.''
Even if Democrats believed the political upper hand was theirs as they used the issue of reproductive rights to portray their opponents yet again as hostile and indifferent to the needs of women, it was clear that the question at hand -- the termination of pregnancies that are five months or more along -- was an uncomfortable one.
At a news conference Tuesday morning led by Democrats who favor abortion rights, the mood quickly turned tense after two journalists tried to press the representatives about their support for late-term abortions. Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado cut off questions after being asked whether she would draw the line at legal abortion later in pregnancy. ''The Supreme Court has spoken, and this bill is unconstitutional. Next question,'' she said.
The debate was marked by graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and medical claims. Representative Michael C. Burgess, a Texas Republican who practiced as an obstetrician before joining Congress, appeared to suggest that male fetuses are capable of fondling themselves.
''They have movements that are purposeful,'' Mr. Burgess said during a debate of the bill during the House Rules Committee meeting on Monday. ''They stroke their face. If they're a male baby, they may have their hand between their legs. I mean, they feel pleasure, why is it so hard to think that they could feel pain?''
Democrats used the debate to mock Republicans' claims that their focus was on the economy and job growth. They repeatedly interrupted the floor proceedings to make rhetorical jabs that were masked as parliamentary inquiries, like asking when the House was scheduled to take up the student loan interest rate bill or why a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee was not managing debate on the bill, which is customary.
''Another day without a jobs bill, another day without a budget agreement, another day ignoring the top priorities of the American people,'' said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader. ''Once again Republicans refuse to listen.''
Speaker John A. Boehner called the legislation ''the most significant pro-life legislation to come before Congress since enactment of the ban on partial-birth abortions. We have a moral obligation to defend the defenseless, and we will continue to fight to ensure our nation's laws respect the sanctity of unborn human life.''

HEADLINE: Boeing Takes Airlines' Orders for Longer Dreamliner

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
LE BOURGET, France -- Boeing said on Tuesday that it had formally committed to building a stretched version of its flagship 787 Dreamliner jet after receiving firm orders for 102 of the planes from five airlines and leasing companies.
The announcement gives the American plane maker orders for the new version worth more than $29 billion at list prices, a welcome bit of news for the Dreamliner program after troubles with its lightweight but volatile lithium-ion batteries grounded the entire 787 fleet for three months this year. 
Boeing made its announcement on the second day of the Paris Air Show, soon after an announcement by its European rival, Airbus, that it had secured an $11.5 billion commitment from the British budget airline easyJet to purchase at least 135 of its smaller A320 single-aisle planes.
Boeing's latest Dreamliner, known as the 787-10, is designed to seat as many as 330 passengers, compared with the 210 to 290 seats on the models currently in production, and is meant to compete directly with the largest version of Airbus's A350-XWB, which made its inaugural flight last week but is not due to enter service until late 2014.
Air Lease Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday for 30 of the new versions. United Airlines, which already has six 787s in its fleet and has ordered at least 25 more, converted 10 of its existing orders into 787-10s and placed 10 new orders for the stretch version.
GE Capital Aviation Services, another lessor, firmed up a previously announced commitment for 10 planes and Singapore Airlines for 30. British Airways said it would buy 12 planes, subject to the approval of its shareholders.
Such a large initial order book for the 787-10 suggested that a bigger Dreamliner was overdue, analysts said.
''This is a highly unusual example of the market launching a plane rather than the company,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''This plane is off to a very solid start.''
Boeing said it planned to begin deliveries of the 787-10 in 2018, just after Airbus says it expects to deliver the first 350-seat version of its A350, in 2017.
The competition between Boeing and Airbus in the market for wide-body jets in the 300-to-400-seat category has intensified as the nascent global economic recovery encourages airlines to invest in larger, longer-range aircraft after several years of brisk purchases of single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.
With oil prices remaining stubbornly high, airlines are hoping to both replace older fuel-guzzling planes with newer models and maximize the number of passengers who can be carried on lucrative long-distance routes. ''That means getting the most you can get in terms of aircraft length and number of seats,'' Mr. Aboulafia said.
With a range of 7,000 nautical miles, or 13,000 kilometers, the larger 787 will not be able to fly as far as the A350 on a single tank of fuel; Airbus says the A350 will have a range of as many as 8,400 nautical miles. But Boeing argues that its plane will cost less to operate.
''The 787-10 is 25 percent more efficient than airplanes of its size today and more than 10 percent better than anything being offered by the competition for the future,'' said Raymond L. Conner, the chief executive of Boeing's commercial aircraft division.
Boeing also reached a deal on Tuesday to sell five more passenger versions of its revamped 747 jumbo jet to Korean Air, as well as six long-range 777s, in a deal valued at around $3.6 billion at list prices. The new version of the 747, known as the 747-8, entered service in 2011, but it has faced tepid interest from airlines, with only around 100 orders so far. Korean Air already had orders for five passenger versions and seven freighter versions of the 747-8.

HEADLINE: Spoils of the Sea Elude Many Alaskans In a Poverty Program

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and LEE VAN DER VOO

 BODY:
AKIAK, Alaska -- The humble pollock, great cash fish of the north, conquered the world through the flaky bland hegemony of a fish stick. At more than $1 billion a year, there is no bigger fishery for human consumption on the planet.
But pollock was also meant to be a savior, part of a Washington-backed antipoverty plan aimed at residents here on Alaska's mostly undeveloped west coast. A generation ago, organizers envisioned federally guaranteed shares of the pollock catch that would create a rising tide of funds to lift up poor, isolated villages where jobs and hope are scarce.
Pollock did succeed, wildly. The dollars that flowed into the Community Development Quota Program, as the catch-share system was called, created a hydra-headed nonprofit money machine. Six nonprofit groups arose on the Bering Sea shore, and they have invested mightily in ships, real estate and processing plants. Over two decades, the groups amassed a combined net worth of $785 million.
But the results on the ground, in rural community and economic development, have been deeply uneven, and nonexistent for many people who still gaze out to the blinking lights of the factory ships and wonder what happened. 
''You eat from one bowl,'' said Ivan M. Ivan, 67, chief of the native community here in Akiak, quoting the Yup'ik Eskimo cultural adage about shared resources. ''That didn't happen.''
Collectively, the groups created tens of thousands of jobs and scholarships in one of the poorest regions of the nation. But critics say that community development, over time, got lost in a push toward institutional sustainability -- and in some cases lavish salaries for leaders. Deregulation became self-regulation with a board of overseers appointed by the groups themselves the only real watchdog in recent years.
Meanwhile, a lopsided division of spoils among the groups has festered into a conflict that some Alaskans fear could unravel the catch-share project itself, which has done much good, they say, despite its flaws. In 2011, according to the most recent figures, one group with a small population got nearly 22 times more revenue per resident than another, larger group, based on allocation formulas locked in by Congress in 2006.
The fate of places like Akiak, a village of 350 people about 400 miles west of Anchorage, was dictated by a political compromise two decades ago, when a line was drawn 50 miles from the Bering Sea. Villages inside the line got pollock money. Akiak's rutted dirt roads and 80 percent unemployment rate, residents said, bespeak its outsider status, 20 miles from that border.
Residents of Napaskiak, by contrast, a village of similar size 24 miles away, get scholarships, free firewood, free tax assistance and subsidized boat motors, all courtesy of the local catch-share group, the Coastal Villages Region Fund, which also buys halibut and herring from local fishermen.
The rules were hard but necessary, said Dick Tremaine, an economist who was a consultant to the state in the early 1990s. ''This was a social engineering experiment that had not yet existed,'' he said.
But even communities within the line have seen uneven development.
The federal health clinic in the village of Teller, for example, in Alaska's northwest corner, went months without toilets last year after its septic system failed. Doctors and patients used five-gallon buckets instead, then stacked them in the street. Worse still, there were often not enough buckets to go around. Cardboard boxes, lined with plastic bags, then had to suffice.
Teller is not unique: 10 of 15 villages dotting the tundra along the Bering Sea outside of Nome -- all within the catch-share system -- do not have complete sewer service or running water.
''I can understand how C.D.Q.'s, in the early years, focused on the development of businesses,'' said Ed Backus, vice president for fisheries at Ecotrust, an economic development group in Portland, Ore., that works in Alaska, referring to the Community Development Quota Program. ''But over time as those revenue streams really bulked up, which they have, I think it's important to remember the main mission of C.D.Q.'s is to really improve life in the villages.''
Spokesmen for the nonprofit groups agreed that not every village has seen the same benefits.
Part of the problem is geography, said Simon Kinneen, vice president and chief operating officer of the Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation, which covers the northern corner of the catch-share region, including Teller. ''Developing fisheries and economies in our member communities that do not have reasonable access to commercially viable fish species is difficult at best,'' he said in an e-mail.
A spokesman for the Coastal Villages Region Fund, Dawson Hoover, conceded that much more work should be done.
Under that guise, Coastal Villages, the largest of the groups by population, with about 9,300 residents, began an effort last year to get Congress to change how pollock and other fish are apportioned in western Alaska -- to a formula based on population.
The shift would greatly increase Coastal's clout and income, and the effort is creating sharp conflict with other groups that could get less. ''The groups with the largest amount of people receive less fish per person,'' Mr. Hoover said. ''It's just not fair.''
Many native subsistence fishermen, meanwhile, say the pollock trawlers inadvertently catch too many salmon. Dozens were cited by state game wardens last summer -- and faced emotional legal proceedings this spring -- for setting their nets on the Kuskokwim River in violation of an emergency fishing ban.
Joe Garnie, a former mayor of Teller, and a board member of the Norton Sound group, said fairness depends on where you look. Imagine what might happen, he said, if a lack of plumbing had led to similar unsanitary conditions in a clinic in, say, Detroit. ''In 15 minutes there would be a federal investigation,'' he said. ''Why isn't there one here?''
Part of the answer to Mr. Garnie's question, is that the program grew up without a yardstick, according to people who were involved in its early years. And as each nonprofit group went its way, one-size-fits all measurements no longer applied.
Coastal Villages became a vertically integrated seafood company. The Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association, another catch-share group, developed a separate economic plan for each village. In Norton Sound, benefits were delivered mostly in the form of community grants and scholarships, sending hundreds of Alaskans to college every year and helping villages operate.
Federal rules are loose, requiring only that the groups spend 80 percent of their money in fisheries. And in 2006, Congress stepped back even further, allowing the groups to regulate themselves, with reviews from Washington every decade. But in the first 10-year review, even the self-regulating catch-share oversight board in Alaska said the data measuring changes in poverty and quality of life in the villages was not meaningful.
But there is no doubt that guaranteed pollock shares -- later extended to include, crab, pacific cod, halibut and other fish -- created a new empire. Coastal Villages now owns an entire fishing fleet based in Seattle and Alaska. The Bristol Bay group owns half of the seafood giant Ocean Beauty. The Glacier Fish Company, based in Seattle, is partly owned by fish-quota groups. Four groups also invested in publicly traded securities, totaling $134 million in 2011, or 28.8 percent of their net assets. Salaries for top executives, meanwhile, have ranged in recent years from $69,503 to $832,367.
The oversight board said in a recent report that in its first 19 years, the program distributed $521 million in wages, training and benefits. But the region's troubles drag on. Of 65 communities within the 50-mile boundary, including Teller, 38 are still listed as ''distressed'' at the Denali Commission, a federal agency that focuses on Alaska's remote communities.
Joel Neimeyer, co-chairman of the Denali Commission, said it would be impossible for one program to solve Alaska's rural problems. The process of giving people training for jobs, for example can, in a perverse way, create a brain drain that leaves communities ever more locked in struggle. People leave and get a taste of the outside world. ''A lot of them just never go back,'' Mr. Neimeyer said.
This article was written in cooperation with InvestigateWest, a nonprofit investigative journalism organization based in Seattle that covers the Pacific Northwest.

HEADLINE: Russian Space Center in Kazakhstan Counts Down Its Days of Glory

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan -- On a sultry desert evening, as bats fluttered about this town's riverfront park, a man emerged from a reedy marsh carrying a bundle of grass tied with twine.
Setting it down to brush himself off, he explained that he was keeping a calf in the courtyard of an apartment building across town, where he had settled in recently after the previous occupants, engineers with the Russian space program, moved out.
Baikonur, in remote western Kazakhstan, was once the pride of the Soviet Union, the home of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the launching site of Sputnik, the dog Laika and the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin. But today, nomadic herders from the nearby steppe are moving into abandoned buildings. 
That is just one of the signs of the city's long fade into the sunset of post-Soviet social and economic problems, which are all the more remarkable given that much of the world, including the United States, still relies on Baikonur for manned space launchings. The only other site for such liftoffs is in Jiuquan, in the Gobi Desert in China.
''It's painful for me to think of my town,'' Anna Khodakovskaya, the editor of the local newspaper, said of its glum state. The first cellphones appeared here in 2004; the first M.R.I. machine in 2011. ''We are not ahead of the planet in anything but space,'' she said.
Today 70 percent of Baikonur's residents are Kazakh citizens, but the town remains a Russian enclave rented from the Kazakh government and administered under Russian jurisdiction. At the time of the Soviet breakup, the ratios were reversed: it was only about one-third Kazakh.
Along with the squatting herders, day laborers and market traders stroll the streets, with only the occasional aging Russian engineer visible.
It is a dusty town, where many sidewalks are sandy tracks but nearly every building is decorated with a mosaic of a rocket, a spacewalking cosmonaut or stars and fanciful renderings of planets. In fountains, water bubbles from spouts shaped like rockets, and signed portraits of astronauts adorn the walls of cafes, where coffee is served in the Turkish style with grounds in the cup.
It is a loose end from the breakup of the Soviet Union that has, strangely, become extraordinarily important for every manned space program except China's.
NASA last month extended the contract for astronaut launchings for a year, until mid-2017, for an additional $424 million. For now, every American astronaut blasts off from this town, the stand-in for Cape Canaveral during a gap in funding for manned missions in the United States.
Because of this dependency, NASA now requires all its astronauts in training to achieve proficiency in Russian before graduating to the astronaut corps.
The space agencies of the European Union, Japan and Canada also launch from here on Russian rockets, under an agreement with NASA to repurchase about half of the six seats NASA buys annually from the Russians.
From all this, Baikonur may sound like a prosperous hub of space activity. But the state of affairs is only temporary -- every nation including Russia, which is building a replacement launchpad on its own territory in the Far East, called Vostochny, views this state of affairs as temporary. As a result, the city of Baikonur has been ignored, and it is falling apart.
''Russia will not be able to roll up the roads and take them away when it leaves,'' Ms. Khodakovskaya said.
Social problems typical of Central Asia today, like abuse of heroin smuggled from Afghanistan, labor migration and growing Islamic fundamentalism, are creeping into the city. A few years back, the police arrested men in Tura-Tam, a Kazakh village just outside Baikonur's guarded fence, for distributing leaflets for Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a fundamentalist Islamic group.
The town is a low boil of ethnic tension, too, as Russians hold nearly all the high-paying space jobs. In 2011, young Kazakh men ran in a mass down a central street yelling, ''The head is a dog,'' a reference to the Russian mayor.
At the outdoor market, behind heaps of apricots and tomatoes, traders flash gold-toothed smiles and hawk Central Asian pottery glazed with crudely drawn rockets, or the smiling face of Yuri Gagarin in a helmet. Flies sampled the savory pies of mutton and pumpkin on display.
Before space missions, NASA astronauts and administrators stay at an upscale hotel on the edge of town, where the cheapest room is about $340 a night, rarely venturing into the town.
NASA's interlude here is surreal, to be sure, though the United States has had gaps in its ability to reach space before: from the end of the Apollo program in 1975 until the first shuttle mission in 1981, and after both shuttle disasters.
''We have always been treated with tremendous hospitality under difficult logistical circumstances,'' Rob Navias, a NASA spokesman, said in an interview here before the launching of an American astronaut, Karen L. Nyberg, last month. ''We are in a transition period right now, and we are hoping the transition is a short one.''
American astronauts ride a bus to the Russian rockets over a rutted, bumpy road where camels graze on the shoulders; nobody bothers to fill the potholes.
Even President Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech on Cosmonaut Day on April 12, referred to Baikonur as ''physically aged.''
''These people are putting up rockets, but the town itself is like a third-world country,'' said Jene Ragan, a software engineer from Bethesda, Md., who came as a tourist to watch a liftoff in May, swatting at flying ants out on the steppe while watching the rollout of a rocket.
Alarmed at the state of Baikonur, the head of Kazakhstan's space agency, Talgat Musabayev, in December suggested canceling the rental agreement with Russia; Kazakhstan charges Russia $115 million a year for the town. ''The agreement has run its course,'' Mr. Musabayev said.
The Kazakhs bristle at Russia's efforts to keep Kazakh squatters out of abandoned buildings, which are formally Kazakh property, noting the housing shortage in the region. They complain of debris falling on their territory from jettisoned rocket stages.
In response, the Russians threatened to simply pull out entirely in 2018 when Vostochny is ready for manned launchings, Izvestia reported.

BYLINE: By ALISON SMALE

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The last time President Obama paid a visit here, as a candidate in 2008, he was cheered on by 200,000 Germans eager to see the back of George W. Bush and, as one member of that crowd recalled Tuesday, ''full of wholly unrealistic expectations of what kind of miracles Obama could work.''
When he arrived here on Tuesday evening ahead of a full day of talks -- capped by a speech at the Brandenburg Gate -- the reception was far more restrained. 
Almost five years later, Germans have undergone ''a brutal sobering up'' with regard to Mr. Obama, said Ralf Fücks, who heads the board of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, a nonprofit political organization in Berlin. It is, he said, as overdone as the euphoria of 2008, but also a bit alarming.
Mr. Fücks and other Germans say there are several reasons for the change in attitude. The most commonly cited: the president's inability to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, continued killings by American drones and, most recently, the disclosure of an extensive surveillance program of foreigners.
Experts also point to the limitations on the power of an American president and on a country like Germany, which is the dominant European power but whose 20th-century history makes it awkward for it to take a leadership role or guide the Continent out of its economic doldrums.
''The American president would like to remind the Germans of the crisis, and what the consequences are if we keep sitting on our hands,'' said Henning Riecke of the German Council on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Fücks noted the ''permanent state of crisis'' in the world economy and politics since Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. When there is ''constant pressure to act,'' he said, it is harder for a president -- or, for that matter, his host, Chancellor Angela Merkel -- to shape events and lay down guidelines for sweeping action.
The conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung was less charitable to the arriving president and his German fans. In an article from Washington by Matthias Rüb, headlined ''The Return of the Feted One,'' the newspaper likened Germans' relationship with Mr. Obama to a lopsided love affair in which the American politician had always reacted coolly and rationally to ''the irrational inclinations of a people in Central Europe.''
Daniel Hamilton, director of the Center for Transatlantic Relations at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins, said Americans and Europeans tended these days to roll their eyes at each other and lament the paralysis of the other side. Dr. Hamilton, who has spent the past seven weeks in Europe, echoed other commentators in noting that the agreement to open talks on a far-reaching trade deal -- one that would create a huge market operating on the same rules -- represents the best way for Americans and Europeans to put their closeness on a new footing.
To judge from interviews with Berliners, though, there is little interest in or understanding of the complex trade talks, which are just starting. Rather, the data surveillance scandal has fired the popular imagination here, guaranteeing that Ms. Merkel, up for re-election in September, will raise the matter with Mr. Obama.
It is not as if Internet users outside the United States did not know that their digital movements might be watched, said Patrick Conley, 47, a media historian who lives in Berlin. ''But you know it more exactly now,'' he said. ''In foreign policy terms, it is a catastrophe.''
That is particularly so in Germany, where state snooping was a dominant feature of the Nazi and Communist regimes. News that Facebook, which attracted 51 percent of German Internet users last year, according to the industry group Bitkom, had given up data to Washington's surveillance program was a special shock here.
Mr. Conley was in the crowd for Mr. Obama in 2008. While he remembers the jubilation close to the speaker's podium at the Victory Column, security forced him and his friends to sit in the surrounding park, far from the candidate, whom they watched on video screens.
The speech might have been electrifying close up, Mr. Conley said, but people near him drifted away before it finished. ''We noticed that it was written not so much for Germans as for voters back home in Ohio,'' he said.
Nonetheless, he and the same friends discussed going to hear Mr. Obama again on Wednesday, and were disappointed to discover that this time it was an invitation-only affair for about 5,000 people. ''That is a shame,'' Mr. Conley said.
Walther Stützle, a former editor of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, recalled the June day 50 years ago when tens of thousands thronged the Schöneberg district of West Berlin to hear President John F. Kennedy speak. There ''was no security madness like today,'' he said.
Onlookers, who idolized the young president, moved freely, Mr. Stützle said. And, he stressed, it was not just the Schöneberg speech -- in which Mr. Kennedy famously uttered, ''Ich bin ein Berliner'' -- that impressed people. His second speech at the Free University of Berlin persuaded Berliners that he was a shrewd judge of what the Soviets were willing to risk in the city where communism and capitalism directly confronted each other.
That cold war context makes a comparison between the Kennedy and Obama visits impossible, Mr. Stützle said. ''The threat of war today is in the Middle East,'' he noted, ''not in Berlin.''

HEADLINE: Obama Raises Possibility of Change at the Fed

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama suggested that he was likely to nominate a new Federal Reserve chairman later this year, saying in a television interview aired late Monday that the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had ''already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to.'' 
Mr. Obama praised Mr. Bernanke's leadership of the Fed, which has mounted an aggressive campaign to revive the economy over the last several years. His second term as chairman of the central bank runs through the end of January.
''Well, I think Ben Bernanke has done an outstanding job,'' Mr. Obama told the journalist Charlie Rose on PBS. He added later, ''He has been an outstanding partner along with the White House, in helping us recover much stronger than, for example, our European partners from what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.''
The president avoided a direct question about whether he would consider reappointing Mr. Bernanke. But the interview, taken together with recent comments by Mr. Bernanke, reinforces a growing expectation that the administration plans to nominate a new Fed chairman later this year. The Senate needs to approve the nomination. Only three people have held the position in the last 30 years, and the Obama administration has an opportunity to put a Democrat atop the central bank for the first time since the resignation of Paul Volcker in the late 1980s.
Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, is widely regarded as a leading candidate. She would become the first woman to head the Fed or any other major central bank. Other possible candidates include two former Obama advisers, Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence Summers, and Roger Ferguson, former Fed vice chairman.
Mr. Bernanke will probably face another round of questions about his own plans at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, following the end of a two-day meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee.
He has said that he will not attend an annual summer conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the first time in 25 years that the Fed chairman has skipped the event. And Mr. Bernanke, who has made a point throughout his tenure of pushing back against the cult of personality that enshrouded some of his predecessors, emphasized in March that he saw no need to stay until the Fed's stimulus campaign is over.
''I don't think that I'm the only person in the world who can manage the exit'' from the Fed's current policies, Mr. Bernanke said.

HEADLINE: New Effort To Quantify 'Social Cost' Of Pollution

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is making a second attempt to systematically account for the dollar damage from greenhouse gas pollution, even with no consensus on how to forestall global warming or whether to do so.
Supporters of the idea acknowledge the tremendous difficulties of trying to translate slippery estimates into a single mathematical factor, difficulties that perhaps help explain why there is little hope of consensus now on climate policy.
The new effort is an update to an estimate for the awkwardly named ''Social Cost of Carbon,'' a range of costs, stated in dollars per ton, that carbon dioxide emissions are thought to impose on future generations. When the government totes up costs and benefits for a variety of proposed regulations, the Social Cost of Carbon is plugged into the calculation to decide how to write the regulation. 
The new price, used for the first time last month in establishing a standard for energy efficiency in new microwave ovens, is 50 percent to 100 percent higher per ton than the one developed in 2010.
But precision is hard to come by. Some of these damages appear likely but hard to calibrate, like the extent of sea level rise. Others are less certain and thus stated as probabilities, like the increase in the number of Katrina-level hurricanes or sustained droughts, or changes that radically cut crop yields. Others are simply hard to put a dollar value on, like the extinction of species.
Another difficulty is how to put a value today on a price that will be paid by future generations, which is why the cost is stated in a range.
''There are multiple sources of uncertainty,'' said Nathaniel Keohane, a former special assistant to President Obama for energy and environment, and now a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. But, he said, the calculation is certainly a good idea.
''Information from climate science, and better understanding of what some of the impacts are, is slowly feeding its way into the economics modeling,'' he said.
The obscure nuts-and-bolts details of forming government policy are also unclear about just what this Social Cost of Carbon will apply to. It is supposed to be used when the government establishes new regulations, like appliance efficiency standards, or fuel economy standards.
Conservatives are saying that it could be used to make big energy projects like the Keystone XL pipeline look bad. (Although the government action needed there is a permit, not a rule, and so for the time being at least, the new calculation may not be applicable. Nonetheless, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a letter to the State Department in April that the State Department, in making its decision, should consider the social cost of increased carbon dioxide emissions.)
Another problem is valuing events that might not happen. ''The models are extremely limited in how they capture dangerous tipping points, and catastrophic outcomes,'' said Laurie Johnson, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Even in appliances, the applicability of the social cost of carbon is limited. Andrew deLaski, of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a Boston-based nonprofit group, said that a new standard could not be approved unless it was advantageous to the buyer.
In the case of microwaves, that would mean that the buyer would save more during the appliance's lifetime than the added cost of buying an efficient machine, and that other benefits like saving polar bears would not enter into the calculation.
In contrast, the Department of Transportation rules on car gas mileage relied on the Social Cost of Carbon -- under the old pricing system -- to reach the conclusion that doubling average fuel economy would more than pay for itself.
But ''this is a very generalized, inexact process,'' said William M. Bumpers, a lawyer who usually represents manufacturers in pollution cases. He applauded the standard, however. In climate change, ''there's uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of the problem, but there's no uncertainty of the problem,'' he said.
''The only real cost of carbon that I know is wrong is zero,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Pro-Clinton PAC Receives the Support Of a Key Obama Backer

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat and one of Barack Obama's first backers in the Senate in his bitter presidential primary fight against Hillary Rodham Clinton, threw her support on Tuesday to the political action committee pressing Mrs. Clinton to run for president.
''In 2008, I was an early supporter of then-Senator Obama's campaign,'' Ms. McCaskill said in a statement on the Ready for Hillary Web site. ''I worked my heart out to elect him president. Now as I look at 2016 and think about who is best to lead this country forward, I'm proud to announce that I am Ready for Hillary.'' 
The unusual declaration was not as much a presidential endorsement of Mrs. Clinton -- she had expressed that support earlier this year -- but an endorsement of a ''super PAC'' encouraging her to run. It was the first endorsement of the Ready for Hillary PAC by a sitting member of Congress, the group said.
Even as she was lending her name to the group's fund-raising efforts, Ms. McCaskill played down the significance of her action.
''It really is me wanting to be part of a large group of people that are urging her to run,'' she said in an interview. ''A lot of us are using every tool in our tool kit to try to convince her that she should step out and be the nominee of our party.''
Ms. McCaskill said she was assuming no position -- honorary or otherwise -- with Ready for Hillary.
Mrs. Clinton has given no public indication of her intentions, but the Democratic establishment has quietly been rallying around a presidential run. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, who succeeded Mrs. Clinton in the Senate when she became secretary of state, met with her recently to express support if she were to run. Ms. Gillibrand is often also mentioned as a possible presidential candidate.
At the same time, Republicans are increasingly turning their attention to Mrs. Clinton to try to tarnish her tenure at the State Department. In recent weeks, Congressional Republicans have striven to link Mrs. Clinton to the fatal attack on the United States Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and to other charges of mismanagement at the department.
''The nice thing about Hillary Clinton is this is not her first rodeo. She will be ready for the types of attacks that will come, and I think she'll weather them very well,'' Ms. McCaskill said.
Founded in January, the super PAC has attracted the support of Clinton family loyalists like James Carville, Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign manager, and Harold Ickes, a political strategist. Also in the fold are former Representative Ellen Tauscher, a California Democrat who served in the State Department under Mrs. Clinton, and Susie Tompkins Buell, a Democratic fund-raiser and a multimillionaire co-founder of Esprit clothing.
The group has organized enthusiastic rallies of support at virtually every public appearance of Mrs. Clinton. Around 50 supporters showed up to cheer on the former secretary of state on Monday night in Grand Rapids, Mich., a town with conservative leanings, where she was delivering a paid speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids.
''There's a groundswell around the country. That organization has really taken off,'' said Jennifer M. Granholm, a former Democratic governor of Michigan.
It is not yet clear how much has been raised by the super PAC, which can accept and spend unlimited amounts of money, because it is not required to file its first financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission until mid-July.
For Ms. McCaskill, the endorsement is also a chance to mend fences with the Clintons. Her support for Mr. Obama in 2008 helped him eke out a one-point victory in Missouri's primary.
Ms. McCaskill turned into a bit player in the long-running soap opera of the Clintons and Mr. Obama. During her first Senate campaign in 2006, Ms. McCaskill said she would not let her daughter be alone with former President Bill Clinton, an insult that led to a canceled Clinton fund-raiser for her campaign.
In 2008, during President George W. Bush's final State of the Union address, Mrs. Clinton approached Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who was standing on the House floor next to the man he had endorsed for president the day before, Mr. Obama. As she leaned in to shake Mr. Kennedy's hand, Mr. Obama appeared to turn his back on her. She called it a snub. He said he had not noticed his rival and was merely turning to talk to Ms. McCaskill.

HEADLINE: De Blasio Offers Ideas In Policy Book For Election

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Bill de Blasio wants to ensure that all students are reading at grade level by the third grade, and to develop at least 100 community schools modeled after the Harlem Children's Zone.
He would like to add more bus routes, especially to the Rockaways, and to add more bike lanes and an expanded bike-share program outside of Manhattan in an effort to double the number of bicyclists in the city.
He wants to create 20 primary health care clinics for city workers, near their offices, and to open 16 new community health clinics in the city's neediest neighborhoods. 
Those are among the highlights of a detailed policy book, ''One New York, Rising Together,'' that Mr. de Blasio, now the city's public advocate, is to release Wednesday as he continues to make the case that he should be elected mayor.
By design, a policy book is, together with the biographical video, part of a time-honored and carefully choreographed campaign strategy to define a candidate and increase one's name recognition among likely voters. That could be a boon to Mr. de Blasio, who is not as well known as some of his rivals vying in the Sept. 10 Democratic primary.
Mr. de Blasio's book tries to blend the new and the old: he offers proposals in 12 areas while also summarizing his record on those same issues as public advocate and, previously, as a member of the City Council representing Park Slope, Brooklyn.
At 69 pages, the book, which will also be released as a free e-book on Amazon, iTunes, Nook and Google Play, is the meatiest material presented by any candidate to date. Former Representative Anthony D. Weiner, another leading Democrat, released a 20-page pamphlet listing 64 ''Keys to the City.'' And Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, recently unveiled an Ideas app highlighting, in even shorter form, some proposals.
In an interview, Mr. de Blasio said, ''The people of the city deserve a clear articulation of each candidate's vision.'' He also jabbed subtly at Mr. Weiner and Ms. Quinn, saying: ''I would personally never have been satisfied with recycling past press releases or putting together a catchy plan that didn't respond to the challenges we face.''
Mr. de Blasio is critical, at times, of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, especially in the areas of education and homelessness, and he said that his ''optimistic document'' focused on addressing inequalities in education, economic opportunities, housing and health care, for starters.
One of Mr. de Blasio's ideas includes a municipal identification card that would serve as proof of residence and allow illegal immigrants to access services.
Mr. de Blasio's background as an organizer for liberal groups and unions is evident throughout. He writes frequently about the need to ''work with'' (20 times) ''stakeholders'' (13 times) and come ''together'' (8 times) on issues. He is no fan of a timid or shrinking government; he uses the word ''expand'' 80 times, often in conjunction with programs.
And, as has been his tendency on the campaign trail, he often talks about fighting for the middle class, and paying close attention to neighborhoods and small businesses.
Among other ideas, he wants to legalize thousands of basement apartments and secondary residences, to give tenants protections, and to enable landlords to make health and safety upgrades. Many of those apartments would be added to the city's rent-regulation system, he adds.
And on public safety, Mr. de Blasio wants to expand the use of cameras, especially in high-crime areas, in all five boroughs. He would invest more money in ShotSpotter technology, which uses sensors to identify and track gunshots. He also would create a public safety high school, with the cooperation of the John Jay College for Criminal Justice and the New York Police Department, to prepare students for jobs in policing.

HEADLINE: U.S. Home Construction Rose in May

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Builders stepped up home construction in May and applied for permits to build single-family homes at the fastest pace in five years. The gains show housing remained a crucial source of growth for the economy. 
The overall pace of homes started rose 6.8 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 914,000, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That offset part of the 14.8 percent decline in April. May's rate is still below March's rate of more than one million -- the fastest in five years.
Construction increased in May for single-family homes, apartments and condominiums.
Builders sought more permits to build single-family homes, which represent about two-thirds of the market. The seasonally adjusted annual rate rose 1.3 percent to 622,000 -- the highest since May 2008. That is a sign that construction will increase further in the coming months.
Permits fell 3.1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted of 974,000 because of a drop in apartment permits, which are more volatile.
Also, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday that consumer prices rose slightly last month, as higher energy costs partly offset cheaper food. The increase is further evidence that consumers are benefiting from mild inflation.
The Consumer Price Index ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in May from April, the department said. Over the last 12 months, prices have risen just 1.4 percent.
Excluding volatile food and gas costs, core prices rose 0.2 percent in May from April. Core prices have risen only 1.7 percent in the last 12 months, in line with the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2 percent.
''Inflation has faded to only a minor irritant,'' Michael Montgomery, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients.
The building report pointed to more signs of a housing recovery that has become sustainable. New-home construction has risen 28.6 percent since May 2012.
''Starts have clearly been trending up,'' said Jim F. O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. ''While levels are still low, housing has been the strongest part of the economy in growth terms.''
Still, some markets are recovering faster than others. In May, housing starts rose 17.8 percent in the South and 5.7 percent in the West. But they fell 13.7 percent in the Midwest and 9 percent in the Northeast.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty at Fed Over Its Stimulus Plans and Its Leadership

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, faces the increasingly difficult challenge of shaping investor expectations about the future course of Fed policy amid growing signs that the Bernanke era at the central bank is drawing to a close.
President Obama suggested late Monday that he was likely to nominate a new Fed chairman this year, saying that Mr. Bernanke had ''already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to.'' Mr. Obama added that Mr. Bernanke, whose second four-year term in office ends in January, has done an ''outstanding job.''
The comments bounced around Washington on Tuesday even as Mr. Bernanke convened a regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee to debate how much longer the Fed will continue its current efforts to stimulate the economy. The Fed is not expected to announce any immediate changes on Wednesday, at the close of the meeting, but investors are watching for signs that the Fed is considering scaling back later this year. 
The central bank is buying $85 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities, in addition to holding short-term interest rates near zero. Both measures are intended to encourage job creation by easing financial conditions, and the Fed pledged to press the campaign until it saw ''sustained improvement'' in the outlook for the labor market.
But that message has been muddled recently by conflicting pronouncements about the duration of the asset purchases from several of the 19 Fed officials who help make policy. Mr. Bernanke contributed to the confusion by telling Congress last month that the Fed might begin to reduce the pace of its purchases this year -- but might not -- while avoiding any clear account of how the central bank would make such a decision.
Uncertainty about the Fed's plans and its leadership has focused attention on the news conference that Mr. Bernanke plans to hold on Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Open Market Committee releases a policy statement. The Fed also will release economic projections by the 19 officials, which could help to explain the apparent momentum toward doing less by showing how quickly they expect the economy to grow and unemployment to decline.
''Federal Reserve officials believe that clear communication about policy intentions can help manage market expectations and so increase the effectiveness of monetary policy,'' Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote to clients on Monday. ''Lately, however, the policy makers appear to have muddled the message and so have created confusion rather than clarity on the policy outlook.'' The news conference, he said, is a chance ''to clarify.''
The confusion is costly. A recent survey of the 21 companies authorized to trade securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a list that includes most of the nation's largest financial companies, found widespread agreement that uncertainty about the Fed's plans was effectively tightening financial conditions. Interest rates on 10-year Treasuries, a benchmark for the Fed's efforts to reduce borrowing costs, rose to 2.20 percent on Tuesday from a low of 1.66 percent at the start of May.
Some analysts argue that the Fed still intends to press ahead with asset purchases at least through the end of the year. They note that Mr. Bernanke has allowed dissenters to command the public stage even as they exercise relatively little influence over the course of Fed policy. Some also see the cacophony as an intentional damper on the ebullience of investors, carving out time for the benefits of low interest rates to spread through the economy.
The unemployment rate has fallen only slightly since the Fed began its latest round of bond buying, to 7.6 percent in May from 7.8 percent in September. And even that decline happened mostly because people stopped looking for work. The share of American adults with jobs has not increased in three years. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation has sagged to 1.05 percent, the lowest level in more than 50 years and markedly below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed considers healthy.
''In our view it would be risky to deliver a hawkish monetary policy message at a time when growth remains sluggish, inflation continues to trend down and market inflation expectations are dropping sharply,'' Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients last week.
Other analysts, however, see mounting evidence that Mr. Bernanke and his allies would like to buy fewer bonds, although most still do not expect the Fed to reduce the pace of its asset purchases before September at the earliest. Fed officials have described the asset purchases as an experiment with uncertain consequences, particularly the potential disruption of financial markets, and warned that those risks might increase with the size of the Fed's holdings.
While the pace of growth has increased only modestly, the worst-case possibility, in which mismanaged fiscal policy sends the economy sliding back into recession, has faded. ''The asset purchases may have been simply insurance against a fiscal disaster that did not materialize,'' wrote Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon.
Moreover, some Fed officials have concluded that large job gains are beyond reach. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland wrote recently that the Fed should be satisfied if the economy adds 150,000 jobs a month -- well below the monthly average of 176,000 so far this year. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago set the bar even lower, at 80,000 jobs a month. Both estimates are based on the assumption that many of the people who stopped looking for work in recent years will never return, allowing the unemployment rate to return closer to its normal levels during an economic expansion even without a rebound in employment.
Some of these decisions will most likely be made after Mr. Bernanke leaves office. Mr. Obama, in an interview with the journalist Charlie Rose on PBS, avoided answering a direct question about reappointing Mr. Bernanke. He said instead that Mr. Bernanke ''has been an outstanding partner along with the White House, in helping us recover much stronger than, for example, our European partners, from what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.''
The interview, taken together with earlier comments by Mr. Bernanke, reinforces a growing expectation that the administration plans to nominate a new Fed chairman this year. The position requires Senate confirmation. Only three people have held the Fed chairmanship in the last 30 years, and the Obama administration has an opportunity to put a Democrat atop the central bank for the first time since the resignation of Paul Volcker in the late 1980s.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, is widely regarded as a leading candidate. She would become the first woman to head the Fed or any other major central bank. Other possible candidates include Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, both former Obama advisers, and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former Fed vice chairman.

HEADLINE: Harnessing the Net to Power a Green Revolution

BYLINE: By BETH GARDINER

 BODY:
LONDON -- At the intersection of clean power and information technology, a new breed of digital start-ups is harnessing the power of the Internet to make smarter, more efficient use of energy and other resources.
Proponents call it ''cleanweb,'' and they say the sector is poised to bring about huge leaps in efficiency, saving money and cutting planet-warming carbon emissions.
As its backers define it, cleanweb is any software or Internet application that makes it easier to use resources -- like textiles or cars or electricity -- more efficiently.
The label is applied to a diverse mix of companies, some of them far removed from the power sector. Cleanweb enthusiasts often point to Airbnb, a Web site that connects people seeking vacation accommodation with others looking to rent out their homes, reducing the use of hotel rooms -- and, in theory, the number of hotels that need to be built. 
The Nest, a sleek, smart home thermostat that can be controlled from a mobile phone, is cleanweb, too. So is Mosaic, a crowdfunding platform that links individual investors to solar energy projects that reduce the use of fossil fuels. RidePal tallies online votes from commuters to design routes to work for employer-funded buses, taking cars off the road in the congested San Francisco Bay area.
''For me, it's about bringing the optimism and the creative energy of the Web to the big challenges of sustainability,'' said Jack Townsend, an organizer of Cleanweb U.K., a network of British entrepreneurs and technology experts. ''It's early days right now, but it's very fast-developing.''
''A lot of the problems of sustainability are information problems, so information and information technology can be a big component of the solution,'' he said.
Investors scared off by volatility and falling prices in more traditional areas of clean technology -- big wind farms or solar arrays that require hundreds of millions of dollars to get up and running -- are turning in growing numbers to cleanweb, where capital requirements can be lower and returns can come quicker.
Globally, investors put at least $1.2 billion into cleanweb ventures in 2011, according to research by Pure Energy Partners and the Cleantech Group, a market research company. A quarter of clean technology deals had a cleanweb component that year, a 55 percent increase from 2009, said Nicholas Moore Eisenberger, the managing partner at Pure Energy Partners, a venture capital and strategy firm in New York.
Mitch Lowe, the managing partner at Greenstart, a San Francisco venture capital and design company focused on cleanweb, said the number of start-ups in the area had doubled in the past year.
''We're seeing a lot of interest in this category right now,'' he said. ''The number of entrepreneurs who are starting businesses in this space has grown a lot in the last couple of years.''
The growth of cleanweb is another example of the huge change information technology has brought to so many sectors of the economy, Mr. Lowe said. This time, he says, it is energy's turn to be revolutionized by the Internet.
''Cleantech is moving from its first chapter, where it was all about wind farms and solar panels and these huge industrial things,'' he said.
''Now that all that technology has been built, the question is how do you distribute it, how do you get it out to the world.''
Fresh out of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, Archie Gupta, an electrical engineer, saw a way to help independent energy generators operate more efficiently. Big utilities have smart systems guiding their decisions about how much power to produce and when, but in the United States alone, there are 24,000 smaller-scale businesses and institutions -- universities, hospitals, airports and factories -- that also generate power, mainly for their own use, Mr. Gupta said.
Because energy is not their main business, many have not bothered to install sophisticated systems to manage it, he said. Root3 Technologies, a start-up that he co-founded a year ago, offers software and services to do just that.
''All the data is already there,'' he said. ''We are taking the data and converting it into actionable information -- and this is actionable information hour by hour. What do you need to do? What do you need to turn on? How much do you need to produce?''
''It's a significant bottom-line benefit,'' that helps clients cut their power generating costs by up to 30 percent, he said.
Along with leaders in the field like the entrepreneurs Sunil Paul and Blake Burris, Mr. Eisenberger, of Pure Energy Partners, recently helped to start the Global Cleanweb Initiative to promote the sector. In cities including Houston and Rome, the group has sponsored weekend meetings for programmers to brainstorm and build apps that save energy or other resources.
Information technology can have a bigger impact on resource management ''than any hard technology in our lifetimes,'' Mr. Eisenberger said.
In addition to energy-related applications, the cleanweb world includes companies in what has been dubbed the ''sharing economy,'' connecting individuals who want to share baby clothes, appliances, cars and more. That saves money as well as the cloth, metal and other materials used in manufacturing such goods -- and the greenhouse gases their creation would have produced.
Brian Steel, the co-director of the Cleantech to Market program at the Haas School of Business, at the University of California, Berkeley, said the popularity of cleanweb could lead to a glut of companies in the area, followed by a shakeout and consolidation. Yet even if that happens, he said, the sector looks likely to play an important complementary role, alongside more traditional renewable power companies, in helping to cut carbon emissions and conserve resources.
Mr. Lowe, of Greenstart, said that venture capitalists who had lost money on clean energy investments in recent years might still be wary. But investors from outside the energy sector have been showing lots of interest, he said, looking at the new companies simply as strong start-ups with good prospects.
Greenstart is investing in one new cleanweb company every four weeks. ''We're superbullish on it,'' he said: With a growing global population and tightening constraints on carbon emissions, ''it's just a massive financial opportunity.''
Mr. Eisenberger said he hoped the opportunities would draw even more entrepreneurs with big ideas.
''Instead of thinking about making a billion dollars by creating some sort of photo-sharing program, which is great,'' he said, ''we would like that next generation of entrepreneurs to see how they can make a billion dollars using tech to tackle resource problems.''

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Moving Away From Link to Oil

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- Last month, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, of Japan, and GDF Suez of France said they would join with Sempra Energy, based in San Diego, California, to build a $10 billion liquefied natural gas plant in Hackberry, Louisiana.
They joined several other non-U.S. companies, including Korea Gas and GAIL, a large Indian utility, in trying to lock up prospective U.S. exports of abundant, low-cost shale gas.
Current low prices may not be the only attraction. Jean-Marie Dauger, the executive vice president of GDF Suez's gas business, said in an interview that the company was trying to gain access to the U.S. natural gas pricing process: Unlike prices in much of the rest of the world, U.S. prices are set by market forces.
''The U.S. market will bring not only diversity in terms of physical sources, but economy,'' he said. ''We don't know what the price will be, but we know it will be a market and price structure that is not the same as elsewhere in the world.'' 
Unlike oil, which is a globally traded commodity, natural gas is priced depending on location and the arrangement under which it is sold.
In North America, gas is a traded commodity whose price is usually linked to benchmarks set at the Henry Hub, a meeting point of pipelines in Louisiana. In the rest of the world, gas prices are often indexed to oil products that gas might replace -- a system that was developed to sell gas from the giant Groningen field in the Netherlands, in the 1960s.
But the linkage to oil is eroding, especially in Europe, as competition increases and multiple sources of gas emerge, largely through the increased use of liquefied natural gas, which can be transported globally by specialized ships. A surge of gas exports from the United States -- not a sure thing -- would add to the pressures on the indexed system.
''There is a certain globalization in this market, which is improving the ability to use gas as a global commodity, '' Mr. Dauger said.
For now, there is not enough competition to eliminate regional disparities in gas prices. For instance, the U.S. price, influenced by abundant shale gas, is now about $4 per million British thermal units. In Britain, the most liquid of the European markets, the traded price is about $10 per million B.T.U.'s and in Asia about $15 per million B.T.U.'s.
But ''the price differentials we see today are not going to persist,'' said Kenneth B. Medlock III, an expert on gas at Rice University in Houston. While gas will never be priced exactly the same from place to place because of differing transportation costs, the spreads will narrow considerably, he said. With the international gas trade worth an estimated $250 billion or more, even a difference of a few cents can make a big difference.
GDF Suez, an operator of utilities in France and elsewhere, is a huge player in the global gas markets as a producer, consumer, supplier and trader. It uses about 110 billion cubic meters, or 3.9 trillion cubic feet, of gas per year to feed its own power plants and those of its customers, about as much as the consumption of Italy and France combined.
Part of Mr. Dauger's job is to make sure that he has enough supply at the best prices. In recent years, that has been an almost impossible task because of the legacy of long-term contracts, typically of 15 to 30 years, between European buyers and suppliers like Gazprom of Russia, Statoil of Norway and Sonatrach of Algeria.
These contracts made sense when they were essentially deals between monopoly producers and distributors like GDF Suez. But they don't look so good now that customers can shop around.
''This business used to be one of the most boring businesses in the world; now it has become one of the most hectic,'' said Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of the Italian energy company Eni.
A two-tier pricing system has now emerged: About half the gas consumed in Europe comes at market or hub prices. The remainder, covered by long-term contracts, is still linked to oil.
That leaves buyers with enormous risk. Oil, which sold for as little as $10 a barrel in the 1990s, when some current contracts were agreed, now costs about $100 per barrel, while gas has come under downward pressure, not least from the development of shale gas in North America.
''Anyone with standard oil-linked contracts is likely losing money in Europe and specifically Italy,'' said Marco Alverà, the head of Eni's gas business.
Gas bought under such contracts can be 10 percent to 15 percent more expensive than gas bought at spot market prices, he said. Over the past year, Eni's gas and power unit has reported an operating loss of about &#x20ac;812 million, or $1 billion.
Executives like Mr. Alverà, a former Goldman Sachs banker, and Mr. Dauger, at GDF Suez, are trying to renegotiate these contracts.
''These are not easy discussions,'' Mr. Alverà said. ''Most sellers are reluctant to sit down and give you big discounts. The more they wait the more they increase their profits.''
Still, the landscape is shifting. On May 28, Eni said it had reached ''a package solution'' with Sonatrach for 2013 and 2014, though it gave few details.
Often, the deals involve formulas that combine oil links with a market price weighting. ''The situation is changing in Continental Europe,'' Mr. Dauger said. ''We are gradually but sustainably moving more and more to market prices.''
About half of the gas sold in Europe now trades at hub prices, according to Nikos Tsafos of consultants PFC Energy. Asia, meanwhile, still mostly uses oil-linked contracts.
The Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011 led to a surge in Japanese L.N.G. imports -- at high prices -- to compensate for the shutdown of the country's nuclear reactors. Last year, about a third of the world's L.N.G. supply went to Japan. Not surprisingly, Japanese utilities are now looking for cheaper supplies. Tokyo Electric Power, for example, has agreed to buy gas from Mitsui and Mitsubishi from their Louisiana project, at Henry Hub-linked prices.
Still, analysts say it may take decades for Asia to switch from oil linkage to market pricing.
Companies like BG Group and Chevron, which are building huge L.N.G. projects in Australia aimed at the Japanese and other Asian markets, will be watching closely. Costs in Australia are soaring and ''they really need oil-linked prices to get a marginal return,'' said Neil Beveridge, an analyst in Hong Kong at Bernstein Research.
Much of the gas from these projects has been sold on long-term, oil-linked contracts. Jonathan Stern, the chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, is among those who wonder whether the oil linkage will hold up long enough for them to make money.
''We think its going to take the rest of this decade for Asia to really begin to price on a market basis,'' he said, meaning the big projects may start producing ''just when the price basis is changing.''
