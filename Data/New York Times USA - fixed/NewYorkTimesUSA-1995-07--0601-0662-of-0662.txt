HEADLINE: Rezoning the Sex Shops

 BODY:
As might have been predicted, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to impose strict zoning regulations on sex-related businesses is being criticized by opponents who fear that the new rules will drive such establishments into their neighborhoods. Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Councilman Walter McCaffrey of Queens, the plan's key supporters when the Council approved the plan in draft form late last year, are standing firm. They are right to do so because the Mayor's strategy of regulating the location and concentration of sex-oriented adult businesses is sound.
Under the current proposal, which the Council must vote on again if, as expected, it is approved by the City Planning Commission in September, sex-related businesses could operate only in manufacturing districts and "commercial zones of high density" in Manhattan, including parts of this newspaper's Times Square neighborhood. To prevent any area from becoming an unappealing "red light" district, the plan pursues a dispersal strategy. It would prevent sex-related businesses from operating within 500 feet of residences, schools and houses of worship and within 500 feet of one another. 
 Though it appears that many opponents would be unhappy with anything short of an all-out ban, Mr. Vallone and Mr. McCaffrey warn correctly that tougher limits would probably be found to trespass on the constitutional rights of the affected businesses. Clearly, the city must proceed with care. Sexually explicit videos, books and dancing are forms of constitutionally protected free expression. While courts have allowed municipalities to limit sex businesses upon a showing of harmful impact on the economy and public safety, local governments may not unduly restrict access. Too severe a crackdown could invite a successful legal challenge that would leave neighborhoods completely unprotected from the spread of X-rated video stores and topless bars.
Indeed, as the commission reviews all of the testimony from its two days of hearings this week, it needs to be especially attentive to criticism that the proposal is too restrictive and would unfairly impinge on free expression. There is still a chance to review the zoning maps in detail and to make sure the final version of the plan is adequately respectful of both neighborhoods and free expression. The worst result would be a zoning plan that makes people feel good and politicians look good momentarily and then fails to withstand a court challenge.

HEADLINE: Use Real Trains for New York Airport Rail Link;
Lower Manhattan Ferry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The loss of some 5,000 jobs connected with the coffee and cotton exchanges has dealt yet another blow to the viability of Lower Manhattan as an important commercial center. Thousands of jobs in banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies and law firms have been lost to midtown Manhattan, the outer boroughs and other states. 
 There are many reasons for the steady flow of jobs away from the downtown area, but surely one of the most important is the lack of good commuting options from suburban areas. The best solution would be the construction of a downtown rail station with connections to New Jersey Transit, Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road lines.
Unfortunately, there are no rail lines in Lower Manhattan and it is difficult to imagine that in these budget-conscious times funds for their construction will be found.
A decent and far less costly alternative would be to construct a Hoboken-style rail-ferry terminal at Hunters Point in Queens. The terminal could be reached by diesel Long Island Rail Road trains and even by Metro-North trains rerouted over Hell Gate. From the terminal, ferries could transport commuters directly to the Wall Street area.
Commuting by ferry has proved popular with New Jersey commuters; there is every reason to believe it would be popular with commuters from Westchester, Connecticut and Long Island.

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber 

 BODY:

THE COLD WAR: A History
By Martin Walker. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $14.
The author looks back on the conflict with some nostalgia: it helped maintain global stability, he argues, and encouraged economic growth. "With lively prose and well-chosen anecdotes, he deftly traverses a half-century," David Callahan said here last year.
THE COLLECTED STORIES
By Grace Paley.
Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.
Moments of recognition, love, remembrance and regret fill these 45 stories, which span more than 25 years in the author's career. The characters, often Jewish New Yorkers, are revealed mostly through dialogue, recorded with an unfailing ear for the vagaries of self-expression. Ms. Paley's "distinctive, sure-footed command of the short-story form brings to fictional material a quality that must be called poetry," our reviewer, Robert Pinsky, wrote in 1994. He added, "By this I mean not mere verbal sauce . . . but the ability of language to dance with playful, lordly authority about the contours of reality." 

THE ROOSEVELTS: An American Saga
By Peter Collier with David Horowitz.
Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.
Theodore and Franklin were both progressive political leaders, but they could not have been more different in their familial relations. The authors portray Teddy as authoritative but deeply devoted, Franklin as aloof and Eleanor as just plain cold. The book "offers vivid and persuasive analyses of their personalities," John A. Garraty said in these pages last year, calling it "truly first-rate popular history." Henry F. Graff, writing in the Book Review in 1979, found "history on the grandest scale" in FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, 1932-1945, by Robert Dallek (Oxford University, $18.95). Reissued with a new afterword, this study shows how F. D. R. guided international relations in a way unsurpassed by any other modern President. Mr. Graff praised its "scope, clarity and judiciousness."
SHEAR
By Tim Parks. Grove, $11.
A British geological consultant investigating the cause of a construction accident rocks the foundations of his own life through two unscrupulous love affairs. The result is an "eerie, engrossing and beautifully written suspense novel," David Sacks said here last year.
THE CIVILIZATION OF EUROPE IN THE RENAISSANCE
By John Hale. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $18.
Drawing on and enlarging upon the scholarship in Jacob Burckhardt's 19th-century study "The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy," the author describes the sweeping social changes and emergent European identity that characterized the entire Continent between 1450 and 1620. Last year our reviewer, Theodore K. Rabb, called the book "a sweeping and learned traversal of the age, full of choice details." The scope is even wider in A HISTORY OF CIVILIZATIONS, by Fernand Braudel, translated by Richard Mayne (Penguin, $14.95), which gives an overview of both Eastern and Western cultures. This "effective and readable" study is "enlivened by Braudel's supple prose," David Walton wrote in the Book Review in 1994.
BLACKER THAN A THOUSAND MIDNIGHTS
By Susan Straight. Anchor/Doubleday, $11.
Darnell Tucker, a young black man in the author's fictional community of Rio Seco, Calif., doesn't have extravagant ambitions -- his love is fighting brush fires -- but even his modest dreams are imperiled by his impending fatherhood. "Darnell's painstaking struggle to do the ordinary things becomes extraordinary in Ms. Straight's gifted hands," Rosemary L. Bray said in these pages in 1994. Anchor/Doubleday has also reissued UNDERSTAND THIS, by Jervey Tervalon ($10.95), a first novel that explores the underside of black life in Los Angeles's urban sprawl just after a drive-by shooting. The story moves "with spirit, energy and truthfulness," Michael E. Ross wrote here last year.
BALSAMROOT: A Memoir
By Mary Clearman Blew. Penguin, $9.95.
The history of the women in the author's family is bound up with the history of their land: the rough terrain of central Montana, where homesteaders led an often lonely existence. Ms. Blew reflects on the choices made by her Aunt Imogene, now elderly and senile, as well as on her own choices and her daughters'. In 1994 Susan Lowell said in the Book Review, "It's hard to imagine a novel casting a longer shadow than this personal testament." A sometimes harsh life is also examined in FLAT ROCK JOURNAL: A Day in the Ozark Mountains, by Ken Carey (HarperSanFrancisco, $10), which records 24 hours of the seven years the author and his family spent without plumbing, electricity or any of the conventional links to the wider world. "You have to admire Mr. Carey for living so independently," Dulcie Leimbach wrote in the Book Review last year.
THE END OF VANDALISM
By Tom Drury. Fawcett Columbine, $11.
What begins as an ironic look at working-class lives in the Midwest becomes something far more poignant, our reviewer, Eric Kraft, said in 1994. This novel's characters, who include a local sheriff and his new wife, achieve a kind of grace through pain. It is as if the author "had discovered the kind of informed sympathy for the living that the visitor to hell feels upon returning to the light," Mr. Kraft remarked.
AIR & FIRE
By Rupert Thomson. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
Southern California in the 1890's is like a colonial outpost. It is here that Theophile Valence, a fictional disciple of Gustave Eiffel, tries to erect a prefabricated iron church. "This often surreal, evanescent story takes careful reading, but the effort is well worth it," David Murray said here last year. LAUREL GRAEBER

 BODY:

SLAPSTICK AND MUSIC
 "Music and Merriment" is the title of an entertainment featuring Julian Sperry, flutist, and Graham Lea-Cox, pianist, composer and director of the English Performing Arts Ensemble. They will appear at the Klein Memorial Auditorium in Bridgeport on Saturday at 8 P.M. 
 Their act is anchored by music from a variety of periods and genres, spiced with British wit, the occasional donning of masks, and the screening of a 1925 silent slapstick film underscored by a musical race through the works of Tchaikowsky, Offenbach, Ravel, Gershwin, Saint-Saens and Rimsky-Korsakov. In another segment the songs of Noel Coward, selections from grand opera and American ragtime are juxtaposed with lighthearted abandon.
Tickets are $10, and the theater is at 910 Fairfield Avenue. Call 333-5000 for reservations and directions.
 
'MOBY DICK' MARATHON
 The birthday of Herman Melville, Aug. 1, 1819, is to be be celebrated for the 10th consecutive year at Mystic Seaport. From noon tomorrow until 11:45 A.M. on Tuesday, the seaport staff and visitors will take turns in a marathon reading of "Moby Dick."
The event is called "Call Me Ishmael" and it takes place aboard the Charles W. Morgan, generally acknowledged to be the last surviving wooden whaling ship in the world. The vessel is permanently berthed at the seaport's Mystic River docks.
Some diehards who return for the reading year after year stay through the night, some leave after their stint is over, and many stay for a few hours or less, particularly people with children in tow.
Anyone planning to make a night of it should arrive fortified with something to sit on and something to eat.
Admission is free with seaport admission of $16, $8 for young people from 6 through 15, free to children under 6. Arrival by 11:30 A.M. is advisable in order to catch the whaleboat demonstration at 11:45, just before the reading starts at noon.
The seaport is off Exit 90 of Interstate 95, and one may call 572-0711 for more information.
 
CHAPLIN MUSICAL
 A musical about Charlie Chaplin is the featured production in a new musical theater conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, 305 Great Neck Road in Waterford, running from tomorrow through Aug. 12.
"The Little Tramp," by David Pomeranz and Steven David Horwich, will have eight readings. An additional three musicals in developmental stage will not be open to the public.
The performances will be held at 8:15 P.M. Thursdays through Saturdays with Saturday matinees at 2 P.M. Tickets are $8 and $10 and may be reserved by calling 443-1238.
 
SONO PARTY
 South Norwalk will hold its 19th annual SoNo Arts Celebration on Washington Street and throughout the surrounding area at the mouth of the Norwalk River on Friday from 7 to 10 P.M., Saturday from 10 A.M. to midnight, and Sunday from 11 to 6. Admission is free.
The streets will be crammed with booths containing the work of more than 200 juried artists and artisans from across the country. Continuous music and dance will be performed on four stages and dozens of vendors in two food courts will offer comestibles from many ethnic and regional cuisines.
Features that have become traditional are the children's art playground, the kinetic sculpture race at noon on Saturday, and the Saturday night block party with three bands providing music for dancing until midnight.
New this year are the parade of the giant puppets, handcrafted by local artists, and a beer buffet marking the opening of the New England Brewing Company on Marshall Street.
Last year's celebration attracted 100,000 visitors to the area, which is closed to traffic for the duration. Motorists can take Exit 14 northbound or 15 southbound off Interstate 95 and follow the signs. The number to call for more information is 866-7916.
 
STAGED READINGS
 The National Theater of the Deaf, based in Chester, has scheduled an international conference at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford.
New plays will be presented and conference participants will attend seminars, lectures and workshops in which the development of playwriting by deaf authors, and marketing to a wider audience will be explored.
Three spoken and signed readings will be performed on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 7 P.M. in the Paul Mellon Center for the Arts on the Choate Rosemary Hall campus.
"I See the Moon," by Michele Maureen Verhoosky; "The Water Falls," by Willy Conley, and "Fish Nor Fowl," by Eugene Bergman, will run consecutively.
The National Theater of the Deaf, founded in 1967, entertains hearing and hearing-impaired audiences by combining the spoken and the signed word.
Tickets are $8 at the door or one may call 526-4971 for reservations or more information. The phone number for people with impaired hearing is 526-4974.
 
STRANGE DOINGS
 In producing his full-length color film "Oddities, Oddities: In the Footsteps of Robert Ripley," William Stockdale has trekked through underground churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia; spent some quality time in Hell, Mich.; filmed the tourist trade that pumps the economy of Arles, France, where van Gogh was once the resident lunatic, and recorded the doings of strange animals, fish, bodies of water, Turkish ice cream that stretches like warm mozarella, and other Ripleyesque phenomena.
His movie will be shown on Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Willimantic Camp Meeting Association grounds, one mile south of Threadmill Square in Willimantic on Route 32, or coming from the other direction, 2 to 3 miles north of the stoplight in South Windham on Route 32. Admission is $3.
 
MARBLES AND JACKS
 Hoop rolling, ninepins, bilboquet, croquet, top spinning, marbles, jacks and other games from the sometimes distant past will be played at the Children's Annual Lawn Party at Roseland Cottage in Woodstock from 11 to 4 on Saturday.
The rose-colored mansion at 566 Route 169 is owned by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. It is a National Historic Landmark and the site of many Victorian-inspired events throughout the year.
Families may take along their own picnics and spend the day being entertained by a 1870's costumed magician, joining in a peanut hunt and getting involved in the making of kazoos, fans, small parachutes and similar crafts. Admission is $2 and the phone number for more information is 928-4074.
 
HAITIAN MUSIC
 The fiery Haitian and reggae music of Boukan Ginen will be heard at the Globe Theater in Norwalk on Thursday at 8 P.M. Now five years old, the 10-member ensemble is an offshoot of Boukman Eksperyans, an established group of Haitian musicians.
Boukan Ginen won Haiti's Carnival Champions Prize in 1991, and has since toured the United States, Canada and Europe. A second recording, for Xenophile, is in the works for release next year.
The theater is at 71 Wall Street and tickets are $10 at the box office, through Ticketmaster, or call 866-2999. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Fifth Avenue in the 50's;
As Troubles Ebb, It's Becoming The Avenue Again

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
OUTSIDE of New York, few people realized there had been a change. Out there, a Fifth Avenue address still conjured up an image of an elegant street where an uninterrupted line of expensive stores like Tiffany blended with tourist-pleasers like St. Patrick's Cathedral.
But recent reality has been far less pretty. Over the last decade even Fifth Avenue in the 50's, the avenue's "best" -- translation: priciest -- section, has been splotched by electronics and rug stores. High-fashion windows were eclipsed by seemingly permanent "going out of business" signs, and the ubiquitous street peddlers were turning the avenue into an obstacle course. 
 "It was like a flea market," said Tom Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Association. "Many good retailers took one look and said, 'I don't really want to be here.' "
Now, Fifth Avenue is again living up to its posh reputation. The shoe store A. Testoni and St. John's Knits, both upscale retailers, have moved to Fifth Avenue and 53d Street, replacing electronics stores. Liz Claiborne is building a big store on the southwest corner of 52d Street, where persistently vacant space coexisted with an electronics store and a low-end men's clothing store. The Ferragamo family, which owns the building next door, has evicted an electronics store and a rug store, and is said to be negotiating with a high-fashion retailer.
In other spaces, retail excitement is replacing respectable dullness. Banana Republic is at 53d Street, in Japan Airlines' former space. Gianni Versace is building a huge emporium, complete with roof garden, where Olympic Airlines once sat. And the Warner Brothers Studio Store is in a long-vacant bank branch at 57th Street.
Some retailers are even choosing Fifth over Madison, reversing a flight of quality that reached a fever pitch when Barney's opened at 61st and Madison in 1993. One reason is the many tourists-cum-impulse-buyers that Fifth Avenue attracts.
"On Madison people shop specific stores, but on Fifth they shop the street," said H. Gene Silverberg, chief executive of Bigsby & Kruthers, which recently opened the Knot Shop, a tie store, across from St. Patrick's.
"Tourists definitely go to Fifth Avenue; everything else is optional," agreed Efraim Grinberg, president of North American Watch, which opened a Movado store at 52d Street last year.
That idea keeps getting converts. Faconnable, the men's clothing store, had always believed that their customer base was between 57th and 72d on Madison, said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco brokerage who persuaded Faconnable to move to 54th and Fifth instead. Do they have regrets? "They're already talking about expanding," Mr. Victor said.
Fifth Avenue landlords, of course, could not be more delighted. Sumitomo Realty, which owns 666 Fifth Avenue, at 53d Street, is looking to replace the B. Dalton bookstore, which wants to move, and to fill space once occupied by Pastrami & Things.
"We will certainly get more for the space than we would have gotten if the area hadn't redeveloped," said Arthur L. Bocchi, a Sumitomo vice president.
Even landlords who say they were unaffected by the avenue's deterioration concede that new tenants have fewer qualms about moving in. "When you buy a house, you care about the neighborhood," said Kate D. Coburn, Rockefeller Center Management's vice president of retail leasing.
Fifth Avenue's landlords are trying to make sure the neighborhood stays classy. According to Mr. Victor, Olympic Tower Associates has turned down several mass-market retailers for space it has available at 51st Street. "They want a tenant in keeping with H. Stern, Mark Cross and Versace, the others on that block," he said.
The owners of the Crown Building at 57th have refused to renew the lease of a low-end jeweler, while the owners of the Scribner Building at 49th, where Brentano's is about to vacate 12,000 square feet, are taking their time negotiating deals.
"We are marketing the Crown space to tenants who attract the same type of shopper as Tiffany or Bulgari nearby," said Kenneth M. Krasnow, an associate director at Cushman & Wakefield who handles leasing at both buildings. "We'll go for a more popular-priced store at Scribner, but we still want a quality tenant."
(Since the Brentano's interior is landmarked, Mr. Krasnow is marketing it primarily to European retailers, since they are more used to making their own retail images conform to unchangeable contours.)
Such pickiness is terribly exciting to members of the Fifth Avenue Association, which has spent much of the last five years getting the avenue back in shape.
"It's hard, walking down Fifth today, to relate to what was going on in 1990," Mr. Cusick recalled. "Liquidation signs were all over, and peddling was out of control."
Moreover, many of the tackier stores had ironclad leases that economically pressed landlords felt forced to sign. "When the landlords were renting to the schlock stores, national chains weren't in the market," said Benjamin Fox, a partner at the New Spectrum store brokerage.
Getting rid of it all was no easy task. Although Fifth Avenue zoning has strict signage rules, it took several lawsuits to get all the offensive signs taken down. And it took enforcement of penalties for consumer affairs violations to purge the street of "ripoff stores," as Mr. Cusick calls the stores that sold overpriced goods to tourists.
PEDDLERS were even harder to oust. In 1990, a city court ruled that disabled veterans had a right to peddle anywhere in New York, and thousands of people applied for licenses. Many of them sold counterfeit versions of the goods being sold in the high-priced stores they parked in front of.
They were followed by book and magazine vendors who, although rarely disabled veterans, remained relatively unhassled by the courts or the police. After all, nobody wanted to be accused of being harder on sellers of constitutionally protected speech than they were on sellers of T-shirts.
The last group to arrive were the peddlers of watches and scarves. Most of them were unlicensed, and thus fair game for the law. But they usually displayed their wares in briefcases that could be shut in a second. Often they would pay lookouts to alert them if the police were anywhere near. By the time the officer arrived, the peddler was simply a person carrying a leather case.
Most of the peddlers are gone now. A new state law requires veterans to abide by the same standards as other vendors, which means Fifth Avenue's zoning rules can again prohibit street sales. Other legal changes make it possible to use witness testimony to prosecute unlicensed vendors who have folded up their briefcases by the time a police officer arrives.
"We had 1,818 encounters with vendors in the month of August 1993," Mr. Cusick said. "Eighteen months later we had one a day."
But not all is roses on Fifth Avenue. When Warner Brothers moved to 57th Street, a great hue and cry arose from people who felt that mass-market entertainment had no place on New York's most elegant shopping street. Their cries accomplished little: Niketown, another entertainment emporium, is opening across the street, in the Trump Tower space vacated by Galeries Lafayette. And Goldfeil and Bally of Switzerland, sellers of, respectively, ultraexpensive jewelry and accessories, are giving way at 55th Street to The Disney Store, seller of, well, Mickey Mouse paraphernalia.
Some brokers say such stores are better suited to Fifth Avenue's pedestrian mix. "Fifth Avenue gets the office workers and the Japanese tourists, but Madison has the wealthy East Side residents and European tourists that the quality retailers go after," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at Edward S. Gordon.
Others say the mass merchandisers represent a net gain for an avenue that can now be all things to all shoppers. "Fifth Avenue has become an all-around consumer friendly place," said Rob Nager, director of retail leasing at Colliers ABR, who handles leasing at 650 Fifth Avenue, at 52d Street.
The new populism has also helped revive Fifth Avenue south of Saks, where annual retail rents average $200 a square foot, compared with $400 north of 50th Street. And mass merchandisers, who normally rent huge spaces, do far better than that.
"It's less expensive to rent below that imaginary border, yet that's where a lot of the big spaces are," said Mr. Krasnow, who believes that the quality retailing zone of Fifth Avenue now extends to 42d Street.
Faith Consolo, managing director of the Garrick-Aug store brokerage, says that the lower stretch is particularly appealing to international retailers, because it offers the cachet of the Fifth Avenue address without the burden of the rents. "When they say 'Fifth Avenue,' no one asks '34th, 47th or whatever,' " Ms. Consolo said.

 A number of upscale retailers have moved to the heart of shopping area in recent months, or have announced plans to do so. In some cases the new stores replace shops that seemed to specialize in 'going out of business' sales. Among the new neighbors.

HEADLINE: Silent Tower On 10th Ave. Is Coming Back to Life

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Lewis Futterman once said he developed the 31-story Aurora apartment tower at 10th Avenue and 57th Street for "an upscale audience of people who want the convenience of being near their jobs in midtown and who want enough space for a baby grand."
No baby grands arrived, however. Neither did any residents. Like other projects that began in an expansive real estate climate but neared completion as the market was convulsing in the late 1980's, the Aurora fell into a limbo from which it is only now emerging. 
 The story of its salvage has to do in part with affordable-housing tax credits, a financing mechanism that is well used but little known outside development circles, and a 30-year abatement on all property taxes. And it has to do with an unusual alliance between a nonprofit service organization and a decidedly for-profit builder.
But it also has to do with the extra space that Mr. Futterman carved out. The oversize living-dining rooms, up to 30 feet long, will permit the subdivision of the 98 original apartments into 178 shared units for people who are elderly, disabled, under-employed or living with AIDS.
And after seven years as an empty shell, the Aurora will finally open next January, said Joseph P. Benincasa, general manager of the Actors' Fund of America, which has undertaken the project in partnership with the Related Companies, the development concern headed by Stephen M. Ross, and its financial service affiliate, the Related Capital Company.
The project has been financed largely through the sale of Federal tax credits to a "group of financial institutions with a significant presence in New York City," said Stuart J. Boesky, managing director of Related Capital. He declined to identify the purchasers in any greater detail.
The purchasers paid $34 million to get tax credits worth $46 million over the next 10 years. About one-third of the proceeds, or $10.25 million, goes to pay for the property. The rest is being used to finish construction, repay a loan, settle with creditors, reimburse Related for the money it has spent out of pocket and pay Related a development fee.
What tipped the economic scale in the project's favor, Mr. Boesky said, was the city's two-year-old Section 420c tax abatement program, usually used for the rehabilitation of single-room-occupancy hotels, under which the Aurora will not have to pay any property taxes for 30 years, amounting to a savings of about $600,000 a year.
That translates to $280 a month in forgiven taxes for every residential unit, said Commissioner Deborah C. Wright of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. She contrasted this with the $1,000 a month that the city spends to house single people with AIDS.
"We're getting 178 low-income units for a really small cost," Ms. Wright said. "Typically, when we use 420c, it's in the context of an almost totally subsidized project. In this case, the thing that's wonderful and fascinating is that the project was almost totally paid for by private development."
Low-income housing tax credits were established on a temporary basis by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, renewed several times after that and then made permanent two years ago. Credits are allocated to the states on a per-capita basis and administered by state housing agencies.
Typically, corporations will purchase the credits, paying less up front than the credits will be worth over time in reducing their Federal tax liability. That is how the investors make their money. Individuals also invest, but in most cases, can only offset $25,000 a year in Federal taxes.
The money paid for the credits goes to build or renovate housing for people whose income is 60 percent or less of the median income in a given area. Rents in qualifying projects can be no more than 18 percent of the area median income. (In the case of New York City, this calculation would yield a rent of roughly $450 a month.) The low-income units have to be maintained a minimum of 15 years to qualify for the credits.
As a rule, Mr. Boesky said, tax-credit equity represents about 40 to 50 percent of the financing for a project, with the rest of the money being borrowed. Investment partnerships put together by Related might involve 10 corporations that have staked $10 million each or 3,000 individuals who have each invested $25,000, he said.
To date, Mr. Boesky said, Related Capital has raised $1.2 billion in tax-credit equity, which has been used to develop 37,000 housing units around the nation. "We're probably the biggest low-income housing production machine in America," he said. "Where it used to be the Federal Government, it's now Related."
ANOTHER major operation is the National Equity Fund, which describes itself as the largest nonprofit syndicator of tax credits, having raised $1.2 billion to produce 27,000 housing units nationwide. The fund is an affiliate of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a community development group started by the Ford Foundation and based in Manhattan.
Locally, the New York Equity Fund has seen tax-credit investment rise to $110 million in 1993, from $49 million in 1989. The National Equity Fund is a partner in this local group, together with a subsidiary of the Enterprise Foundation of Columbia, Md., an affordable-housing development concern founded by the developer James Rouse.
"There's a more confident investment by corporations," said William R. Frey, director of the New York office of the Enterprise Foundation. What has increased confidence, he said, are tangible results. "There's a product," he said. "Housing has been built. They have received a return on their investment for seven or eight years. There's more of a comfort level that, in fact, this a good vehicle to invest in."
Given its success, Related Capital keeps searching for further investment opportunities. "We were scouring the tristate area for failed 1980's real estate deals that had never been placed in service," Mr. Boesky said. "The reason we were doing this is that we happen to think it's a very exciting way to utilize tax credits."
That brought them to 10th Avenue and 57th Street.
The Aurora was begun in 1987, using development rights from a merged zoning lot formed with the Mission Evangelical Pentecostal Church immediately to the north and the Badem Buildings, a small apartment house immediately to the east. The architect was John Harding. He designed Mr. Futterman's Bel Canto apartment building on Broadway, near 67th Street, and worked on an unrealized project that would have linked the chateau-like former Towers Nursing Home at Central Park West and 106th Street, a city landmark, to a new apartment tower.
By 1989, the Aurora was 90 percent finished. About half the units had been spoken for. Studio apartments were being offered from $154,500 and two-bedroom units were being offered from $386,200. "We were selling very well," Mr. Futterman recalled in an interview last week.
But the project unraveled quickly. "It got into trouble all at once," Mr. Futterman said. "That was at the time that real estate values were tumbling right and left." In addition, interest rates were skyrocketing. "So much money allocated for construction ended up being eaten up by the interest rates," he said.
"We tried desperately to finish the project but we weren't able to accomplish it," Mr. Futterman said. Although he was "within an inch" of making a deal in late 1989 with the lead lender, Home Savings of America, he said that Home was unable to persuade the other banks involved. All the deposits were returned to the prospective buyers, he said, and the building sat empty "while everyone banged heads in court and elsewhere."
At about the same time as the Aurora was sinking, the Actors' Fund was confronting a real estate problem of its own.
Established in 1882 to provide for the welfare of entertainers, the fund rather naturally found itself in the business of helping pay rent for those who were disabled or down on their luck. By 1990, rent subsidies were consuming $2 million a year, Mr. Benincasa said, about half of all the financial assistance offered by the fund.
And the demand showed no sign of waning, particularly with the closing of one of the city's largest low-rent hostels, the William Sloane House, a 1,400-room Y.M.C.A. residence at 34th Street and Ninth Avenue.
Moreover, there was an ever increasing demand for housing and services from people with AIDS and H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. "There is a high incidence of it in the entertainment industry," said Cyril Brosnan, public affairs director of the fund.
All of that suggested that the Actors' Fund develop its own affordable housing, on a scale much larger than its existing nursing and retirement homes in Englewood, N.J. The search began in 1990.
Reaching out for experienced developers, the fund turned to Housing and Services Inc., whose projects include the renovation of the Narragansett, a single-room-occupancy hotel at Broadway and 93d Street; the conversion of the former Speyer School at 514 West 126th Street into an AIDS residence known as St. Mary's Episcopal Center and the conversion of a former orphanage at Woodycrest Avenue and 161st Street in the Bronx into an AIDS residence called the Highbridge-Woodycrest Center.
The Actors' Fund had several criteria. "We focused on areas where entertainment professionals live," Mr. Benincasa said, "so the West Side was very important." Also, Mr. Brosnan said, the fund wanted a building that it could occupy 12 to 15 months after purchase, which ruled out new construction in favor of renovation.
Some of the buildings that were briefly under consideration included the Holland Hotel, 351 West 42d Street; the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel, 851 Eighth Avenue, between 51st and 52d Streets and a 22-story apartment tower at 255 West 85th Street.
But when Housing and Services brought the Aurora to the attention of the Actors' Fund in 1993, the search pretty much came to a halt. "After I saw it," Mr. Benincasa said, "it was the only serious contender."
THAT was when the Actors' Fund crossed paths with Related.
"We learned that Housing and Services Inc. had entered into a contract with the owner," Mr. Boesky said. "We reached out with the idea of buying out Housing and Services or doing a joint venture. We learned quickly that they were representing the Actors' Fund, which we thought was very exciting."
In the summer of 1993, negotiations began to resuscitate the Aurora. "It was a difficult deal to pull together," Mr. Boesky said, "because there was so much litigation and so many zoning issues around it." The new development team was required not only to buy the mortgage but also to settle all the outstanding lawsuits.
Complicating matters was the fact that the church had gone into court to detach its zoning lot from that of the Aurora, on the ground that it had not been paid by Mr. Futterman. The merger of the zoning lots had yielded about 20,000 square feet of extra development rights for the Aurora (roughly equal to 20 apartments).
"The judge gave the air rights back to the church," Mr. Boesky said, "so you had a situation where the building was no longer in compliance." Jeff T. Blau, vice president of the Related Companies, said the developers negotiated with the church to re-merge the lots and paid for the development rights.
There was another problem with the storefront church. Since it was part of the merged zoning lot, it was subject to the same requirement as the Aurora: that it be set back 10 feet from the sidewalk. Rather than move the building or chop off its front, the developers had to obtain a variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals.
All of the owners of the merged zoning lot had to sign the application before the board, and that occasioned a further delay when the landlord of the Badem Buildings balked.
Last year, the developers filed for their Section 420c abatement. Commissioner Wright confessed some initial skepticism. "I got a phone call about this project maybe six weeks into the Giuliani administration," she said. "It sounded like found money. And you know how fearful we bureaucrats are of something that looks too good to be true."
"But the tone the Mayor set was to be aggressive, try new ideas and find private investment," Ms. Wright said. "We took a deep swallow and, against all history, decided to be bold."
Marketing of the tax credits began in the fourth quarter of 1994, Mr. Boesky said, and construction began in early May. The closing occurred this month.
The architect of the renovation is Marvin H. Meltzer of Manhattan, whose other projects include two ambitious developments in the Bronx: the 265-unit Melrose Court, a new residential project on St. Ann's Avenue, between 156th and 159th Streets, and Crotona Park West, the rehabilitation of 563 units in 20 buildings, most on Fulton Avenue, south of the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The general contractor is Constantine Designers and Builders of Long Island City, Queens.
As built, the Aurora has four apartments on a typical floor: three one-bedroom units and a studio. Under the plans drawn by Mr. Meltzer, an extra bedroom is being added to each of the one-bedroom units and the studios are being converted into one-bedroom apartments. Some residents will share bathrooms; others will have their own.
On the second floor, the Actors' Fund will set up a community center, social workers' and volunteers' offices, a library and a large kitchen. The presence of these services enables the building to qualify as a "community facility with sleeping accommodations" rather than a residential development, Mr. Blau said, which permitted the new owners to increase the room count significantly.
The three chief criteria for admission to the Aurora will be age (a cut-off has not yet been set but it may 62 years and older), income (less than $20,000 a year) or health (symptoms of AIDS). As many as half the residents may come from outside the entertainment industry, Mr. Benincasa said. Monthly rents should run from $450 to $480.
One thing that isn't being changed -- at least for now -- is the building's name. Board members of the Actors' Fund came up with other ideas. For example, Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, suggested the Tommy.
"We like 'Aurora,' " Mr. Benincasa said. "There's continuity. But we're going to reserve judgment." He paused to contemplate the naming opportunity before asking, "Do you know anyone who wants to establish a $5 million reserve?"

HEADLINE: Expanding System Metes Out Mashantucket Justice

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
A MEDICINE wheel decorated with buckskin, trade beads, hackle feathers and the face of a fox hangs on the wall of the Mashantucket Pequot tribal courtroom. The medicine wheel and a judge's gavel, also embellished with beads and feathers, symbolize the traditions and customs that make the newly created tribal court different from non-Indian courts of law.
The opening of Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino and the breathtaking pace of its expansion -- nearly 10,000 employees have been hired since the casino opened in 1992 -- have made legal issues come to the forefront on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation. 
 "Any time you have major economic development and an influx of employees and visitors, it makes sense that there will be more issues," said Melody L. McCoy, a lawyer with the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder, Colo. "The tribal court system provides a viable means of resolving conflicts."
The Mashantucket civil court was established in 1992. The criminal court was created a year later, and the juvenile court opened last March. The Mashantuckets have enacted criminal court ordinances and a children's code and are developing a civil code, said Henry Sockbeson, a lawyer for the Mashantuckets. Before the tribal court was established, the Tribal Council heard and decided cases for the tribe.
Native American tribal courts as a whole have become more active in recent years. Of the more than 500 American Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages, about 180 operate courts today, almost double the number 20 years ago, Ms. McCoy wrote in an article in Human Rights, a publication of the American Bar Association. The tribes vary widely in size, from the Navajo Nation of more than 200,000 members to bands with fewer than 50 members. There are 340 members of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe.
A broad range also exists in the number of cases handled by tribal courts. In 1992 the Navajo courts processed more than 85,000 cases; some smaller tribes heard fewer than 10. It is not unusual for medium-sized tribes to handle 200 to 300 civil, criminal and juvenile cases yearly, Ms. McCoy said. One of the cases currently before the Mashantucket court involves employees at Foxwoods who were fired or asked to resign after an investigation by casino management of poker games off the premises.
Jill E. Shibles was hired last year as the court's chief judge. A member of the Penobscot Indian Nation in Maine, Ms. Shibles is one of only a handful of Native American judges in the eastern United States who are also lawyers. She earned a bachelor's degree in 1985 from King's College in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and a law degree in 1989 from the University of Maine.
Ms. Shibles became director of the Penobscot tribe's judicial system in 1990 and a judge two years later in the Passamaquoddy Tribal Court. She also had a private law practice in Maine, where she specialized in American Indian issues, criminal defense and family law.
Ms. Shibles, who is 31, worked first as part-time chief judge for the Mashantuckets. Last spring, she moved with her husband and two sons to Connecticut and began full-time work for the tribe.
"It's thrilling to be on the ground level," she said, "developing the tribal court and exploring new ways of dealing with the administration of criminal justice.,"
Lawyers who practice before the court are members of the tribal bar familiar with tribal law and court proceedings, Ms. Shibles said.
Michael Kurs, a partner in Pullman and Comley in Hartford, is among several lawyers who were recently sworn into the tribal bar. Mr. Kurs had experience with Indian law in two cases involving the Navajos, who live in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. "The tribal court is like any other court in that a lawyer isn't allowed to practice there unless he is admitted," Mr. Kurs said. "Being a member made sense to me as an outgrowth of my work with the Navajo Nation."
Criminal jurisdiction is an important issue to tribal courts. Crimes committed on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation fall under Federal, state, tribal or concurrent Federal and tribal jurisdiction, depending on the type of crime, whether or not there were victims and whether the person charged with the offense is Indian or non-Indian, Ms. Shibles said. A gaming compact between the state and the tribe allows the state to prosecute crimes committed in the gaming rooms of the casino.
Under a Supreme Court decision, Indian tribes do not have jurisdiction over non-Indians charged with offenses committed on their reservations, Ms. Shibles said. This does not sit well with the chief judge, who argues that since the Mashantuckets are like any other sovereign nation, non-Indians should be tried in the tribal court.
"I think the concern is that there might be some bizarre punishments," she said. "But I don't think you'll see those kinds of things. It should be up to the tribe to decide what punishment there will be under their laws."
The Mashantuckets consider rehabilitation, rather than detention, the main objective in criminal and juvenile cases. The court's intent is to get to the cause of a person's behavior problem with the help of social services, including mental health professionals and social workers, available on the reservation at no cost, Ms. Shibles said. But violations of the law can carry penalties. A breach of peace violation, for example, may be punished by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.
In one recent case, a defendant was sentenced to 30 days in jail, which was suspended on the condition that he make restitution, get counseling and treatment focusing on substance abuse, domestic violence and anger management. If the defendant failed to comply, a hearing would be held and the portion of the sentence that had been suspended would be reimposed.
Teen-agers up to 18 fall under the tribe's juvenile code. (Connecticut courts classify teen-agers under 16 as juveniles and those 18 and over as adults.) Defendants who are 16 or 17 are considered adults. However, they may apply to the court for youthful offender status, which means they are treated as adults, but their records are sealed from the public.
The tribe shares the close ties of an extended family, and children receive strong support from other members. A new community center on the reservation offers a variety of activities for children during the summer. "We keep them really busy," Ms. Shibles said.
The only complaints against juveniles so far have concerned criminal mischief, Ms. Shibles said, and they were settled out of court in meetings between the tribal probation officer and the people involved in the incident. A resolution may require a youngster to do community service or make good for any loss or damage.
The Mashantuckets are exploring home detention as an alternative in severe juvenile cases. Rather than being in detention with other troubled youngsters, the child would leave home only to go to school, Ms. Shibles said. "For the underlying behavior problem, the child's family has resources available to help them," she explained. "There's little excuse."
Despite some problems, tribal courts are a flourishing and promising system, a unique blend of the traditional and the contemporary, Ms. McCoy wrote. But for their potential to be fully realized, steps must be taken to resolve the legal issues surrounding their jurisdiction and relationships with non-tribal governments.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Bumpy Ride: A Faster Rail Link to Manhattan Runs Into Parking Problems

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD

 BODY:
Like many residents here, Vicki Herzfeld Arlein is excited about the Kearny Connection, the rail link that will offer direct access to midtown Manhattan when it opens next spring.
But like many residents here and in other communities along New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex Line, she is far from thrilled with the idea of a giant parking garage to accommodate new commuters, right in the heart of town. 
 "This was the mother of all issues recently, and there was a lot of broad-based opposition," said Ms. Herzfeld Arlein, who has been active in trying to stop the deck. "We were feeling that this would change what we like about Maplewood."
From Maplewood to Summit to Bernards Township, there has been a lively debate over New Jersey Transit's quest for additional parking. The agency expects 6,500 more riders a day over the next five years -- an increase of 50 percent for the Morris and Essex Line -- and it wants to accommodate some of them by adding 1,500 parking spaces, either in new garages or in expanded lots. By law, any parking built by the state transit agency must be open to all, not just local residents.
But when the connection opens in May, only 200 of the 1,500 spots, in Bernardsville and Far Hills, are expected to be available. By the end of 1996, the agency hopes to have 900 more. It has been a tough sell.
"We have run into some rough sledding," said Alfred Harf, assistant executive director of planning for New Jersey Transit. "I think there is a not-in-my-backyard sentiment that says we should be taking care of our own residents and have residents from other towns go somewhere else."
The transit agency says its proposed parking decks and lots would lure people to the train and contribute to local economies. Residents say the parking plans -- particularly those that involve new decks -- are too grand and too intrusive. And while the discussions have generally been civil, they make it clear how strongly people feel about physical changes to their communities.
This has been true even with the popular and much-anticipated $69 million Kearny Connection, which is expected to shave an average of 17 minutes off the commute to Manhattan when it opens in May. Until now, commuters have had to take the Morris and Essex Lines into Hoboken and transfer to the PATH. With the Kearny Connection, they will be able to ride the train right into Penn Station via the Northeast Corridor Line. (Trains will still run to Hoboken, for those traveling there or to lower Manhattan.)
Many local merchants favor the extra parking, saying their towns do not have enough as it is.
Residents who oppose it do so for several reasons. They say selling land to New Jersey Transit would take valuable property off the tax rolls. They fear the extra traffic. And they don't want to spend extra money to patrol and clean garages.
Nowhere, perhaps, have those feelings been more adamant than in Maplewood, where more than 2,000 people signed a petition this year to protest plans for a four-story, 400-car deck within a block of a park, a children's playground, the library and the middle school.
In March, the township formed a committee on parking and traffic to study alternatives to the deck. Its report is not yet complete, but already there are suggestions of a shuttle bus service and a reconfiguration of existing parking spaces.
In Summit, residents protested New Jersey Transit's plan to build a 600-space, four-level deck. Last fall, a group called the Committee to Save Summit collected 1,200 signatures, forced local officials to postpone acceptance of the deck and helped create a task force on the subject, said Marty Van Allen, a founder of the group.
Like Maplewood's, Summit's report should soon be ready. But some residents say the passion has subsided somewhat. Parking was an issue in the Republican mayoral primary in June, and Walter Long, a downtown businessman, defeated Judy McLendon, a prominent member of the Committee to Save Summit.
The idea of a deck was also floated in Millburn, but it was quickly dismissed after residents said they feared a deck would clog narrow roads leading to the station and raise serious safety concerns.
In Bernards Township, it was not a deck but a platform ramp and increased parking for the Lyons station that generated controversy, said H. Steven Wood, the township administrator. New Jersey Transit wanted 300 spaces; the township wanted 200. New Jersey Transit wanted a 300-foot elevated ramp to get to the train station; the township wanted only 100 feet. Negotiations are continuing.
And in South Orange, residents objected to a tiered parking deck for 470 cars but seem amenable to a proposal for two smaller garages attached to new stores to help revitalize its downtown, said Barbara Sacks, village administrator.
Back in Maplewood, even the most ardent of anti-deck residents agree that compromise is possible.
"We want to work with New Jersey Transit because they're great for the community," said Barbara Novak. "But let's not go for major surgery. Let's take an incremental approach."

Whose Beach Is It?

 BODY:
Should New Jersey's beaches be open to everyone, or should towns have the right to restrict access?
 
A Question of Fees
 The coastal areas should be accessible to everyone as a national resource. But there is an economic element to this controversy: the question of access fees. While undeveloped coastal areas should be open and free, developed sections such as maintained sand beach facilities and boardwalks can justify a fee to recoup expenses on a nonprofit basis.
 
KENNETH A. CROSSNER

Don't Drive Tourists Away
 Hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans and out-of-staters visit our beaches every year. If we take away their access, they will spend their money elsewhere. And let us not forget that the state of our waters and beaches was not solely created by the beachgoers but also by lax corporate and Government standards of years gone by.
 
MARY BUYOFSKI
Perth Amboy
 
High Cost of Visiting
 I am in absolute agreement that the New Jersey coast should be off limits to those of us who are not privileged enough to own a half-million-dollar beach house or drop 3 grand in rent for two weeks "down the shore."
 
TRISH VANNI

The Best Beaches
 I just returned from a stay in Ocean City, Md., and I have stayed at many beaches along the East Coast. The Wildwood beaches are the absolute best. What are they doing right down there?
 
ERIC HOWARD
Somerset
 
Sharing the Shore
 While I can understand the concerns of those who live in beach towns, there are many more towns that do not have the availability of beaches. Garden State residents should have the absolute right to enjoy all the wonderful beaches throughout the state. If this access is prohibited, what's next, a law that only residents, not visitors, can travel through or be in their town?
 
SHIRLEY FRAZIER
Paterson
 
Share the Burden
 Tax money needs to be allocated to bear the costs of maintenance, but that burden should be shared, as should the sands. Legislators who promote tax money for beach replenishing should also work for equal access.
 
JUDITH OWENS
Brick
 
Fees Are Too High
 One of the things I absolutely hate about New Jersey is the concept of having to pay for access to the ocean or beaches. When I lived in California, I could go to any beach any time for no fee because the beach is all public land. The pay beaches have lost my tourist dollars forever.

HEADLINE: The Long, Shared Summer

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: SEA GIRT

 BODY:
TERRY McGUCKIN was one of the originals in the big, boxy cedar-shake Colonial house a few hundred feet from the shore in Sea Girt. That was summer 1990.
 Mary Bridget Schmid knew Terry from Bayonne High School and got into the house three or four summers ago. Patty Hardina knew Mary Bridget from the University of Dayton, a Marianist Catholic school in Ohio. 
 Patty had long known Sea Girt, a gracious resort town a mile square with block after block of fine old gabled houses with cupolas and wide lawns and wraparound porches. Four or five summers ago, she answered a Village Voice ad and bought a share in another big seaside house in nearby Manasquan.
 "I wasn't thrilled," Patty said of the Manasquan house. "People had their names on their jelly. Once I took a guy's salt and he got upset."
 When Mary Bridget and Patty got together during the winter, Mary Bridget would tell stories about the good times and the great people she had met at 3 Brooklyn Boulevard, Sea Girt -- the bicycling, the barbecues, the beer parties, the long days on the sand, blanket-hopping from one friend to another. The friendly young men, many Roman Catholic like them, with good jobs. The friendships, the engagements, the subsequent marriages.
 "That's all I'd heard about -- the shore," said Patty. "I really wanted to meet people and stuff." That first weekend at 3 Brooklyn three summers ago, she lugged her suitcase up the steps and into a house where she knew hardly anyone. "I walked into a strange house. To this day I could be in the wrong house."
 But it wouldn't much matter. At any of the big seaside houses that rent to groups of adults, Patty would be part of a long summer tradition, like sunscreen, sweet corn and heavy Friday afternoon traffic. For Patty and thousands of adults -- especially those in their 20's, and 30's -- summer began months ago with a down payment on a bed and a corner of the refrigerator. In return, the space between Memorial Day and Labor Day becomes an unbroken series of weekends by the sea, where the house, the roommates, the routine are comforting and familiar, where the days are taken up with sports or nothing at all, and the nights are filled with rounds of parties and always the hope of meeting somebody nice, somebody really right.
 Patty sits upright in a porch chair as she talks. Around her are a good handful of the 17 summer renters -- 14 full shares, who can come every weekend, and 3 half shares, who are allowed to come every other weekend. The porch is wide and inviting, as big as a living room, with open spaces between the pillars through which the beach is visible. An Irish flag flies in front of the house across the street. Sea Girt and Spring Lake are known as the Irish Riviera, towns where American Irish Catholics traditionally congregate. Each little town of about 2,000 has its own Catholic church.
 The air is oppressively hot. Mary Bridget, 29, an account manager for a hazardous-waste removal company, and Patty, also 29 and a vice-president in sales for Salomon Brothers, had a late lunch of salads with bottled low-fat dressing. Now they are passing around fat-free nacho Doritos, critiquing them and comparing them with the full-fat kind. Mary Bridget is outgoing, with dark hair down her back. Patty is demure and tidy, with neatly cut straight blond hair. Russ Mollica, who's 35, with an easygoing demeanor, digs out a handful.
 Before coming to 3 Brooklyn, Russ, who owns a Hoboken computer-import company, had spent a few summers at the Manasquan house where Patty was. He didn't like it much, either. "People came home at 4 in the morning," he said. "They were screaming and jumping off the roof." After a struggle, he says, this house has a "good group of people with similar living values."

IN other words, people in their 30's or close to it. People with good jobs, many in sales or accounting. People without sharp edges, who'll blend with the others. People who, for economic and philosophical reasons, prefer the Jersey Shore to the Hamptons. The shore is closer for New Jersey and New York City people, and cheaper; dinner out is a cheeseburger, not an arugula salad with nasturtiums, and party dress is clean shorts and sneakers, not silk and heels.
 Most important, "people with similar living values" are people who are single.
 "Ultimately everybody wants to meet somebody and stop doing the singles thing," said Patty.
 Of course, the immediate purpose of a seaside house is to play and see friends and rest after the winter and the workweek. But an underlying purpose is for men to meet women and women to meet men. Sea Girt in the summer is a great place to do this. The routine is easygoing. People who, in the city, would have to schedule a meeting far in advance drop by unannounced at one another's houses. The entire weekend is a big get-together, at the beach, on the porch, at bars and restaurants. It's a lot easier to connect with people lounging in shorts on a porch than sitting upright on an ergonomic office chair dressed in a business suit. Last year three couples, friends of the people at 3 Brooklyn, married.
 At summer's end, the friendships continue. The 3 Brooklyn housemates get together for drinks and dinner once a month. In the fall, they gather for the Far Hills Hunt. On New Year's Eve they party. Last year 10 women vacationed together at Newport.
 "Everybody I've dated for the past five or six years I've met here," Patty said. "I can't remember when I didn't meet at least one guy."
 Naturally there are customs, if not actual rules, governing behavior between men and women. If two people from the same house are attracted, they should wait until Labor Day to date. Housemates tend to treat one another as buddies, family members, people to whom they can confide while wearing old bathrobes. A man and a woman who were dating lived at 3 Brooklyn last summer; their fights made the others squirm.
 In the hierarchy of summer places, Sea Girt and Spring Lake are classy, while the nearby beach towns of Belmar and Manasquan attract a younger, wilder, messier and more impecunious crowd. At a summer house in Belmar, for instance, a group of at least 15 young men -- all of whom appeared to be in their late teens or early 20's and none of whom wanted their names used -- could be seen one overcast afternoon hunched around the tube, chanting at the set, swigging beer and smoking marijuana. The dishes piled in the sink, wet towels on the floor, seemed to create no tension, for there must be the concept of cleanliness for the lack of it to be troublesome.
 These young men would not be welcome at houses in Sea Girt or Spring Lake, nor could they afford it. The average summer rental in Sea Girt -- from Memorial Day to Labor Day -- costs $12,000 to $15,000. Three Brooklyn, a five-bedroom house built in the early 1900's, rents for $25,000 for the summer. It is owned by William Doyle, a Vermont State Senator who grew up in Sea Girt and whose father was Mayor there. Renting the grand old house lets him keep a presence in Sea Girt. He rents it for the winter, as well, and visits it with his wife and children in fall and spring. He's pleased with the current renters, though some in Sea Girt would like to do away with summer groups, all summer groups. Virginia Zientek, president of the Sea Girt Chamber of Commerce, opposed the group rentals, echoing the feeling of some longtime residents who regard summer people as noisy, messy and irresponsible.
 Terry Hemmer, the real estate agent who rents 3 Brooklyn, called her summer renters "professional adults."
 "We sincerely love them," she said. "They treat it like it's their own. The house is always left in immaculate condition."
 The rent is about $1,800 for a full share. The extra money goes for toilet paper, mustard, electric bills. Terry McGuckin and another housemate take care of the business at 3 Brooklyn. They talk to the real estate agent, recruit and approve new renters and collect the money, which must be paid in full by the preceding January. They tote up the phone bills and buy such essentials as coffee and hot dogs and margarita mix.

EACH renter buys his own food. The kitchen, which is as big as a Manhattan studio and has counter space and cupboards around its perimeter, is divided into sections. They keep their cans of soup in the cupboard, their milk and butter sticks in the extremely jammed refrigerator, and their snacks and liquor on the counter. Lined up are bottles of zinfandel, vodka, peach schnapps, tequila and Diet Pepsi. Meals don't warrant much attention. Breakfast is coffee and cereal or a muffin, eaten on the porch. Lunch is peanut butter or a Big Mac. Dinner is hot dogs or burgers or chicken on the grill or a sub sandwich or whatever can be scrounged at the Saturday night keg parties around town.
 An upstairs room has five beds, a downstairs one has four. The beds are narrow and the rooms have a dormitory look. In adjacent living rooms are three pull-out sofas on which guests -- or renters, when the house is full -- sleep. The renters pay for a maid to clean each week.
The weekend days in Sea Girt, as in any summer community, have an easy, holiday rhythm. Mornings, get a cup of coffee, sit sleepily on the porch in shortie pajamas or shorts and a T-shirt. Drive to the golf range. Bicycle or roller-blade. Lie on the beach, swim in the sea.
 Saturday nights mean big parties, and each of about 15 group houses, all with 10 to 20 single working people in their 30's, takes a turn. Every renter in the host house contributes $50 to $75 for beer, sandwiches and salads. Hundreds of people come: summer renters, their friends, weekend visitors staying at seaside inns. Many have come to Sea Girt summer after summer and have gotten to know most everyone. The big group houses are within blocks of one another, so guests can drink without worrying about driving. The hosts warn the neighbors and promise to clean up. They tell the police, who will come at 9:45 and make sure the party's closed by 10, when Sea Girt, by law, must be quiet.
 Saturdays build up to the big event, the party, and Sundays, in the party's aftermath, are a palpable lull. At the end of the summer, people dress up in long gowns and tuxedos for the Seashell Ball, with profits donated to St. Dennis's parochial school. The rest of the summer are T-shirt-and-beer parties.
 On one recent Saturday, party time is drawing near. Terry, Patty, Mary Bridget and Kristine Tedesco, who handles insurance for a New York City company, with a few others, crowd into the bedroom with four narrow beds and one bureau. They pull out baskets of shampoo, Nivea, razors, toothbrushes, loofas.

TERRY helps Mary Bridget lace up the back of a swingy, washed-demin dress. Patty sits cross-legged in front of the door mirror, blow-drying her hair, pulling it around the brush, blowing it into fine soft waves. Nonnie Narin, a TWA flight attendant, paints dark lines across her eyelids. It's a scene from Saturday night at a college dorm, which summer at Sea Girt greatly resembles, except, as one renter remarks, people have money and don't have to study.
 Patty, hair smooth, face pink with make-up, is neat in bright white shorts, a striped sleeveless shirt, and gold earrings and a gold chain necklace.
 "That's what you're wearing?" she asks Michael Chinque, her voice incredulous.
 "Yeah," he replied, looking down at his worn T-shirt. "The Daffy Duck."
 Patty turns to Brian Quirke, a Paterson accountant, eyes his cotton shirt and says, "You need to be ironed." He smiles.
 The party is a block away at a big Victorian house with a three-sided porch. People holding paper cups of beer are crowded onto the porch and spread in clumps across the lawn, around the beer kegs and the food. Some stand and cheer at the four-foot high slanted ice block with three tracks. One person, hunched at the bottom, mouth open, is trying to catch streams of vodka another pours from the top.
 Snatches of talk flow and fade. People approach and smile and hover, keeping intent watch on the movements of others. A self-described M.B.A., who one of the 3 Brooklyn Boulevard women thought was cute, walks off in the middle of her sentence.
 By 10, the party is over and the 3 Brooklyn men and women are back on their own porch. The evening hasn't panned out. Nobody's connected with anybody. But the housemates have one another. Several, including Russ Mollica, gather for a game of Pictionary. Others, however tired they may be, soldier on. The scene is moving to Gilly's, a Sea Girt bar.
 "I feel like going to bed," says Mary Bridget. "But I should go to Gilly's. There's not time to wallow in self-pity. You have to maximize your opportunities. That's why I should go to Gilly's."
 "Dave asked me where my tan was," says Patty morosely.
 "Bummer," says Russ.
 "I dated him once in the city -- he's kind of a wacko," Patty says.
 "Not a fun night," says Mary Bridget.
 Gilly's is packed. People squeeze by and consider themselves well settled with enough open space to stand. Fetching beer through the crowd is an ordeal. Talk is shouted. The 3 Brooklyn men and women stand together, eyeing acquaintances and strangers.
 Back home after an hour or so of this, at 1 or 2 in the morning, 3 Brooklyn rattles with noise and action. The Pictionary game is rousing, exciting the players far more than the keg party did. One woman is nuzzling a friend in the living room. Patty settles into a porch chair for a while and then rises to go to bed. The house is too noisy to easily sleep, so she'll turn on a machine that makes sounds like ocean waves.
 In the morning, the friends sleepily make their way to porch chairs, balancing coffee cups and critiquing the party. Russ brings back the newspapers. Brian heads out to bicycle. Mary Bridget and Terry drive to 10 o'clock Mass. Shortly, in just a few hours, everyone will head back to apartments in Bayonne or Paterson or New York City, apartments where most live alone. Only five more working days before they'll be back together again.

HEADLINE: Together, 2 Magazines See Brighter Future

BYLINE: By ANN COSTELLO 

DATELINE: HARRISON

 BODY:
IT was a marriage of convenience between two little-known magazines, both aimed at international business managers. Separately, each was losing money. Together, they hoped to share staff in several departments and settle down to a long and happy -- and profitable -- life together.
Few Westchester residents were aware that one of the magazines, International Business, with a circulation of 62,000, had been published in Westchester for seven years and had been based for the last three in a shimmering glass box at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison. Fewer still knew that the other magazine, Foreign Trade, was in McLean, Va. 
 Quietly, the British owners of Foreign Trade bought International Business on June 15 and immediately set about downsizing and restructuring it. International Magazine's staff members are now preparing to move from their spacious suite with its views of lushly landscaped grounds and adequate parking to a smaller space in Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
The 10 or so remaining staff members are optimistic about the move. Especially upbeat is David E. Moore, a Rye resident for 43 years and the founder, editorial director and former chairman of International Business.
"A magazine is an extension of one's ego, an extension of myself," Mr. Moore said, "My staff has made this a top-quality magazine, but I sold it because I wanted it to grow."
The new owners, Labyrinth Group, a British company involved in books, videos and magazines, announced the sale in London on June 19. Labyrinth bought the magazine from American International Publishing Corporation for 1.5 million shares of Labyrinth stock now, plus a two-year note for $120,000 and the right to buy 600,000 shares at a later date.
The day after the sale, the new owners set about to further reduce staff size, which Mr. Moore had already whittled down over the last year. They also combined several departments with identical departments at Foreign Trade, which has a circulation of 33,000. Mr. Moore will be staying on at International Business as editorial director and will sit on the Labyrinth board. He said he hoped to continue his monthly column. He and his wife, Katherine, vice president of the Katonah Museum of Art, love London, he said, and look forward to making four trips a year there for Labyrinth board meetings. In the meantime, he will commute to the magazine's new offices in midtown Manhattan.
The new editor in chief, Lori Ioannou, had been a senior editor at the magazine for three years and enjoyed her 25-minute reverse commute by car from Bayside, Queens. The trip by train to midtown Manhattan will be considerably longer, but Ms. Ioannou's attention is focused less on commuting than on the magazine's future.
As she put together the August issue, her first, she said her hope for the success of International Business lay in her belief that its niche, the "international arena, is the wave of the future for business journalism."
The chairman of Labyrinth Group, Gerard Mizrahi, who lives in London, appeared in the Harrison offices the day after the sale and began the restructuring. He was joined by Labyrinth's executive director, Peter Campbell, who will supervise the marriage of the two magazines in their production, editorial design and advertising staffs over the next few months.
"We intend to keep the two magazines operating as two parallel publications," Mr. Mizrahi said, describing their two audiences as "non-overlapping." He explained that Foreign Trade "talks to smaller companies, and is focused on trade -- a practical approach," while International Business aims at larger companies' managers and covers "global issues and strategies."
The marriage of the two magazines and their cost-saving move out of Westchester raise questions about the commercial vacancy rate in Westchester and the health of the magazine industry.
Seven years is left on International Business's 10-year lease on the lush 7,917-square-foot suite at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue. The building is managed by Legacy Management, whose president, Tom Julius, said he felt that the space would be quickly sublet. "The building is 100 percent leased, and we have many inquiries about space every day," he said.
Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, estimated that the overall commercial vacancy rate in the county was 25 to 35 percent. He cautioned that some management companies count space as leased even if the tenants have moved out, so that true vacancy rates are difficult to determine.
"Fifteen percent used to be considered high," he said. "But, since the recession in 1990, the commercial sector vacancy rate has been much higher."
As to the overall health of the magazine industry, James R. Guthrie, executive vice president at Magazine Publishers of America, said that "a strong first quarter" had resulted in "a 10-year record for first half ad page and revenue gains." Translation: the magazine industry is experiencing a boom in advertising sales. But several New York advertising agencies said that the increase in the price of paper by at least 35 percent since the middle of last year had hurt many magazines, causing some to take "drastic measures."
Paul Schnabel, who worked as a salesman at International Business for four years before becoming publisher of Foreign Trade in February, was named publisher of both magazines after the sale. Mr. Schnabel said that Foreign Trade had grown "75 percent in ad sales in the first six months this year" but that International Business had experienced flat sales over the last year.
He said the move to Manhattan would be completed by the end of July and would serve to "better position International Business as a mainstream business magazine." He pointed out that before the purchase the sales staff spent 40 percent of its time taking trains to midtown Manhattan to meet with clients.
"The consolidation has been challenging," he said, "but it was needed to better compete in the market. Divided, we were in the red. Combined, we're in the black."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Retirement's Worried Face

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
LIKE so many of his generation, Ronald McPherson switched careers in his 40's, going from social work to computers. But the job switching and then illness shrank his once-generous pensions. And now at age 56, Mr. McPherson finds himself scrambling in part-time work to save enough for retirement. "I never thought this would happen to me," he said.
Or take Fern Marx, who is 59. She quit college to marry and raise children, but at 40 found herself divorced. Like so many women her age in the same fix, Ms. Marx managed to build a late-in-life career, earning $60,000 as a researcher in Wellesley, Mass. In retirement, that will shrink to $20,000. "I have no choice but to work into my 70's," she said. 
 The great retirement crisis, so widely anticipated for the Baby Boomers who begin to reach retirement age in 2010, is not waiting for the millenium. Already it is quietly engulfing millions of Americans now in their last few years on the job. They had counted on golden years in retirement, and this may not be.
Since World War II, Social Security and company-paid pensions have been the two main pillars of the American retirement system. But the pensions are disappearing, and Social Security, while still intact, is the subject of such gloomy forecasts that the Ronald McPhersons and Fern Marxes of America try not to count on it in planning for retirement. In the transition to a new system -- one that requires people to pay for much of their own retirement from their own savings -- they see themselves caught short, without enough reliable income from pensions or savings or Social Security to maintain their old living standards.
Their stories, and their struggles, are giving younger workers an advance look at a future that is scary because it is still so opaque. Will some of the old system be preserved? If not, what in particular will happen to the huge middle class now earning $30,000 to $100,000 a year? Millions in this wage bracket still count on Social Security and company pensions for the bulk of their retirement income. If they now have to pay their own way, how much must they save? Is it $1 million, $3 million, $6 million?
"No one really knows," said Olena Berg, the Labor Department's assistant secretary for pensions and welfare benefits. "But any amount you save is going to leave you better off than if you don't save that amount. We are getting tens of thousands of inquiries about these issues. Clearly there is anxiety out there."
Clearly. The Baby Boomers are shedding an earlier silver-spoon optimism about their future, surveys show. And behind the Boomers, Mr. McPherson's children and other young people in their 20's are watching their parents' distress with growing apprehension, wondering if they, too, will be forced into harder times in old age.
The spreading nervousness is pushing millions of American workers toward a reluctant self-reliance. "Whether we like it or not, we are heading de facto to a system that has to depend on private savings," said James P. Smith, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation and the author of a just-published study with some unusual findings.
Self-financed retirement may be the wave of the future. But analyzing data from a survey of 7,600 households, Mr. Smith found that even many wealthy families lack enough savings to maintain their lifestyles in retirement, without considerable help from the old standbys, company-paid pensions and Social Security. Saving money is hard. By Mr. Smith's estimate, a four-person household needs $70,000 in annual income to begin saving significantly -- quite a threshold for a nation with a median household income of only $37,000.
"Many Americans, despite this threshold, have started to save, particularly those over 45," said Diane Colasanto, president of Princeton Survey Research. "But very few think this will lead to a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. They feel crunched."
 
What It Takes to Retire
 Wall Street fosters the anxiety. Brokerage houses and mutual funds are deeply engaged in the profitable business of investing the billions building up in retirement accounts. And their estimates of how much people must accumulate for retirement are often open ended.
Merrill Lynch, for example, estimates that a husband and wife earning $85,000 apiece when they retire together at age 65 will need at least $1.5 million in savings to come away with $100,000 a year in retirement income. But that estimate assumes that inflation will be mild and that $26,000 of the $100,000 will still come from Social Security.
Maybe. The Social Security fund is expected to run dry by 2029, and in anticipation, various plans are already afoot to scale back. One proposal would skew the payments toward the poor while cutting back what the wealthy receive, including Merrill's couple. Or perhaps in the 21st century, the Federal Government will halt the inflation adjustments in Social Security payments that since the 1960's have lifted the elderly out of poverty.
A similar cutback is well under way for company-paid pensions. These had their origin in World War II, when companies circumvented a wage freeze by offering pensions to their workers. What evolved was a system of guaranteeing the payment of a pension that often exceeded 50 percent of a worker's income, if he or she stayed on the job long enough.
These pensions, called "defined benefit" plans, reached their peak in 1985, when they covered 30 million people, and then went into a continuing decline. New rules raised their cost, and many corporations, engaged in downsizing, no longer wanted to encourage workers to stay for decades. A new system of "defined contribution" plans came into existence instead, and mushroomed.
Under the new system, workers themselves pay for retirement by depositing a percentage of their wages into special savings accounts, often called 401(k) plans, after the section of the law that authorized tax breaks for these accounts. Employers frequently match a part of their workers' contributions, but that is the extent of their obligation. When a worker retires, his pension consists only of the savings in his 401(K) and the return those savings earn. The company is off the hook.
Early this month, the Clinton Administration seemed to encourage the shift away from company-guaranteed pensions and Social Security. At a Labor Department gathering, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called on Americans to save more, but he demurred at the suggestion that he had given his blessing to the new retirement system. "We are simply acknowledging," he said later, "that where we are right now, a lot of people have to take action on their own to protect themselves."
 
Covering the Shortfall
 That is what Ms. Marx is discovering. After her divorce, she went back to school, took a job, and in 1980 became a researcher for the Center for Research on Women at Wellesley College. But she was too late. Like so many women in their 50's, drawn late into jobs both by the women's movement and necessity, Ms. Marx has not accumulated enough years to build up much in the way of benefits or retirement income from the 401(k)-type savings account that both she and her employer contribute to.
"My guess is that I will get about $10,000 or so a year from my savings and roughly the same from Social Security, but who knows what will happen to Social Security," she said. "Given the finiteness of my resources, I can't think about retiring."
Whatever happens, Ms. Marx probably won't be destitute. If she can't go on working -- and a bad back already limits her hours on the job -- there is a $200,000 home that could be sold, and $200,000 in other savings, apart from her retirement account, that could be drawn down -- savings squeezed from years of spartan living. But each such step would mean a harder old age.
"It is all very confusing to be 60," Ms. Marx said, referring to her next birthday, this month. "I can't see myself as an older person. I see myself, and must see myself, as someone who is still middle aged."
Mr. McPherson still hopes to stop working at 62. By one standard, he and his wife are rich. Although he brings home only $12,000 a year from teaching computer courses at San Bernardino Valley College, his wife, Gail, who is 42, earns $80,000 a year as the manager of a waste water plant for the City of Riverside. Their combined income puts them in the upper 20 percent nationally and they own an idyllic three-bedroom house in the mountains above San Bernardino. "It is beautiful here," Mr. McPherson said.
But maintaining this lifestyle in retirement will be dicey. The McPhersons are just finishing the process of raising five children -- three hers and two his by first marriages -- and they have only $176,000 in savings today. Again, by national standards, that is high for the McPhersons' age group, Mr. Smith found in his study, but probably not high enough to pay for retirement.
The McPhersons estimate they'll need $5,000 a month, before taxes, "to live comfortably in retirement." The income from savings must bring in at least $1,000 of that total, which means the current savings, now mostly invested in mutual funds, must return a healthy 7 percent a year, and more if inflation kicks in. He had once expected to collect $2,700 a month in pensions, but this has dwindled to $1,700. There will be $800 in Social Security. Now he is counting on his wife's pension, which he hopes will be $1,500 a month. (She has no Social Security from her city Government job.)
Mr. McPherson's retirement plans began to go wrong in 1986, when he resigned after 20 years as a social worker for Orange County and, switching careers, became a computer systems executive for the State of California. "I burned out," he said. "I could no longer take the strain of dysfunctional families."
The job switch, at age 48, meant giving up the $1,700 a month pension that Mr. McPherson would have received at age 62. Instead, he accepted a reduced $1,000 a month, starting at age 50, and it is this pension that the McPhersons now use to help build up their savings.
The computer job also promised a $1,700 a month pension, if Mr. McPherson had lasted until age 62. But sudden, severe illness -- a huge threat in any retirement system based on an individual's own hard work and savings -- struck Mr. McPherson two years ago, at age 54. The illness resembled chronic fatigue syndrome and it forced him into early retirement. That meant a cut in his state pension to only $700 a month.
He is well now, but his stepson, Rex Briggs, is marked by the experience of watching his parents' retirement income dwindle. At 23, Mr. Briggs is doing quite well himself, earning nearly $40,000 a year as a researcher in Norwalk, Conn., for Yankelovich Partners, a public opinion polling firm.
Most of his contemporaries, he finds in his research, are too burdened by expenses to save, although they think constantly about it. They have college loans to repay and credit card debts stemming largely from the costs of a social life aimed not just at pleasure, but also at the important task of finding mates.
Mr. Briggs is a saver, having started last year just weeks after he married his college sweetheart, Carmel. "When I see what is happening to my parents," he said, "the thought crosses my mind, what if I have to help them? And I absolutely would. What would that do to my retirement?"
So he is putting away roughly $500 a month in a 401(k) plan. The couple lives mostly on her salary as an accountant, a salary roughly equal to his. They still have debts from her college days, but they save anyway, by scrimping. They own only one car (she drops him at work), rent a modest apartment (home ownership is far off in their minds) and give up the old pleasures.
" I am torn," Mr. Briggs said, "between enjoying my youth and being scared to death that there won't be enough saved when it comes time for me to get out of the work force."
 
A Hero of Saving
 Already, the emerging retirement system is producing its heroes. Manuel Matsos is one. During the Labor Department's gathering to encourage savings, Mr. Reich introduced Mr. Matsos, who is 40, as an example of how to save for retirement on wages of $60,000 to $70,000 a year. Mr. Matsos, who was chosen from a focus group, offered two attributes that average Americans should embrace, Mr. Reich said, "so that when 65 comes, they can retire and relax."
First, take a second job if your wife stays home with the two sons, as Mrs. Matsos does. Mr. Matsos is plant manager for a company that makes cosmetic samples, and in his off hours he is the guitar playing leader of a band that plays at weddings and festivals in Baltimore's Greek-American community, of which Mr. Matsos is a member.
"I had chosen to work two jobs so that my wife could stay home," he said, "but I wasn't channeling the income properly, and I realized that if I did not change, I would have to work in my retirement years. Now 15 percent goes into savings."
That happens because of the second attribute that Mr. Reich seeks to promote. The Matsos family shuns consumerism. Given the family's income, cutting back sharply is the only way to save. Mr. Matsos is convinced of this, although his asceticism does not always sit easily. "Showing me living in a row home and driving used cars is not the image I want to project to the Greek community," he said.
Nevertheless, the Matsos family avoids fast food restaurants; the children spend too much in them. Summer vacations in a rented condo on the Maryland shore are taken with parents and siblings, who share the cost. Impulse buying is out, and coupon shopping is de rigueur. Only lessons for the children are spared.
"My oldest son is studying music and is enrolled in martial arts," Mr. Matsos said, "and if I have to drive my car another year to do this, I will."
 
A Pension in Doubt
 Angie Rogers has no hope of living on savings in retirement. At 45, she has worked 26 years at Fieldcrest Cannon Mill in Columbus, Ga., and today she earns $8 an hour operating a machine that folds towels. Like so many low-wage Americans, Ms. Rogers is counting on a Social Security pension that would pay her roughly $12,000 a year, or 72 percent of her current $16,600 base wage.
Nevertheless, for the first time, Ms. Rogers, who is single and childless, is accumulating cash savings. Five years ago, her union negotiated a 401(k) plan to which the employees can contribute up to 10 percent of their wage. The company partly matches up to 4 percent. Ms. Rogers contributes 6 percent of her wage, cutting back on new clothes and dinners out to do this.
While the savings won't pay for retirement, Ms. Rogers said, they are a buffer against poverty, and they come at a time when she is beginning to wonder whether Social Security will really be there for her.
"I sure do worry about it," she said. "Being in the baby boom generation, plenty of us are going to draw Social Security, and if we all start drawing, then before I am very old, the money won't be there."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Bubble Grows Ever Bigger

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
So much for that collapse of technology stocks.
Last week the Philadelphia stock exchange index of semiconductor stocks set three record highs. Even with a dip on Friday, the index is up 103 percent for 1995. The previous week's plunge of more than 10 percent in a couple of hours is almost forgotten. 
 The recovery shows that faith in technology lives on, especially among the people running some of the largest mutual funds in the country. It is they who bought heavily to halt the fall and get prices rising again.
The mini-panic of July 19 was largely confined to the hours between noon and 2 p.m., when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 100 points and tech stocks did even worse. A rally ensued, wiping out most of the losses by the close. Would this never have happened if some money managers had not gone out to lunch that day? What would happen if they took vacations?
There will be no forecast in this column of when the tech-stock mania will end. It is widely believed that no price is too high for many tech stocks, simply because technology is in the process of transforming every human activity. To a visionary, that sounds inspiring. To a contrarian, it is reminiscent of the belief 15 years ago that inflation would never stop and no price was too high for an oil stock.
Just for argument's sake, however, let's assume that Michael Brown, Microsoft's chief financial officer, has good reason to pronounce himself mystified by that stock's surge this year. And then consider what will happen to Microsoft and a lot of other tech companies if Wall Street, for reasons good or bad, does turn negative some day.
One answer is that the stock options that are now making employees and executives wealthy will suddenly look less attractive. That will create two classes of people at those companies: the ones who got in early and the ones who didn't. With the jealousies will come demands from the late arrivals to be compensated more in cash and less in paper that may never pay off. Right now, many tech companies are able to pay relatively low salaries to key employees, with options making up the difference.
It is then that those companies will regret one of their great victories of 1994, when they used political pull to force accounting regulators to back off from making companies show an expense for the value of options handed out. Having won that fight, these companies can continue to report inflated profits. But if cash salaries someday have to be raised to compensate for the fact few options are being cashed in any more, that will mean that reported profits will suffer. So the companies will see their reported costs rise even as their employees are in fact getting less and are unhappy about it. And that drag on reported profits could help to delay the eventual recovery of tech stocks.
All that is, of course, sometime in the future. Now tech is king of Wall Street, and the gambling frenzy is on. The mutual funds that bet on technology are the market leaders, and get more money from eager investors. The funds use that cash to buy the same stocks, which sends them up even higher and brings in more money. Buyers who focus on value are getting out, but that doesn't matter.
Someday, however, it will. And after the fall both those who bought the stocks -- either directly or through mutual funds -- and those who work for the tech companies themselves will wake up with long-lasting hangovers.

To the Editor:
"Should I Have Left an Hour Earlier?" (June 18) reconfirmed my disappointment in executives who have done nothing to make the workplace more family friendly. Sadly, baby boomers who espoused a more family-centered life have chosen accommodation with the status quo. 
 Workaholism affects both families and society. Workaholics' spouses may be precluded from seeking challenging careers, and children who feel abandoned by a frequently absent parent may develop behavioral problems.
Those who choose to make family life paramount often must work at unsatisfying or low-paying jobs because the "good" jobs go to those willing to sacrifice family life and leisure time. Unemployment rises as companies downsize, increasing the workloads of decreasing numbers of employees, who become less productive from fatigue and stress. One prescription: make Juliet B. Schor's "The Overworked American" required reading for all chief executives, managers and business students.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK 1945;
The War Was Ending. Times Square Exploded. Change Was Coming.

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
FOR millions of New Yorkers waiting anxiously in Times Square, World War II ended at 7:03 P.M. Aug. 14, 1945. At that moment, the 15,000 light bulbs on the Times Tower's zipper sign spelled out five words that touched off a tumultuous celebration: "Official -- Truman announces Japanese surrender."
After surviving years of scarcity and sacrifice, with London bombed, Paris humbled and Rome, Berlin and Tokyo occupied by foreign troops, New York had suddenly been elevated from the nation's major metropolis to the unrivaled world capital. 
 "All City 'Lets Go,' " a New York Times front-age headline exulted the next day, merely hinting at the outpouring to come later with V-J Day and the formal signing of the surrender. If the day's jubilant headlines reported the present, some of the advertisements suggested the future.
One, aimed at executives in the nation's largest manufacturing city, exhorted: "Bring Your Factory to Texas." The ad pointedly cited Texas's tax advantages, a large, semi-skilled labor force idled by peace and the potential markets developing in the Southwest. Another ad, from the Academy of Languages, promised readers with an eye on Latin America or East Harlem that by taking advantage of "the famous Ibarra method" they could learn Spanish in record time.
And in the classifieds (in which apartment seekers and others still insistently identified themselves as "Christian"), the greatest demand for houses was in the suburbs. Typical was an ad placed by an executive with two school-age children who was looking for a place with three or four bedrooms within one hour's commuting from New York City.
Today, the youngest World War II recruit would be close to 70 years old. Of all the people living in New York City today, fewer than one in four were even born in 1945, much less remember firsthand what the city was like then.
In the summer of 1945, New York was a city riding a wave of triumph, even as the undertow of the future began to tug at its feet. It was a time of unbridled self-confidence. The city had contributed 850,000 servicemen to the war effort. The war had transformed New York into the capital of the world. By 1946, seven airlines offered regular service between Queens and Europe, and the United Nations would later settled on the East Side of Manhattan, where the Modernist headquarters of an organization devoted to peace displaced a stand of odorous slaughterhouses.
As Jan Morris recalled in her book "Manhattan '45" (Oxford University Press, 1987), a promotional brochure from Bankers Trust proclaimed that New Yorkers were a people "to whom nothing is impossible."
"There were no strangers in New York yesterday," Alexander Feinberg wrote in The Times, reporting on the celebration of Japan's surrender.
But a Depression, a world war, migrations and government policies had already laid the foundation for profound political, social and economic change.
During the war, shortages of food-ration stamps for grocery purchases led more people to eat out. (Restaurants were serving eight million meals a day during the war compared with three million before.) Women moved in droves into the work force, replacing soldiers. The dearth of housing construction, coupled with an influx of defense workers, produced another shortage whose mixed legacy endures today: rent controls. When the war ended, 75,000 New Yorkers were still waiting for telephone service because so few new instruments were being manufactured. (By choice, not necessity, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia did not have a telephone on his desk at City Hall). A few months after V-J Day, 25,000 women mobbed Macy's after a sales clerk posted a sign advertising nylons.
Still, New York had not let a war a continent away (but within U-boat sight of New York harbor) disrupt its routine any more than necessary. The national curfew was midnight, but Mayor La Guardia insisted that New Yorkers be allowed to drink, legally, until 1 A.M. On West 56th Street, Miyako's, a traditional Japanese restaurant, took its orders from loyal customers -- not from Tokyo -- throughout the war. Broadway was awash with blockbusters, including "Carousel," "Harvey," "Oklahoma!" "On the Town" and a play, "The Glass Menagerie," by a popular new writer, Tennessee Williams. The city's baseball teams were doing less well on Aug. 14, 1945: The Yankees and Giants each in fourth place, the Dodgers in third.
 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS
During the war years, Brooklyn still had its own daily newspaper (Queens had two, the Bronx one) and its own baseball team (run by Branch Rickey, who, a year later, broke the sport's color barrier by recruiting Jackie Robinson). Harlem was still a mecca for aristocrats of black culture. Downtown, Manhattan was still home to Augustus Van Horne, the last descendant of Peter Stuyvesant.
In the summer and fall of 1945, millions of them turned out for separate ticker tape parades to welcome Eisenhower, de Gaulle, Gen. Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and Claire Chennault. Harry S. Truman visited that fall, in what was described as the first time a sitting President paid his respects to a New York City mayor at City Hall. La Guardia read the funnies on radio during a newspaper strike that year (providing, perhaps, besides the airport that bears his name, the most durable memory of his mayoralty).
But if, apart from the anxiety about loved ones overseas, the war years seem in retrospect like the good old days, they were not that good (though, in some respects, statistically, at least, better than today). About 165,000 families were living doubled up. Welfare consumed $70 million or nearly 10 cents of every dollar of the city's budget (compared with nearly 25 cents for the Human Resources Administration today). The poor were growing so out of hand that the Mayor tightened a ban on begging in the subway. New mothers were leaving about 1,000 babies a year at the New York Foundling Hospital.
New York, as it has always been, was a changing city in the 1940's. And, as always, the instruments of that change were considered suspect -- even when they were fellow Americans lured, like newcomers before and since, by the promise of better life in the form of defense industry jobs.
Puerto Ricans, outgrowing the island's agricultural economy, began migrating to the city during the decade in record numbers -- tripling their population to nearly 190,000 by 1950. As a result of an influx from the American South, the city's black population rose by more than 60 percent.
But, much more so than today, the city was racially segregated. It was still acceptable then not only to admit it but to justify it. Sacrificing civil rights for an opportunity to lure private investment to vitally needed housing, in 1943 La Guardia reluctantly agreed to municipal tax breaks that would enable the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to build Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan -- apartments for which blacks need not apply. As the company's president explained at the time, "Negroes and whites don't mix."
The City Council adopted a resolution prohibiting city participation in any similar projects unless the agreements with private developers included an anti-discrimination clause. La Guardia, seeking to reconcile seemingly intractable goals, wrote the insurance company that if the tenant selection process at Stuyvesant Town were ever challenged in court, the city's position would be that racial discrimination should not be tolerated. Charles V. Hamilton, researching his biography of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., later discovered a copy of the letter in the Mayor's files with a handwritten notation: "Not sent."
The following year, Metropolitan Life announced plans for another housing project, the Riverton in Harlem. That was the same year that Harlem proudly elected Powell as New York's first black Congressman, projecting his advocacy involving issues like Stuyvesant Town onto the national stage and onto the House floor, where using the word "nigger" was still tolerated.
In Brooklyn's Little Harlem, as Bedford-Stuyvesant was known, a grand jury investigation concluded that "it has become dangerous and unsafe to traverse the streets of this area before and particularly after dark." The grand jurors took pains, though, to blame the situation not on race but on lapses in law enforcement and on social conditions, including too many people illegally collecting home relief and living tripled up or worse in former one-family homes, many of which had been carved into rooming houses for Brooklyn Navy Yard workers. (As if to further confirm that crime was an equal-opportunity employer, a sign posted in the changing rooms at S. Klein warned in Italian and Yiddish, as well as English: "Do not disgrace your family. The punishment for stealing is jail.")
The Brooklyn grand jury reported that "many churches have closed completely because their parishioners do not dare attend the evening services," that "groups of young boys armed with penknives of all sizes and other weapons roam the streets at will and threaten and assault passers-by," and that "many law-abiding children and adults residing in this area are therefore forced to carry similar knives and weapons for protection."
Foreshadowing an era plagued by similar problems but later bedtimes, the grand jury suggested that at 9 every night radio stations broadcast the question: "Parents, where are your children right now?"
Wartime manpower demands had shrunk the police force, which was further challenged after V-E Day by a growing arsenal of illegal guns brought home by returning servicemen. After V-J Day, there was nearly one murder a day committed in the city, or about double the previous year's rate. The toll for all 1945 was 292.
 
LA GUARDIA STEPS ASIDE; TAMMANY HALL IN DECLINE
Early that year, after three tumultuous terms, La Guardia decided not to seek re-election. The mayor, Thomas Kessner wrote in his biography, "left no party legacy, no structure, no institutional fusion or urban reform movement." After being shut out of the mayoralty for 12 years, the Democrats were revived by the election of William J. O'Dwyer, the former Brooklyn District Attorney (whose grand jury had produced the Bedford-Stuyvesant report). The selection of O'Dwyer, who had arrived in New York City from Ireland at the age of 19, marked the 11th consecutive time (since 1909) that the Democrats had chosen a mayoral nominee of Irish descent.
But the election of New York City's 100th mayor was also a turning point, even if it took another two decades for the decline of the Democratic Party machine to play itself out. Tammany, unable to meet the mortgage payments, had to sell its Union Square headquarters. Its demise was further signaled by two developments: New Deal programs had largely supplanted the party as a provider for the poor and powerless (by 1946, more than 100,000 people were receiving relief); and, in the year of the ethnically-balanced ticket, a Hollywood producer created campaign "newsreels" for the Democratic ticket, which foreshadowed the radio and television commercials that candidates would soon regularly broadcast to appeal directly to the voters.
Moreover, Edward N. Costikyan, a former Tammany leader, remembers: "World War II broke the geographic solidity of the Democratic Party's control over the electorate. After the war, people were more mobile and their long-term relationships with their district captains and district leaders disappeared."
Winning wasn't everything. What O'Dwyer inherited, he later recalled, was a city in which "not a single hospital had seen a paintbrush in the 16 years prior to my swearing-in ceremonies.
"In the meantime," he said, "the city's population had increased by a million residents, and each department was woefully undermanned. The smoke was choking New Yorkers, and the raw sewage had long ago discouraged fish in the bay or in the North River and had rendered our beaches dangerous for bathing . . . Veterans were returning home with no place to live . . . the rapid transit system, once our pride and joy, was falling apart and badly in need of equipment and repair."
The morning after the election, he also inherited a plan. A minion of Robert Moses, whose 1939 World's Fair had made the public -- and himself -- absolutely giddy about the future, delivered the master builder's master plan for reconstructing the city. His ambitious blueprint with a $1.5 billion price tag called for completing the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Idlewild Airport and for new housing, as he prepared to bulldoze existing homes to complete a network of highways, including three elevated expressways that would slice across Manhattan.
Soon after, Cleveland Rodgers, a City Planning Commissioner, and Rebecca B. Rankin, librarian of the Municipal Reference Library, echoed O'Dwyer's lament. "New York has never kept up with the demands for vitally needed facilities and services," they wrote in 1947. "It has not solved the basic problems of existence. Nowhere are there more glaring contrasts between rich and poor. Life is hard for millions and living and working conditions are deplorable in many respects."
Life in the city was also increasingly congested. (Unlike many other American cities, New York had lots of undeveloped land then, but Manhattan still had more residents than Queens.) Gas rationing during the war had slowed the migration to the suburbs. But between 1940 and 1950, for the first time, more people moved out of the city than in (over all, though, the population rose from about 7.4 million to more than 7.8 million because of higher birth rates at the beginning of the Baby Boom). While nearly 100,000 more foreigners, 230,000 nonwhites and 130,000 Puerto Ricans settled in the city than moved away, at least 340,000 more non-Hispanic whites left than arrived -- a middle-class exodus that accelerated in succeeding decades.
 
THE RISE OF THE CAR, THE SPREAD OF HIGHWAYS
Meanwhile, more and more of those who had left were returning to work in the city by car. By 1950 (the year that alternate-side parking was instituted and one year after O'Dwyer finally doubled the nickel subway fare), nearly 120,000 people were commuting to the city by car -- more than three times the number only two decades earlier.
Even more fundamental changes would soon be wrought by the deliberate and the unintended consequences of the Government's postwar policies on housing, transportation and veterans' benefits as the city's political influence waned in Washington. At the beginning of 1945 -- and not since then -- the President of the United States, Roosevelt, was a native New Yorker. More congressmen came from New York City that year than represented the entire state of California.
That an expected recession, like the one that occurred after World War 1, did not materialize reflected, in part, the Government's decision not to limit veterans' pensions to the elderly and disabled but to subsidize the education of returning soldiers and their ability to buy a home. But the criteria for Federally insured mortgages generally favored suburban developments, not urban housing -- just as Robert Moses's network of parkways had opened Long Island, Westchester and Connecticut to an influx of New York City expatriates.
Plenty of people were left, though, and more were on their way. By the end of the decade, E. B. White would write a paean to New York, with a caveat. Never, he wrote then, had the city been "so uncomfortable, so crowded, so tense."

Tales From the Sky

BYLINE: By CHASTITY PRATT 

 BODY:
FROM where Frank Kind works, sidewalks look like gray chalk lines, billboards are the size of postcards and Central Park is a tidy mosaic of bonsai trees and bushes.
When he is perched on a scaffold 45 floors above the cement sidewalk, Mr. Kind, 58, doesn't think about his brother-in-law Harry Heller, who fell from a scaffold and ended up with one leg shorter than the other. And he never looks down. "I just pay attention," he said, "to what I'm doing." 
 Mr. Kind has been a window washer for 43 years, since he was 15. When he started in the trade, he used a wooden chair suspended by rope from building rooftops or a cotton belt hooked around his waist and onto the outside of the building where he worked. In those days, scaffolds were little more than wooden planks powered by rope and muscle. Sometimes a belt would fray, a hook would pull free from masonry, a plank would tip. Window washers know the horror stories: four washers who fell from a scaffold at the Equitable Building in the 60's, another killed when his cotton belt tore in 1970, two others who died in 1990 when their scaffold plunged from the 12th floor of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in Times Square.
But today, nylon has replaced cotton, and hooks are bolted into window frames. New skyscrapers have customized wire scaffolds, powered by electricity and equipped with walkie-talkies and fire extinguishers.
Everyone agrees that the window washer's job is safer. Still, working conditions are not for the weak of will or stomach. On Thursday, a fierce wind smashed a scaffold into a window of 919 Third Avenue, near 56th Street. A facade repairman crawled through the broken window onto the 22d floor, but another worker dangled from a safety rope 20 floors above the sidewalk until a lawyer in the building saved him.
Other enemies of the window washer are wild birds that attack when their building-ledge nests are disturbed and windows that slam shut, leaving a washer dangling -- sometimes for hours -- with no way to climb back inside. And there is the occasional thrill seeker, be it nudist or parachutist.
"I was on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers when the guy jumped out with a parachute," Mr. Kind recalled as he and his partner, William Bubak, 61, took a break from the hundreds of windows they wash regularly at 888 Seventh Avenue, a 45-story office tower at 57th Street. "He looked at me, I looked at him and he jumped out and pulled the cord. The Port Authority called me and asked why I didn't stop him. I said, 'I didn't have a parachute.' "
Cesar Gerena still remembers the time he was washing windows at an apartment building on 58th Street. "The guys inside say, 'Finally, we can see; it's that time again,' " Mr. Gerena said. "A lady walked past naked in the window right across from the ones I just washed. She did it every day at 8 A.M. That's New York."
Window washers in the city belong to Window Cleaners Local 2. Managers of large office and apartment buildings usually contract with maintenance companies, which get their workers from the union. The local president, Arnold Geller, said "business was good" until about 1985; then the recession brought commercial construction to a near-halt and forced companies to slash maintenance. Union membership plummeted. Today, Mr. Geller said, it is rebounding. "Window cleaning," he explained, "follows construction and the economy."
Most cleaners earn about $40,000 a year. Among the job's perks: bumping into someone famous, like a movie director who needs a window washer in his next film. "I was working at 22 Broadway when Oliver Stone saw me in the lobby and says, 'Hey, how long you been doing this?' " said Patrick DeFillippo, 45, of Glendale, Queens. "I was with them all day taping 'Wall Street.' In that scene where Michael Douglas is arguing with Charlie Sheen, he goes to the window and waves at me. I got paid good for it, too."
The typical window cleaner's day begins between 5 and 6 A.M., before the sun starts its ascent, and ends before it scorches their skin and drenches their drab blue uniforms in perspiration. From their perches, they watch the city yawn its way into the working day. Their tales are told matter-of-factly; the daily monotony strengthens the gut.
"In 1969 was I working on the 19th floor, and a hook came out of the window," Mr. Bubak recalled. "I swung off the window, hit my head against the building and was out cold. I gave it up for seven years." But, he said, the pay brought him back. "Sometimes I still get butterflies if I haven't been on the scaffold for a while, but it goes away."
Mr. Kind started washing windows with his father, Jacob, in 1952. His sons, Jason and Steve, have followed him into the union. A 14-karat squeegee hanging from a gold rope chain around his neck has three diamonds -- one for each generation of window cleaners in his family.
"It's quiet up here," said Jason Kind, 21, looking toward New Jersey from the roof of 888 Seventh Avenue. "All you hear is the wind and the air-conditioner motors. You get a rush; it's like bungee jumping."
His father and other veteran washers also speak of the rush. Some say modern safety measures have taken the thrill out of the job. "Years ago, it used to be that there was no limit on how high you could go on rope," Frank Kind said. "You climbed over the roof into the chair. Twenty-five, 40 floors. The good thing with rope is you knew you were going down and you knew you were coming back up."
Bill Bubak agrees, especially about the mandatory tether from the roof to a washer in a chair or on a scaffold. "You got this lifeline connected to you that smacks you in the face," he said. "It's a pain. Besides, once you get so high, it doesn't matter anymore. It's all the same if you fall."

Deep Water And 2 Cranes Revive a Port

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The Brooklyn waterfront once hummed with activity as hundreds of longshoremen hauled freight each day from dozens of ships onto trains and trucks. But in the last 30 years, most of that business fled to newer, more spacious piers in New Jersey.
In the last year the city's Economic Development Corporation moved two refurbished, 120-foot cranes from the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park to the struggling Red Hook Marine Terminal, the only port in the city where cargo containers are unloaded from ships. The agency also met with shipping companies to help Red Hook snare new contracts. 
 The efforts seem to be paying off. Sal F. Catucci, the chief executive of American Stevedoring, which began managing the Red Hook terminal in 1994, said it was handling almost twice as much freight as last year.
This year Red Hook has unloaded about 20,000 cargo containers from ships and 11,000 from barges, Mr. Catucci said. It expects to unload a total of 35,000 containers from 288 ships and 20,000 from barges. In 1994 it unloaded 18,000 containers from 228 ships and nearly 7,000 from barges. Mr. Catucci said he employed 125 to 300 longshoremen a day, up 10 percent from last year.
Development agency officials said that working in Brooklyn's favor is that Buttermilk Channel, which leads to the Red Hook piers, goes down 65 feet before it hits rock. The channel is about 40 feet deep now, but its sandy bottom could be dredged to accommodate larger ships. By comparison, Kill Van Kull, which leads into Newark Bay, hits rock at 40 feet.
"Ships are getting bigger and deeper," said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat who leads a private group that is lobbying the Empire State Development Corporation to study how to develop the Brooklyn port. "When you drive along the Shore Parkway and see ships idling, they are waiting for high tide so they can go." The group has also asked Mayor Giuliani to halt waterfront development until a study can be completed.
For Mr. Catucci, such a study cannot come too quickly. "Brooklyn has the deep water," he said. "This is where the port should be."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Rolls-Royce Silver Spur;
Expensive Behemoth Is Surprisingly Nimble

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
I HAD done this before, I thought -- driven a car to the ooh-oohs of the crowd. I had preened at the wheel in parades, and I had driven in races, although the ahhs then were more like gasps as I demonstrated true ineptitude in the turns.
But this was no race. This was a v-e-r-y slow crawl through New York's Central Park, leading a $1.5 million line of fancy metal, and the appreciation from the multitude of skaters, joggers and muggers ranged from waves to stared befuddlement. One woman whistled. 
 The occasion was the introduction of Rolls-Royce's 1996 models, complete with police escort. There were Silver Spurs, Silver Dawns, Bentley Turbos -- eight cars forming a train of ostentation. A day-care class in green T-shirts pointed like a drill team.
I tried to look important and to forget that I somehow forgot to wear a tie.
Rolls-Royce has invested $75 million in the redesign and enhancement of its line over the last 18 months, and while that might be goobers to Ford or General Motors, it is a whopping sum for a company that is more a boutique than a mainstream player.
Rolls sold only 335 vehicles in the United States last year, but not to fret. With its cars costing as much as condos, the company remains profitable -- and with BMW's takeover of the Rover Group, Rolls is now, amazingly, the largest solely British-owned auto maker. Sales this year also show promise -- all 30 of the $319,000 Bentley Azure convertibles were spoken for before they were produced -- and 1995 could end with more than 400 new Roll-Royces and Bentleys whispering out of the company's 47 American showrooms.
All the same, the investment for '96 was needed, and the new models are smoother and more potent than their predecessors. A new intercooler for the turbocharged Bentley V8's and a new engine-management system has improved efficiency and (dare one say) economy.
For the first time, too, Rolls has actually announced a horsepower figure, admitting that the 6.75-liter turbocharged V8 produces 385 horses and an immense 553 foot-pounds of torque. The admission, supposedly to show that Rolls is a rejuvenated company, has not spread to the nonturbo cars, however, and the word there, as always, is that power is "adequate."
That coyness, incidentally, goes back to one of the marque's two founders, Sir Henry Royce, who is quoted thus: "My motorcars are designed to transport four people in supreme comfort at speeds up to two miles per minute. How that is achieved is utterly irrelevant."
These days, any Rolls or Bentley can top 120 miles an hour, and the best guess for the nonturbo's horsepower is about 300. Also, while the turbo will propel the car's megatonnage from 0 to 60 in less than six seconds, the more sedate sedans will accomplish the feat in just three seconds more.
The fact that there is no such thing as a slow Rolls, the journey through Central Park notwithstanding, has always been one of the hard things to keep in mind about the car. Rolls-Royces have for so long been equated with hushed civility that it takes the occasional spin to note once again that this is an automobile, a very real automobile, and not a living room.
The rear-opening hood rises on counterbalanced hinges, and there is the engine, sure enough. True, most of it is hidden under a cover of plastic composite, but finned aluminum valve covers do stick up, all polished silver and black, and there is no question that they are the upper ends of serious machinery.
For '96, the handmade grille is a bit lower, and the venerable "Spirit of Ecstasy" hood ornament has lost some height, shrinkage attributable not to age but to a search for aerodynamics, according to a Rolls spokesman. "As coachwork has become more streamlined, the Flying Lady has evolved," he said in rounded tones. "Some might say that she now maintains a slightly more discreet vigil over the famous radiator."
The black Silver Spur out in the driveway (you didn't think I left it in Central Park, did you?) comes with whitewalls, a vinyl roof, tasteful scads of chrome, and a sticker that says $176,500. For $22,500 less, you can get the Silver Dawn -- the same car but without such niceties as polished wooden picnic tables in the back seat and similar foofaraw.
The Dawn is a made-for-America-only model, and its intent is to lure buyers with a price that is closer to that of upper-level Mercedes-Benzes. But the Spur is -- forgive me -- the bread-and-butter Rolls. Its formal lines, huge length and interior amenities are as right for C.E.O.'s as for sultans.
New wheels and tires, wider and bigger, help the car's stance and road performance, which is surprisingly nimble. But it is inside that the car really shines. Mine has black leather everywhere, with bright red piping on the seats in an odd sort of frolicky decor, given its otherwise formal mien. What isn't leather or lamb's wool is mirror-finished wood, and even the new passenger air bag hides behind veneer.
It goes without saying that the interior cossets you in quiet solidity. The rear seats recline, with power adjustments, and the room back there is amazing. Surprising in a different way, however, is luggage capacity for the vehicle's occupants. The boot is shallow and holds a rather stingy 12.3 cubic feet of cargo -- but it does contain his-and-hers umbrellas, blue and white with Flying Ladies on the panels. Neat.
For the driver, there is a tilt wheel that automatically trundles up and out of the way when the door is opened or the ignition key is removed. The front seats are also lower to ease entry and exit, and their foam has been softened for more comfort. The audio system is both the best and worst to be found, with great sound and impossibly small buttons.
Fortunately, Rolls provides a remote control, but you probably shouldn't try to tune the radio while you drive. What you should do is enjoy the purr under the hood and the kick in the seat when you step on the gas. You can also have fun going slowly, of course. Just smile and wave. And look important.

The Budget Knife Boomerangs Home

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOR many people here, this has been one of the saddest and most anxious weeks of waiting in decades. The largest county government in America, is facing a potentially disastrous budget gap, and the Los Angeles County supervisors are deciding how to dismantle not just their social, health and other services, but their ideal of what a government should be.
 It appeared that nearly 40 walk-in clinics, spread mostly in poor neighborhoods, would disappear. More than 15,000 county workers would lose their jobs and many social and welfare programs probably would be slashed beyond recognition. 
 Meanwhile, Orange County, lying on Los Angeles' southern border, was facing the realities of its bankruptcy. After slashing its operating budget by 41 percent, the county had to eliminate free school bus rides, halt some testing for bacteria at popular beaches and sentence some criminals to perform routine maintenance at the courthouse.
 Without much local money to cushion the blow, Southern California is one of the first places to feel the tough love that the new leaders in Congress have promised to deliver to those who have been dependent on the government for survival, or just for services.

 
 
The Final Chapter Begins
 Many experts say this difficult exercise is a harbinger of what counties across the country are going to be experiencing under the restrictive new budgetary and social policies in state capitals and in Congress. But it is also the final chapter in the tax revolt that started in Southern California almost two decades ago with the passage of Proposition 13 and reached final victory when anti-tax Republicans captured Congress last year.
Until now, local tax rebels have been largely shielded from the consequences of their own revolt, because Washington and the state governments increased their contribution to schools and social programs as local revenues shrank. But now, with the tax rebels ensconced in Washington, there is nowhere else to turn.
 This is a pivotal moment. What is now dawning on Southern California will soon become evident to the rest of the nation.
 "We're just the first ones to get hit by all this, said Yvonne Braithwaite Burke, a Los Angeles County supervisor and head of the Inter-governmental Affairs Committee for the National Association of Counties. "But it's going to happen all over the country."
Some would argue that this reckoning has been put off for 17 years and that counties like Los Angeles and Orange should have prepared for it long before budget cutting fever reached Washington last November.
 In 1978, California passed what was known as Proposition 13, a rebellion that slashed property taxes and put a 2 percent cap on annual increases.
 But the county governments were able to dodge the deep cuts in services and the restructurings that the rebels had hoped for. California's economy was thriving throughout the 1980's and the flush state government made up most of what the counties had lost. In addition, the Federal Government stepped in and provided billions of dollars to cover many of the health and welfare programs that counties administered on behalf of Washington.
 Even Orange County did not have to come to terms right away with the consequences of its policies. Blocked from raising local taxes to finance the services residents clamored for, the county's treasurer generated more than $150 million a year in interest income by operating a risky investment fund. It was only last year that the financial house of cards collapsed (the fund lost $1.7 billion) and Orange County became the largest municipal government ever to file for bankruptcy.
 The collapse, as it turned out, happened at an inopportune moment. Now the state has its own fiscal crisis and is in no shape to bail out any of its counties. And the Federal Government has been cutting back some of its support, and it plans to cut even more. At long last, Prop 13, as it is known, is running its course.
 Not everyone is gloomy about this. Some of the tax rebels think it is all to the good, and they are not looking for help from the state or Federal governments. "Prop 13 was supposed to limit the size of county government, and it didn't do it," said Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which led the fight for the measure. "I don't want to see the health care system collapse. But the county has just tried to patch things over. Now they are going to have to restructure."
 He added, "What Congress is doing will put even more pressure on the counties."
 Pressure indeed. The new Congress has promised that many of the big social programs that the Federal Government used to finance will now be the responsibility of the states. That has already happened to programs to reduce child abuse, to welfare and to the justice system. Increasingly, responsibility for more and more programs will be be passed down.
 In Washington, this trend is touted as a form of populist democracy, allowing the people who use the programs to be closer to those who manage them. But for many local officials, it looks an awful lot like an evasion of responsibility; they think they, not the members of Congress, will take the political heat for slashing services.

 
 
Pass the Hatchet
 "Congress talks about passing responsibility, but what they're really doing is passing the knife," said Robert Reischauer, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office.
Already, the knife has been handed down in Southern California, and the slashing has begun. "Much of this starts with the Congress," said Ms. Burke. "It then goes to the states, and then guess who it ends up with? The buck stops with us. We're the ones who have to close the hospitals." Sally R. Reed, Los Angeles County's chief administrative officer said, "Eyeball to eyeball, all this happens at the county level. We're the ones who listen to the parents crying or face the disabled kids whose programs have just been shut down."
 But the final chapter of the revolution that began with Proposition 13 has yet to be written. Perhaps the greatest question is whether residents of Los Angeles, or any other county, will feel that the quality of life will decline if they accept deep cuts in services. Some experts have predicted that as soon as the middle class suffers the consequences of closed libraries or a more inefficient justice system it will vote for a change of course. But California's experience suggests otherwise.

 
 
Future Shock
 For instance, while most services have survived the Proposition 13 shock, education in the state has undergone a slow but dramatic decline. In the mid-1960's California had the fifth-highest rate of spending per pupil in the country and an envied education system. Today it is 42d in spending; it has one of the highest school dropout rates in the country (only two states are worse), and last year its fourth graders tied for last place in an educational assessment test that was given in 39 states.
 Is anyone balking? Yes, but not about the decline in education. According to Ms. Reed, what people are saying is what they've been saying for 17 years: "We're not going to pay any more."

A Rage for Merit, Whatever That Is

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
OF all the questions that bubble around the issue of affirmative action -- questions of fairness, justice, discrimination or quotas -- perhaps none is more nettlesome than that of merit. 
 As an ideal, it is as American as apple pie, and its celebration is what supposedly distinguished this country from the class-bound societies of Europe. It is the magic word in the campaign against affirmative action, invoked repeatedly, for example, as the regents of the University of California voted this month to abolish preferences accorded by race and sex.

 
 
The Beholder's Eyes
 But as competition for society's benefits grows more intense than ever and the economy undergoes radical change, the definition of merit is becoming more elusive. Is it, as some say, the only basis that the society should use in bestowing benefits and rewards such as jobs, promotions and admission to college? Or is it merely a Potemkin concept behind which the ruling class maintains its position? "Fondly we think we honor merit then," Alexander Pope wrote 250 years ago, "when we but praise ourselves in other men."
 Some people, like Prof. Lani Guinier of the University of Pennsylvania law school, hope the debate over affirmative action would provide the opportunity to delve into the question of merit -- and its kissing cousin, qualifications -- and whether the means used to assess them remain relevant.
 Liberal supporters of affirmative action, including President Clinton, often say they oppose the selection of "unqualified" over "qualified" people. That, of course, treats merit in absolute rather than relative terms. Conservative opponents of affirmative action routinely wave the flag of merit without defining the term; they would rely on mechanisms like standardized tests.
 "Standardized tests give you a relatively narrow picture of a person's abilities," said Alexandra Wigdor, director of the Division of Education, Labor and Human Performance of the National Academy of Science. "These do not measure motivation, perseverance or teamwork skills. There are just so many things that they don't measure that to consider merit to be fully explained by rank order on a standardized test is such a narrow definition of merit that it's absurd."
 Those who question the value of standardized tests posit this example. Suppose a high school student whose parents are college graduates scores 1,400 on the Scholastic Assessment Test, and the median score in his high school is 1,450. And then suppose a student from a low-income family whose parents did not finish high school scores 1,200 and the median score in his school is 800. Which would make the better college student? The one who scored higher or the one who overcame disadvantage?
 The issue is not an abstract one. To the California Board of Regents, judging by merit alone means using only scores on a standardized test, such as the S.A.T., and grade-point averages. Starting in 1997, 50 to 75 percent of those admitted to the University of California at Berkeley and the University of California at Los Angeles, the system's most prestigious schools, will be admitted strictly by those numbers. (Currently, 40 to 60 percent are admitted on that basis.) For the others, factors like socioeconomic background and unusual talents -- in music or sports, for example -- may also be considered.
 Under the new scheme, the regents estimate that the number of whites would probably remain the same and the number of Asian-American students would increase. The percentage of black and Latino students would fall.
 Yet the S.A.T. is little more than a predictor of how a student will do in the freshman year of college. That is certainly a limited measure, though better than no measure at all. Benjamin Wright, a professor of psychology and education at the University of Chicago, says the differences in test scores do not accurately measure the differences in performance, either. In addition, the S.A.T. has a range of error of at least 40 points, meaning that someone scoring 900 one day could take the test the next day and score anywhere from 860 to 940.
 "When people use these numbers to make decisions, they are naturally being misled," Mr. Wright said.
 The problem of using standardized tests to predict performance becomes even more acute in the employment context, some experts say. In a service economy, creativity and interpersonal skills are important -- but hard to measure. And in the highly contentious area of civil service exams for police and fire departments, such important traits as honesty and courage are left out.
 "Those kinds of private skills are totally missed in the merit argument," said James Heckman, professor of economic and public policy at the University of Chicago.

 
 
Compared to What?
 But if the means of measuring qualifications are less than perfect, the question has to be asked, compared to what? Scrapping "objective" gauges would mean relying more on the kinds of judgments that prompted the adoption of standardized measures -- and ostensibly fairer ones -- in the first place.
 For traditional civil rights advocates, the answer to the dilemma is affirmative action, using so-called objective measures to establish a floor of standards and then encouraging -- or forcing them if necessary -- schools and companies to select a proportion of women and members of ethnic minorities who meet the minimum qualifications. Others who oppose using race or sex as a criterion for selection hate this idea, but some -- though not many -- say they have an obligation to insure that adhering to the idea of merit does not confine minorities and women to second-class status.
 "Is it necessary to have two different kinds of standards because the playing field is not level?" said Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, who is an outspoken critic of affirmative action. "My answer is that we should always try to adhere a single set of standards that will apply to everyone. But our challenge is to find a ways of leveling the playing field, so that more people can meet those standards."

Trade's Bottom Line: Business Over Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EARLIER this month Henry A. Kissinger and a delegation of American business executives and academics paid a visit to Li Peng, China's Prime Minister. As would be expected at a moment when relations between the two countries has reached a low point -- on human rights, missile proliferation and Taiwan -- the opening minutes were spent with Mr. Li complaining about Taiwan's President visiting the United States, and with the Americans pressing the case of Harry Wu, the imprisoned human rights activist.
 What surprised the visitors, however, was how quickly Mr. Li dropped those issues and jumped right into business: Power projects that need foreign capital, China's plans for buying and building new passenger aircraft, the giant Three Gorges Dam project. "He made it very, very clear that he had no intention of letting these huge diplomatic disputes affect the economic relationship," said C. Fred Bergsten, a prominent economist and adviser to the Clinton Administration, who was along on the trip. "It was as if we were talking about two completely separate relationships." 
 These days America's economic stake in China's future is far too large to leave to the vicissitudes of diplomatic relations, especially when Japanese and German competitors are hardly about to pull out of the country every time the Chinese jail another 100 dissidents. Yet "commercial diplomacy" -- a term once enthusiastically used by some in the Administration to describe engaging the Chinese in economic development, the arena they are most focused on -- has so far done nothing to modify China's political behavior. Just the opposite: Mr. Li is betting that the United States is not willing to lose deals with McDonnell Douglas and Ford in the name of protecting human rights.
 It is a taste of things to come, and one of the central dilemmas facing Secretary of State Warren Christopher next week as he tours Southeast Asia and ends up in Vietnam, the newest site of American efforts to use business as its main diplomatic vehicle.

 
 
The Best Promotion
 At its most basic level, commercial diplomacy has clearly been a success for the Administration. For the first time in this century, the Government has regularly put the promotion of business interests at the top of its foreign policy agenda. Even the Republicans who want to eliminate the Commerce Department were congratulating Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown last week for his department's advocacy of those interests in the big emerging markets from Brazil to Poland. And Mr. Brown seemed to win converts when he argued that this is no time for "unilateral disarmament" in trade.
 But when Mr. Clinton decided last year to remove the link between China's human rights record and the renewal of trade benefits, and when he extended diplomatic recognition to Vietnam two weeks ago, he suggested that economic engagement had a deeper purpose: It would be the best way to change the nature of authoritarian regimes. So far, that strategy has failed to work in China. In a widely published essay last week Mr. Kissinger himself concluded that the two countries are on "a collision course."
 Commercial diplomacy works best with small countries reaching for America's markets and capital. That is why Hanoi has been more cooperative than Beijing. Even the North Koreans have begun to make concessions regarding their nuclear program in hopes that the ultimate reward is Western investment. But China is a special case, with the luxury of many suitors. Even while assuring Americans that trade and politics are separate, China's first response in the dispute over American relations with Taiwan was to sign a deal with Mercedes-Benz.
 Jeffrey Garten, the Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, is among the many officials who say that while there is little political leverage in the commercial ties to China now, the power equation will change. "Over the next decade, our links could easily expand geometrically." he said. "By that time a new generation will be leading China, and their interests in economic prosperity for China are likely to rank much higher in terms of China's international priority. It may be a gamble, but it is the best shot we have."
 Even with allies, though, the Administration is increasingly recognizing that there is a fundamental complication when relations are based on business rather than security. In Southeast Asia, the relationship with America was once a matter of life and death. Today Asian countries say they want America's continued military presence primarily because it keeps shipping lanes open.
 Commercial alliances run by very different rules, in which political allies are also fierce competitors. So the question -- today in China, tomorrow elsewhere -- is whether and when America is willing to swallow its devotion to human rights or concerns over nuclear proliferation to keep Mitsubishi from closing a deal.
 "Everyone acknowledges that economics now plays a central role in foreign policy -- that battle is over," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers said the other day. "What no one has really grappled with is what happens when commercial concerns push out other interests."
 It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Christopher, who has rarely gone beyond the platitudes of the new era, is ready to grapple openly with such tradeoffs. During a speech on Asian policy on Friday, someone asked him if he was concerned that Japan's banking crisis could mushroom into a worldwide financial crisis -- an issue far closer to the hearts of the Asian leaders he meets next week than the issue of how to contain the Serbs in Bosnia.
 "Where are you, Bob Rubin, when I need you?" he asked, referring to the Treasury Secretary. Then, the true diplomat, he said he hoped the Japanese would solve their own problems.

In Japan, Chicken Little Lays the Golden Egg

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
" . . . and then in the fall of 1995, to cap an atrocious year for Japan, Mount Fuji erupted, covering Tokyo with lava and triggering a giant earthquake that sent the country's major islands sinking noislessly beneath the sea. . . ."
WELL, that hasn't happened yet. But it would be a fitting follow-up in an Annus Horribilis that is deflating Japan in its own eyes and those of the world. 
 It wasn't so long ago that the West looked upon Japan as the Great Success Story of the latter part of the 20th century -- and, perhaps, of the 21st century as well. Its economy appeared unstoppable, it was buying up golf courses and Old Masters around the world, and its youngsters were intimidating because they seemed more interested in calculus than in controlled substances.
 Those were the days when Japanese restaurants served meals sprinkled with gold dust, and the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo were said to be worth more than all of California. The Japanese ran the world's biggest banks and bought assets like Rockefeller Center at astronomical prices; if it was comforting that they could be fleeced, it was also scary that being fleeced didn't seem to matter to them.
 These days, though, the Japanese are feeling anything but scary; their own self-image is more like pathetic and vulnerable. It is not just the great earthquake that toppled earthquake-proof bridges and killed 6,055 people in January. Nor is it just the addition of the nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system.

 
 
The Blue Period
 Those episodes have been the highlights of Japan's Blue Period, but the day-to-day texture is more about economic woes. Partly because of the high yen, unemployment is at a record, and plenty of 50-year-olds fear that after a lifetime of sacrifice, they face "kubi kiri" -- or beheading, as layoffs are sardonically called here.
 "While it is only with the utmost caution that a political leader dares make statements that might heighten anxiety among citizens, I frankly believe we face very serious crises," warned Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister. He added: "in this critical situation, Japan is like a ship on the verge of sinking."
 A commentator in the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest-circulation newspaper, warned that "the public vaguely shares a sense of 'doomsday.' "
 So which is the real Japan? The colossus? Or the basket case?
 There is evidence for both propositions, but experience suggests that foreigners should be wary of the hand-wringing. Japan has always been a nation of self flagellators, at a national and personal level. Japanese women have to be warned when living abroad not to complain constantly to neighbors about how awful their own husbands are, as it is only polite to do back home. Abroad, neighbors will take their complaints seriously and suggesting dumping the bum.
 One of Japan's strengths, in fact, may be its bleak outlook. The last time that Japan was this worked up, for example, was the early 1970's, after the oil shock. Japanese feared that this was the end of their boom, and even toilet paper disappeared from shelves as people stockpiled for an uncertain future. But in retrospect the gnashing of teeth seemed ridiculous, and Japan emerged stronger than ever. Instead of putting Japan out of business, the oil shock put Toyotas in carports across America.
 Will Japan be able to bounce back this time?
 "Japan in one or two years will of course bounce back," said Yukio Okamoto, an influential consultant. "But we will never again come back to the years of really strong economic growth."
 One reason is simply that as economies grow, the pace tends to slow. Japan's postwar boom, when annual economic growth rates sometimes approached 10 percent, was an anomaly. If future growth is in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 percent per year, that is still fine by the standards of industrialized countries.
 But Japan's neighboring developing countries, from China to Malaysia, are still in the boom phase. This means that Japan's share of the global economy is likely to diminish, and this is already happening: Japan's exports accounted for 11.1 percent of the world total in 1985, and now account for about 9.7 percent. For the same reasons, the American share has tumbled hugely over the last half century.
 A more fundamental long-term challenge is demographic: Japan is aging very fast. In the year 2000, for example, Japan will have one-quarter fewer youngsters aged 10 through 19 than it did in 1990. The number of people over 60 will have increased by 35 percent.
 This kind of aging tends to slow an economy down in part because the proportion of retirees increases. But some economists say the more important problem is simply that older people are less innovative and entrepreneurial than younger ones. So as Japan ages, it can expect fewer risk-takers like the ones who in the late 1940's founded Sony and Honda.
 While some foreigners are as gloomy as the Japanese, anticipating such possibilities as a banking collapse, many other experts also point to Japanese long-term strengths. They suggest that Japan will be hugely important for generations to come -- and could gain greater influence than ever.
 "Japan still has many prominent factors working in its favor," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. "It has a labor force that is still very well educated, hard working and works up to extremely high standards. It has a social system that still works extremely well, with a crime rate that is very, very low."
 Another of Japan's advantages is location, location, location. It may be embarrassing for recession-bound Japan that its neighbors are booming along at growth rates of 7 percent or more per year, but it is also a major opportunity. Japan's experience, connections and investments in Asian countries allow it to share in some of their growth, and could help it become the focal point of the most dynamic continent in the world.
 Japan could also gain influence simply by being more hospitable to foreigners and their products. Opening up Japanese markets to Asian exports would mean a big boost, and welcoming foreign university students and faculty could make Japan an educational center for all Asia. Japan would also hugely expand its importance if it were to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, as it hopes to do; even if that doesn't happen, it could simply choose to play a more active role in international diplomacy.
 One gauge of long-term potential is how much countries invest in plants and equipment or in areas such as health and education. Not surprisingly, as a nation of Eeyores, the Japanese have been socking away money to tide them over difficult times. The net household savings rate in Japan last year was 16.6 percent; in the United States it was 4.1 percent. Laboratories throughout Japan still hum away with research-and-development spending, though less than before.
 "The fact that many Japanese are worried, many opinion leaders are coming out and saying we've got to change course" is a reason for optimism, said Richard Koo, an American economist who is often critical of Japan from his perch at the Nomura Research Institute. The public worry in Japan is leading to widespread talk about the need for deregulation, which could be the fuel for a tremendous new wave of growth.
 "These could push Japan to a new height," Mr. Koo said. "We don't need to write off Japan."

The South American Art of Name-Calling

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
LATIN America isn't, as it is often portrayed in the United States, just one civilization artificially divided into different countries. Listen to the chants at soccer stadiums around South America, and you'll hear what Latin Americans really think about each other.
 At the recent America Cup tournament in Uruguay, Argentine fans belittled their Chilean counterparts as "sons of Pinochet" (translation: Chile is full of militarists). The Argentines, who are predominantly white, also urged their team on against the "dirty blacks from Brazil" (the country with the largest black population on the continent). 
 Meanwhile, in a match against Bolivia, Chilean fans yelled that no country with a standard of living equal to Uganda could beat them.
 And finally, when Uruguay took the championship here, thousands of Uruguayans took to the streets to celebrate their victory not by mocking Brazil, the closest contender, but by shouting their joy at having humiliated the continent's most prideful nation, Argentina. Gleefully, they cursed the "portenos" of Buenos Aires -- a moniker that connotes hopeless arrogance.
 Stereotypes are alive and well in Latin America, and they are not just limited to the soccer stands.
 While other societies have been cultivating taboos on crude references to ethnic origin or race or sex, Latin culture is still often surprisingly straightforward about these things.
 Latin Americans say this makes them more direct and honest than, for example, North Americans, who even while struggling to make their own society speak more tolerantly still tend to lump all Latin Americans in one stereotypical mass.
 On the other hand, it also means that Latin Americans accept stereotypes -- of their own compatriots as well as of other Latin Americans -- that would make most North Americans cringe. In doing so, they build elaborate pecking orders in their minds (usually with one's own country at the top, of course).
 Bolivians, for example, think of themselves (and are thought of by many other Latin Americans) as a kind-hearted nation. But kind-heartedness isn't what applies when many Bolivians think about Chileans, their neighbors to the southwest.
 A 10-year-old Bolivian boy returned from school recently announcing that he wanted to kill all Chileans. Why, he was asked. "They stole our coastline in the Pacific War of 1869 and left us with nothing," the child explained.
 Many Chileans, who have very distinctive accents, complain of being treated poorly in stores and restaurants in Bolivia. Bolivians view Chile as an expansionist country not only militarily but also economically and culturally -- a notion that was confirmed in many a Bolivian mind when Chile recently hired away the Bolivian soccer coach who had taken Bolivia to the World Cup competition last year.
 Latin Americans are also very frank in their dealings with others on a personal level. A fat person is openly called "gordito" or fatty, and people of dark skin color are called "negrito" or blacky ("ito" usually shows affection). Such references would be unthinkable in the United States, but they are not meant or taken as disparaging.
 In such an atmosphere, a stereotype that might otherwise be thought of as nasty can even be taken as a compliment, if the target wants to bury the sting. Argentines, for example, often revel in being referred to as haughty (the trick is to think enough of yourself that arrogance seems justified). Likewise many Chileans, when they are called militaristic, can summon up their best feelings about men in uniform by remembering the prosperity and order that Gen. Augusto Pinochet brought, along with repression and terror.
 Without a doubt, Argentines, who are mainly of European descent, are the most universally loathed group in South America. "Argentines are hated because they are arrogant," said Luigi Manzetti, a senior researcher at the North-South Center at the University of Miami. "They see themselves as an outpost of European civilization, and they think the rest of Latin America envies them because their population doesn't include Indians and mestizos."
 A favorite pastime of many South Americans is trading Argentine jokes. Here are two very popular ones:
 In the middle of a violent lightning storm, an Argentine goes outdoors and stands in the rain. "What are you doing out here?" he is asked. "I came out because God wants to take my photograph."
 Question: What is the most effective weapon against an Argentine? Answer: A needle, which can be used to deflate him.

 
 
Equal-Opportunity Disdain
 Argentine disdain for anything different is not limited to other nationalities and is often expressed within the country for the lower classes and people of mixed blood. For example, during Argentine league soccer games, fans who are rooting against the country's most popular team, Boca Juniors, like to sing that Boca fans are "all dirty Bolivians and Paraguayans who never bathe." The reference is particularly pointed these days because many Argentines resent a recent influx of peasant immigrants from those countries.
 In Argentina's neighbor, Chile, Peruvians and Bolivians are viewed as less than equal, because they are mainly mestizo (of mixed ancestry) and indigenous, rather than European, in ancestry. This is expressed by Chileans as a stereotype that the Peruvians and Bolivians are all backwoods peasants with no sophistication -- a stereotype that rankles the Andean people.
 Hernan Godoy, a sociologist and former dean of the faculty of social sciences at Catholic University in Santiago, thinks he knows why the Chileans feel that way; typically, it has something to do with Argentina and pride and pecking orders.
 "We Chileans feel that Argentines are whiter, blonder and more secure," he said. "But on the other hand, the Chileans feel blonder and whiter than Peru and Bolivia."

The Wobbly Ideal Called Perfection

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
THE French novelist Emile Zola once declared that he was "little concerned with perfection." American high school students suddenly have the luxury of feeling the same way: it is now possible to miss three or four questions on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and still achieve a perfect score. 
 The College Board, which administers the all-important admissions test, has recalibrated its scoring system so the average student would once again get scores of 500 on both the math and verbal sections. The average verbal score had fallen to 424, the average math score to 478. The change redefined perfection downward a notch or two. "We don't believe what others believe, that an 800 should only go to a student who has a perfect raw score," said Bradley J. Quin, the director of admissions and enrollment services at the College Board. "We don't define perfect that way."

 
 
By Any Other Name
How to define perfect in an imperfect world? (And it is an imperfect world: it bulges around the middle, instead of being perfectly round.)
 Hollywood has had a lot to say about perfection: "Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide" lists 21 films with the word "perfect" in the title, from the Clint Eastwood escaped-convict thriller, "A Perfect World," to the David Niven-Loretta Young romance, "The Perfect Marriage." In a 1985 film titled simply "Perfect," John Travolta played a reporter. Everybody knows reporters are perfect.
 Sure.
 But don't ask an economist what constitutes the perfect rate of economic growth. The Administration and the Federal Reserve seem to have decided that a 2.5 percent is perfect, although that's not all that brisk. The trouble is, if the economy starts chugging much faster than that, the result would be a situation that even a less-than-perfect student of economics could recognize as less than perfect: inflation.
 Employment statistics? Perfectly confusing. Full employment -- a job for every worker -- might strike a layman as not only perfect but an improvement on Henry IV of France, who said he wanted there to be no peasants in his realm so poor they did not have a chicken in their pot on Sunday. Economists, though, are not laymen. This may or may not be why full employment does not mean zero unemployment. Instead, full employment is considered to exist when unemployment is in the 6 percent range.
 What's perfection at the Post Office? Never mind rain, sleet and gloom of night: take a look at on-time performance. Nationally, 85 percent of first-class mail arrives perfectly on schedule. But the island of Manhattan is a black hole of imperfection. Its comparable figure drops to 76 percent, meaning that one in four letters arrives late by Postal Service standards. That adds up: Manhattan postal workers have to redeliver 400,000 to 500,000 letters every day because they did not get to their perfect destination the first time around.
 Milton wrote about Chaos and Night moving "in perfect phalanx." How perfect were the phalanxes of bombers in the Persian Gulf war? "Smart bombs" were 90 percent accurate but made up only 7 percent of all of the American explosives dropped on Iraq and Kuwait. The 81,980 tons of unguided bombs had an accuracy rating of only about 25 percent. That is, 62,137 tons missed their targets.
 Perfect pitch? Musicians who have it may be far from perfect. "There was a violist at Juilliard who had it when I was a student," said the composer Lowell Lieberman. "You could press all the keys with your forearms and she could tell you which keys were not sounding. But she was the worst musician in the school. She played totally out of tune." (What pitch is the perfect one for the A above middle C? The standard used to be 440 cycles per second, but original-instrument aficionados prefer 415, while some symphony orchestras seek a bit more brilliance at 444.)
 The perfect Madison Avenue pitch? Earlier in the year, the trade publication Advertising Age chose the greatest commercial ever made: the spectacular spot by Chiat/Day that evoked the George Orwell novel "1984" to introduce the Apple Macintosh computer during Super Bowl XVIII 11 years ago. It ran only that one time.
 The perfect baseball pitch? Some fans say it was the Yankees' Don Larsen's game-ending throw in the 1956 World Series, a called third strike against Dale Mitchell of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the first (and so far, the only) no-hitter in World Series history.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Wields the Gavel, Without the Scrapper's Style

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
As he perches in his special seat of power as chairman of the Whitewater hearings, there is an uncharacteristic quietude about Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato that even he himself can find strange.
"Being able to be a free spirit, a free operator -- that's a luxury of the minority that I don't have anymore," said the New York Republican, hardly ruing his return to majority power, but conceding that his street instinct for political cut-and-thrust has been crimped. 
 "But I listen to them all -- listen, listen," he said. "Give people time, and if they're cooking things up it will come out," he said of the hearings' current question: whether the White House, on a damage-control mission, rummaged through the office of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy counsel, the night he committed suicide two years ago.
Last year, Senator D'Amato raged with partisan certainty about that question when he was on the attack in the minority. But, wielding the majority gavel now, he leaves it to other Republicans on the committee to attempt roundhouse innuendo. He modulates the proceedings evenly, ruling out the more far-fetched political queries for the moment as the hearings proceed with slow certainty into the Presidential election cycle.
"I relish it," conceded the hyperkinetic, 57-year-old politician who runs the inquiry with a soft-spoken gravity that seems an almost amusing relief from the essential D'Amato political dynamic perfected in a career of upset victories: the scrapper up from steerage, the nobody with no place in the halls of power -- except for his knack of seizing the initiative in jungle-fast thrusts that even his peers find breathtaking.
"He doesn't take no for an answer, and he's got a very long memory," said a fellow Senator, speaking in cool summary of Mr. D'Amato's formidable fund-raising powers, his true cutting edge within Washington's politics.
The D'Amato image that he works so hard to keep before the public -- the gauche, lippy, brazen populist -- is hardly a full picture here, where his many strands of power are gathered easily in his restless, far-reaching hands.
As the hearings proceed with some bipartisan praise for their fairness thus far, nervous witnesses at the testimony table look across at a politician at the top of his game.
Even while running the Whitewater inquiry under a near-unanimous Senate mandate, Mr. D'Amato makes time to be a strategizing and fund-raising principal in the campaign of his friend, Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, who hopes to topple President Clinton next year. Mr. D'Amato is very busy shaping this national power broker's role, one that would dwarf his mastery last year in the election of his chosen candidate, George E. Pataki, as Governor of New York.
At the same time, Mr. D'Amato is running one of politics' most important mother lodes of power and money, the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Then, too, he is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, historically one of the main generators of legislative and fund-raising power under either party's control.
"To me, this could be the culmination of all the political endeavors I've ever undertaken," said Mr. D'Amato, envisioning a Dole victory as he sat back casually this week after a long day of Whitewater, his mind's eye on a dozen current endeavors: his new sass-and-tell autobiography, which burnishes his scrapper's image; banking bill arcana that leave critics suspicious; his soaring love life; Whitewater's intriguing political rapids, and his growing role in national politics.
In this, he early on used his New York party machine as the front-runner's wedge for the Dole campaign. Lately, he has been warning the candidate against a repeat of the prime-time ideological rabidness of the 1992 Republican National Convention. Even more, he cautions Mr. Dole of Mr. Clinton's extraordinary prowess as a candidate, if not as a President.
"Ronald Reagan was the second greatest politician I've ever seen," Mr. D'Amato said. "Clinton's the best. The best. Great persona. Incredible in person. They hit him with everything last time. Here he is, in the thick of the battle."
Mr. D'Amato was clearly paying homage as a fellow besmirched scrapper who has rebounded from the canvas. "Take him for granted, we pay the price," the Senator said as Mr. Dole's national steering committee chairman, making the Whitewater hearings seem even more intriguing to discuss.
But first he sang a bit into the phone when a critical call came through. "Miss Claudy! Hi, Sweetness!" Mr. D'Amato warbled in response to the anchor-desk felicities of Claudia Cohen, the wealthy television newswoman featured in the senatorial news conference he called solely to confirm that he was in love again.
"Learning is a wonderful experience," he said, updating the romance for a visitor and describing his visits to Ms. Cohen's splendid house in the Hamptons as if in a National Geographic narrative: he, a humble denizen of the Nassau County boardwalk and poker games at the Island Park Knights of Columbus, venturing far eastward to that moneyed sleekness and finding "insight into some things I generally don't deal with."
Mr. D'Amato, endlessly visceral, stood in delight at the sudden arrival into his office of Arthur J. Finkelstein. He is one of the most reclusive political consultants in the business, gifted at honing the D'Amato image in New York and branching out more now with the Senator into the lucrative national arena. They embraced like brothers. The Senator autographed his new book, "Power, Pasta and Politics: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato," for the visitor, and Mr. Finkelstein glided out with a smile, assured that "that other thing will be taken care of."
Of heartfelt hugs and dialogue is the mesh of Senator D'Amato's days. Early Monday morning, he strolled along Broadway in Manhattan in an arm-in-arm chat with another political lieutenant, Charles A. Gargano, a legendary D'Amato fund-raiser who is now in charge of economic development for the Pataki administration. The Senator had made a Wall Street speech to a gathering of 200 world bankers, finding them too drowzy and suddenly asking how fast a 10 percent growth rate would double the national cost of Medicare.
"C'mon, this is a test, wake up!" he gibed at the silent sea of gray suits. "This is a tough one, huh? I'm boring you?" he added. "To hell with it; I'll sit down," he needled with his best beyond-the-boroughs nasality from Nassau County. He let them off the hook by announcing the answer and instructing the bankers to buy 10 copies each of his new book.
His bemused confidence was understandable. In truth, the intersection of big money and power politics is a signature nexus for Mr. D'Amato, one that has produced steady controversy but undeniable power across 25 years.
His earliest days as an avowedly innocent underling in the Nassau County Republicans' fabled "tithing" patronage machine have been followed by tens of millions in senatorial fund-raising success, some of it criticized as lobby fleecing.
The Democratic sneering that such a man, called "the vacuum cleaner" for his prowess as a fund-raiser, should be looking for ethical violations in Whitewater is rooted in his own various vettings by news organizations, prosecutorial investigators and the Senate itself.
"Even though the ethics charges were thrown out with a small admonition -- the guts of them were thrown out -- the thing lives with you," said the Senator, speaking of the investigation by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in 1991 of influence-peddling charges in the office of Senator D'Amato. He was eventually criticized by the committee for being "negligent" in letting his office and his letterheads be used by his brother, Armand, a military contract consultant, in an "improper and inappropriate manner."
This was followed by the ultimate exoneration for him, re-election. From that experience, the Senator maintains, comes a sense of empathy, not revenge, as he guides the Whitewater hearing and faces nervous, sometimes tearful witnesses with their reputations on the line.
"I have a much more acute awareness, given what I came through," he said. "Destroying someone by feeding unfair allegations -- I don't need that on my conscience. Let me tell you, families grieve."
"Become a pariah and see what happens," he advised a visitor with an owlish glare dark with memories. "A person can be turned into an outcast."
Even so, the Democrats are hardly counting on the tender mercies of Mr. D'Amato as the hearings' conclusions come out sometime during the 1996 election campaign. Concerned that the Republican majority would engineer a partisan setup, the minority, led by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, focused early on the critical pre-hearing procedures that produce the public testimony.
"Senator D'Amato did a good job setting it up -- he handled it fairly," conceded Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who has been warning other Democrats against making hyperbolic complaints about the hearings thus far.
"He's not put on his partisan hat," added Mr. Dodd, a Whitewater committee member who is mindful of Mr. D'Amato's talent for suddenly seizing most political forums with a jagged-edged sound bite.
In "Power, Pasta and Politics," published by Hyperion, Mr. D'Amato notes: "History books are filled with great men who never had the nerve to act fast enough or decisively enough." He translated this dictum into his 1992 re-election drive when he leaped on his opponent, Robert Abrams, the state's Attorney General, with an expensive and overwhelming television blitz of bare-knuckled attack ads the day after the Democrat barely survived a blistering primary fight, broke and battered.
"I had him and had to stay on top of him, just had to stay there," Mr. D'Amato said with a simple nod at the elementary nature of it all. "Politics? I don't know about politics -- this is about life," he said, preparing for another day of Whitewater.

HEADLINE: U.N. Watches Romania Violate Sanctions

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIMISOARA, Romania, July 25

 BODY:
Three times daily, a blue-and-white Yugoslav Airlines 727 passenger jet, its seats usually empty and carrying only a few crew members, pulls up at the out-of-the-way airport terminal here.
For the brief flight back to Belgrade, each 727 is pumped with much more fuel than it needs -- enough to fill three MIG fighter planes or three turbo-attack helicopters, according to State Department estimates. 
 United Nations monitors watch and record the tens of thousands of liters of fuel being loaded from a Romanian state oil truck. The monitors say a friendly hello to the Yugoslav pilot, and after he takes off, they hand official reprimands to the Romanian fuel truck driver and the local customs inspectors.
These actions have been going on for months and represent one of the most flagrant violations of international sanctions against the Belgrade Government, American and European sanctions-monitoring officials said. Last week, the officials said, the Romanian authorities allowed the number of daily flights to increase from two to three.
"Timisoara is a very blatant violation of sanctions," said Antonio Napolitano, the sanctions coordinator in Brussels for the European Union and the Organization of Security and Cooperation for Europe. "With the increase of flights, it becomes quite an export of oil."
Each 727 leaves here with about 22,000 liters of fuel for a 25-minute flight to Belgrade that requires about 5,000 liters, records of the United Nations monitors show.
Under international law, it is up to the country where the sanctions are being broken -- in this case Romania -- to shut down the violations. But despite repeated appeals to the Romanian Foreign Ministry to stop the operation, it has increased, said Casimir J. Krul, an American customs official who heads the sanctions-assistance mission in Romania.
The Romanian official at the Foreign Ministry responsible for sanctions enforcement, Dumitru Tanasa, said he did not believe the accounts of the United Nations monitors at Timisoara. Mr. Tanasa said in a telephone interview that he had informed the Romanian Department of Transportation to allocate the Yugoslav planes only enough fuel for the flight to Belgrade.
"Every day we are in contact with the representative of the Department of Transportation, and they are informing us the instructions are observed," Mr. Tanasa said.
In May, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution to close a loophole that the Belgrade Government had exploited after an easing of sanctions last fall. In exchange for agreeing to seal its border with Bosnia, Belgrade was allowed to resume commercial flights of Yugoslav Airlines.
After the easing, the airline immediately began to fly virtually empty 727's to Timisoara and fill them up. The May resolution said the Yugoslav flights could carry only sufficient fuel for the return flight and a little extra for an emergency situation. But after the Security Council action, the flights increased to two a day and then, beginning last week, started coming in three times a day.
A sanctions-monitoring team of 19 people, including 5 American customs officers, has issued 210 violation notices at the Timisoara airport, Mr. Krul said. Sanctions officers boarded the jets, took the names of the pilots and recently noted that the maintenance crewmember was wearing military identification.
American officials said that unlike many other sanctions violations in the Balkans region, where private individuals and companies are engaging in the smuggling while governments look the other way, the violations taking place here are being directed by senior Government officials. Three Romanian state authorities, the American officials said, are involved in the fueling: the state oil company, known as Romarc, the customs administration and the aviation agency.
The stepped-up operation at the airport here comes as the Romanians show that they are unable, despite some efforts at law enforcement, to stamp out the smuggling of oil from the Romanian side of the Danube River 120 miles south of here to the Serbian side. Fuel, which is coming from scores of new gas stations recently built to serve the smugglers, is also crossing by land.
A United Nations monitoring team estimated that 2,500 tons of fuel in tankers crossed the checkpoint at Naidas on Monday. On a stretch of road running 15 miles on either side of the fishing village of Pescari, where the fumes of gasoline are overpowering, United Nations monitors estimate that there are more gas stations than in all of Bucharest.
The fuel from the gas stations is pumped into jerrycans and then taken across the river in boats by hundreds of smugglers who are paid 50 German marks (about $35) each by the Serbs, the monitors said. Despite a raid by the Romanian customs authorities last month, the river smuggling seemed to be back to normal and had even increased, monitors said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND DOLE BIDDING TO BREAK WELFARE IMPASSE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
President Clinton and Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, will offer competing proposals on Monday to overcome a political impasse that has stalled welfare legislation for two months.
The two men are scheduled to outline their proposals in speeches to the National Governors' Association, meeting in Burlington, Vt. Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who is the group's incoming chairman, said he would work to line up support for Mr. Dole's plan. 
 Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton, in an effort to recapture the initiative on welfare, would announce steps to encourage states to move more of their welfare recipients into jobs. At present, fewer than 10 percent of the five million adults on welfare are employed.
Mr. Clinton will offer states incentives to meet an ambitious new goal of putting large numbers of welfare recipients into jobs or programs that prepare them for work. States could choose a variety of strategies, including "workfare" or subsidies to private employers to hire welfare recipients.
A senior Administration official said Mr. Clinton would also give states more flexibility in running their welfare programs, a priority for governors from both parties as well as for Congressional Republicans.
Senator Dole, the front-running candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, has for several weeks been struggling to broker a compromise on welfare legislation. Bills approved by the House of Representatives and by the Senate Finance Committee are, in general, much tougher than Mr. Clinton's proposals and would set more stringent work requirements.
Mr. Dole's proposal builds on the measure approved in May by the Senate Finance Committee. A bloc of 24 conservative Republicans led by Senator Phil Gramm, the Texan who is one of Mr. Dole's chief rivals for the party's Presidential nomination, rebelled against that measure, forcing Mr. Dole to move to the right in his search for a Republican consensus. Aides to Mr. Dole said his plan would place him in the middle, between a conservative bill drafted by Senator Gramm and a liberal alternative to be offered by Senate Democrats.
Mr. Dole's proposal, like the bill passed by the House in March, would give each state a lump sum of Federal money, known as a block grant, to assist poor people. State officials would have far more discretion than they now have in deciding how to use the money. But poor people would no longer have a legal right, or entitlement, to assistance, and the Federal Government would put a cap on total spending, regardless of economic need.
As they gathered in Vermont, governors of both parties said they favored welfare legislation that would leave states with the most money available and the fewest restrictions on how to use it.
Mr. Thompson said he continued to be concerned that some Republicans would load up any welfare bill with "conservative prescriptions," like work requirements or denials of cash to unwed mothers. Each of those mandates he said, just like liberal mandates of the past, "limits our flexibility, our ability to get the job done."
Senate Republicans have made progress in resolving one issue that was blocking action on welfare legislation: a dispute over how to divide up the Federal money that would be turned over to states in the form of block grants. Senators from Sun Belt states had objected to the formula used in the House bill and in the Finance Committee bill, saying it made no allowance for population growth.
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said the Republicans had agreed on a formula to compensate high-growth states with a pool of money totaling $860 million over five years.
"I believe it will be acceptable to everyone concerned," she said in an interview. And Governor Thompson said today that Senator Dole had assured him that under the new fiscal formula no state would get less Federal money than it now received and that there would be increases for high-growth states like Florida and Texas.
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, said Mr. Dole's plan was "clearly a major, major improvement" over other proposals because it would not reduce the amount of money going to states like New York. The population of New York State, around 18 million, has not increased significantly since 1970.
President Clinton, a former Governor of Arkansas, has often expressed support for governors seeking more flexibility to devise and run social welfare programs. In the President's speech on Monday, Administration officials said, he will propose expanding the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve state welfare experiments.
Administration officials said they hoped Mr. Clinton's proposals would enable him to regain control of an issue that he made a campaign priority in 1992, only to see Republicans claim it as their own after last year's elections.
An Administration official said Mr. Clinton's speech to the governors would convey this theme: "I want welfare reform. I thought we were making progress, but now things have slowed down in the Senate. In the meantime, while Congress is snarled, I will take action." The official said Mr. Clinton's action would move states in the direction of "work-based welfare reforms."
On welfare, more perhaps than on any other issue, Mr. Dole's instincts as a deal maker in the back rooms of Congress conflict with the ideological purity demanded by the conservative wing of the Republican Party.
"This may be the first philosophical battleground in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination," said Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire, which is tentatively scheduled to hold the first 1996 primary on Feb. 20.
Governor Merrill, a Republican who has not endorsed any candidate for President, said Mr. Dole was riding high in the polls in New Hampshire because he had effectively "articulated Republican policies in contrast to those of Bill Clinton." But Mr. Merrill said the welfare issue might work to the advantage of Senator Gramm.
"This gives Gramm a specific issue on which he can contrast himself with Bob Dole," the Governor said.
The view of many conservative Republicans is expressed by Robert Rector, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, who helped draft the welfare bill passed by the House in March. "Dole's lack of leadership on welfare reform, particularly on the issue of illegitimacy, has been very disappointing," he said.
Conservative groups like the Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council and Empower America have endorsed Mr. Gramm's bill.
Mr. Dole says his efforts to negotiate a compromise show his strengths as a pragmatic lawmaker. "It's not easy to put together a welfare reform package," he told the Republican National Committee two weeks ago. "It's easy to put together if you don't care how many votes that you get. But to get one that will pass is not easy."
The bill passed in March by the House would give states control of $15.4 billion a year in Federal welfare money. It would deny aid to unmarried mothers under the age of 18, most legal aliens and additional children born to families already receiving welfare. It would also authorize financial bonuses for states that reduce out-of-wedlock births.
Mr. Gramm supports these proposals; Mr. Packwood says the Federal Government should not impose its will, but should let states decide.
Senator Dole is considering several proposals to discourage out-of-wedlock births. One proposal, described in confidential documents prepared by the Senator's staff, would "require teen mothers to live at home and attend school" and would "expressly give states the option to deny benefits." Mr. Dole is also considering a proposal to "mandate that states deny benefits to teen mothers," but to let states "pass legislation to opt out" of this requirement.
William B. Lacy, deputy chairman of Mr. Dole's campaign, emphasized the differences between Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton, rather than the disagreements among Republicans. "Clinton promised in the 1992 campaign to end welfare as we know it, but he has not made it happen," Mr. Lacy said. "He hasn't lifted a finger. His inaction shows a lack of leadership."
Democrats say Mr. Clinton deserves credit for putting welfare on the national political agenda. Rahm I. Emanuel, a White House aide who worked on Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, said: "Senate Republicans are in disarray because of three forces: geography, ideology and Presidential politics. Senator Dole is bobbing and weaving among those forces."
By contrast, he said, "the President is already taking action by encouraging and approving state experiments that move people from welfare to work."
Efforts to negotiate a compromise in the Senate are hampered by the fact that one of the main negotiators, Senator Bob Packwood, is preoccupied with his own political welfare. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics has found "substantial credible evidence" to support accusations that he made unwanted sexual advances to women. Mr. Packwood, an Oregon Republican who is chief sponsor of the Finance Committee bill, is fighting the charges.
Mr. Dole recently threatened to keep the Senate in session through August to pass a welfare bill, but it is unclear whether he intends to carry out such a threat.
If the Senate does not pass a welfare bill before the recess, Republicans said, they will try to include its main provisions in an omnibus bill to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Senate rules allow only 20 hours of debate on the budget bill, and that bill will be a vehicle for many other Republican initiatives, including tax cuts and efforts to slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Mexican Connection Grows As Cocaine Supplier to U.S.

SERIES: The New Drug Lords: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico

 BODY:
The bodies of police informants still turn up around this sprawling border city, their mouths sometimes stuffed with one of the fingers they might have pointed at drug traffickers.
Mostly, though, the stronghold of the man thought to be Mexico's most powerful cocaine smuggler, Amado Carillo Fuentes, is almost peaceful compared with other drug capitals. Gun battles are rare, car bombings unheard of. The police chief cannot remember the last time armed thugs took over one of the discotheques for a party. 
 That quiet, drug enforcement officials say, is the sound of business booming.
As Mexico's political and economic ties to the United States have strengthened in recent years, American demand for illegal drugs has helped a new generation of Mexican traffickers to consolidate their power, carving out an ever larger share of the world's drug trade and posing a growing threat on both sides of the border.
That the violence among major traffickers has begun to fade may only portend greater efficiency, Mexican and American law enforcement officials say. With once-rival gangs working together more, Mexican traffickers have expanded their markets, diversified their products and cut better deals with their powerful Colombian suppliers.
Mexicans who once earned cash for transporting the Colombians' cocaine north now frequently take their payment in kind, officials say. They earn as much as half of any large load, distributing it across a network that has expanded to include most of the western United States, parts of the South, much of Chicago and pockets of New York.
The Mexican traffickers' share of the profits has risen sharply, and officials say their sophistication, contacts and corrupting influence have grown as well.
"If we don't do something, both in the southern United States and in Mexico, Mexico will take over from Colombia in a few years as the traffickers' headquarters of choice," the United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, said. "It will undermine democracy. It will undermine commercial development. It will undermine free trade."
American officials who once trumpeted Mexican cooperation in fighting drugs now worry that the Government has lost control of most of its police. When the authorities located a leading cocaine trafficker last month after his rented Learjet crashed as he flew to a wedding in Guadalajara, they needed army troops to capture him. The city's federal police commander and most of his deputies were on the trafficker's payroll, officials said.
President Ernesto Zedillo, like his predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has made a point of calling the drug trade "the most serious threat to national security" that Mexico faces.
He has promised to crack down as hard as the Government can, but many Mexican and United States officials question whether the Government is prepared to confront all the obstacles.
While American officials lavishly praised Mexico's cooperation in fighting drugs under Mr. Salinas, growing evidence indicates that protection for the traffickers reached high into his Administration. Those directly implicated in taking bribes include former federal police commanders and two of the administration's three drug enforcement directors.
American officials say huge amounts of drug money have flowed into Mexico's tourism, transportation and construction industries, helping to fuel the speculative rise of the economy until last year. Without offering details, a senior F.B.I. official, James Moody, asserted recently that many of the state-owned companies privatized under Mr. Salinas had been bought by traffickers.
Some supporters of the Zedillo Government say the central question it faces is whether, in the midst of economic and political turmoil, it can afford the instability that a serious challenge to the drug mobs might entail. Another question is whether Mexico has grown addicted to the money it earns from drugs, now estimated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration at more than $7 billion a year.
"They could hit the traffickers any time they wanted to," said one former D.E.A. official with long experience in Mexico. "But who is going to knock off the goose that lays the golden eggs?"
 
The Violence
Killing Each Other, Not the Politicians
 The bursts of violence that have attended the traffickers' rise have led many Mexicans to fear that their country is sliding toward the sort of terror that the Medellin cocaine cartel unleashed on Colombia during the late 1980's and early 1990's.
During the last three years, the victims of drug-related shootings have included the Roman Catholic Cardinal of Guadalajara, a crusading police chief of Tijuana, two former state prosecutors and more than a dozen active and retired federal police officials.
Anti-drug officials say the infighting among lower-level gangs is likely to remain endemic, especially along the border. Some officials are also braced for new violence in the United States as Mexican cocaine wholesalers strengthen their presence in distribution territory once dominated by Colombians.
At the same time, many analysts believe that the threat of more politically significant violence by the traffickers in Mexico is mostly latent.
Senior Mexican officials say they have never found hard evidence to support rumors that drug gangs were involved in the assassination last year of the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
And since jailing Mr. Salinas's elder brother, Raul, on charges of ordering the murder last fall of the party's deputy leader, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the authorities have backed away from the idea that drugs might have played a role in that slaying.
Mexican drug gangs have generally avoided the bombings, murders and other terrorism with which the Medellin cartel, in particular, sought to intimidate the Colombian Government. Given the wide availability of police protection, Mexican traffickers have generally opted to pay.
The cost of public prominence has tended to be higher. The notoriety and ruthlessness of Juan Garcia Abrego, the leading trafficker along the northeastern border and the Gulf coast, has lost him millions of dollars in seized assets, and a half-dozen of his lieutenants have been arrested. Since March he has been on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list.
Intelligence officials say the more recent Colombian influences on Mexican traffickers have not been the flashy, homicidal men from Medellin, but the cooler and more businesslike, if only marginally less violent, leaders of the Cali cartel. That has been especially apparent, they add, in the ascent of the powerful trafficker from Ciudad Juarez, Amado Carrillo Fuentes.
 
 
The Kingpin
A Career Built On Discretion
 Like Mr. Garcia Abrego, Mr. Carrillo, 39, is a nephew of one of the older traffickers who led Mexican marijuana and heroin smugglers into the cocaine age as the United States cracked down on smuggling routes through the Caribbean. Their uncle, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, was imprisoned in 1985 for the murder of an American drug agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar.
One American intelligence summary describes Mr. Carrillo as a stocky, brown-haired six-footer, reared in the sierras of the western state of Sinaloa and apprenticed in the early 1980's to Pablo Acosta, a cocaine trafficker based in Chihuahua. Mr. Carrillo took over the organization after Mr. Acosta was killed by the police in 1987.
Two sets of Mr. Carrillo's partners were arrested in 1991, and Mr. Carrillo himself was captured by the police in 1989, only to be freed for "insufficient evidence." His chief rival in Juarez, a flamboyant former state security commander, was gunned down in April 1993. That November, Mr. Carrillo narrowly escaped from gunmen apparently sent by Mr. Garcia Abrego to kill him at a seafood restaurant in Mexico City.
"He has been very lucky," said an American law enforcement official. "It has helped that a lot of people in Colombia trust him, that he has kept a low profile and a cool head and that he has a lot of contacts in all aspects of the drug trade."
American officials say Mr. Carrillo established strong ties to one of the most powerful leaders of the Cali cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.
Like those in Cali, Mr. Carrillo's trafficking operation is said to be a model of criminal security, well managed and highly compartmentalized. Drug enforcement officials say he talks over the same secure telephones used by his Colombian partners; his underlings avoid surveillance by pirating the frequencies of cellular telephones across the border and by changing beepers as often as once a day.
Perhaps more impressive has been Mr. Carrillo's ability to broker deals among groups that are often called cartels but have acted more like competitors. By syndicating large drug shipments and assigning different smuggling tasks to different partners, intelligence analysts say, he has begun to achieve economies of scale that earlier traffickers mostly dreamed about.
The wide belief among American officials in Mr. Carrillo's pre-eminence is based not only on the amount of drugs he ships but also on the contacts and Government protection that allow him to operate throughout Mexico and abroad. Intelligence analysts rank him as one of five or six patrones, or bosses, of the Mexican trade.
American officials said Mr. Carrillo had been linked to most of the seven huge loads of cocaine that were flown into Mexico from May 1994 to March 1995 on converted Boeing 727 and Caravelle jets.
Like the Tijuana-based trafficking organization run by the brothers Benjamin and Ramon Arellano Felix, he is also thought to be responsible for container ships that have brought tons of cocaine into Mexican ports.
 
The Operation
A Retailing Secret: Learn to Diversify
 Following the lead of Mr. Garcia Abrego, Mr. Carrillo and other Mexican traffickers have also begun to demand more of their payment in kind, a move that could shift the balance of power within the global cocaine trade.
Though the Colombians appear to have freely allowed the Mexicans a wider distribution role as a means of reducing their own risks and maximizing profits, the compact remains something of a riddle to drug intelligence analysts because it seems to cede so much potential power to the Mexicans.
The officials say Mr. Garcia Abrego, for example, usually earned no more than $2,000 a kilo for the cocaine picked up from Colombian pilots in Mexico and delivered to Colombian distributors in Queens or the Bronx. But where a one-ton load might then have earned him $2 million in transportation fees, a half share of the same load would be worth about $10 million on the wholesale market in New York.
In some cases, the Mexicans are simply buying entire loads of cocaine from the Colombians and selling it themselves.
Compared with the Colombians, officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration and Mexican prosecutors say, the Mexican distributors are unsophisticated, even sloppy. Their wholesale networks are looser and more independent, built on those they used to market heroin and marijuana.
But by most accounts, the Mexicans are learning quickly.
"If history is any predictor," the D.E.A. administrator, Thomas A. Constantine, said in an interview, "I think the Mexican groups will eventually force the Colombians out of narcotics trafficking and control it themselves."
While continuing to transship about 70 percent of the cocaine coming into the United States, Mexican trafficking groups have also expanded product lines as the American cocaine market has begun to decline.
In addition to the marijuana and black-tar heroin that Mexico has produced for decades, smugglers have moved into higher quality white heroin from Colombia and Southeast Asia, officials say. In the last few months, agents in Mexico have seized Laotian opium, Nigerian heroin and 13 tons of hashish from Pakistan, by far the largest seizure of the drug ever in Latin America.
In barely two years, Mr. Constantine said, Mexican traffickers have also virtually taken over the growing and highly profitable American market for methamphetamine, or speed, displacing motorcycle gangs like the Hell's Angels. The wholesale price of speed has dropped from $10,000 a pound to $2,000, cutting into the crack cocaine market in parts of the southwest and fueling new spurts of gang activity and violence.
"A pound used to be a big seizure," said the special agent in charge of the D.E.A. office in Phoenix, Richard Canas. "Now we are seeing 400 pounds."
 
 
At the Border
Trade Pact Helps All Entrepreneurs
 Mexican traffickers also seem to have embraced a vision of North American integration not unlike that with which Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was sold to skeptics in Washington.
Law enforcement officials say more and more drug cargoes are moving through Mexico into the United States as part of the widening flow of legal commerce between the two countries. Tons of marijuana and cocaine have been seized on ships and trucks coming into Mexico, and tons more on trains, tank trucks and tractor-trailers passing through Mexico as traffickers buy into trucking firms, fishing fleets and other transportation companies.
And though Mexican officials deny that traffickers have taken advantage of the country's privatization program, the State Department recently cited reports that some have been buying bank stocks and seeking election to bank boards to ease the laundering of their profits. Some traffickers have even sought trade consultants to determine what merchandise moves most quickly across the border under Nafta regulations.
"They have very specific issues," said Craig Chretien, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.'s San Diego office. "Does a perishable get through quicker than a load of steel? What kinds of cargoes go through faster than others?"
Clinton Administration officials insist that the 19-month-old trade agreement has not quickened the flow of drugs through Mexico. But United States Customs Service officials acknowledge that the smugglers are moving more of their drugs into the United States through legal ports of entry, taking advantage of rising truck traffic and a falling rate of inspections.
The traffickers have also apparently realized that American agents are not immune to the temptations to which some of their Mexican counterparts have long succumbed.
In May, two customs inspectors in El Paso were arrested on charges of conspiring with smugglers to allow more than a ton of cocaine across the border in return for a $1 million payoff. That same month, the F.B.I. began an investigation into charges by a customs supervisor in San Diego that as many as eight customs officials may have aided Mexican smugglers there.
A senior American anti-drug official described the two cases as "the tip of an iceberg."
 
 
The Corruption
Pervasive, Yes, But Not Dominant
 Reports of high-level drug corruption in the Salinas Government have helped popularize the notion that Mexico is becoming what critics call a "narcodemocracy" -- a polity in which traffickers have a disproportionate share of the votes.
But without playing down the growing danger that the traffickers pose, some analysts say the threat to political institutions remains more potential than present.
Though the earnings of Mexican traffickers are already thought to approach those of the Colombian cartels, the Mexicans' influence is diffused in a more complex political universe and an economy roughly six times as large.
Nor is there much sign that Mexican kingpins have developed the broad political agendas that have led their Colombian counterparts to form parties, finance presidential campaigns and even run for office.
It may be that Mexican traffickers have simply not yet had much to worry about: the considerable opening of Mexican politics in the last decade has seemed hardly to perturb them, and the corruption cases that have come to light suggest that the traffickers' bribes are well-aimed and rarely turned down.
"All you have to do," noted the Ciudad Juarez chief of police, Jose Luis Holguin, "is not look."

Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: The Bosses"
 Analysts at the Drug Enforcement Administration compared the loose structure of Mexican drug trafficking to a federation rather than a series of cartels. In this view, the stature of the patrones or bosses, comes not from controlling territory so much as from the international scope of their contacts and their ability to operate across Mexico with Government protection. About a dozen lower-ranking "division heads," many of them up-and-coming young traffickers, may join different bosses for different deals. Division heads, in turn, contract with smuggling groups at different points along the border to move their shipments into the United States.
 
Amado Carrillo Fuentes: At 39, considered Mexico's most powerful trafficker, organizing huge shipments by air, land and sea, and operating throughout Mexico from such bases as Ciudad Juarez, Hermosillo, Mexico City, Cuernavaca and Cancun. Indicted in the United States on heroin and marijuana charges in 1988 and on cocaine charges in 1993, he faces only a minor gun charge in Mexico.
 
Juan Garcia Abrego: A 50-year-old native of La Paloma, Tex., he dominates drug trafficking in northeastern Mexico and along the Gulf-coast corridor. The main smuggler of Colombian cocaine going to Houston, Dallas and New York, he pioneered deals in which Mexican traffickers take payment in kind, raising their profits sharply. Put on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list in March, there is a $2 million reward for his capture.
 
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo: A 48-year-old former Sinaloa state policeman, he rose to become the "godfather" of Mexican cocaine trafficking until his arrest in April 1989 in connection with the murder of an American drug agent four years earlier. His nephews, Benjamin and Ramon Arellano Felix, moved part of his organization to Tijuana, establishing themselves as the strongest traffickers on the Pacific coast. Since being jailed, Felix Gallardo has continued to trade on his singular contacts, brokering deals around the country.
 
Juan Jose Esparragosa Moreno: A 46-year-old former associate of F'elix Gallardo's nicknamed El Azul, or "Blue," he is the least known of the country's major traffickers but has risen quickly back to prominence since completing a six-year prison sentence in 1991. Once bases mainly in Guadalajara, he is said to have moved north, working with Carrillo Fuentes and Hector Luis Palma.
 
Joaquin Guzman: A former Felix Gallardo lieutenant, Guzman, 40, broke away after the boss's arrest, allying himself with Palma. Known for his intelligence and 5-foot-6-inch -- he is called Chapo, or "Shortie" -- he became one of Mexico's more innovative smugglers, building tunnels beneath the border at Douglas, Ariz., and San Ysidro, Calif. Officials say Guzman was the target of an attack by the Arellano Felix brothers in which the Catholic Cardinal of Guadalajara was killed in May 1993, and he was captured a month later.

HEADLINE: After Three Months on the Job, France's President Exudes Elan

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 29

 BODY:
In barely three months as President of France, Jacques Chirac has cultivated a macho image that is the envy of far younger leaders, like President Clinton.
After the French leader made a dramatic call for American and British support for stronger military action against Bosnian Serb attacks on United Nations "safe areas," one Administration aide in Washington said, "Some people in the White House are absolutely convinced that Chirac is grandstanding to make Clinton look bad." 
 Officially, Mr. Clinton, who will soon be 49, and Mr. Chirac, who is 62, are said to be on the best of terms -- "Jacques" and "Bill."
At the staff level, though, there is irritation in Washington along with grudging admiration for the legerdemain that has given Mr. Chirac a reputation as the most dynamic leader in the Western world before he has really had much chance to prove that he deserves it.
His moves have been decisive but brusque, like the man himself. In June, he outraged leaders in the Pacific, from Australia to Japan, by announcing a resumption of underground French nuclear testing in the Pacific this September. And he annoyed Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain by refusing to dismantle French border controls with them until he was satisfied that they would keep drug smugglers, illegal immigrants and terrorists from crossing into France.
Police checks of foreigners' papers were stepped up nationwide after a bomb exploded in a Paris commuter train last Tuesday and killed seven people.
Nevertheless, Mr. Chirac, elected with 52.6 percent of the vote after a campaign focused almost exclusively on promises to get the country's unemployment rate below 12 percent, has watched his poll ratings sink while unemployment has stayed stubbornly high.
In a nationwide telephone poll conducted by IFOP, a polling institute, in mid-July, only 44 percent of those polled said they were satisfied by Mr. Chirac's performance in office, compared with 59 percent in May.
Six feet tall and athletically trim, he favors double-breasted suits but takes to more informal American-style loafers and sports jackets when working political crowds, reportedly on the advice of his daughter and communications adviser, Claude Chirac.
She also has apparently told him to go slow on granting one-on-one television appearances or press interviews, for he has granted no such requests since May.
He has held two news conferences since his election, both of them following the White House format of the President standing behind a lectern and calling on questioners. That is a sharp change from the tradition begun by Charles de Gaulle of the President regally pontificating from behind an ornate desk.
Despite his tough policy statements, he has also brought an easygoing American style to the working habits of the Elysee Palace, the Paris equivalent of the White House, dropping in informally on aides to see how they are doing or picking up the phone rather than working from the formal memos favored by his predecessor, Francois Mitterrand. "Enjoy your siesta," he jokes to aides who work 14-hour days.
Visitors find him far more accessible than previous French Presidents. When Richard C. Holbrooke, the American Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, came to Paris to discuss Bosnia policy early this month, Mr. Chirac agreed on short notice to come over to an aide's office to talk with him. The President just came in and pulled up a chair, according to another American with Mr. Holbrooke.
Mr. Chirac apparently acquired this style during a summer in Cambridge, Mass., in 1953, when he and two classmates from the Institut des Sciences Politiques attended summer courses at Harvard College. He also got a job as a dishwasher at the local Howard Johnson's restaurant, but was promoted to be a waiter upstairs after three days.
Though French regional delicacies, and not Howard Johnson's fare, were served on the lawn of the Elysee at his first July 14 national day reception this year, Mr. Chirac invited 4,000 young people in blue jeans and scouts' uniforms and turned it from a garden party into something more like an American picnic.
Many of the young people had worked on his campaign, but the usual guests from the Paris elite of politicians, business leaders and well-connected journalists found themselves unexpectedly without invitations.
Mr. Chirac has tried to send other signals that he means to change things. Immediately after the election, he said that all members of the Government would give up one of the most cherished perquisites of political power in Paris -- the right to race through the streets to and from work in limousines with sirens, flashing lights, and police motorcycle escorts.
From now on, he ordered, Government drivers must stop at red lights and obey speed limits. Officials would travel on commercial aircraft; a VIP fleet would be dismantled and its planes returned to the French Air Force.
The President retained access only to two small Falcon 900 executive jets, and he used one of those for a tour of French-speaking Africa this month.
Mr. Chirac's many critics here believe, though, that it is far too early in his seven-year term to judge Mr. Chirac as a statesman. Some believe that his activity on foreign affairs is mostly a diversion from the intractable problems of unemployment, which he himself has said is the Government's first priority. He has taken steps to encourage employers to hire the long-term unemployed and entry-level workers.
In Bosnia, he has repeatedly signaled that he will not be satisfied with the status quo, threatening to withdraw the French peacekeepers unless the United Nations is given the means to be more effective.
When hundreds of peacekeepers in Bosnia were taken hostage by the Bosnian Serbs at the end of May in retaliation for NATO bombing raids on military installations in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, Mr. Chirac was reported to be furious -- at the peacekeepers, for submitting too meekly.
Aides say that he upbraided Adm. Jacques Lanxade, the chief of the French military general staff, as if he had been personally responsible.
Admiral Lanxade offered to resign, and last Tuesday French officials announced that he would be replaced by Gen. Christian Quesnot, an advocate of firmer military action in Bosnia.
Mr. Chirac persuaded Britain to join France in sending 10,000 additional troops to back up the peacekeepers, and he also pressed for American logistical support to move them around in helicopters.
What he finally got instead, after the Bosnian Serbs began overrunning Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, was the promise of intensified American and NATO air strikes to deter further attacks.
But the French diplomacy in NATO and the United Nations was acknowledged to have been shrewd. As one American military officer pointed out, it is a French general in Zagreb, Croatia -- Gen. Bernard Janvier, the commander of the United Nations Protection Force for the former Yugoslavia -- who now has the ultimate authority to begin the bombing.
Mr. Chirac met with Prime Minister John Major of Britain today and got an agreement to try to restart the stalled peace talks for Bosnia.
Mr. Chirac's reputation for decisive derring-do is now so firmly established that when loud detonations were heard near Pale on July 23, people around the world were prepared to believe, despite Mr. Chirac's fervent denials, that he had ordered a bold French bombing raid.
At first, aides say, he was amused, but after the Paris commuter train bombing, he concluded that the Pale rumor might be seen as a provocation for terrorist actions. On Thursday, the French General Staff issued a formal denial that there had been a French bombing raid on Pale.

HEADLINE: Communism in Laos: Poverty and a Thriving Elite

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM 

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos, July 25

 BODY:
As Laos, a vital but virtually forgotten battleground of the Vietnam War, prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Communist "people's democracy," it remains a place of harsh inequalities.
It is a country of 4.5 million people where a small class of entrepreneurs and members of the Communist establishment has attained a level of prosperity reminiscent of the privileged life of those who benefited from French colonialism and the years of American dominance that ended with the Communist victory. 
 "The social injustices, the growing differentiation among the few and the many are enormous," said the Ambassador of a formerly Communist country.
After the Lao People's Democratic Republic was proclaimed in December 1975, the Government practiced an austere brand of Communism, with low economic activity. But in the late 1980's, following Vietnam's lead, it recognized a need to make up for faltering Soviet assistance by gradually opening up to foreign investment and appealing for broader international assistance.
The subsequent influx of businessmen, particularly from neighboring Thailand, led to many joint ventures, which found their Laotian partners among the existing elite, Communist and pre-Communist.
More of the former privileged classes survived in Laos than in Vietnam, where repression was more ruthless, and in Cambodia, where most of the old elite were killed during the Pol Pot regime. With the economic liberalization in this country, overseas Laotians, mostly in the United States and France, along with their relatives here, began playing an important role in business.
"Our hearts have always stayed here, and now it's also possible to do business," a frequent long-term visitor from France said.
But for the poor, there seems to be little such optimism in a country that is classified by the United Nations as a "least developed" nation.
"Only 20 percent of the national budget goes to the social sector, and the same is true for the aid of the donor Governments," said the head of a major United Nations agency, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of its presence here. "They have accepted this imbalance. The gap is widening. They have done nothing for the villages."
About 85 percent of the population is estimated to be peasant farmers, who enter the money economy only marginally. They live from what they grow, augmented by barter. Estimates of per capita annual income, ranging from $250 to $335 cited by international organizations, are based on Government statistics in which the organizations have little faith.
None of this appears to raise questions among the top leadership of this single-party state. The party forswore its ideology of creating a classless society when it began the "new economic mechanism" in 1986, but it continues to swear by the tenets of Marxism-Leninism.
When asked whether his party had changed its goals, President Nouhak Phoumsavan cited a need "to readjust" to "the reality of the situation."
"The aspirations and noble ideals of the Lao people of all ethnic groups are to lead toward development of a prosperous country and create a life of affluence, well-being and justice in society," the President said when asked whether Communism remained the eventual aim.
Mr. Nouhak Phoumsavan is a revolutionary hard-liner believed to be in his 80's and one of the few surviving leaders of the generation of disciples of Ho Chi Minh, founder of Communism in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. While reading prepared answers to questions submitted in advance, the President gave no indication how his Government intended to realize its goals.
There was however, some apparent criticism of the Government's policies from Sisana Sisane, who at 73 is the most outspoken of the early Communist leaders.
"We were a little dogmatic in the past and made a mistaken analysis," he said. "Laos is not yet ready for Communism or capitalism. First we must reach the point where we can opt for one or the other. We must be a little realistic. The subsistence economy is the obstacle."
Despite an annual economic growth rate of 6 to 7 percent since 1990, most of it concentrated in the capital, this progress is in part negated by a population growth rate of 3 percent and a gross domestic product of about $1 billion. Foreign assistance financed 44 percent of the 1994 budget, 40 percent of which was devoted to the public payroll.
From 1990 until the end of 1994 the Government succeeded in cutting rampant inflation, limiting it to single-digit rates for the last three years.
The country's principal exports are logs, hydroelectric power and garments and motorcycles made here from imported materials, because of the cheap labor in Laos.
Romeo A. Reyes, senior economist of the United Nations Development Program, prescribed "more fiscal discipline," more tax collection, less use of the money-printing press and cuts in the public payroll. But in the United Nations Human Development Index, Laos remains near the bottom. It ranks 133d out of 173 countries. Life expectancy is steady at 50 years. Of 1,000 children born this year, 182 are expected to die before the age of 5; the infant mortality rate is at least 125 out of 1,000. The United Nations Children's Fund reports that only one pregnant woman of 20 sees a health worker, and most births are unattended.
"There isn't really any functioning health-care system," said the head of the United Nations agency. "There are hospitals, but there isn't really any reason to go to them."
Visits to the hospitals of Xiengkhouang and Luang Namtha Provinces showed why. They are rundown, unsanitary places virtually empty of functioning equipment and medicines and receive electricity two or three hours an evening.
"Yes, from time to time people die here because we don't have what they need," said Dr. Sivay Vong Thongchit, deputy hospital director in Xiengkhouang.
Gov. Kuan Keomany of Luang Namtha, a mountainous province on the Chinese border, said he was satisfied with the achievements of socialism. He said modern diagnostic equipment in the military hospital in Vientiane had discovered he was suffering from a lung ailment, and he was cured.
He is a member of the ruling elite of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, with access to the best. He acknowledged that at his provincial hospital not even the simple X-ray machine was working. Few in his remote province have ever been far from their villages.
A survey by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization last year concluded that 47.3 percent of children under 5 were "stunted" from chronic malnutrition and 10.5 percent "wasted" from acute malnutrition. The results showed no change from a 1983 survey. Fewer than half the rural population have access to safe drinking water.
"But I think poverty is even more serious," said Jan Mattsson, resident coordinator of the large United Nations community. "The statistics are very poor."
Underdevelopment is equally unchanging in education, according to international officials. Estimates of the illiteracy rate range from 50 to 80 percent.
The United Nations reports 70 percent enrollment in primary grades in 1993-94, with a dropout rate of 60 percent. Less than three years of schooling is the mean, and most teachers have had less than five years of education. A result of this is what some Laotians and most international officials, aid workers and foreign businessmen call "the human-resource problem" and consider the principal constraint on hopes for development.
The refugee exodus after the Communist takeover deprived Laos of about one-tenth of its population, including a majority of its small educated elite. The vacuum has not been filled and puts heavy strain on the few officials with whom the large number of foreign donors and businessmen must deal.
Deputy Foreign Minister Souban Srithirath said in an interview, for instance, that Laos did not aspire to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, because it did not have enough qualified officials to take part in its work.
But despite the evident abandonment of Communist objectives, the governing party does not provide any indication of willingness to dilute its monopoly on power, which is anchored in the Constitution.
"When most people don't know how to read and write, how can you have democracy?" the French-educated Mr. Souban Srithirath said.

HEADLINE: Asian Nations Putting Pressure on France Over Nuclear Tests

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, July 29

 BODY:
With France only weeks away from resuming nuclear tests in the Pacific, governments across Asia and the South Pacific are demanding that the French reconsider, and there are warnings of an economic boycott that could damage the French economy.
The most potent threat may come from Japan, where the Government has bitterly criticized the decision by President Jacques Chirac to resume nuclear testing in French Polynesia this fall after a three-year moratorium. Mr. Chirac says his decision is irrevocable. 
 Last week 47 Japanese lawmakers, many of them prominent members of parties in the coalition Government, called for a boycott of French luxury goods, a threat that carries weight given the affection of millions of Japanese consumers for brand-name French fashion, perfumes and liquor.
The Japanese market accounts for as much as half of the profits for some French makers of luxury goods, and shares of several of those companies have been tumbling in the French stock markets as a result of the protests in Japan.
"Nations that possess nuclear weapons must show their wisdom and set an example to countries that do not have nuclear weapons," the Japanese Science and Technology Minister, Makiko Tanaka, said in a letter to Mr. Chirac. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has accused France of "betraying" nonnuclear countries with the resumption of nuclear tests.
Mr. Chirac announced in June, shortly after his election, that France would carry out eight underground explosions in two tiny Polynesian atolls -- Mururoa and Fangatauta -- from September through May. After that, he has promised, France will sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and end nuclear testing forever.
The French Government has said it needs to carry out the tests to check the reliability and safety of its existing nuclear arsenal. But that has not satisfied foreign leaders and environmental campaigners who say computer simulations would offer much the same information.
There is debate among scientists about the environmental impact of the tests, with French geologists insisting that none of the radiation from the test sites can leak from the hard basalt bedrock of the atolls. Scientists elsewhere are not so sure, concerned that radiation could reach the ocean through a porous layer of limestone.
The decision to resume the tests has been criticized by the United States, Britain and Russia -- nuclear powers that have all halted testing.
Last week, the lower house of the Russian Parliament condemned the French tests, describing as "dangerous such testing in the fragile systems of coral reefs." Only China, which has continued to conduct underground nuclear experiments at Lop Nor in the western province of Xianjiang, has continued to test.
Although they can threaten nothing like the economic wallop of a Japanese boycott, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand have offered far stronger words against the French.
"An arrogant action of a European colonial power," Prime Minister Jim Bolger of New Zealand has said of the French tests. The Australian Prime Minister, Paul Keating, described the tests as "deplorable."
"We are determined to maintain the pressure on France to modify its program to desist from testing weapons and also to encourage further international focus on France," Mr. Keating said last week in Melbourne after meeting with Mr. Bolger.

HEADLINE: Gowanus: Rougher Road Ahead;
Highway Work Will Make It Worse Before It's Better

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
It would be hard to blame people in Sunset Park and Red Hook for wanting to turn back the clock, to reclaim western Brooklyn as it was before the soaring, noisy eyesore known as the Gowanus Expressway was rammed through their neighborhoods.
But the river of steel and concrete forced on another generation by Robert Moses in 1941 is about to become even more of an intrusion. 
 The state plans to overhaul the 3.8-mile elevated part of the Gowanus, which is falling apart in places, at an estimated cost of $500 million to $600 million.
State officials say the highway is too important to be shut down, even briefly, so they plan to do the work piecemeal. That will take six years, far longer than it would take to build a new highway.
While the work is under way, the neighborhoods along Third Avenue, cast into shadow and economic decline 54 years ago by the creation of the Gowanus, will be filled again with noise and heavy equipment. The expressway traffic that roars or creeps past the third-floor windows of row houses will be worse, the traffic that spills onto Third Avenue will be worse and the traffic on alternative routes, like Fourth Avenue and the Fort Hamilton Parkway, will be worse, perhaps much worse.
State officials say this is the price of keeping alive the Gowanus, a commercial and commuting artery on which the city is utterly dependent, used daily by tens of thousands of commuters and trucks.
The Gowanus has always exemplified the hardships created by building a highway through an urban area. And its reconstruction will probably reinforce those lessons.
"Construction on this scale is devastating to a community," said Robert E. Paaswell, director of the University Transportation Research Center at City College. "The project may be absolutely necessary, and it may be wonderful when it's done, but the pain while it's being done is very real."
In the next few months, the State Transportation Department will release its environmental assessment of several proposals for the Gowanus and designate one as the best choice. The department will then hold public hearings and choose one option; it clearly favors keeping the expressway open while the repairs are going on, in work that could begin as early as 1997.
On the side streets where the green-painted Gowanus looms, where windows are shut even on beautiful days to keep out fumes and soot, many express a deep resignation about the discomfort ahead.
"I guess they've got to fix it, but I'm dreading it," said Alexandra Mendez, 49, who runs a day care center in her home in Sunset Park, a mixture of middle-class and working-class neighborhoods with large Hispanic and Chinese populations. Shaking her head, she glanced up at the expressway and said: "It's going to be awful. Six years . . . ."
Another Sunset Park resident, Sonia Solero, a 43-year-old homemaker, said: "I've been hearing about this for years, so I know it's coming, and I guess there's nothing we can do about it.
"It's already so bad, with the cars and the smog and the noise," she said. "A lot of times when there are accidents up on the highway, they come down here, on the streets. And it's impossible to move, and there are more accidents on the streets and it's not safe for the kids to cross the street."
She worries that having the Third Avenue median full of construction equipment and temporary supports will invite prostitution and drug dealing. "It's no good when you give people places to hide," she said.
Some residents say that the project is unnecessary and that its cost could approach $1 billion. "It's going to create a poverty zone," said Tony Giordano, executive director of Sunset Park Restoration, a community group that has fought the project. "Any time you have all that construction going on for years and years, anyone who can afford to move out of that location will move away."
 
Ahead: Traffic Jams, Noise and Traffic
 Brian T. Ketcham, a private transportation engineer who has worked with the project's opponents, acknowledged the difficulty of putting a price on noise, traffic and pollution, but he estimated that the project would cost Sunset Park $215 million, in both tangible and intangible ways.
But the Transportation Department and five independent experts interviewed say the Gowanus must remain. "We know there will be impacts," said Sandra E. Williams, the regional director of the department. "But it has to be done. We're going to go farther out of our way to mitigate the effects of this project than we've ever gone before."
The department will close three of the Gowanus's six lanes at a time. To keep traffic moving, Ms. Williams said, tow trucks will wait just off the highway to remove disabled cars quickly. The state plans to repave the streets parallel to the highway, like Fourth Avenue, before work begins on the Gowanus, so those roads can better manage the spillover. Officials hope that thousands of commuters will switch to public transportation.
Last year, state officials said the overhaul would take 10 to 12 years -- too long even by New York standards -- and that brought howls from residents and elected officials. In response, the state planned round-the-clock work schedules and decided to promise bonuses for contractors who finish work on time. The current estimate for the project is six years and four months.
On an average day, 175,000 vehicles use the Gowanus, which stretches from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel in Red Hook. Although the highway is important for commuters, its most important role, experts say, is in commerce.
Heavy trucks make up about 5 percent of the traffic, and that share may rise to 25 percent during off-peak hours. The Gowanus is the major route for freight moving between New Jersey and Long Island, between Manhattan and Staten Island, and between Brooklyn and much of the rest of the world.
"Brooklyn is stuck with trucks," said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a transportation consultant to the Regional Plan Association, a private group that studies development and transportation issues, "and that means it's stuck with the Gowanus. If it weren't a major truck route, I might say we could do without it, but the Gowanus serves a function for which there is no alternative."
 
6 Years of Trouble, Or 2 Years of Chaos?
 Opponents of the project argue that the state has not seriously considered alternatives. "They're talking about the most expensive highway, mile for mile, in United States history," Mr. Giordano said, "and what we are going to get for that is basically the same roadway that was built 50 years ago."
The opponents want to raze the elevated part of the expressway, north of 66th Street, and convert Third Avenue into a boulevard with local and express lanes, like the West Side Highway in Manhattan.
But a boulevard would be inadequate, say independent experts, including Mr. Ketcham, the engineer who has ties to the opposition groups. "Traffic would redistribute itself through the local streets, and I don't think that's what the community wants, either," he said.
He proposes an equally radical, and cheaper, answer: tear down the Gowanus and build a new elevated highway. "It could done in two years, to a standard that will last for 100 years," he said. His plan would trade six years or more of trouble for two years of utter chaos, a swap many would oppose.
"Close it and have all those trucks on my streets?" asked Hector Rodriguez, 46, an unemployed Red Hook resident. "No thank you."
State officials concede that Mr. Ketcham's way would be faster and less expensive, but they insist that going without the highway, even for a short time, is not an option, and many outside experts agree.
During the most disruptive part of the project, the replacement and widening of the concrete deck, three of the six lanes will be shut down at a time. Two lanes will always be open for the heaviest traffic, with one for traffic heading the other way.
The elevated section sits on steel supports, most of them anchored in the Third Avenue median. Some steel will be replaced, so heavy equipment will block parts of the avenue while much of that work is under way.
The rebuilding plan also calls for changing several features that contribute to the Gowanus's notorious traffic jams. The road has very little room outside the traffic lanes, so a single breakdown or accident always stops a lane. To create a partial shoulder, the roadbed, already more than 80 feet wide, will grow by about 3 feet. That would provide room for a car to move part of the way out of traffic.
Areas of the highway that are chronic bottlenecks or frequent accident sites will be widened or redesigned, including the transitions from the Gowanus to the B.Q.E., from the Prospect Expressway to the Gowanus, and from the Gowanus to the Shore Parkway, and the exits at 38th and 39th Streets.
 
Yet Another Blow For a Battered Street
 When the Gowanus was built in 1941, most of the immediate dire effects were felt in Sunset Park. Through the Depression, Third Avenue was lined with stores, restaurants and theaters. An elevated train line cast a venetian blind shadow on the avenue, but that line was closed in 1940.
Sunset Park residents wanted the Gowanus to run above Second Avenue, through an industrial area between Third Avenue and the waterfront. But Mr. Moses thought that using the steel pillars of the elevated tracks in the columns for his highway would make it cheaper.
The homes and businesses on the east side of avenue were demolished, and others were lost to on-and off-ramps. A hundred stores and 1,300 homes were ripped up, Robert A. Caro wrote in "The Power Broker" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1974), his Moses biography.
The avenue was pitched into darkness, and its constant flow of cars and trucks turned pedestrians away. Nearly all the businesses that were not torn down closed. Third Avenue became desolate.
"If Third Avenue was the heart of the neighborhood," Mr. Caro wrote, "Moses tore it out."

Map/Diagram: "TRAFFIC ALERT: Rebuilding the Gowanus"
 The Gowanus Expressway, which slices through Sunset Park and Red Hook in western Brooklyn, is deteriorating. The state plans to overhaul the 3.8-mile elevatged part of the highway, adding a partial shoulder and widening or redesigning major interchanges that are the sites of chronic bottlenecks and frequent accidents.
 
SHORE PARKWAY INTERCHANGE
 The outbound Shore Parkway Interchange is the Gowanus viaduct's deadliest stretch, largely because the parkway exit is where drivers don't expect it: on the left. The state plans to reverse the ramps, and to close the Third Avenue ramp to the inbound Shore Parkway.
 
BUS/HOV LANE
 Between 92d Street and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel a bus and High Occupancy Vehicle lane could be created.
 
38TH AND 39TH STREET INTERCHANGE
 The interchange at j38th and 39th Streets is another accident-prone area. The overhaul would widen the exit ramps' sharp curves and lengthen their approach lanes.

HEADLINE: Sexual Assault Trial Puts a Chicago Congressman's Career on the Brink

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 29

 BODY:
Five days into the trial of a Chicago Congressman charged with sexual assault, obstructing justice and soliciting child pornography, a recording of a sexually explicit telephone conversation has cast a long shadow over the short career of a rising political star, while the woman who once claimed to be his victim sits in jail, refusing to testify.
Representative Mel Reynolds, a Democrat elected in 1992 from the Second Congressional District, is accused of having sex with Beverly Heard when she was a 16-year-old campaign volunteer, and of trying to get lurid photographs of a 15-year-old girl. 
 He is also accused of persuading Ms. Heard to leave the state to avoid talking to prosecutors and to sign a sworn affidavit recanting her testimony against him before a grand jury.
If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of four years on the sexual charges and up to seven years for obstruction of justice.
Prosecutors say that Ms. Heard, now 19, went to the Cook County State's Attorney's office last June and told them she had had sexual relations with Mr. Reynolds beginning in June 1992, after he approached her outside her high school and offered her a job. Their sexual relationship continued, she said, until September 1993, when Ms. Heard joined the Air Force.
On the basis of Ms. Heard's statements and a police-monitored telephone conversation between Ms. Heard and Mr. Reynolds, prosecutors obtained a court order to record phone conversations between the two.
Those tape recordings now represent the bulk of the prosecution's case, because Ms. Heard issued a 55-page statement last December saying that although she and Mr. Reynolds had gone to hotel rooms when she was 16 and had played with sex toys, they had never had intercourse. The statement contradicted her testimony before the grand jury last summer.
On Wednesday, the third day of the trial, Ms. Heard appeared in court for the first time since issuing her statement. She appeared nervous and downcast under questioning by the First Assistant State's Attorney, Andrea Zopp.
She first refused to answer any questions, then responded to queries about her military service. But when asked by Ms. Zopp to describe her first meeting with Mr. Reynolds, Ms. Heard invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Judge Fred G. Suria of Cook County Circuit Court told Ms. Heard that she could not refuse to answer questions if no criminal charges could result from her replies, and he ordered her to answer the question. When she refused, he declared her in contempt of court.
Ms. Zopp asked another dozen questions about how and when Ms. Heard had met Mr. Reynolds, all of which Ms. Heard refused to answer. For each refusal, Judge Suria imposed a new contempt-of-court charge. Finally, he ordered her to spend the night in Cook County Jail.
On both Thursday and Friday, the process repeated itself. Today, Ms. Heard remains in jail. Unless she relents and agrees to testify, she will remain there at least until the end of the trial unless she agrees to testify.
The legality of the judge's action, however, is not clear, because the District Attorney has refused to grant Ms. Heard immunity from prosecution for perjury. And since she has sworn to two opposite versions of events, whichever version she testifies to on the witness stand would make her vulnerable to perjury charges on the other version.
Late Friday, prosecutors softened their stance on immunity from perjury charges. "If we get to the point where the judge feels she truly should not answer a question because her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination would be in jeopardy, we would consider immunity," Andy Knott, a spokesman for the State's Attorney's office, said in a telephone interview.
For his part, Mr. Reynolds told reporters on Wednesday that he considered the treatment of Ms. Heard by the prosecutors and judge "a travesty."
But he had no comment about the salacious nature of the tape recordings that have now assumed center stage in his trial or about any other aspect of the case.
Jurors seemed to alternate between shock and amusement as they read a transcript of two conversations recorded last June. On the transcripts, Mr. Reynolds asks Ms. Heard what color underwear she was wearing. He then reminded her how much fun they had had "that summer" when they had sexual intercourse "out south in that Riverdale apartment." He next asks her to describe to him in detail her most recent sexual encounter with her lesbian lover.
At another point in the transcript Ms. Heard offers to introduce Mr. Reynolds to a 15-year-old friend, "Theresa," who, Ms. Heard tells him, is interested in "threesomes." Theresa was also, Ms. Heard said, a Catholic schoolgirl.
Mr. Reynolds exclaims, "Did I win the Lotto?"
Later he asks Ms. Heard to take Polaroid photographs of Theresa's breasts and genitals for him. It is that request that led to the charge of solicitation of child pornography.
In fact, Theresa never existed. She was created by Ms. Heard and the State's Attorney's office. Ms. Heard's lawyer, Eric Dunham, recently told reporters that the recordings had merely captured a sexual fantasy game that she and Mr. Reynolds played over the telephone.
That is also the stance of Mr. Reynolds's defense team. "He had no physical contact with Beverly Heard," said Sam Adam, one of the Congressman's lawyers. "He had a series of phone calls with her. Explicit, graphic phone calls. So? He's an adult. She's an adult. What's illegal? You can still talk dirty if you want to, to the best of my knowledge."
Whatever the eventual verdict, there can be little doubt that the charges will have a profound impact on Mr. Reynolds's political future, and on that of his overwhelmingly minority and lower-income district.
Three years ago, Mr. Reynolds, a Rhodes Scholar and lawyer, defeated Gus Savage, the incendiary, race-baiting incumbent, in the Democratic primary.
"He was the opposite of Gus Savage, who ran on a platform of racial polarization," said David Axelrod, a Chicago Democratic political consultant.
In Washington, Mr. Reynolds won a coveted seat on the House Ways and Means Committee. From that foundation, he seemed poised to become one of the more visible young black voices in Congress.
But when the Democrats lost their House majority in the 1994 elections, Mr. Reynolds lost his Ways and Means seat. Today, he sits on the much less powerful Economic and Educational Opportunities panel.
He is also facing a separate Federal investigation of his campaign finances and of whether he falsified information to receive a bank loan. "There is likely to be a large group of voters in the Second District, especially churchgoers and conservative suburban and middle-class voters, who will have a hard time supporting him in 1996," says Alan Gitleson, a professor of political science at Loyola University of Chicago. "But then there is another group that will likely support him more vocally exactly because of the charges he's faced. This group will use the claims that he was victimized by the white establishment and by the media and the unfair justice system to increase sympathy for him."
Mr. Axelrod, the political consultant, adds: "If Mel runs in 1996, it will probably be as a mirror image of Gus Savage. He will embrace everything he once rejected. I think we'll see him playing the race card for all it's worth."
For now, Mr. Reynolds refuses to say whether he will run in 1996 if acquitted. But even if he should win re-election in 1996, it seems unlikely that he would ever achieve the prominence for which he once seemed destined. "The national Democratic Party will probably stay as far away from him as possible," Mr. Gitelson says. "There won't be any of those plum committee assignments ever again."
Even so, Mr. Reynolds is not without support. On the sidewalk outside the courtroom on Thursday afternoon, the Congressman was approached by three young black men who embraced him and shook his hand.
"Give 'em hell, Mel," said one.
"Yeah," said another, "we're with you, man. We'll always be with you."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
The Market Is Strong for Hired Guns

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
Have Gun, Will Travel. Wire . . . David Cone.
Peace in the Wild West, peace in the Transvaal may have made the gun-toting mercenary passe. But the ball-throwing variety is gaining in stature as never before. 
 It used to be that the term hired gun applied to precious few strong-armed baseball players. Through the 1980's, Doyle Alexander had the market practically to himself, riding from town to town, providing innings and, late in his career, more than a few victories and a division championship or two.
Now, though, the woods are full of Doyle Alexanders, as economics and the assertiveness of big-market contenders has caused antsy also-rans and cash-poor teams to dump expensive talent in exchange for unproven, cheap diamonds in the rough.
So it is that Jim Abbott and Ken Hill changed teams this week. Then there's Cone, the former Royals prospect turned Mets ace, turned Blue Jays pennant insurance, turned reborn Royal-for-life turned Blue Jay gamble, turned Yankees savior.
On Friday, Cone was shipped by Toronto to the Yankees, a pitching-poor team seeking pennant-race insurance. And, as the Yankees had hoped, Cone paid immediate dividends by stopping the Minnesota Twins on six hits over eight innings to win, 4-2, last night.
Cone's 10th victory of the season was his first in a long while in a game that had importance as he helped the resurgent Yankees keep up the pressure on the first-place Boston Red Sox.
Like Abbott and Hill, Cone is leaving a club that acquired him with high hopes in the spring only to march full speed into a rebuilding process once the season fizzled.
"Maybe it's the state of the game," Cone said. "Kirby Puckett said when the Twins traded Rick Aguilera, there's no more loyalty. And you're probably going to see a lot more of this in the future as far as rosters getting turned over quicker and players getting moved."
When Cone donned a Yankee uniform yesterday, it made official the sixth stop in his relatively short career, a phenomenon that would have been unheard of for such a talent in past eras.
So, too, would have been the movement of an incumbent Cy Young Award winner. Cone is now two teams removed from the season in which he won the pitching honors as a Kansas City Royal.
As Cone said, he knows that the moving of players like so many chess pieces is now the reality. It is also ironic that he is so intertwined with others, like Bobby Bonilla, his former Met teammate turned Oriole. Then there's Bret Saberhagen, Cone's teammate in Kansas City and in New York. The Mets right-hander threw eight shutout innings last night in what could have been a nifty audition for courting contenders like the Red Sox.
"He's a good friend," Cone said of Saberhagen. "We played together in Kansas City. I bought his house when he went to the Mets and I went back to Kansas City. I always watch him and pull for him. It would be extremely ironic if he ended up with the Red Sox."
Ironic, but not surprising, not since what was once an identifiable core of untouchables on each team became obsolete. Add the talents and track record of a pitcher like Cone and it was a no-brainer that he would not only be sought after, but moved to a contender in the days leading to the July 31 trading deadline.
"It's not puzzling at all," said Buck Showalter, the 1995 winner of the David Cone sweepstakes. "He's coveted."
From Kansas City to New York and back, again, Cone has shown that he is mentally and physically equipped to handle not only life's little bounces, but the major potholes as well. And as New Yorkers know, potholes can be killers in the Big Apple. Cone traversed such potholes.
It would be an upset if the witty and media-savvy Cone was unable to handle the Bronx Zoo. Cone is perfectly suited for the role now handed him, just as Alexander was, but for entirely different reasons.
Alexander, hardened by an unsettling trade from the Dodgers to the Orioles early in his career, embittered by that truly forgettable tenure in the Bronx Zoo, settled into a steely, but detached, resolve. It showed when he pitched the division-clinching victory for Toronto over the Yankees in 1985.
Alexander went on to author one of the more incredible performances following a late-season trade in 1987. After being sent to the Tigers by the Atlanta Braves for a youngster named John Smoltz, Alexander started 11 games down the stretch. He won nine times. The Tigers won all his starts.
But while Alexander could win games for teams, he wouldn't bleed for them. He rented his skills, not his heart and soul.
Cone does both. He, too, can be rented and help win, as he showed in 1992. That year it was the disappointing Mets who did the selling and the surging Blue Jays who did the buying. Cone made seven starts down the stretch. Though he won four and lost three, he limited the opposition to four earned runs over the course of 44 1/3 innings in his last five starts.
Cone also oozes with emotion. But it is not a bitter emotion.
"After a while I guess it would wear you down, but right now I really don't feel it," Cone said after last night's game, adding: "I don't mind being called a hired gun; it doesn't bother me. I consider it a great challenge. If I can come through and pitch well for this team, who knows what the future will hold?"
Cone was one of the more ardent and articulate union representatives during the strike that halted the 1994 season and the start of the 1995 campaign. He speaks with great emotion.
Cone is a gypsy asked to harness such emotion, because teams know he can.
Perhaps Cone will settle in New York for a good while this time. That will happen only if the Yankees win with Cone instead of losing in spite of him. For to do the latter would inevitably make Cone what he was Friday: a quality commodity more likely to be sold than savored.

HEADLINE: Speak Up for Harry Wu

 BODY:
China now claims that the American human rights activist Harry Wu has confessed to falsifying information in two television documentaries on the Chinese prison system. The claims, made in a report by China's official news agency, Xinhua, and a videotape sold to news agencies by a state-affiliated firm, cannot be independently assessed at this point.
 The tape shows a haggard Mr. Wu telling four interrogators that a number of scenes in the British Broadcasting Corporation programs were falsely or misleadingly identified. But nowhere does he say that he was personally involved in any misrepresentations in the broadcasts. Nor does he admit to the more serious charge of espionage on which he is now being held. The BBC defends the accuracy of its two programs and plans a detailed rebuttal. 
 Mr. Wu, of course, is not free to tell his side of the story. He is a prisoner of his Chinese interrogators, threatened with execution. He has not been allowed to talk to American consular officials since an initial interview three weeks ago.
 But if Mr. Wu is constrained in what he can say, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who meets China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, on Tuesday in Brunei, is not. While the Clinton Administration rightly wants to halt the dangerous deterioration in relations between Washington and Beijing, China now needs to hear a firm message -- about Harry Wu and about human rights in general.
 The Administration also needs to draw a firmer connection between Beijing's conduct and the hospitality it will offer China's top leaders. President Clinton is about to invite China's President and party leader, Jiang Zemin, to meet with him when Mr. Jiang visits the United Nations this fall.
 This would be an inappropriate moment to bestow such an invitation, which Mr. Jiang has long sought as a way to boost his personal prestige as he struggles to succeed Deng Xiaoping. Not only is Mr. Wu's case ominously unresolved. China has spent most of the last two months accusing the United States of all manner of imagined offenses while locking up high-profile dissidents, menacing Taiwan with missile tests and, according to U.S. intelligence officials, exporting prohibited missile parts to Iran and Pakistan.
 America has a lot to lose if the continued downward drift of relations between the United States and China cannot be checked. But China has an even greater stake in halting the slide.
 China exports four times as much to the United States as it imports, gaining in exchange vital hard currency resources it could not obtain anywhere else. Further unraveling of relations would severely constrain the pace of China's economic development, which its leaders see as the key to political stability.
 China's strategy of diverting attention from its own offenses against international norms by loudly and falsely accusing others should not be rewarded. Mr. Christopher should use his meeting with Mr. Qian to patiently detail America's legitimate grievances with China and search for constructive solutions. Mr. Clinton should put off meeting with Mr. Jiang until some of these grievances have been addressed and Mr. Wu is safely back on American soil.

HEADLINE: For the Record/The Pork Barrel;
Watch Out With That Budget Ax. My District NEEDS Than Dam.

BYLINE: Michael Wines 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For four decades, the Democrats who ruled Congress larded Federal spending bills with pork. Locks, dams, people-movers, Federal research centers, passenger rail lines, electric buses, airport control towers, highway "demonstration projects" and Lord knows what else rained from Washington like inflation-adjusted pennies from heaven.
 Everybody on Capitol Hill got wet. But Republicans got damp, while Democrats got soaked. And the Democrats who dispensed the goodies -- those who sat on Congress's appropriations and authorizing committees -- were so flooded that they needed dams, which, fortunately, they were in a position to finance. 
 Whether this was representative government at work or thinly veiled corruption was a matter of pitched debate. Democrats asserted that the projects weren't pork, but vital additions to the national infrastructure. Republicans accused Democrats of trying to buy votes with highways and frittering away the national wealth. And they took power last November in no small part on a pledge to change it all.
 So how are they doing? Buy way of illustration, here is a selection of Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, along with those identifiable projects earmarked for their Congressional districts in the transportation spending bill that the House passed last week. (The list is taken from those projects that the committee specifically ordered financed even when Government agencies had not asked for them). For comparison, Democrats whose districts can likewise be identified with specific projects are also listed.
 Other Democrats and Republicans in the House also were awarded projects for their districts in the legislation. But the preponderance of the grants, largely for transit programs, went to committee members.
 Sooner or later, Democrats will surely accuse Republicans of spending these precious tax dollars to buy notes. Republicans already have a reply, expressed eloquently by Representative Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican, on the House floor just last week. "This project is not pork," he said, defending his own allotment for a freeway. "This project is a vital infrastructure necessity."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK 1945;
The War Was Ending. Times Square Exploded. Change Was Coming.

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
FOR millions of New Yorkers waiting anxiously in Times Square, World War II ended at 7:03 P.M. Aug. 14, 1945. At that moment, the 15,000 light bulbs on the Times Tower's zipper sign spelled out five words that touched off a tumultuous celebration: "Official -- Truman announces Japanese surrender."
After surviving years of scarcity and sacrifice, with London bombed, Paris humbled and Rome, Berlin and Tokyo occupied by foreign troops, New York had suddenly been elevated from the nation's major metropolis to the unrivaled world capital. 
 "All City 'Lets Go,' " a New York Times front-age headline exulted the next day, merely hinting at the outpouring to come later with V-J Day and the formal signing of the surrender. If the day's jubilant headlines reported the present, some of the advertisements suggested the future.
One, aimed at executives in the nation's largest manufacturing city, exhorted: "Bring Your Factory to Texas." The ad pointedly cited Texas's tax advantages, a large, semi-skilled labor force idled by peace and the potential markets developing in the Southwest. Another ad, from the Academy of Languages, promised readers with an eye on Latin America or East Harlem that by taking advantage of "the famous Ibarra method" they could learn Spanish in record time.
And in the classifieds (in which apartment seekers and others still insistently identified themselves as "Christian"), the greatest demand for houses was in the suburbs. Typical was an ad placed by an executive with two school-age children who was looking for a place with three or four bedrooms within one hour's commuting from New York City.
Today, the youngest World War II recruit would be close to 70 years old. Of all the people living in New York City today, fewer than one in four were even born in 1945, much less remember firsthand what the city was like then.
In the summer of 1945, New York was a city riding a wave of triumph, even as the undertow of the future began to tug at its feet. It was a time of unbridled self-confidence. The city had contributed 850,000 servicemen to the war effort. The war had transformed New York into the capital of the world. By 1946, seven airlines offered regular service between Queens and Europe, and the United Nations would later settled on the East Side of Manhattan, where the Modernist headquarters of an organization devoted to peace displaced a stand of odorous slaughterhouses.
As Jan Morris recalled in her book "Manhattan '45" (Oxford University Press, 1987), a promotional brochure from Bankers Trust proclaimed that New Yorkers were a people "to whom nothing is impossible."
"There were no strangers in New York yesterday," Alexander Feinberg wrote in The Times, reporting on the celebration of Japan's surrender.
But a Depression, a world war, migrations and government policies had already laid the foundation for profound political, social and economic change.
During the war, shortages of food-ration stamps for grocery purchases led more people to eat out. (Restaurants were serving eight million meals a day during the war compared with three million before.) Women moved in droves into the work force, replacing soldiers. The dearth of housing construction, coupled with an influx of defense workers, produced another shortage whose mixed legacy endures today: rent controls. When the war ended, 75,000 New Yorkers were still waiting for telephone service because so few new instruments were being manufactured. (By choice, not necessity, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia did not have a telephone on his desk at City Hall). A few months after V-J Day, 25,000 women mobbed Macy's after a sales clerk posted a sign advertising nylons.
Still, New York had not let a war a continent away (but within U-boat sight of New York harbor) disrupt its routine any more than necessary. The national curfew was midnight, but Mayor La Guardia insisted that New Yorkers be allowed to drink, legally, until 1 A.M. On West 56th Street, Miyako's, a traditional Japanese restaurant, took its orders from loyal customers -- not from Tokyo -- throughout the war. Broadway was awash with blockbusters, including "Carousel," "Harvey," "Oklahoma!" "On the Town" and a play, "The Glass Menagerie," by a popular new writer, Tennessee Williams. The city's baseball teams were doing less well on Aug. 14, 1945: The Yankees and Giants each in fourth place, the Dodgers in third.
 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS
During the war years, Brooklyn still had its own daily newspaper (Queens had two, the Bronx one) and its own baseball team (run by Branch Rickey, who, a year later, broke the sport's color barrier by recruiting Jackie Robinson). Harlem was still a mecca for aristocrats of black culture. Downtown, Manhattan was still home to Augustus Van Horne, the last descendant of Peter Stuyvesant.
In the summer and fall of 1945, millions of them turned out for separate ticker tape parades to welcome Eisenhower, de Gaulle, Gen. Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and Claire Chennault. Harry S. Truman visited that fall, in what was described as the first time a sitting President paid his respects to a New York City mayor at City Hall. La Guardia read the funnies on radio during a newspaper strike that year (providing, perhaps, besides the airport that bears his name, the most durable memory of his mayoralty).
But if, apart from the anxiety about loved ones overseas, the war years seem in retrospect like the good old days, they were not that good (though, in some respects, statistically, at least, better than today). About 165,000 families were living doubled up. Welfare consumed $70 million or nearly 10 cents of every dollar of the city's budget (compared with nearly 25 cents for the Human Resources Administration today). The poor were growing so out of hand that the Mayor tightened a ban on begging in the subway. New mothers were leaving about 1,000 babies a year at the New York Foundling Hospital.
New York, as it has always been, was a changing city in the 1940's. And, as always, the instruments of that change were considered suspect -- even when they were fellow Americans lured, like newcomers before and since, by the promise of better life in the form of defense industry jobs.
Puerto Ricans, outgrowing the island's agricultural economy, began migrating to the city during the decade in record numbers -- tripling their population to nearly 190,000 by 1950. As a result of an influx from the American South, the city's black population rose by more than 60 percent.
But, much more so than today, the city was racially segregated. It was still acceptable then not only to admit it but to justify it. Sacrificing civil rights for an opportunity to lure private investment to vitally needed housing, in 1943 La Guardia reluctantly agreed to municipal tax breaks that would enable the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to build Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan -- apartments for which blacks need not apply. As the company's president explained at the time, "Negroes and whites don't mix."
The City Council adopted a resolution prohibiting city participation in any similar projects unless the agreements with private developers included an anti-discrimination clause. La Guardia, seeking to reconcile seemingly intractable goals, wrote the insurance company that if the tenant selection process at Stuyvesant Town were ever challenged in court, the city's position would be that racial discrimination should not be tolerated. Charles V. Hamilton, researching his biography of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., later discovered a copy of the letter in the Mayor's files with a handwritten notation: "Not sent."
The following year, Metropolitan Life announced plans for another housing project, the Riverton in Harlem. That was the same year that Harlem proudly elected Powell as New York's first black Congressman, projecting his advocacy involving issues like Stuyvesant Town onto the national stage and onto the House floor, where using the word "nigger" was still tolerated.
In Brooklyn's Little Harlem, as Bedford-Stuyvesant was known, a grand jury investigation concluded that "it has become dangerous and unsafe to traverse the streets of this area before and particularly after dark." The grand jurors took pains, though, to blame the situation not on race but on lapses in law enforcement and on social conditions, including too many people illegally collecting home relief and living tripled up or worse in former one-family homes, many of which had been carved into rooming houses for Brooklyn Navy Yard workers. (As if to further confirm that crime was an equal-opportunity employer, a sign posted in the changing rooms at S. Klein warned in Italian and Yiddish, as well as English: "Do not disgrace your family. The punishment for stealing is jail.")
The Brooklyn grand jury reported that "many churches have closed completely because their parishioners do not dare attend the evening services," that "groups of young boys armed with penknives of all sizes and other weapons roam the streets at will and threaten and assault passers-by," and that "many law-abiding children and adults residing in this area are therefore forced to carry similar knives and weapons for protection."
Foreshadowing an era plagued by similar problems but later bedtimes, the grand jury suggested that at 9 every night radio stations broadcast the question: "Parents, where are your children right now?"
Wartime manpower demands had shrunk the police force, which was further challenged after V-E Day by a growing arsenal of illegal guns brought home by returning servicemen. After V-J Day, there was nearly one murder a day committed in the city, or about double the previous year's rate. The toll for all 1945 was 292.
 
LA GUARDIA STEPS ASIDE; TAMMANY HALL IN DECLINE
Early that year, after three tumultuous terms, La Guardia decided not to seek re-election. The mayor, Thomas Kessner wrote in his biography, "left no party legacy, no structure, no institutional fusion or urban reform movement." After being shut out of the mayoralty for 12 years, the Democrats were revived by the election of William J. O'Dwyer, the former Brooklyn District Attorney (whose grand jury had produced the Bedford-Stuyvesant report). The selection of O'Dwyer, who had arrived in New York City from Ireland at the age of 19, marked the 11th consecutive time (since 1909) that the Democrats had chosen a mayoral nominee of Irish descent.
But the election of New York City's 100th mayor was also a turning point, even if it took another two decades for the decline of the Democratic Party machine to play itself out. Tammany, unable to meet the mortgage payments, had to sell its Union Square headquarters. Its demise was further signaled by two developments: New Deal programs had largely supplanted the party as a provider for the poor and powerless (by 1946, more than 100,000 people were receiving relief); and, in the year of the ethnically-balanced ticket, a Hollywood producer created campaign "newsreels" for the Democratic ticket, which foreshadowed the radio and television commercials that candidates would soon regularly broadcast to appeal directly to the voters.
Moreover, Edward N. Costikyan, a former Tammany leader, remembers: "World War II broke the geographic solidity of the Democratic Party's control over the electorate. After the war, people were more mobile and their long-term relationships with their district captains and district leaders disappeared."
Winning wasn't everything. What O'Dwyer inherited, he later recalled, was a city in which "not a single hospital had seen a paintbrush in the 16 years prior to my swearing-in ceremonies.
"In the meantime," he said, "the city's population had increased by a million residents, and each department was woefully undermanned. The smoke was choking New Yorkers, and the raw sewage had long ago discouraged fish in the bay or in the North River and had rendered our beaches dangerous for bathing . . . Veterans were returning home with no place to live . . . the rapid transit system, once our pride and joy, was falling apart and badly in need of equipment and repair."
The morning after the election, he also inherited a plan. A minion of Robert Moses, whose 1939 World's Fair had made the public -- and himself -- absolutely giddy about the future, delivered the master builder's master plan for reconstructing the city. His ambitious blueprint with a $1.5 billion price tag called for completing the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Idlewild Airport and for new housing, as he prepared to bulldoze existing homes to complete a network of highways, including three elevated expressways that would slice across Manhattan.
Soon after, Cleveland Rodgers, a City Planning Commissioner, and Rebecca B. Rankin, librarian of the Municipal Reference Library, echoed O'Dwyer's lament. "New York has never kept up with the demands for vitally needed facilities and services," they wrote in 1947. "It has not solved the basic problems of existence. Nowhere are there more glaring contrasts between rich and poor. Life is hard for millions and living and working conditions are deplorable in many respects."
Life in the city was also increasingly congested. (Unlike many other American cities, New York had lots of undeveloped land then, but Manhattan still had more residents than Queens.) Gas rationing during the war had slowed the migration to the suburbs. But between 1940 and 1950, for the first time, more people moved out of the city than in (over all, though, the population rose from about 7.4 million to more than 7.8 million because of higher birth rates at the beginning of the Baby Boom). While nearly 100,000 more foreigners, 230,000 nonwhites and 130,000 Puerto Ricans settled in the city than moved away, at least 340,000 more non-Hispanic whites left than arrived -- a middle-class exodus that accelerated in succeeding decades.
 
THE RISE OF THE CAR, THE SPREAD OF HIGHWAYS
Meanwhile, more and more of those who had left were returning to work in the city by car. By 1950 (the year that alternate-side parking was instituted and one year after O'Dwyer finally doubled the nickel subway fare), nearly 120,000 people were commuting to the city by car -- more than three times the number only two decades earlier.
Even more fundamental changes would soon be wrought by the deliberate and the unintended consequences of the Government's postwar policies on housing, transportation and veterans' benefits as the city's political influence waned in Washington. At the beginning of 1945 -- and not since then -- the President of the United States, Roosevelt, was a native New Yorker. More congressmen came from New York City that year than represented the entire state of California.
That an expected recession, like the one that occurred after World War 1, did not materialize reflected, in part, the Government's decision not to limit veterans' pensions to the elderly and disabled but to subsidize the education of returning soldiers and their ability to buy a home. But the criteria for Federally insured mortgages generally favored suburban developments, not urban housing -- just as Robert Moses's network of parkways had opened Long Island, Westchester and Connecticut to an influx of New York City expatriates.
Plenty of people were left, though, and more were on their way. By the end of the decade, E. B. White would write a paean to New York, with a caveat. Never, he wrote then, had the city been "so uncomfortable, so crowded, so tense."

Two Cranes and Deep Water Help Put Hum Back in a Troubles Port

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The Brooklyn waterfront once hummed with activity as hundreds of longshoremen hauled freight each day from dozens of ships onto trains and trucks. But in the last 30 years, most of that business fled to newer, more spacious piers in New Jersey.
In the last year the city's Economic Development Corporation moved two refurbished, 120-foot cranes from the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park to the struggling Red Hook Marine Terminal, the only port in the city where cargo containers are unloaded from ships. The agency also met with shipping companies to help Red Hook snare new contracts. 
 The efforts seem to be paying off. Sal F. Catucci, the chief executive of American Stevedoring, which began managing the Red Hook terminal in 1994, said it was handling almost twice as much freight as last year.
This year Red Hook has unloaded about 20,000 cargo containers from ships and 11,000 from barges, Mr. Catucci said. It expects to unload a total of 35,000 containers from 288 ships and 20,000 from barges. In 1994 it unloaded 18,000 containers from 228 ships and nearly 7,000 from barges. Mr. Catucci said he employed 125 to 300 longshoremen a day, up 10 percent from last year.
Development agency officials said that working in Brooklyn's favor is that Buttermilk Channel, which leads to the Red Hook piers, goes down 65 feet before it hits rock. The channel is about 40 feet deep now, but its sandy bottom could be dredged to accommodate larger ships. By comparison, Kill Van Kull, which leads into Newark Bay, hits rock at 40 feet.
"Ships are getting bigger and deeper," said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat who leads a private group that is lobbying the Empire State Development Corporation to study how to develop the Brooklyn port. "When you drive along the Shore Parkway and see ships idling, they are waiting for high tide so they can go." The group has also asked Mayor Giuliani to halt waterfront development until a study can be completed.
For Mr. Catucci, such a study cannot come too quickly. "Brooklyn has the deep water," he said. "This is where the port should be."

Tales From the Sky

BYLINE: By CHASTITY PRATT

 BODY:
FROM where Frank Kind works, sidewalks look like gray chalk lines, billboards are the size of postcards and Central Park is a tidy mosaic of bonsai trees and bushes.
When he is perched on a scaffold 45 floors above the cement sidewalk, Mr. Kind, 58, doesn't think about his brother-in-law Harry Heller, who fell from a scaffold and ended up with one leg shorter than the other. And he never looks down. "I just pay attention," he said, "to what I'm doing." 
 Mr. Kind has been a window washer for 43 years, since he was 15. When he started in the trade, he used a wooden chair suspended by rope from building rooftops or a cotton belt hooked around his waist and onto the outside of the building where he worked. In those days, scaffolds were little more than wooden planks powered by rope and muscle. Sometimes a belt would fray, a hook would pull free from masonry, a plank would tip. Window washers know the horror stories: four washers who fell from a scaffold at the Equitable Building in the 60's, another killed when his cotton belt tore in 1970, two others who died in 1990 when their scaffold plunged from the 12th floor of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in Times Square.
But today, nylon has replaced cotton, and hooks are bolted into window frames. New skyscrapers have customized wire scaffolds, powered by electricity and equipped with walkie-talkies and fire extinguishers.
Everyone agrees that the window washer's job is safer. Still, working conditions are not for the weak of will or stomach. On Thursday, a fierce wind smashed a scaffold into a window of 919 Third Avenue, near 56th Street. A facade repairman crawled through the broken window onto the 22d floor, but another worker dangled from a safety rope 20 floors above the sidewalk until a lawyer in the building saved him.
Other enemies of the window washer are wild birds that attack when their building-ledge nests are disturbed and windows that slam shut, leaving a washer dangling -- sometimes for hours -- with no way to climb back inside. And there is the occasional thrill seeker, be it nudist or parachutist.
"I was on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers when the guy jumped out with a parachute," Mr. Kind recalled as he and his partner, William Bubak, 61, took a break from the hundreds of windows they wash regularly at 888 Seventh Avenue, a 45-story office tower at 57th Street. "He looked at me, I looked at him and he jumped out and pulled the cord. The Port Authority called me and asked why I didn't stop him. I said, 'I didn't have a parachute.' "
Cesar Gerena still remembers the time he was washing windows at an apartment building on 58th Street. "The guys inside say, 'Finally, we can see; it's that time again,' " Mr. Gerena said. "A lady walked past naked in the window right across from the ones I just washed. She did it every day at 8 A.M. That's New York."
Window washers in the city belong to Window Cleaners Local 2. Managers of large office and apartment buildings usually contract with maintenance companies, which get their workers from the union. The local president, Arnold Geller, said "business was good" until about 1985; then the recession brought commercial construction to a near-halt and forced companies to slash maintenance. Union membership plummeted. Today, Mr. Geller said, it is rebounding. "Window cleaning," he explained, "follows construction and the economy."
Most cleaners earn about $40,000 a year. Among the job's perks: bumping into someone famous, like a movie director who needs a window washer in his next film. "I was working at 22 Broadway when Oliver Stone saw me in the lobby and says, 'Hey, how long you been doing this?' " said Patrick DeFillippo, 45, of Glendale, Queens. "I was with them all day taping 'Wall Street.' In that scene where Michael Douglas is arguing with Charlie Sheen, he goes to the window and waves at me. I got paid good for it, too."
The typical window cleaner's day begins between 5 and 6 A.M., before the sun starts its ascent, and ends before it scorches their skin and drenches their drab blue uniforms in perspiration. From their perches, they watch the city yawn its way into the working day. Their tales are told matter-of-factly; the daily monotony strengthens the gut.
"In 1969 was I working on the 19th floor, and a hook came out of the window," Mr. Bubak recalled. "I swung off the window, hit my head against the building and was out cold. I gave it up for seven years." But, he said, the pay brought him back. "Sometimes I still get butterflies if I haven't been on the scaffold for a while, but it goes away."
Mr. Kind started washing windows with his father, Jacob, in 1952. His sons, Jason and Steve, have followed him into the union. A 14-karat squeegee hanging from a gold rope chain around his neck has three diamonds -- one for each generation of window cleaners in his family.
"It's quiet up here," said Jason Kind, 21, looking toward New Jersey from the roof of 888 Seventh Avenue. "All you hear is the wind and the air-conditioner motors. You get a rush; it's like bungee jumping."
His father and other veteran washers also speak of the rush. Some say modern safety measures have taken the thrill out of the job. "Years ago, it used to be that there was no limit on how high you could go on rope," Frank Kind said. "You climbed over the roof into the chair. Twenty-five, 40 floors. The good thing with rope is you knew you were going down and you knew you were coming back up."
Bill Bubak agrees, especially about the mandatory tether from the roof to a washer in a chair or on a scaffold. "You got this lifeline connected to you that smacks you in the face," he said. "It's a pain. Besides, once you get so high, it doesn't matter anymore. It's all the same if you fall."

HEADLINE: WAR WITHOUT END

BYLINE: By SEBASTIAO SALGADO

 BODY:
When President Clinton announced earlier this month that he was normalizing relations with Vietnam, he spoke with care about the 2,202 United States service personnel officially listed as missing in Southeast Asia. He said next to nothing, however, about the million or more Vietnamese who became P.O.W's and M.I.A.'s of a different kind after Saigon fell to North Vietnamese troops 20 years ago. The Communist victors violently repressed freedom of expression, of commerce, of movement, of religion, of association. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were sent to "re-education" camps -- there to undergo a regimen of forced labor, starvation rations and torture. Nearly a million others fled, packing themselves into small boats that drifted over the South China Sea. Many died on the waters. Nearly 800,000 survived, and most of them were eventually settled in America.
 Normalization "will advance the cause of freedom," the President declared, and he promised that his Administration would discuss human rights issues with Hanoi. But he was careful not to mention the 40,000 Vietnamese boat people who remain in detention camps -- half of them in Hong Kong; the rest in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Almost all these detainees have been declared economic migrants, not political refugees, by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, whose representatives screen the boat peole -- hostily and unjustly, the detainees and their human rights advocates maintain. As a result, these boat people cannot receive asylum under international law. They have been presented with a United Nations plan, endorsed by the Administration, that seeks to close the camps by encouraging those remaining in them to return to Vietnam voluntarily -- and, should this fail, by deporting them to Vietnam forcibly. 
 The President spoke of how Vietnam's economy is liberalizing. The detainees I've spoken with in camps in Hong Kong and the Philippines are all for economic reform, but insist it is meaningless without political reform. They know that the Communist Party in Vietnam remains all powerful, that Buddhist monks and Government critics are often jailed and that free trade and a booming business sector do not mean freedom and democracy.
 As Sebastiao Salgado shows in his photographs, days in the camps are achingly dull and depressing. There is nothing to do but worry. Men, women and children lie shelved on bare-board bunks, fenced off from the world. Pam Baker, an asylum lawyer I met in Hong Kong, observed: "The effects of prolonged detention, especially on kids, is just devastating. You see them when they come out, this line of snot-nosed kids staring at a dog. They've never seen one before. Cockroaches and rats are the oly animals they know."
 Still, detainees refuse to go back. In June, detainees in Hong Kong and Malaysia who were faced with forced repatriation began to riot. Others who had agreed to go back changed their minds. Later, a number of them said they had been encouraged by reports of legislation, sponsored by House Republicans, that could result in offers of asylum to as many as half the detainees. The bill faces a Presidential veto; opponents of this asylum plan argue that there is not once documented case of a returnee being politically persecuted. Human rights monitors I've spoken with do not deny this, but say there are many reasons to fear persecution. And so another battle looms in the war that will not end.
 Salgado's images are more quietly unsettling than these we associate with the Vietnam War. Yet they tell of people still reeling from decades of violence and dread. Peasant flock to the big cities in search of more money and liberty. City dwellers wend their way through a system that might -- just might -- get them legally to the United States. Detainees at the Galang Island Camp in Indonesia depart for Vietnam as part of a repatriation. Look at the expressions -- stony or grief-stricken -- of the family members Salgado saw and photographed that day at Galang. Look how he found them, abandoning the hopes that carried them across the sea. These are people turning to face 20 years of defeat.
 Studying these picutres, I found myself recalling a conversation I had last winter with one detainee who was about to be repatriated. "These years in the camp have been the most significant time of my life because I can sit here and talk to you like this about anything I want," he said. "When I go back, I have to put myself into the society and help myself survive. If I see you in Vietnam, I will avoid you." PHILIP GOUREVITCH
 Sebastiao Salgado is a contributing photographer for the Magazine. His last project, a photo essay of Russians immigrating to the Unitd States, appeared in November 1994. Philip Gourevitch, a contributing editor of The Forward, wrote recently about the boat people for Granta.

GRAPHIC: Photos: HONG KONG -- Half of the 40,000 boat people who were not resettled in the United States have been detained at camps in this British colony. At Whitehead, on the preceding page, some 4,400 of the 11,000 Vietnamese held are children, many of whom have never seen a live animal. At High Island, right, daily life for the 5,000 Vietnamese who are stored there -- one family per cubicle -- is akin to existence in an overflowing prison. (pg. 27); GALANG ISLAND, INDONESIA -- In 1978, 130,000 Indochinese boat people, the vast majority of them Vietnamese, arrived on this seven-mile-long island 40 miles southeast of Singapore. Today, there are 5,000 boat people left on Galang. And like other Vietnamese detainees, they are being encouraged by the United Nations and the Clinton Administration to return to Vietnam voluntarily, a repatriation they have greeted with dread. When a family does agree to return, it often dispatches younger members first, delegating to them the responsibility of reconnoitering the homeland before they decide whether to follow. Such separations are fraught with torment; the leave-takings are anguished. This statue, carved by a detainee and located at the camp's entrance, makes clear where they would rather go. (pg. 28); HO CHI MIHN CITY -- The journey back to Vietnam is a fearful one for the boat people who decide to make it. Leaving a wretched existence behind, they are heading toward the promise of not much more. At least in the detention camps, there are family and friends. The country they are about to enter is not the one they fled; if anything, things may have got worse. At the end of the war in 1975, the population of Saigon was about three million. Today, as Ho Chi Minh City, it may be as much as double that, according to some recent visitors. In the absence of any mass-transit system, thousands of motorbikes clog the city's arteries, choking it with pollution. The Vietnamese Government may want the boat people back, but where will it put them? How will it sustain them? HO CHI MIHN CITY -- In 1979, the Vietnamese Government established the ongoing Orderly Departure Program to counter the exodus of the boat people. Since 1980, more than half a million Vietnamese have been allowed to leave, immigrating mostly to the United States (and to a lesser extent, Australia, Canada and France). For those whose departures have been approved, ID photographs and medical exams are, of course, mandatory. PRECEDING PAGE: Even with the increasing urbanization of Vietnam, some things don't change. Farmers who sat on their windowsills in the countryside, awaiting prosperity, now sit on their windowsills in huge apartment buildings in the big city, awaiting the same thing.

HEADLINE: INSIDE QUEENS;
The High-Wire Act of the 109th

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII

 BODY:
Driving past crates full of cuttlefish, water spinach and stringy gourds in downtown Flushing last December of the 109th Precinct, Capt. John McManus barely recognized the bustling area from his childhood memory of rundown streets and abandoned warehouses.
 At age 42, after a brief stint as second-in-command at the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn, he was now in charge of one of the largest precincts in the city, and certainly its most culturally diverse -- a district sweeping over northeast Queens populated on the one hand by wealthy, predominantly white residents who demand prompt response, and on the other by new immigrants, many suspicious of the police. 
 "I didn't know what to expect," Captain McManus said. "But I knew I had to work with them and gain their trust."
 He put the word out -- he was accessible. One by one, the groups came calling with a list of demands:
 Indian immigrants wanted a police escort for the annual pilgrimage of their Hindu holy man, Mahantswami, and his entourage of 75.
 The Pakistanis wanted the captain's direct phone number. They also wanted the police to enforce order when more than 20,000 descend upon parks to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holy day at the end of Ramadan. But they could not give the captain an exact date because the festival is determined by the moon's position the night before.
 The Chinese merchants wanted peddlers off the main thoroughfares. The Koreans demanded more Korean-speaking police officers. And the Chinese and the Koreans also wanted the police to patrol on bicycles.
 It was reminiscent, in many ways, of Captain McManus's days as a schoolteacher, when he was faced with a class full of elementary pupils who each wanted individual attention, but by necessity had to be dealt with as a group.
 "As a schoolteacher, I developed patience," he said. "That and my communications skills have assisted me in my effort to reach out to the community. The most important thing is that I listen. Through listening, I learn about things."
 For example, he learned about the highly delicate process of greeting Asian businessmen. A seemingly simple task like exchanging business cards was a ritual. Never put the card in your back pocket, Captain McManus learned -- accept it gracefully, with two hands, and bow.
 But such lessons in cultural differences were easy compared with the task of garnering trust in the Asian community, which includes Koreans, Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis and Filipinos and makes 40 percent of the population within the precinct's boundaries. Many Asians have traditionally shunned the police out of fear of retaliation or because they do not want to lose face by reporting crime.
 Captain McManus has overcome some barriers by taking such considerations into account, community leader say. "He is a good captain," said Mark Lii, president of the Flushing Chinese Business Association. "He understands what we need."
 But Captain McManus has also found that by satisfying the needs of one group, he runs the risk of offending others. When he closed Geranium Avenue off Kissena Boulevard for several days during the construction of the Muslim Center of New York non-Muslim residents besieged the station house with angry phone calls complaining about the inconvenience.
 Wide economic disparity within the precinct's boundaries also plays a role in the politics of law enforcement. The neighborhoods within the 109th Precinct -- Queensboro Hill, Flushing, College Point, Malba, Whitestone, Beechhurst and Bay Terrace -- each have problems that seldom extend beyond their own borders, necessitating a varied law-enforcement approach.
 In downtown Flushing, concerns include traffic, the proliferation of gypsy cabs and overcrowding. College Point and Malba, a more affluent neighbor, are feuding over a plan to reverse the flow of traffic on 11th Avenue, a residential street that locals say has become a traffic nightmare since motorists began using it as a shortcut to nearby highways.
 Beechhurst has been plagued with illegal fireworks. Cedar Grove has formed its own anti-crime posse.
 In Whitestone, Captian McManus led a July 4 detail to sweep away illegal fireworks being set off under the Throgs Neck Bridge. His action in attacking what had long been a traditional Independence Day activity risked tearing down some of the goodwill he had built up.
 "I knew I was doing the right thing," he said, "but I wasn't sure how the community would receive it."
 Overall, his techniques have drawn praise.
 "The captain is a man of his word," said Regina Colletta, the district manager of Community Board 7 in Flushing. "He follows through with the promises he makes. And he gives equal attention to all the different groups."
 But sometimes, even when all a community's demands have been met, some people are still not satisfied. During a meeting with the Flushing Chinese Business Association, board members complained that the shorts worn by officers on bicycles were not distinctive enough and that people often mistook them for mailmen.

HEADLINE: Where the Mississippi Begins

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE S. COZZENS; CHRISTINE S. COZZENS, who teaches writing at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., spent her summers in the North Woods as a child.

 BODY:
THE mighty river that changed so many lives and landscapes in the summer of 1993 begins un assumingly enough as a bright little stream rushing out of a tranquil lake fringed with wild rice in central Minnesota. For 150 years the river's humble beginnings -- and the fact that it flows north and east for miles before curving southward -- fooled the region's European and American explorers, who claimed several other lakes as the headwaters before confirming what the Sioux and Ojibway had known for centuries: that the Y-shaped lake later named Itasca (from the Latin words veritas and caput, for truth and head) fed the river that had come to be known as the Great River, Father of Waters -- the Mississippi.
Now enclosed in 32,000 acres of protected land, Itasca State Park remains open to visitors all year, though the food, lodging, and boat and bicycle rental facilities close for the winter. The park draws more than half a million visitors a year to view the headwaters site and touch the waters that flow 2,552 miles to the Gulf of Mexico. In a clearing at the northern tip of Lake Itasca, a simple wooden marker identifies the beginning of this historic waterway: a tiny outlet where the lakes and creeks of the Itasca basin merge in what can -- in compliance with historical and geographical precedent -- be deemed a river. 
 A convenient rocky ford, well-placed boulders for sitting and climbing, and clear, bubbly water racing over a tidy river bed -- all look just as one might expect the source of a great river to look. And with good reason. Originally a "swampy, muddy and dirty sight," in the words of a park superintendent of the early 1930's, the headwaters area was reimagined, in keeping with the park philosophy of the 1930's, by a series of Civilian Conservation Corps projects, which included the digging of a new channel, elimination of swamp areas, mass plantings, and the building of a dam, thus ensuring the continuing popularity of the spot.
Since that time, every day from May to October visitors have hiked to the clearing, determined to ford the Mississippi at this narrowest point or wade in its usually chilly water. For all but the youngest, an air of reverence pervades the experience. On the August morning that I made the journey with my husband and children, we joined an elderly man with a cane, a crowd of Japanese teen-agers, and several mothers with babies strapped on approach the bank and solemnly dip our hands and feet in the waters. "When I touch this water I'm touching the Gulf of Mexico," my 14-year-old son called to me from the opposite bank.
Lying just north of Minnesota's geographical center, between Park Rapids and Bem idji, Itasca State Park stretches across highlands that rise 1,600 feet above sea level in a glacial moraine 20,000 years old. As the glacier receded, it carved out the complex of lakes and stream beds that mystified the explorers seeking an obvious source for the Mississippi.
 EVIDENCE of human habitation in the Itasca region dates to about 6,000 B.C.. We visited a camp and a bison kill site from this period that were excavated in the 1960's. Burial mounds from 500 to 900 years ago near the headwaters site suggest the presence of woodland peoples, who gathered wild rice from canoes using techniques that have changed little over time.
 True wild rice still grows along the edges of Lake Itasca, showing pale yellow-green blossoms in early summer and sheltering a unique ecological community of ducks, turtles, fish and plant life. Though most wild rice is now cultivated and harvested by combines from drained patties, the Ojibway still gather it by hand.
 It was an Ojibway chief, Ozawindib, who guided Henry Schoolcraft, an Indian agent, mineralogist and folklorist, when he set out to find the source of the Mississippi in 1832. Ozawindib provided the Schoolcraft party with maps and led them to the lake, which they named Itasca, and to the northward-flowing stream that forms the outlet. Over the next half century, several adventurers challenged Schoolcraft's claim to have found the source, but in 1889 Jacob Brower, later Itasca State Park's first commissioner, surveyed the area and finally settled the dispute: Schoolcraft's discovery held, and the explorer retained credit for the knowledge his Ojibway guides had shared with him.
Following the footsteps of the Ojibway, Schoolcraft, and Itasca's other discoverers, a web of 24 well-marked biking trails, bike paths, and roads make almost every corner of the park accessible to visitors, who can choose the route best suited to their interests and stamina. After several scouting trips by car, my family and I chose to explore the park on bicycles, which we rented at the Itasca Sports Rental shop on the Main Drive near the Park Headquarters. During the season, boats, canoes, fishing licenses and live bait are also available here, and visitors can try for sunfish, crappies, bass, northern pike, walleye and other northern species.
With stops for sightseeing, a picnic, wildlife watching, and to catch our breath, it took us about four hours to circumnavigate the park, a 15-mile trip. A paved bike path dips into the dense pine forest and breaks out again at overlooks for views of the sparkling lake, following Itasca's eastern and northern arms and the Bear Paw and Pine Ridge Campgrounds, a swimming beach, and the headwaters site. Along the way we stopped to admire the elegant stand of fire-scarred red pines at Preacher's Grove, named for a group of Methodist ministers who camped there in 1916. Apparently the message of peace and love did not always take: the Pioneer Cemetery further along the path provides a final resting place for the victims of a famous feud in the 1890's that began with a dispute over hunting rights and an accidental shooting.
Just to the east of the headwaters site, we stopped to visit one of the park's most interesting log structures, the Itasca Natural History Museum, built in 1922 and now home to an exhibit of indigenous wildlife. From Memorial Day to Labor Day at the adjacent amphitheater and other locations throughout the park, the Park Service plays host to musical performances, storytelling, historical lectures, craft demonstrations, seasonal activities and guided nature walks.
Beyond the headwaters site, on the lake's western side, the bicycle path -- now a road -- reaches around the 2,000-acre Wilderness Sanctuary, wandering far from the shoreline but passing within sight of several smaller lakes. We stopped to explore the forestry demonstration area, view the state's tallest white and red pines (both over 110 feet) and the bison kill site, and climb the observation tower before heading on to the South Itasca Center and cool drinks on the porch at Douglas Lodge.
 Douglas Lodge was built in 1905 from local timber in the rustic style of the early national park era that emphasized natural materials, informal design, and handcrafted details. With its spacious lobby, restaurant, coffee shop, five guest rooms, and the 18-room Nicollet Court Motel next door, the lodge is a busy spot on a summer afternoon. All meals are served on the lovely Douglas Lodge china -- white stoneware with the Great Seal of Minnesota and the showy lady-slipper (the state flower) painted on it in pink and red -- designed in the 1930's and reissued to commemorate the parks' centennial in 1991. The Itasca Nature Store in the Forest Inn Visitor's Center, another historic log building across the way, sells the china and a wealth of items representing the heritage of the North Woods.
By the mid-19th century, Schoolcraft's discovery had stirred interest in the Itasca region. Conservationists bent on preserving the historic headwaters site and wilderness areas flocked to it, as did logging companies that had heard of its legendary trees. Today the immense size of the original forest can be imagined at certain groves of 300-year-old trees in the Wilderness Sanctuary, or at the Old Timer's Cabin, built in 1934, a short walk from Douglas Lodge. The cabin's massive walls of virgin timber are only four logs high.
If Itasca's history could be summarized in one word, it would have to be timber. The establishment of the park by the state legislature in 1891 created a vast domain of forests, lakes and streams, but it was a park on paper, since much of the land still belonged to the logging companies, which resisted the park concept. Thanks to the Minnesota legislature, by 1919 the big logging operations had ended, and the park on paper was a park in fact. Today's park management treats the logging era as an important part of Minnesota's economic and social history; in summer, tours of a working sawmill and demonstrations of logging techniques are among the park's daily programs.
 THOUGH I knew that no physical evidence of the period of exploration remained, I was happy to discover that summer visitors can follow Schoolcraft and Ozawindib's voyage across the lake to the headwaters aboard the Chester Charles, a sightseeing boat that docks near Douglas Lodge, where the explorers saw the lake for the first time.
We sat on the upper deck for the 90-minute trip. As the boat glided along the glassy surface, the guide explained the lake's natural and human history, often cutting the engine to let the boat drift silently closer to a deer that had paused in a clearing, a beaver lodge, a bald eagle perched on a dead branch high above the water's edge, or a family of loons.
As we approached the island where the Schoolcraft party made camp before following Ozawindib's directions to the headwaters, I remembered the words of the explorer, moved by the experience of "reaching the actual source of a stream so celebrated as the Mississippi." He wrote of the beauty of the "transparent and bright" lake, "lying among hills . . . surmounted with pines, which fringe the distant horizon and form an agreeable contrast with the greener foliage of its immediate shores." Happily, those words still describe Lake Itasca and the park surrounding its shores.
 
Discovering the headwaters
 
Getting There
 Itasca State Park is about a five-hour drive from Minneapolis-St. Paul via Interstate 94 West; at St. Cloud take Highway 10 to the north and east until Highway 71 North, which goes direct to the park.
 
Information
 The park information number is (218) 266-3654.
 A Minnesota annual vehicle permit (sold at all state parks) for $18 ($12 for seniors) allows unlimited vehicle entry to all of the state's 60 parks. Daily permits are $4.
The park distributes maps, guides, and free information about programs. The Itasca Guide Book, $5.95, contains a great deal of information about the park, including articles about its history and natural resources, detailed trail and park maps, and is updated annually. It is available at both gift shops (near Douglas Lodge and at the head waters), park headquarters, and Douglas Lodge. A cassette tape driving tour of the entire park and one for Wilderness Drive can also be bought at the gift shops for $8.75 each.
 
Lodging and Eating

HEADLINE: Honors Studies Shine at Community College

BYLINE: By SHARON W. LINSKER 

 BODY:
GINO SCALABRINI, 21, planned to major in accounting when he entered Westchester Community College in 1992, but he became fascinated with political science after taking courses in the honors program. He has just completed his junior year at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., where he is majoring in government.
Each year about 100 students take part in the honors program at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. Many of them credit that program with introducing them to new subjects and stimulating their interest in college-level work. 
 Being in the program also helps students get into four-year schools and earn scholarships. Another drawing point is the tuition, the lowest in the county.
"Students are choosing Westchester Community for both academic and financial reasons," said Abby J. Hirsch, director of guidance for the Somers school system. "There has been a tremendous change in attitude toward W.C.C. over the last couple of years, especially because some families have been hard hit economically."
In 1994, 20 percent of Somers High School's 160 graduates went to Westchester Community, and several could have qualified for four-year schools.
Two typical honors program courses are the Art of the Novel and Life: Origins and Evolution. Enrollment in each class is limited to 18. Students take part in symposiums that explore topics in greater depth than in regular courses, hear guest speakers and develop close relationships with professors who offer academic guidance and share similar interests with the students.
The honors program is headed by Carol Klein, associate professor in the chemistry department, and Dr. Linda Ching Sledge, assistant professor in the English department. Both women hold the Joseph and Sophia Abeles chair in the honors program, sponsored since 1994 by the Abeles family of Mount Pleasant.
Until now, speakers have addressed individual honors program classes. For example, the Westchester residents Benjamin Cheever, a novelist, and Aranka Siegel, a young author who lectures on the Holocaust, visited during the last academic year. But financing from the Abeles chair will enable the directors to run seminars next year that will be open to the public. The first such meeting will take place in the spring, and the topic will be "Can Justice Be Done in the United States?"
Honors participants include the same mix of traditional and nontraditional students found throughout the college. There are teen-agers just out of high school, women with children, students from foreign countries and adults with diverse work experience. During the last academic year, honors program students included a former dancer, an auto mechanic and a police officer.
Among those attracted to Westchester Community College are young men and women who cannot afford the high cost of four-year colleges. Tuition at the community college this fall will be $2,150 for two full-time semesters for residents and $90 a credit part time. In contrast, Mr. Scalabrini will pay about $27,000 for room, board and tuition during his senior year at Dartmouth.
Westchester Community College scholarships also help ease the cost of going to college. In the honors program, Nancy Jo Abeles Honors Scholarships are awarded for outstanding academic performance.
April Landshof, 24, of Katonah, chose the community college over a four-year school because of the saving it offered. "I didn't want to waste money since I wasn't sure what I wanted to do," Ms. Landshof said. She is the oldest of three children and is putting herself through college by working while attending classes.
At the college, Ms. Landshof took all the drama courses available and psychobiology, mathematical excursions: problem solving, and other honors classes. In the fall, she will transfer to New York University to study drama education.
Honors program students frequently talk about the involvement and innovative approach of their teachers and about the strong bond among classmates. James Holdridge, 43, a Mahopac resident who was a police officer for 21 years, said that while he had always read on his own he had not discussed literature with others until coming to Westchester Community College in 1993.
Now Mr. Holdridge is getting straight A's and was twice a finalist at the Beacon Conference for Student Scholars at Two Year Colleges, held this year at Dutchess Community College in Poughkeepsie. In 1995, 7 of the 44 finalists from 26 colleges were from Westchester Community College, and 6 of the community college's participants were honors program students.
When Mr. Scalabrini graduated from high school, his composite Scholastic Assessment Test scores totaled nearly 1,200, but his grade point average was low. Accepted at only a few expensive private colleges and one New York State four-year school, he decided to attend Westchester Community College.
There, he found the honors program a "place for serious students to work with other students," he said.
"I felt really well prepared when I began my junior year at Dartmouth," he added. And Dartmouth credited all his course work from Westchester Community College.
Mr. Scalabrini was also accepted by the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Yale University, Boston College and the State University of New York.
Each year, several institutions award scholarships to Westchester Community College students, and the University of Rochester gives a full scholarship to an honors program graduate. Westchester Community College has also signed articulation agreements with 22 four-year colleges, automatically granting two full years of credits to entering juniors.
Dr. Joseph N. Hankin, president of Westchester Community College, said: "Our students have gotten into very strong schools that they couldn't have gotten into initially because their grades weren't high enough. And what's more, they save two years of higher tuition."
At Westchester Community College, students earn two-year associate degrees, participate in one-year certificate programs in areas like practical nursing and electronics, or take noncredit courses. Enrollment continues through the end of August. For further information, call the Office of Admissions at 785-6735.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
A Longshot Wins Diners' Top Zagat Rating

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
A LONGSHOT has run away with top food ratings in the first stand-alone Zagat survey of Long Island. Piccolo, a popular Northern Italian spot in Huntington, received the highest ranking in a survey of more than 2,000 diners who filled out questionnaires after they had visited a total of 530 restaurants. They rated Mirabelle of St. James second and the Mill River Inn of Oyster Bay third.
Piccolo, which received a rating of "24" for its food in the 1995 Zagat Tri-State survey, jumped to 27 out of a possible 30. The storefront restaurant in the Southdown shopping center was the front-runner in the Italian and Continental categories, as well as No. 1 among Suffolk restaurants. 
 When the owner, Dino Philippis, was told about the voting, he was surprised. That is understandable. Piccolo has always had a fiercely loyal, largely Huntington-based following. But it had never achieved ratings that put it in the category of Mirabelle, the Mill River Inn, Panama Hattie's, Starr Boggs and Navona, all of which have won consistent acclaim.
Piccolo's emergence shows that a well-established restaurant with a devoted clientele in an affluent area where people dine out frequently and let their preferences be known can beat out better-known competitors.
The publisher, Tim Zagat, indicated that although Piccolo had been mentioned in 74 questionnaires and that Mirabelle was on 341, the food at the Huntington restaurant had been very highly praised by almost all who rated it. The 140-page Survey of Long Island, which costs $9.95, will be available the middle of next month. The guide with a green cover is the first of four separate suburban books that replace the regional survey. Separating Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and lower New York State is a result of the growing importance and sophistication of the restaurants in the areas, a spokesman for the publisher said.
Zagat voters registered preferences on decor and service, as well as food. The Pine Island Grill in Bayville, East Hampton Point and the Ram's Head Inn on Shelter Island placed first, second and third in decor, and Mirabelle, the Mill River Inn and da Ugo of Rockville Centre were given the nods for service. Peter Luger of Great Neck, Mirabelle and the Mill River Inn proved to be the most popular choices.
Diners who seek outstanding value will go to the listings of best buys, which rank Maureen's Country Kitchen in Smithtown, the Tortilla Grills in Huntington and Merrick and Fish on the Run in Huntington as "Top Bangs for the Buck."
Panama Hattie's made a dramatic jump from being unrated to a 26, making it the most improved spot. The Grill Room in Hauppauge, also with a 26, was the No. 1 newcomer. Riverbay in Williston Park had the highest marks for a seafood restaurant.
The Long Island survey recorded more responses from diners than all others except the New York City, Los Angeles and Washington editions.
 
On the Move
 La Viola, popular Italian family-style restaurants in Cedarhurst and Syossett, are planning to open a branch in Manhattan. The restaurant in Cedarhurst will offer monthly opera dinners in the fall. It is also selling elaborate gift baskets of specialties and has already introduced a summer salad menu.
An agreement to acquire a site on West 44th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues is close to completion, the restaurant says.
The gift baskets, from $20 to $50 and available only in Cedarhurst, include La Viola's Bolognese, marinara, filetto di pomodoro, vodka and clam sauces, as well as De Cecco pastas. Herb-flavored oils and vinegars, pickled Portobello mushrooms, eggplant and string beans, dip and salad dressings, sun-dried tomatoes and breads from the wood-burning oven are also among the items.
The $40 opera dinners, on the first Thursday of each month in Cedarhurst, will begin on Sept. 7 with selections from "La Traviata," "Aida," "Il Travatore" and "Adriana Le Couvreur." Diners who pay for five nights of opera in a year will receive a sixth opera dinner free. The meal that accompanies the music consists of salad, pasta, a veal, chicken or fish entree, dessert and coffee.
Among the summer salads are avocado, endive and radicchio, red beets and new potatoes, tuna and borlotti beans and arugula and sauteed shitake mushrooms with herbs.
La Viola is at 499 Chestnut Street in Cedarhurst (569-6020) and 41 Jackson Avenue (364-8383) in Syosset.
 
New Menus and Meals
 Pomodorino, Pomodoro's lower-priced kid brother, at 33-65 Hillside Avenue in New Hyde Park (739-1318), has a new menu that offers any of 11 pastas along with salad and a cannoli for $7.95. The pastas include chicken raviolini in a porcini mushroom sauce, penne alla vodka, meat lasagna, rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms in a light tomato sauce and spaghetti with chicken, broccoli, olive oil and garlic.
The more-economical menu lists seven individual pizzas for $5.50 each. An antipasto table of grilled vegetables, cured meats and cheeses, salads and hors d'oeuvres is $6.95 for one and $11.95 for two.
Georgia's German and American Restaurant at 722 South Wellwood Avenue in Lindenhurst (957-8484) is featuring German dinner specials for $7.95 on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Monday is fresh ham and roast beef, the Tuesday special is sauerbraten, and Wednesday is schnitzel night.
Palmer Vineyards in Aquebogue (329-3300), in cooperation with the Mediterranean Manor, is holding two evenings of music, dancing and dining in a tent. Next Saturday, local foods will be featured on a bountiful Long Island grill, and on Aug. 26 a Caribbean buffet and reggae music are scheduled. The dinner, dancing and a glass of wine costs $48.
The Honest Diner on Montauk Highway in Amagansett (267-3535) is serving an early bird special from 5 to 6:30 P.M. every day. The $9.95 dinner consists of the chef's selection entree and a soup or salad. New on the regular dinner menu is a combination of a lobster roll, french fries and cole slaw for $10.95.
 
Chefs' Corner
 Frank Falcinelli is the new chef at the Pine Island Grill at the Crescent Beach Club in Bayville (628-3000). Mr. Falcinelli, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, also trained in Auch and Toulouse, France, and David Burke and Dan Budd at the River Cafe in Brooklyn. After a stint with Charles Palmer as a chef saucier at Aureole in Manhattan, he opened his own restaurant, Culinary Renaissance, a highly rated spot in Metuchen, N.J.
Ella Rocca, executive chef at Navonna in Great Neck, was among the 120 North Americans recently initiated into Chefs 2000, an international organization based in San Francisco. Ms. Rocca, one of three women honored, was cited for "providing culinary leadership into the 21st century." The members of Chefs 2000 will meet in Washington in the year 2000 to discuss culinary trends in the 21st century. Ms. Rocca also appeared at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan recently for a specialty food show. The Berreta Rice Company invited her to cook dishes that she offers at Navonna.
Sam Gottlieb, the son of the owner of the Grand Cafe, Steve Gottlieb, is now a chef at the restaurant at 66 Newtown Lane in East Hampton (324-9207). Mr. Gottlieb most recently worked for the executive chef at Della Femina's, Pat Trama.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Curtain Going Up on a Rescued Summer Theater

BYLINE: By PATRICIA VOLK 

 BODY:
ADARK THEATER IN A SMALL town is like a corpse in the living room. It's dead and it's there. For many of its 40 years, the Sharon Playhouse in the northwest corner of Connecticut limped along, cherished but in debt, a primer for How Not to Run a Summer Theater. Five years ago, gasping for air, the big barn finally went belly up.
"It was your typical summer theater experience," says the actress Jane Curtin, who lives in Sharon. "You know, holes in the roof. They would do 'Godspell.' When it closed, you'd drive by and it was very sad." 
 Weeds grew. Paint sloughed. Somebody toyed with rezoning the property for a shopping village cum restaurant-theater. An auctioneer and an auto body shop nosed around.
Then suddenly, last September, a group of theater people, many involved in the Broadway musical "The Phantom of the Opera," closed on the property, west of Main Street on Route 343, a mile from the New York border. Scaffolding appeared. By May, the red barn with the lopped off peak was getting two enormous air-conditioning towers on either side. By June, it looked like Chartres with a buzz cut. The Sharon Stage was born.
Sharon, Conn., is a time warp. Ninety miles from Broadway, the police blotter reads: "Following too close. Mailbox struck. Bricks stolen." A hair dye goes for $25 at Dor-Ray Coiffures and a rose-breasted grosbeak sighting is front-page news. Houses so lovely you have to pull over and recover date from 1739 and start at $80,000. (Jasper Johns recently bought one for $3.9 million.) The latest census lists "2,901 whites, 12 blacks, 5 American Indians, 9 Asians, 20 Hispanics and 1 other," though she may have moved.
For a long time, Sharon supported the playhouse. Literally. In 1972, to keep it going, 80 shares were sold for $1,000 each. Two local residents, Marilyn Reagan and Nelson Slater, co-signed personal loans. It had such a loyal following that when a fire broke out during a matinee, the audience refused to leave. Once, a storm doused the lights during "Gypsy" and someone drove a Camaro into the lobby, jacked it up and flipped on the brights.
People still throng to nearby Tanglewood, the Berkshire Theater Festival and Jacob's Pillow. So why did they stop coming to Sharon?
"There's a lot of ill will there," says Gail Mirabile, a town librarian. "It was badly managed. They were always losing money. There were always people who thought they were artists. Talk to Bill Landis."
Mr. Landis says he and his wife, Liz, became producers by default. "It was never a money-making proposition," says the former president of the Sharon Creative Arts Foundation. "Some very good people came here. Rene Auberjonois. Olympia Dukakis. Jane Alexander. The only year I think the theater made any money was 1979. We netted a $10,000 profit."
Mr. Landis and his wife tried opening and closing with big musicals to finance the dramas in between. They tried using local performers to generate community support and to save on Equity salaries. But in 1981, the trustees wanted more. "They had visions of grandeur: rubbing elbows with stars," says Mr. Landis, who once played Polonius to Dirk Bogarde's Hamlet. "They forgot it was a little theater. They were bankers and brokers."
Nelson and Brenda Slater sit in the living room of their woodland aerie in nearby Taconic, Conn., with their springer spaniels Tiffany and Chester. Stage right of a wall-size stone fireplace is a portrait of Samuel Slater, Nelson Slater's great-great-grandfather, who operated the first successful cotton mill in America.
"After Marilyn Reagan and I co-signed some notes, the bank called the loan," says Mr. Slater. "But to some extent we recouped our losses when the playhouse was recently sold. The people who bought it agreed to pay back part of what we paid at so much a month. We have an agreement with them that if they don't, we get the whole thing back. Not that we're anxious to do that.
"The kicker," Mr. Slater adds, "is that there are no good restaurants in Sharon. And let's face it. Part of summer theater is having a restaurant nearby that people can go to and have dinner before the play."
The selling price was $200,000 for 3.5 acres, the big stage, an art gallery with a small stage, a costume barn, a dorm for interns and an office building. Eleven principals chipped in $5,000 to $38,000 each.
Plays started pouring in. "We looked at many possibilities for our opening season, but there were only 15 real contenders," says Tim McHenry, the board president of the new Sharon Stage. Three productions were planned, from June 20 through Sept. 3, for three weeks each.
"Originally," says Michael Gill, the managing director at Sharon Stage and the company manager for "Phantom," "we were going to open with the world premiere of 'The Woman Who Laughed' by Joyce Carol Oates, go to 'The Belle of Amherst' with a major name, then do 'The Robber Bridegroom.' Then an independent producer called and said, 'I just wanted to let you know that Estelle Parsons and Carol Kane have already committed to doing 'Twice Removed.' And I thought, well, if they believe in it and they're committed, we better read this."
The inaugural season evolved into "Twice Removed," a new comedy by Mark Rosin and Barry Glasser; a revival of "The Robber Bridegroom," a musical based on the Eudora Welty novella (which runs through next Sunday); and the premiere of Ms. Oates's tragi-comedy about a New York teacher in a Midwest school. It opens on Aug. 15 and closes on Aug. 27 -- a week early. ("It's the economics of putting on new plays," says Mr. McHenry.)
 
Sunday, May 28: Mildew and Rogaine
 Sweat equity is when you use your back instead of your wallet. It's three and a half weeks before opening night and Jack Gaughan, secretary-treasurer of Sharon Stage and the orchestra conductor of "Phantom," is bolting seats to the concrete floor. Mr. McHenry appears to be hoeing. Lee Austin, a Sharon Stage board member and former "Phantom" wardrobe supervisor, has sifted through 40 years of junk in the costume room. What wasn't mildewed is stored in garbage bags labeled Men's Suit Coats, Indian Headdresses, Curtains Red . . . Another board member, Merle Frimark, a Broadway publicist who represents "Phantom," is checking on the grass she planted. It looks like a bald head one month post-Rogaine. She has cleaned the old prop room. "We've come a long way," Ms. Frimark says. "It doesn't smell anymore."
 
Sunday, June 4: Passing the (Straw) Hat
 It's six days before the benefit that opens the season. The parking lot is loaded with tractors, Dumpsters and air-conditioning trucks. Paint cans and rolls of carpet fill the lobby. A not-for-profit theater too young to get grants depends on donations.
The signs were a gift from King Display. Serino Coyne, the Broadway advertising agency, designed the logo. Francis Gill, Michael's father, has been working as a contractor for six weeks nonstop. The 380 deep-blue theater seats are a present from the Jujamcyn company's Virginia Theater on Broadway. They are about half in, but not alphabetically: M,H,C,K,P,N,B,L,A,H,L and F. For the first time, there is a pit, and the theater will be air-conditioned.
The construction has cost $120,000, but you can still see daylight through the barn walls.
 
Saturday, June 10: Kyra, Kevin and Sam
 A workman says one air-conditioner will definitely work for tonight's benefit, but he's worried about how loud it is. In the field behind the theater, a donkey brays. Ms. Frimark seems pleased with local support: "Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon want to do something. Sam Waterston said, 'I'll help you whenever I can.' " (The names of homeowners in Litchfield County often appear in bold: Streep, Blass, Kissinger.)
Mr. Gill is hauling trash.
"What do you have to do before 7 P.M.?" someone asks.
"Everything," he grins.
At 7:40 the parking lot is jammed. It's the big night, Sharon's first look at its stage. The chinks in the walls have been sealed from the outside. An intern is cutting limes. When the lights go up, six local actors are sitting on stools. Jill Clayburgh, who lives in Sharon, introduces them. Ethel Merman's voice singing "There's No Business Like Show Business" vibrates the rafters. Jane Curtin reads Dorothy Parker's review of an A. A. Milne play. The audience howls.
"Is there a doctor in the house?" Mr. McHenry asks, as the lights go up. Speaking of the Sharon Stage, he adds: "A new baby has just been delivered!"
 
Wednesday, June 14: The Cash Flow Isn't
 Six days before the official opening night, the theater's board of directors meets for the 49th time in the Broadway offices of Frimark & Thibodeau Associates.
Details are gone over for "Twice Removed." Lucie Arnaz has committed to "The Woman Who Laughed." The provisional liquor license still hasn't come through, but a mailing list with 13,000 names on it is back from computer hell. The playbill will cost $12,898. Only $8,000 in ads has been raised.
"Our cash flow right now is tight," says Mr. Gill, who has a budget of $600,000 per year. Ticket sales will bring in 60 percent (prices range from $12 to $25). For the rest, he's counting on fund-raisers, a general donation campaign, Friends of Sharon Stage and a major benefit to be held Sept. 10 at the Majestic Theater on Broadway (the home of "Phantom").
Three days before opening night, a frayed power line outside the theater sets fire to a tree. The electricity shorts out for five hours and the phones go dead.
Matthew Fahrner, formerly a chef at the West Street Grill in Litchfield, takes over the West Main Cafe. For the first time, Sharon will have nori-wrapped tuna and garlic smashed potatoes.
 
Tuesday, June 20: Fire Watches Ready
 Opening day. At 2 A.M., Ms. Frimark is painting the ladies' room. By 5 P.M. geraniums and petunias line the walk. A new flagstone path went in an hour before, laid by Bill Marshall, a local composer and astrologer. There's a rubber plant with a green bow in the lobby. The seats are now alphabetical. On stage, the actors are still rehearsing. No one is going to wait up for reviews. The closest thing the town has to Sardi's is the Nutmeg Pantry, and true to Sharon Stage's view of itself as a safe haven for works-in-progress, New York critics have not been invited. Besides, two of the key papers are weeklies.
By 6:40 P.M. the parking lot is beginning to fill up. Three fire watches are in place. A fire watch is a person who stands by with a fire extinguisher. During a performance, that is the only job the fire watch has. Stan MacMillan, Sharon's building inspector and fire marshal, will visit to make sure the watches are where they're supposed to be. It's 90 degrees outside. The air-conditioner sounds like a B-52.
At 7:15, with a full house, the curtain rises on the comedy "Twice Removed." There is a collective gasp, followed by a collective "Ooooo!" In one stroke, the Sharon Stage's intentions are clear: This is not summer stock. This is not Mickey Rooney grabbing Judy Garland's hand and shouting "Come on, kids! Let's put on a show!" This set is Broadway caliber, a rotting Victorian in Poughkeepsie with French doors, a solarium and a staircase, designed by Paul Wonsek. Ms. Parsons, Ms. Kane and Deborah Rush perform so smoothly, no one would guess that two hours before they were learning a new scene and dropping two old ones. But 10 minutes into the first act, the air-conditioner goes off. You can't hear with it on. People start fanning themselves with the playbills. Drops of sweat hang from the actors' chins.
Later, at the reception, playgoers wearing everything from shower thongs to cowboy hats study photos of the original opening night in 1955 when playgoers wore mink stoles and dinner jackets. A harpist plucks "Greensleeves." There is trout mousse and champagne.
 
Monday, June 26: The Critics Speak
 The air-conditioning problem has been fixed. The reviews are in. The Litchfield County Times: "giddy, fizzy, wacky." The Lakeville Journal: "loopy and funny." The Berkshire Courier: "funny and professional." The Poughkeepsie Journal: "a must-see." Only The Hartford Courant blasts the play, but four out of five beats Babe Ruth's batting average. The theater is a hit. Sharon is optimistic, New England-style:
Jane Curtin: "The hardest part they're going to have is getting people to come up. It's an unknown commodity. But once they get over that hurdle, it'll be fine."
Nelson Slater: "There isn't any Frank Rich who will review their plays and have everyone read his review. But if the word of mouth is good, everyone will come."
Bill Landis: "It's wonderful to see the theater in the hands of professionals. I think they'll be successful. But I assume they'll lose money. You can't make money in that theater."
Mr. Gill explains: "A profit would mean you're not spending enough on your mission." He envisions Sharon Stage as a cultural center, with readings, workshops and children's shows. "Our goal is to break even."
 
Sunday, July 2: Invitations to a Play
 Tim McHenry drops Lee Austin off at the Metro North station in Dover Plains, N.Y., for the ride back to his day job at the soap opera "Another World." Mr. McHenry returns to his Ford Explorer but doesn't open the door. Instead, he reaches in and extracts a pile of Sharon Stage fliers.
"See Estelle Parsons in 'Twice Removed' ! See Estelle Parsons in 'Twice Removed' ! " He hands the crisp blue and yellow leaflets to people in their cars. They take them, curious and smiling. That night, the parking lot is full.

THE ATOMIC BOMB
And the Architecture of an American Myth.

CODE-NAME DOWNFALL
The Secret Plan to Invade Japan --
And Why Truman Dropped the Bomb.
By Thomas B. Allen and Norman Polmar.
Illustrated. 352 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 FOR 20 years after Harry Truman ordered the atomic bomb dropped on Japan in August 1945, most American scholars and citizens subscribed to the original, official version of the story: the President had acted to avert a horrendous invasion of Japan that could have cost 200,000 to 500,000 American lives. Then a young political economist named Gar Alperovitz published a book of ferocious revisionism, "Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam" (1965). While acknowledging the paucity of evidence available at the time, he argued that dropping the atomic bomb "was not needed to end the war or to save lives" but was Truman's means of sending a chastening message to the Soviet Union.
Now, in "The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb," Mr. Alperovitz, who is the president of the National Center for Economic Alternatives, writes that "oversimplified versions of my argument (together with some obvious graduate-student errors) were pounced upon by critics who could not abide criticism of the Hiroshima decision." Benefiting from documentary discoveries of the past 30 years and the less fractious post-cold war atmosphere, he has produced a more ambitious and far-reaching work. As the author notes, his earlier book focused on "how the bomb influenced diplomacy." With the advantage of greater hindsight and documentation, this volume seeks to deal more comprehensively with the decision to drop the bomb and to suggest why the public clings so tenaciously to the original explanation of why Truman gave the order. With piquant irony, he has chosen the same title that Truman's first Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, used in a famous 1947 essay in Harper's that did much to establish the original version of the story in the public mind. Mr. Alperovitz has lost none of his instinct for provocative judgments about one of the century's paramount historical controversies. He has written what will almost certainly serve as a bible for the next generation of revisionist scholars, a book that is elegantly documented (with the aid of seven research collaborators) and intensely argued.
Fifty years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Mr. Alperovitz declares that a final answer to why the atomic bomb was used is "neither essential nor possible." He continues with a more debatable premise: "What is important is whether, when the bomb was used, the President and his top advisers understood that it was not required to avoid a long and costly invasion, as they later claimed and as most Americans still believe." More orthodox historical critiques of the atomic bomb decision sometimes question the estimates of casualties to be expected from a full-scale invasion of Japan. The argument goes that if these appraisals were inflated, the President had less business justifying the horror of the bomb as a way of saving lives. This debate is less interesting to Mr. Alperovitz. He insists that without use of the bomb, Japan might still have been made to surrender before the first American landing on the island of Kyushu, planned for November 1945. He notes that many American military leaders then and later felt that using atomic weapons against Japan was unnecessary.
But, Mr. Alperovitz argues, Truman and his Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes, were struck by the notion that ending World War II without dropping the atomic bomb would not have brought added strength to American diplomacy against the Soviet Union in Europe. More than in the earlier book, Byrnes is the villain of this piece. Mr. Alperovitz insists that a decision not to drop the bomb could actually have bolstered American diplomatic objectives in Asia -- for example, by helping to create the atmosphere for a more harmonious postwar American-Soviet relationship. He criticizes Truman for failing to issue a more explicit warning to Japan about the bomb and for attacking Hiroshima rather than a nonurban target, as his Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George C. Marshall, had suggested.
As evidence of the link between the bomb decision and diplomacy toward Moscow, Mr. Alperovitz points to Truman's postponement of his Potsdam meeting with Stalin and Churchill until July 1945, when the new weapon would have been tested. At Potsdam, after hearing about the first successful detonation in New Mexico, Truman turned suddenly more truculent. According to Stimson, Churchill marveled that the President "was a changed man. He told the Russians just where they got on and off and generally bossed the whole meeting." Truman confided to his crony and reparations negotiator Edwin Pauley that the bomb "would keep the Russians straight." Mr. Alperovitz argues that "the U.S. feeling of cheerfulness rather than frustration" over differences with the Soviets at Potsdam "makes little sense unless one realizes that top policy makers were thinking ahead to the time when the force of the new weapon would be displayed."
But how might Truman, if he were disinclined to use the bomb, have ended the war without the large number of casualties required, by any estimate, for the invasion of Japan? Mr. Alperovitz says that the President could have shown himself a lot more eager to welcome the Soviets into the Asian conflict. Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, had wanted Stalin to help pin the Japanese down on the Chinese mainland, making it harder for them to reinforce their home armies when the Americans invaded.
Mr. Alperovitz suggests that on the issue of Soviet participation in the Japanese war, Truman zigged and zagged after taking office in April 1945. In mid-June, American officials like General Marshall were arguing that a Soviet war declaration might "prove to be the decisive blow to force a Japanese surrender." But at Potsdam, Mr. Alperovitz writes, Truman sought to delay a Soviet war declaration: although it might have precluded the use of the bomb on Japan, it would have given Stalin a large foothold in east Asia. Mr. Alperovitz says that the timing of the Hiroshima bombing -- Aug. 6, 1945 -- was no accident. Two days later the Soviet Union declared war on the Japanese and then crossed the border into Manchuria.
 MR. ALPEROVITZ offers another alternative for ending the war without using the bomb: relaxing the unconditional surrender demand issued by Roosevelt in 1943 at Casablanca. He suggests that the President might have provided assurances that if Tokyo surrendered, the Japanese Emperor, Hirohito, would be permitted to retain his throne. This idea indeed found strong support among Truman's advisers. Stimson proposed that Truman allow the Japanese "a constitutional monarchy under the present dynasty if it be shown to the complete satisfaction of the world that such a government will never again conspire to aggression." Mr. Alperovitz notes that in mid-August, after the bombs had been dropped and the Russians had entered the conflict, Truman and Byrnes were willing to provide assurances about the Emperor. Doesn't the fact that these weren't provided earlier, when they might have helped end the war, indicate an eagerness to drop the bomb?
Mr. Alperovitz gives less weight than other scholars to the arguments against such an offer. As the Stanford historian Barton Bernstein has recently noted in the journal Diplomatic History, the Tokyo regime of mid-summer 1945 was badly split over what kind of American peace offer, if any, to accept. At that point, granting a concession on the Emperor's role could have drawn the United States into extended bargaining with the Japanese leaders. Haggling with a regime that Roosevelt and Truman had denounced as criminal, that had attacked Pearl Harbor and that had committed well-publicized atrocities was the kind of thing the unconditional surrender doctrine had been drafted to avoid. Not irrationally, Truman told Churchill that he did not think the Japanese had "any military honor after Pearl Harbor." (And there is also the possibility that ambiguity over Hirohito's role might have impeded America's ability to occupy the country and reform the political system from the ground up.)
Mr. Alperovitz devotes considerable space to showing how Stimson's article in Harper's, misleading official memoirs and the American Government's refusal over the years to release certain classified documents helped enshrine the original explanation of the atomic bomb decision. Yet, as energetically as he argues his case, he is unlikely to convert those who do not believe that finding an alternative to the atomic bomb should have been an overarching priority for Truman in the summer of 1945.
Moreover, Mr. Alperovitz's new volume lacks what the Harvard historian Charles S. Maier has called the "shock value" of his earlier one. One reason is that we are more skeptical about the motives of our leaders and the origins of the cold war than we were in 1965. But another is the degree to which Mr. Alperovitz's views have pushed other scholars to re-examine their assumptions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
 IN "Code-Name Downfall," Thomas B. Allen and Norman Polmar, the authors of "CNN: War in the Gulf" and "Rickover: Controversy and Genius," reveal new sidelights on the planning to invade Japan. Amid some purple prose (the book begins, "The United States was plunged into despair on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941," and later says, "MacArthur's life and career were a parade of superlatives"), they show how the fall of Okinawa in July 1945 became the prelude to the planned landing by seven Army and three Marine divisions on Kyushu and the 17-division landing on the main Japanese island of Honshu, the latter action scheduled for March 1946. They describe the fictitious attacks and feints devised to deceive the foe, and the possible American use of poison gas, anthrax germs and atomic weapons during the invasion. Told of Hiroshima, one American planner said he wanted "six of these things" for the Kyushu landing. Ignorant of the danger of radiation to his own troops, General Marshall pondered using atomic bombs on Kyushu before the Americans came ashore.
Mr. Allen and Mr. Polmar explain that before the atomic bombs were dropped the Pentagon expected to be faced with Japanese resistance until November 1946. Grimly recalling a March 1945 bombing attack on the Japanese capital, General Marshall said, "We had 100,000 people killed in Tokyo in one night, and it had seemingly no effect whatsoever."
The authors also describe Truman's effort to assess the possible casualties that would result from a full-scale invasion. Whereas Mr. Alperovitz laments Truman's manipulation of casualty estimates after his retirement (in 1959 he argued that the bomb saved "millions of lives"), Mr. Allen and Mr. Polmar are more intrigued by the manipulation of casualty estimates before Truman made his decision. They note a "worst-case scenario" in June 1945 that estimated the number of battle casualties at 220,000, but caution that the military was not averse to reshaping casualty estimates in order to influence Truman's thinking on whether or not to invade Japan: "High estimates would make the invasion a far less attractive alternative to the bomb."
The authors display little ambivalence about the question raised by the second half of their subtitle, "And Why Truman Dropped the Bomb." They dispose of the immensely complex problem of whether or not the bomb should have been dropped in a few paragraphs, writing, "As for the use of the atomic bomb as an implied threat to the Soviet Union, geopolitics may have been on the minds of some of Truman's advisers, but the war and American lives were on his mind. Preparations for the massive amphibious assault on Japan were under way, and Truman went to Potsdam in July seeking assurance that Stalin would enter the war against Japan. Then Truman learned on July 16 that the atomic bomb would work, and he ordered it used. It was a weapon, and it might end the war without an invasion." Mr. Allen and Mr. Polmar conclude that Kyushu "would have been the bloodiest invasion in history" and "could have been surpassed by the assault of Honshu." The debate goes on.

DARK SUN
The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb.
By Richard Rhodes.
Illustrated. 731 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $32.50. 
 THE discovery, in early September 1949, that the Soviet Union had recently exploded its first A-bomb forced American nuclear-weapons policy to a fraught point of decision. Although the United States possessed a formidable and steadily expanding nuclear arsenal, a number of scientists and policy makers demanded a crash program to build a thermonuclear weapon that they called "the Super"; fueled by hydrogen, it would explode with the power of millions of tons of TNT in a blast a thousand times greater than the one that destroyed Hiroshima. The H-bomb's most zealous advocate was Edward Teller, a theoretical physicist and refugee from Hungary, for whom the Super had become an obsession. He battled scientists like J. Robert Oppenheimer, the charismatic head of wartime Los Alamos whose public career he would later help destroy, politicking against their attempts to block the escalation of terror and warning that if the Soviets beat the United States to a thermonuclear weapon, "our situation will be hopeless."
In "Dark Sun," a book of formidable range, Richard Rhodes recounts in detail what led up to the Soviet explosion, how Mr. Teller and his allies obtained Presidential authorization for a crash hydrogen bomb program and how the weapon was ultimately invented. His book, the first in a new Sloan Technology Series sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, handsomely fulfills the series' aim, which is to deepen public understanding of modern technology in all its human and technical dimensions.
Mr. Rhodes draws on a vast array of sources, melding previous scholarship with an abundance of fresh material from memoirs, interviews, F.B.I. files and recently released Soviet documents. Illuminating issues through the play of personalities, he sometimes loses sight of how bureaucratic forces shaped policy disputes and gives little attention to the industrial underpinnings of the nuclear weapons enterprise. But no great matter. He writes with a sharp eye for anecdote, character and political context, and with the talent for lucid exposition of technical issues that he displayed in his award-winning "Making of the Atomic Bomb." The result is a brilliantly rich and vivid account of the interlocked early history of the cold war and the arms race that is as chilling as it is enthralling.
In a kind of extended prologue to his main story, Mr. Rhodes devotes much of the first third of "Dark Sun" to the espionage that speeded the Soviet A-bomb effort. Here he makes especially effective use of F.B.I. records and Soviet sources, laying out the activities of key atomic spies like Klaus Fuchs, David Greenglass, Julius Rosenberg and Harry Gold. He explores their motives, recounts their shady rendezvous at bars, apartments and street corners with one another and with the Soviet rezidents who ran the show in the United States. He concludes that the espionage was extensive -- as this month's disclosure of decrypted Soviet cables demonstrates -- and that by the end of the war it produced probably 10,000 pages, much of it from American classified documents. By correlating the information the spies passed on with contemporary Soviet technical writing, he finds that it significantly shaped the Soviet technical program, guiding Igor Kurchatov, the cheery and resilient physicist who headed the Soviet nuclear enterprise, to an advantageous reactor design, to the recognition that a bomb could be made of plutonium and to the implosion method of detonation. Mr. Rhodes, whose independent treatment of the Soviet story complements David Holloway's 1994 book, "Stalin and the Bomb," estimates, as do Mr. Holloway's best qualified sources, that espionage accelerated the Soviet bomb by as much as two years.
On one side of the debate that followed the discovery of Joe 1, as the Soviet bomb was known in American intelligence circles, was a distinguished complement of scientists and policy makers, including Oppenheimer, since Hiroshima a leading adviser on nuclear policy, along with other oppositionists, who urged that the United States not build an H-bomb in the hope that the Soviets would then not either. Others argued that the bomb should be pursued only if the Soviets would not agree to forgo developing one. Their reasons were partly moral -- an H-bomb would be a weapon of "genocide" and, as such, "necessarily an evil thing," as the Nobel laureates I. I. Rabi and Enrico Fermi put it -- and partly prudential: the national interest of the United States lay in avoiding a thermonuclear arms race.
The arguments were also technical. It was an open question whether the bomb design that Mr. Teller was promoting -- what Mr. Rhodes calls the "classical Super," as distinct from a more modestly energetic alternative called the "Alarm Clock" -- was inconsistent with the known laws of physics. The basic idea was to use the heat of a fission bomb to ignite a mixture of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium to a fusion burn, but under theoretical analysis, Mr. Teller's variations had repeatedly failed because of inadequate ignition or fizzling of the burn.
Lined up with Mr. Teller were distinguished physicists like Ernest O. Lawrence and powerful officials, including Lewis L. Strauss, of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Some could see no moral difference between slaughtering a city with several atomic bombs or with a single H-bomb. The Chiefs considered it "foolhardy altruism" voluntarily to renounce a superweapon, a view no doubt influenced by the big-bomb ambitions of Gen. Curtis LeMay, who in March 1949 had proposed an attack plan for his Strategic Air Command that, using just atomic bombs, would destroy 70 Soviet cities in 30 days. Secretary of State Dean Acheson was unconvinced -- justifiably, as Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Holloway both show -- that a paranoid adversary could be persuaded to disarm by example. At the end of January 1950, President Harry S. Truman announced the crash H-bomb program, at a time, Rabi bitterly remembered, "when we didn't even know how to make one."
The dramatic account of how we learned to make one is one of the most arresting sections of "Dark Sun." The breakthrough came in January 1951, on the periphery of the crash effort, in the inspiration of Stanislaw Ulam, the mathematical physicist who had pioneered the tedious calculations showing that the classical Super would fail. Ulam's idea was that a thermonuclear weapon might work if neutrons from the fission primary were used to compress and ignite the fusion fuel. Mr. Teller brilliantly improved on it, proposing the superior trick of using the fission primary's radiation and, in April, adding a second fission mechanism.
At a meeting of physicists in Princeton in mid-June, the new, unexpected approach was greeted as virtually miraculous. There was no talk of evil and genocide. Oppenheimer enlisted in the H-bomb army, later explaining that the breakthrough was too "technically sweet" to pass up. Mr. Rhodes rightly asks "why technical promise should decide questions of politics and morality," and answers that the frame of ethical perception had changed, because of the Korean War, the exposure of Fuchs, who knew the early ideas for the Super, and the expectation that if our physicists could think of a radiation-fired H-bomb, so could Soviet physicists. On Nov. 1, 1952, the principle of the new Super was proved in a spectacularly successful test in the Pacific, code-named "Mike," that yielded a 10-megaton blast and that Mr. Rhodes describes in riveting detail.
 YET for Edward Teller and assorted acolytes of a big-bomb defense, the advent of the H-bomb was not enough. They wanted to destroy Robert Oppenheimer as a credible participant in national-security policy. In singling him out for the Svengali-like influence they supposed he had over people who had sought to thwart them, they were driven by an obsessive anti-Communism, by distrust of Oppenheimer, who had mixed with Communists, and, in the cases of Mr. Teller and Lewis Strauss, by a deep hatred of the man. Mr. Rhodes compellingly summarizes the machinations that led to the official finding, in 1954, that Oppenheimer was a security risk. He believes that Oppenheimer contributed to his own downfall by lying at his security hearing about a 1943 wartime approach on behalf of the Soviet Union. But he emphasizes that the touchstone issue was his opposition to the hydrogen bomb.
A number of the key charges were drawn from what Mr. Teller had told the F.B.I. in 1952 -- that Oppenheimer had persistently hindered and effectively delayed the development of the weapon, and that but for him, it might have been ready by 1951 or even earlier. Mr. Rhodes shreds Mr. Teller's misrepresentations of the matter then and since, concluding convincingly that it was Edward Teller himself who delayed the development of the hydrogen bomb by forcing concentration of the American effort for so long on his idee fixe, the classical Super. Before too long, Mr. Rhodes observes, nuclear weapons became "obsolete" as instruments of destruction; the terrifying days of the Cuban missile crisis made tangible that using them would invite Armageddon. Yet they served many other purposes -- for example, helping to drain enormous resources from the civilian into the military economy, including General LeMay's swelling sector of it.
Robert Oppenheimer was in the end victimized because he eloquently advanced a view that threatened the megaton ambitions of Mr. Teller and his allies -- the view that greater security did not lie in ever more powerful nuclear arsenals and that the cost of pursuing them, as "Dark Sun" shows, could undermine the vitality of the democracy they were built to defend.

HEADLINE: Discord Rattles Co-op City Towers;
Feuds and Finances Threaten Stability of Middle-Class Refuge

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
The very idea of Co-op City sounds idealistic, even friendly, like a gigantic concrete commune in the Bronx on the Hutchinson River. It is the largest cooperative housing development in the country, with 55,000 residents who own shares of the sprawling development. They are not called tenants or renters or even partners -- they are "cooperators."
Lately, however, "gladiators" would be more fitting. 
 Open warfare has broken out on the governing board of Co-op City, which seems to comprise some of the least cooperative of cooperators. They are engaged in the high-rise version of small-town politics, with players making their entrances and exits at the comical pace of a French farce.
But the bickering obscures the fact that this city within a city, as residents like to call their community, is at a difficult crossroads. Co-op City, which was the urban answer to the call from moderate-income residents for safe, affordable and spacious living when it opened in the late 1960's, is in a squeeze much like the middle class in the city as a whole.
Twenty-seven years after it opened, helping to speed the working-class exodus from the South Bronx, Co-op City'sunderground infrastructure of water and utility pipes is defective and needs more than $200 million in repairs. That is about $75 million more than either the State of New York or the corporation that owns the complex says it can afford. In addition, nearly 10 percent of Co-op City's 8,000 parking spaces are closed because the parking garages are plagued by crumbling concrete, which would take at least $10 million to repair.
Fixing the utility system is considered crucial to Co-op City's survival, but officials say paying for the repairs could require a 30 percent increase in residents' maintenance fees over the next six years. Apartment prices were slashed two years ago to attract new buyers, and officials are concerned about increasing fees just as a new wave of largely black and Hispanic middle-income earners from around New York is discovering Co-op City.
When it opened, Co-op City was a refuge for middle-income families eager to flee the inner city but unable to afford the suburbs. It was a self-contained neighborhood with decent schools, a low crime rate and its own stores and playgrounds, all built on a former swamp that had once been the site of the Freedomland amusement park.
Crime remains low, but the recent shooting of an off-duty police officer in one of the buildings has hastened a push for lobby attendants. New residents, like the generations that preceded them, laud Co-op City for its peaceful distance from the violence and decay of their old neighborhoods, but longtime residents decry the creeping graffiti and the occasional smell of urine in the elevators.
"We're fighting to keep it a stable community," said Gretchen B. Hazell, the newly elected president of the Riverbay Corporation, which owns Co-op City. She acknowledges that Co-op City has problems but said that the influx of new, young families interested "in protecting their investments" would give the development new energy.
"We're going to survive this," she said. "We're a city within a city, and all cities have problems."
Co-op City is engaged in a new marketing campaign that in 18 months has cut the number of vacancies among its 15,372 apartments to fewer than 600 from nearly 1,400. It now costs $1,750 per room to buy shares of Co-op City, and monthly fees amount to $140 per room.
The working-class promise of Co-op City is hardly lost. Ann Carty, 33, moved to Co-op City a year ago from the Castle Hill Houses, a public housing project, and said she considered the development "the last stop." She said other affordable neighborhoods were too dangerous and decayed. The hallways of her high-rise building at Co-op City are spotless, flowers grow in a garden outside the front entrance, and she says she feels relatively safe.
Ms. Carty, who has three children, works for a commercial cleaning company, and her husband works in building maintenance. Her concern, like others', is that Co-op City does not go the way of poorer neighborhoods. "I just don't want it to happen here," she said, while watching two of her children play on a nearby playground. "It you're working hard, you deserve better."
Questions about Co-op City's stability have been reinforced recently by its tumultuous politics.
Since April, the board has had three presidents. Board members have asked the Bronx District Attorney to investigate whether other board members have received special treatment, like free countertops or custom colors painted in their apartments, and Ms. Hazell unilaterally suspended the general manager of the $138 million-a-year corporation.
Two investigations are focusing on the Co-op City board. In a state investigation, the Attorney General's office is reviewing the awarding of contracts to the insurance brokers who purchase insurance for the development to determine if favoritism was involved, two Co-op City officials who have cooperated with the investigation said.
A spokesman for District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said that the office was looking into allegations that board members received free work on their apartments. The accused say they are not guilty.
"I have a receipt!" said Iris Baez, one of the three recent board presidents. "They claim I got a countertop. I did. But I bought it. They claim I had wallpaper. That's true, but my ceiling fell. I didn't get anything any other cooperator didn't get."
Mrs. Baez was removed as president by her fellow board members in April, after she made the original charges of corruption against the board members. Her successor, Clarence (Jake) Powell, a retired homicide detective, then began an investigation that reported "a disturbing pattern of special favors being provided to" board members -- including Mrs. Baez -- and turned that evidence over to the District Attorney.
Five weeks ago, Co-op City voters elected a new board majority that includes Mrs. Baez, who is now the first vice president and head of the Integrity Committee. She is an ally of the new president, Ms. Hazell.
Ms. Hazell has said she intends to bring order to Co-op City's management. Late last month, without taking a vote of the board, she suspended the general manager, Alan M. Brenner, blaming him for problems at the development. Although Ms. Hazell said Mr. Brenner had been operating under "a cloud" because some Co-op City workers had painted his Westchester County house, he said he had paid them privately.
Then Ms. Hazell moved on to other matters. She ordered the personnel director to draw up a dress code for employees and directed all employees to address each other with courtesy titles like Mrs. and Mr. "I come down the hall and people say, 'Hey, Gretchen,' " she said. "Like, I'm the president."
But Mr. Powell, speaking of the board's new majority, said, "They're really out of control."
A board member, Cheryl Abramson Richards, said of all the infighting, "If it weren't so dangerous, it would be hysterical."
Co-op City aficionados say that the development has long been afflicted with complicated, hardball politics and that the current financial problems have been long in coming. Co-op City was built as a state-assisted project, and its construction was overseen by the state.
"The basic problem with Co-op City was that it was built under lax supervision," said Congressman Eliot L. Engel, a Democrat who maintains an apartment in Co-op City, which he represents. "There were shoddy materials used, and there was wholesale thievery going on. Five or six years after the place was built, it was falling apart."
Since the 1970's, Co-op City residents and state officials have been arguing over who should pay for repairs. In the mid-1970's, residents went on a 15-month rent strike to protest increases in the monthly maintenance, or carrying, charges.
In 1992, the state agreed to provide $108 million for the necessary renovations, and the Riverbay Corporation put up $25 million. But the estimated cost of the repairs are $210 million, leaving a shortfall to be made up with increases in the monthly carrying charges.
Those fees are also expected to rise in the year 2000 because of an agreement that calls for Co-op City to begin paying the state 13 annual payments of $10 million to settle unpaid mortgage payments accumulated during past rent strikes.
Representative Engel said the state would have to come up with more money or risk pricing many residents out of their apartments. He and other Co-op City residents say the state should pay for the repairs because it was responsible for monitoring the initial construction.
The state has said it will not put up any more money, and even that has become an issue in Co-op City politics. The current board leaders accuse their predecessors of negotiating a bad deal with the state that straps residents with a future of increased monthly fees.
Then again, almost everything seems to become a matter of politics. "The politics here are absolutely cutthroat," said Shirley Saunders, a former board member who was once accused by political opponents of using two parking spaces but paying for one. Then she quickly added, "But the community is lovely."

HEADLINE: June Orders Down For Machine Tools

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
June orders for machine tools made in the United States fell less than 1 percent from May levels, holding essentially steady as higher shipments in the first half of 1995 kept orders afloat, a trade group said in a report to be released today.
Total orders fell seven-tenths of a percent in June to $375.9 million from a revised $378.6 million in May, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said. Earlier, the association had said that May orders reached $387.1 million. June orders were down 6.9 percent from $403.7 million a year earlier. 
 Despite the overall decline, Albert Moore, president of the association, said it was satisfying that export orders for the year were more than double the 1994 level.
"Healthy overseas markets will be a necessary part of the U.S. industry's continued growth," he added.
Export orders in June, however, fell 17.2 percent to $52.5 million from a revised $63.4 million in May, the association said. They rose 19.8 percent from $43.8 million in June 1994. May orders were revised down from $64.1 million.
Shipments, at $2.18 billion in the first six months of 1995, were 15.3 percent higher than the $1.89 billion for the period last yer.
Orders so far this year climbed 14.5 percent from the first six months of 1994. Export orders through June soared 158.6 percent from the 1994 period.
The association said the backlog of unfilled orders in June fell from May, to $2.37 billion. In June last year the backlog stood at $1.67 billion. June shipments rose to $438.6 million from a revised $371.7 million in May. A year ago, shipments were $371.3 million.

HEADLINE: SENATE COMMITTEE STARTS RESHAPING HOUSE BUDGET BILL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Less than two weeks after a raucous House approved a $23.2 billion spending bill crammed with political trouble, the Senate has begun quietly but methodically stripping the measure of its most controversial provisions on abortion, AIDS education, the Mexican peso and the outright abolition of offices in the core of the Democratic White House.
The House's efforts drew headlines and loud debate on the floor of Congress. But much less notice was given six days later to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that quietly picked up the House bill, excised each of those provisions, and cut spending by $175 million more. 
 The bill is one of 13 that set 1996 spending, totaling about $540 billion, for the three branches of Government and their agencies. About $1.2 trillion in spending on interest on the national debt and on benefit programs -- welfare, Medicare, Social Security and so on -- is covered in other measures that have yet to come to a vote in either house.
"Let's try to clean up some of these bills from the House," the Appropriations Committee's chairman, Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, said dryly as his panel approved the bill late last week.
As the Senate begins to receive the great slug of spending bills from the House, that appears to be just what is occurring, even though both bodies seem intent on making major cuts in spending.
The House, impatient to advance the conservative revolution, has used the bills not just to cut spending, but to insure that what is spent promotes a rightward ideology.
The Senate, either because it is less revolutionary or more realistic, is stripping out the ideology and keeping the spending cuts. It is as if the Visigoths had submitted the records of their latest conquests to a Big Eight accounting firm.
The House and the Senate must agree on every jot and tittle of all 13 measures, including the legislative riders on issues like AIDS education and abortion, before they can go to the President, who may reject them anyway.
"The Clinton Administration isn't going to like a lot of these bills," said Thomas Mann, the Brookings Institution scholar and authority on Congress, "but it's going to have a lot more to do with their funding levels than these legislative riders. A fair amount of them are going to fall out in the Senate."
The Administration already does not like a lot of the bills. It has threatened to veto 5 of the 11 that the House has approved so far unless the Senate vastly moderates them.
The Senate has its work cut out for it. When the House passes a $261 billion spending bill this week covering the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services departments, it will have virtually completed its work on that section of the 1996 budget. By contrast, the Senate has barely begun; its Appropriations Committee has plowed through about half the stack of bills and put off the prickliest ones until Congress returns from vacation in September.
The Senate has passed but two of the bills, neither controversial. It takes up a third, covering energy and water spending, this week.
Whatever differences the Senate has with the House measures do not extend to the amount they would spend. Both chambers agreed in June to a budget outline that sharply reduces the growth of spending in 1996 and the next six years. The size of next year's pot of money has already been decided.
The fiscal differences are niggling, but they mirror the two bodies' political leanings. The senators already are breaking ranks with the House over how and where to spend the money, and on whether the spending bills should be vehicles for other efforts to dismantle 40 years of more liberal and generally Democratic programs.
The Senate would allot about $1.4 billion less for the military than the more hawkish House, but set aside an extra $1.6 billion for labor, education and welfare programs. The House would spend a trifle more on highways, buses and airports; the Senate would spend more for veterans and public housing.
The House and Senate can reconcile such gaps when they meet to hammer out compromise spending bills. But the ideological differences within the bills, written into spending priorities and politically inspired amendments, will be tougher.
Consider the $23.2 billion bill, which finances the Treasury, Postal Service, White House and other general government agencies, that Mr. Hatfield's Senate panel tackled last week. It arrived from the House bearing an amendment that barred Federal employee health plans from paying for abortions except when the mother's life was in danger. Another prohibited Federal worker-training programs from seeking to change "values or life style," or providing more than medical and legal information about AIDS.
A third amendment barred the Treasury Department from using its Exchange Stabilization Fund to support a foreign currency -- in this instance, the Mexican peso.
A fourth amendment cut financing for Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, a heretofore uncontroversial group that apparently fell to the House's desire to show who holds the national purse strings.
The Appropriations subcommittee headed by Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Democrat turned Republican last year, removed all those clauses and largely followed the directives of Mr. Hatfield.
"Hatfield doesn't really interfere," a committee aide said last week. "Basically, he says not to put anything in your bill that's controversial -- if you have something, bring it to the floor, not the committee."
In fact, supporters of the House provisions will get a second shot, because the legislative rules provide that decisions to remove clauses from House bills must be approved by the full Senate. Most such changes are offered as a package that the Senate votes up or down.
The House is sending Mr. Hatfield some bombshells, especially in the labor and education spending bill being considered this week.
Some of the amendments attached to spending bills in the House reflect the demands of the Contract With America and repay Republicans' grass-roots supporters, especially conservative Christians.
As it now stands, the labor and education bill includes clauses that withhold Federal grants from nonprofit groups and companies that lobby or engage in political activities, limit medical research involving human embryos, and let the states withhold Medicaid money for abortions involving rape and incest -- which would limit Medicaid financing for abortions to only those needed to save the life of the mother.
The bill would restrict the National Labor Relations Board's ability to seek injunctions in labor disputes, and prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from drafting or carrying out some safety rules, including one crafted to reduce repetitive motion injuries.
It would reduce money for public broadcasting and eliminate a billion-dollar program, called Liheap, that helps the poor pay their utility bills, and restrict the use of money for family-planning programs.
And that is one bill. Elsewhere, the House and Senate will probably disagree on how much to spend on the Energy Department, on money for Indian programs, on whether to abolish the office of the White House drug czar, and on how much to spend on exotic new weaponry.
When Congress returns to town after Labor Day, the Senate must settle those issues, approve virtually the entire budget, strike compromises on all 13 bills with the House, and then send them to the President, who seems determined to veto many of them anyway.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Eagle's Painful Decision to Sell

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: PITTSFIELD, Mass.

 BODY:
For 103 years, The Berkshire Eagle has been a Yankee institution, as important to the intellectual, social and political life of this corner of New England as the town meetings it has covered.
With a daily circulation of 32,000, The Eagle has been tough, thoughtful and thorough. Awarded the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1973, its reputation for excellence has extended far beyond Berkshire County. Journalists nationwide revere The Eagle as a guardian of their professional values. 
 One family, the Millers, has owned the paper -- based in this western Massachusetts town of 43,000 people -- and they have poured money into the newsroom. With a far larger staff than most other dailies of its size, The Eagle has chronicled it all: church suppers, school board elections, Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts at Tanglewood in nearby Lenox, labor problems at the local General Electric plant, politics at the Statehouse in Boston.
But now, the Millers' Eagle Publishing Company -- burdened by an estimated $19 million in debt, most of it from an ill-timed real estate deal -- is about to sell the paper, as well as its four other papers. An announcement of The Eagle sale is expected by mid-August; the paper is estimated to be worth $40 million to $50 million. The new owner is expected to be an outsider.
Michael Miller, publisher of The Eagle, has said that one prospective buyer is W. Dean Singleton, a Denver publishing entrepreneur whose companies own about 75 papers, including The Denver Post. Mr. Singleton is chief executive of Media News Group, which sold The Houston Post to its rival, The Houston Chronicle, in April -- resulting in the closing of The Post. He did not return telephone calls to his office.
Eagle reporters and editors also worry that under a new owner, The Eagle will lose its voice and its commitment to the community.
Over the years, The Eagle has become a training ground for journalists, including Helen W. Donovan, the executive editor of The Boston Globe; Stephen Rosenfeld, the deputy editorial page editor at The Washington Post; and the late Kirk Scharfenberg, who was the editorial page editor at The Globe.
The curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, Bill Kovach, began reading The Eagle in the early 1970's, while he was the Boston bureau chief for The New York Times. "The thing about The Eagle that really set it apart was its willingness to accept a responsibility to presume that it was the only paper its readers took in their circulation area," he said. "And it made the effort to provide the best possible coverage of the issues that affected their lives, including state government and the public-affairs issues confronting the whole state."
"That kind of willingness to use your resources to provide your readers with what they deserved, and what they needed, is the hallmark of great journalism," Mr. Kovach added. "It's really sad to see a paper like The Eagle on the block with an almost certain assurance that it will be bought by a corporate chain whose interests are corporate and the bottom line."
 Donald A. MacGillis, The Eagle's editorial page editor, has spent 21 years at the paper. "The Eagle makes money," he said. "We're afraid the new owners will say, 'I want it to make a whole lot more money.' American journalism proves you can put out an awful paper and still make money."
 Kelton B. Miller started running The Eagle in 1892, with one flatbed press and one Linotype typesetting machine. The family business eventually grew into the Eagle Publishing Company, which also owns two dailies and a weekly in Vermont and a daily in Connecticut.
When Kelton Miller died in 1941, his sons, Pete and Donald, inherited the paper. Pete was editor and Don publisher until Don died in 1972. Then Pete became publisher, too.
Pete Miller knew what readers wanted. "He had this little VW Beetle and he'd just drive everywhere," said Richard K. Weil, an assistant managing editor at The St. Louis Post Dispatch, who was a reporter at The Eagle. "Everything about the county interested him."
When Pete Miller died in 1991, his son Michael took over as publisher, and another son, Mark, became editor. "It's painful," Mark Miller said in a recent telephone interview. "It's a defeat. We'd rather have it be a success and carry on and try to put out a very good paper ourselves for another generation or so."
A third brother, Kelton, is the publisher of the Vermont papers. Their sister, Margo, is a reporter for The Boston Globe.
As the publisher of The Eagle and president of the company, Michael Miller played a key role in the real estate deal that left Eagle Publishing mired in debt. In 1987, the company bought an 11-acre mill complex in Pittsfield for $3.66 million, when the market was booming, and spent $23.7 million to renovate it for The Eagle, with space for other tenants. While the building has won awards and The Eagle has a new newsroom, the building is half empty.
The purchase was supposed to diversify the company's investments and make the company's future more secure. Grier Horner, the assistant managing editor, said: "The ironic thing is that the effort to insulate the paper from financial shocks ultimately became the death knell for the Miller ownership. It was a bold move that backfired."
Mr. Miller blames Eagle Publishing's problems partly on the recession, which worsened in Pittsfield in the early 1990's. General Electric slashed its work force from 8,000 to 600. House after house was put up for sale. England Brothers, the family-owned department store and a major Eagle advertiser, was closed.
 Mr. Miller said the stock market crash in 1987 and the soaring cost of newsprint also hurt the company.
 In 1991, Eagle Publishing acquired more debt, apparently, after it bought a paper in Connecticut. "I think buying The Middletown Press after buying that building just sealed it," Mr. Miller said. He declined to say how much had been spent to acquire The Press, but added that the paper had become profitable.
Seated at his grandfather's roll-top desk in his office during a recent interview, Michael Miller declined to talk about his feelings about the sale. He did offer, however, that "the new owners will probably make savings increases we haven't been able to."
With circulation steady and advertising solid, The Eagle remains profitable, Mr. Miller said.
But the newsroom is an anxious place these days. Under Pete Miller, not a single reporter or editor was laid off, even when circulation dipped. But since then, the newsroom staff has been cut from 62 to 40 employees. Twelve reporters have to cover territory once handled by 20.
The news editor, Clarence Fanto, said: "It's a community trust; it's the town crier; it's the bulletin board for the county. Who's going to buy it? What are they going to do to it? Will it still be The Berkshire Eagle?"
 And cost-cutting has meant the end of certain Eagle traditions, like free obituaries. Readers were outraged in May when the paper began charging $85 for an obituary.
But despite the possible change of ownership at The Eagle, "the newsroom hasn't quit," said Mr. Horner, who started as a reporter 30 years ago. "But it's harder. We're not as rich in subject matter and stories as we would be if we had a few more reporters. We're sort of like a runner with shinsplints. You're running, but it hurts, and you can't run as fast."

HEADLINE: 2 Killed as Speeding Car Crashes Into Police Cruiser

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC 

 BODY:
Alcohol, reckless driving and an apparently fake 911 call combined in deadly fashion before dawn yesterday in the Bronx, when a 31-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic drove a red Honda into the side of a police cruiser, killing himself and his girlfriend and injuring two police officers, a Police Department official said.
Witnesses told police investigators that the Honda, heading south on Crotona Avenue, had run at least one red light and had crossed a double yellow line before it went through a stop signal at East 180th Street in East Tremont at about 75 miles per hour, said Deputy Chief Frank Biehler, the Police Department's executive officer in the Bronx, at an afternoon press conference at the 48th Precinct. 
 The car hit the broadside of the police cruiser, which had entered the intersection from the east at about 20 to 30 m.p.h. Its red lights were flashing, but its siren was switched off, the police said.
The impact sent Officer Tracey Brown, 33, the passenger in the cruiser, through the windshield, the deputy chief said. He landed about 25 feet from the police vehicle.
The Honda crashed into the wall of a nearby building. "Four empty beer bottles were found in the Honda," Deputy Chief Biehler said.
Rescue crews required 45 minutes to extract the Honda's driver, Juan Antonio Inoa Debarez, also known as Jose Santos, and his girlfriend, Gloria Bajana, 37, the police said.
Ms. Bajana, the mother of three children, was pronounced dead at the scene, Deputy Chief Biehler said. Mr. Inoa, who had two children in Santo Domingo, was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital about an hour after the accident.
Officer Brown was in critical but stable condition at Jacobi Medical Center with a deep cut on his head, burns on his eyes and cuts on his legs, a hospital representative said. The driver of the patrol car, Officer Paul Montalvo, 31, was listed in stable condition.
Mr. Inoa and Ms. Bajana lived at 2345 Crotona Avenue in Belmont, Deputy Chief Biehler said. Ms. Bajana worked as a home attendant, and Mr. Inoa was unemployed, he said.
"Mr. Santos is known to us by a variety of names," Deputy Chief Biehler said. Mr. Santos, or Mr. Inoa, had a temporary driver's license issued in California, Deputy Chief Biehler said, and he was arrested in the Bronx on Dec. 4 for driving under the influence of alcohol and running eight red lights.
The Honda driven by Mr. Inoa is registered to a Manhattan resident, Deputy Chief Biehler said. The name of the car's owner was not released.
The collision occurred as Officers Brown and Montalvo were responding at about 5:04 A.M. to a 911 call about a robbery a few blocks from the accident scene, Deputy Chief Biehler said. Other police officers who answered the robbery call found no signs of foul play, he said.
"The witnesses are telling us the radio car was proceeding 20 to 30 miles per hour, and the green light was in their favor," the deputy chief said. As many as nine people saw the accident, he added, and only one said the police vehicle had beel traveling at high speed.
Deputy Chief Biehler said it was the usual police procedure for officers to use their roof lights but not their siren when responding to a street-robbery call.
Juan Arguetta, a son-in-law of Ms. Bajana, said the couple had been to a party in the area and had probably been going out to get something to eat.
"When I go to the scene," he said, "I see my mother-in-law on the floor almost already dead. I talked to somebody, and he see everything. He say they not going fast, but the police were going fast. They were going to an emergency."
Mr. Arguetta said Ms. Bajana had come to the United States from Honduras 10 years ago. "She came here for a better life for her kids," he said.
Officer Montalvo remembers nothing about the incident, his brother, Rinaldo, said. When Officer Montalvo became conscious, his brother said, he asked, "Where's Brown?"

HEADLINE: In Somalia, a Chameleon Thrives

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, July 25

 BODY:
A millionaire businessman, reputed arms dealer and drug trafficker, self-styled diplomat and peacemaker, Osman Hassan Ali has his own private army in Somalia. But as he limps into the lobby in Nairobi's Intercontinental Hotel, wearing a jacket and striped shirt and clutching a crutch in one hand, he hardly raises an eyebrow.
Accompanied by only one bodyguard, Osman Ato, as he is widely known (Ato is a nickname that means "skinny"), has come for coffee and a chat with an American Embassy official. The get-together is part of a whirlwind of meetings on Somalia's future that occupy much of his time these days as he commutes in and out of Mogadishu. 
 Osman Ato, 50, is far removed from the character of Somali warlords, men greedy for power and wealth at any cost. In the five months since the United Nations withdrew its troops, three men have already claimed to have been elected President of Somalia and formed governments. But the country remains in turmoil and rudderless, divided into clan territories. Even the Mogadishu airport tarmac is divided and under the control of different clans. Insecurity in Mogadishu has kept all but a handful of relief agencies in the capital and no Western nation has diplomats in Somalia.
Straight-talking and focused but coy about his own ambitions, Osman Ato is the chameleon of Somali politicians, showing himself to be a master of survival and adapting to shifting alliances. He financed clan militias during Somalia's civil war; built deadly "technicals," the four-wheel-drive cars mounted with antiaircraft guns and other automatic weapons, and expanded his fortune with United Nations contracts.
Now he says he wants to bring peace to his country so business can thrive and Somalia can rebuild itself. Of all the Somali political players, Osman Ato is the most skillful and pragmatic, Western diplomats say.
Once the chief financier of General Mohammed Farah Aidid, Somalia's most powerful clan leader and recently one of its self-proclaimed presidents, Osman Ato is now his enemy. Like many of General Aidid's former supporters, he has openly split and says he disagrees with his former leader's international isolationism and his desire to fight other clans to maintain his grip on power.
In 1992, Osman Ato helped pave the way for the food airlift and later the American troop landing. He was the Americans' main contact and negotiator with General Aidid.
Within half a year as the tension escalated and the United Nations began an all-out assault against General Aidid, the American military bombed Osman Ato's garages, destroying hundreds of thousands of dollars of bulldozers and other equipment as well as equipment that gave him the ability to build technicals. American military officials described him as "General Aidid's evil genius."
As they searched for Mr. Aidid, the American military arrested and imprisoned Osman Ato. In prison on an island off the coast of Somalia for four months, he suffered from malnutrition and severe neglect, former Western diplomats in Somalia say.
A year and a half after his release, Osman Ato's garages are up and running and making technicals again, he says. He is also once again talking and dealing with the Americans, trying to negotiate for funds for reconciliation conferences.
"We had a dispute but that dispute can be settled at a later stage," Osman Ato said about his relationship with the American Government. "We have to work with the Americans. We cannot live without them. We need their help in assisting Somalia. Personal grievances can come at a later date."
His pragmatism has brought at least grudging respect.
"He's very shrewd," said Robert Oakley, a former United States Ambassador to Somalia and its special envoy during the United Nations mission there. "Obviously he knows how to make deals and how to work with the Americans. He understands what makes sense to us.
"Not that he's our man," he said. "Politically, he can't afford to be too close to the Americans. He's one of the people keenly aware of how much damage we did to Somalia."
Osman Ato has spent much of his life dealing with Americans in Somalia. From the age of 11, he worked for American oil companies, starting as a greaser and working his way up to general manager, developing close ties, in particular with Conoco. He also built businesses in heavy equipment and became one of Mogadishu's biggest real estate owners. He has 22 children, 3 of whom are in college in the United States.
"He makes more money than the country is making," Mr. Oakley said.
When the civil war broke out in Somalia in 1991, Osman Ato allied himself with Mr. Aidid and financed his militias. They are both members of the Hawiye clan and its Habr Gedir sub clan.
Mr. Oakley remembers a night in June 1993 when a truck piled high with weapons was smuggled out of Osman Ato's compound just days before his garage was bombed. When United Nations troops dug up the huge sand berms blocking roads near Osman Ato's garage, they found weapons caches. In a recent interview, Osman Ato said his garages were back in business making technicals.
Late last year, his car drove over a land mine in western Somalia and the explosion broke both his feet. He said he was only visiting the area; American diplomats said he was organizing a weapons transaction near the Ethiopian border.
Osman Ato said that when he was imprisoned by the American military, he was handcuffed and blindfolded for long periods of time. American diplomats deny it. But Mr. Oakley said Osman Ato's health had so deteriorated because of neglect and malnutrition that he had to be transferred to a hospital in Baidoa.
He knows how to play the chess game of Somali politics -- when to bluff, when to bargain, when to play innocent, when to ignore and when to fight. In 1993, the day before the Americans bombed his garage and with tension and anti-American hatred building in Mogadishu, he invited a reporter for tea at his house, just down the street from his garage.
The blinds were drawn against the scorching sun as he calmly sipped his cardamom-flavored tea and watched CNN. He did not talk about politics, but about the CNN program on cholesterol that he was watching.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Journal;
Japanese-Style Booths Put Police at the Center of the Action

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, July 28

 BODY:
The little booth sits just off a downtown intersection that once stood at the retail heart of the city, with large department stores, movie theaters and fashionable restaurants. In recent years, with one street a pedestrian mall and the other reserved for buses and commuter trains, the neighborhood has become a collection of specialty shops and stores for the budget-conscious.
But as the neighborhood struggles to stay vibrant without the tourist appeal of other downtown attractions like Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Harbor Place mall, few buildings seem to be as vital to the area's well-being as the small booth. It is known as a koban, a police substation modeled and named after similar buildings used in Japan as part of that country's law-enforcement policy of stationing officers among the people they protect. 
 Baltimore's Howard Street koban (pronounced: koh-bahn), an air-conditioned booth with bullet-proof glass large enough to accommodate two people, was opened in May at a cost of $150,000. Since then, officers assigned to the 10-by-10-foot koban say crimes that were common to the area, like purse snatchings, shoplifting, assaults and robberies, have sharply declined.
And that is in keeping with trends in other cities where the police are using kobans and other Japanese crime-control measures. A report to be published this fall by the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation, a private organization that seeks solutions to urban problems, concludes that crime in those city neighborhoods dropped by as much as 35 percent.
"They're a novel way of bringing police officers closer to the community," said Alfred Dean, an executive with the Police Foundation, a group that studies policing techniques. "With police departments under the gun to control crime and being forced to do more with less, they're using more nontraditional methods. They're recognizing that the old methods are ineffective."
But as more cities turn to innovative ideas for policing, kobans are gaining in popularity not only as a crime deterrent. They are also proving valuable to groups leading drives for economic redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization.
"We're looking for the police to play a role in the total neighborhood redevelopment," said Lynn A. Curtis, president of the Eisenhower Foundation, which introduced city police chiefs to kobans on a trip to Japan in 1988. "We then try to mesh the kobans with the work of community development corporations."
Among the first cities to use a koban were Philadelphia and San Juan, P.R., after officials made the 1988 trip. In Japan, most city neighborhoods are served by kobans of various sizes rather than precinct stations, and the police work closely with residents, visiting each house at least once a year. Some Japanese officers assigned to larger kobans live in them with their families.
The structures contribute to the fact that Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, some law-enforcement experts say.
The Eisenhower Foundation, a Washington-based group named for the brother of the former President, found that Japan's community policing techniques work in the United States. Its fall report concludes that the rate of reported crime in a residential neighborhood of San Juan, where officers worked with residents from a koban, fell by 35 percent from 1989 to 1993. Similar efforts in a retail section of Philadelphia north of downtown helped drive down the rate of reported crime by 24 percent from 1991 to 1993.
Successes were also reported in high-crime neighborhoods in Boston and Chicago, which used other Japanese methods, including having officers serve as mentors and counselors to troubled teen-agers. The police said reported crime in the neighborhoods declined by 27 percent in Boston and 22 percent in Chicago.
A more recent foundation-sponsored trip to Japan included officials from Baltimore, Little Rock, Ark., Los Angeles, Newark and Columbia, S.C.
Here in Baltimore, city officials have not yet linked koban officers and local community groups. But the mere presence of the structure seems to be deterring crime and easing tensions on the streets.
"It's so visible, and visibility is the key," said Gary Austin, manager of the Pick 'n' Pay shoe store just beyond the koban. "It has helped deter shoplifting and has cut down on some of the loitering."
The police department has not yet compiled crime statistics for the area. But Officer Dwight P. Thomas, whose workday includes sitting in the koban and walking the streets, said that only rarely had he come across criminal activity, from either watching through the window of the koban or patrolling.
In several months, the department plans to install surveillance cameras around the neighborhood to allow the koban officer to monitor a wider area. The city is also studying the idea of placing other kobans in highly populated neighborhoods.
"People down here love it," Officer Thomas said. "They say it's good to see you out here, and teen-agers don't congregate the way they used to, standing on street corners."
Many local merchants said that they believed the koban concept had made the area safer. But few people sounded more appreciative of the police presence than John Mathew Smith, a 36-year-old photographer.
Waiting for a bus near the koban recently, Mr. Smith was approached by a panhandler who asked for 50 cents. When Mr. Smith refused, the man punched him in the nose.
"I saw the whole thing," said Mr. Thomas, who was sitting in the koban at time. He dashed out and arrested the man on assault charges.

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT'S MOBILIZATION: THE CUSTOMERS;
Computer Users Told To Go Slow in Change Of Operating Systems

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
When it finally goes on sale on Aug. 24, Microsoft's Windows 95 will be better, faster and easier to use than any previous version of the software. So why is Brian Mott, a computer consultant to small and large companies, telling his clients not to buy?
Wait till next year, Mr. Mott advises. 
 "There aren't too many reasons to change right now," said Mr. Mott, who is based in Larkspur, Calif. "And there are too many things we don't know."
For Mr. Mott's clients, some of whom have hundreds of PC's, changing to the new operating system would be disruptive and expensive, and fraught with the minor technical glitches common in the first iteration of any software.
And he is not alone. While many businesses will begin the transition to Windows 95 immediately, many others will adopt Mr. Mott's wait-and-see stance, as they do when any significant new software program is introduced. Despite all the advance billing -- and the extensive field-testing by 400,000 volunteer users -- Windows 95 appears to be no exception.
"It would be a natural evolution of our existing system, but we're taking a cautious approach," said Annie Reutinger, a spokeswoman for the the McKesson Corporation. McKesson, in San Francisco, is the nation's largest distributor of pharmaceuticals and health-care products with 11,000 employees worldwide; it has 5,000 PC's that use Windows. "It'll take at least six months and a lot of research."
But even if corporate America takes its time, most analysts agree that just about every company running Windows today will make the transition to Windows 95 eventually. The question is how quickly and at what cost.
As software goes, Windows 95 is cheap at about $100. But for many people, the actual cost will be several times that amount, because they will need or want a faster microprocessor, more memory and a bigger hard disk to accommodate Windows 95's 11 million lines of programming code (Windows 3.1 has 3 million lines of code.) And to take full advantage of Windows 95's features, they will need new versions of word processors, spreadsheets and so on at a cost of anywhere from $50 to several hundred dollars apiece.
Kent D. Bentkowski, a Windows user who runs a graphics company called Perfik Graphix in Angola, N.Y., figures he will have invested $1,200 to $1,500 preparing his system for Windows 95.
In fact, Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a market researcher, says that fewer than 40 percent of the PC's currently in use in homes or businesses meet the technical requirements for Windows 95. The vast majority of existing computers have neither the memory nor the computing power. (A quarter of the people who rely on Microsoft software have yet to move to Windows at all and are still running MS-DOS, the company's original PC operating system.)
Microsoft's official position is that Windows 95 will run on machines with as little as 4 megabytes of memory, but people who have tested the software report that under those conditions performance is unacceptable for anything but the most rudimentary tasks.
Microsoft recommends that people have at least 8 megabytes on their machine, which is standard on most new computers; most early reviews in the trade press recommend 16 megabytes. That addition alone would cost about $350 retail.
The new operating system also hogs microprocessor power. Adequate performance requires at least a 486 chip made by the Intel Corporation and a couple of small competitors; optimal performance requires one of Intel's faster Pentium chips.
The computer's storage requirement has also climbed with Windows 95. Simply loading the software onto the machine requires about 35 megabytes of hard-disk space, depending on the features chosen, compared with the 10 megabytes needed by the version of Windows it is replacing, Windows 3.1. And the applications software takes up a lot more hard-disk space, too. The Windows 95 version of Microsoft Office, an assortment of business computing programs like the Word word-processing program and the Excel spreadsheet, takes up 89 megabytes -- 20 more than the Windows 3.1 version of Office.
In short, if millions of computer users want to start using Windows 95 and enjoying its benefits, they will have to buy additional hardware and software and "upgrade kits," creating a potential sales boom for makers of all those products. By the end of next year, Infocorp predicts, more than 60 percent of the PC's in use will have the horsepower to run Windows 95.
But before all those upgrades, the bulk of Windows 95 sales will be as the operating system software that will come installed on new computers. Many of those early sales are expected to be to home computer users, the market's fastest-growing segment.
"The person who will have the easiest time with this will be the home user who buys it pre-installed," said David Coursey, editor of PC Letter, an industry newsletter published in San Mateo, Calif.
For corporations, shifting to Windows 95 will be daunting. In addition to the hardware and software, they face the substantial cost of training people to use the new software and employee downtime as they learn.
"Here you have a system that is infinitely more complex," Mr. Coursey said. "There are just lots of things that add up to hours and hours." For starters, Windows 95 takes an entirely different approach to networking than version 3.1.
But even if corporate sales of Windows 95 start off slowly, analysts say, it is only a matter of time until managers come around rather than risk being left behind. The expectation is that in a year or two, the most sophisticated desktop business software will probably require Windows 95.
"I don't know any company that's not going to move to it," said William Cornfield, president of the Windows Support Group, a software consulting firm in New York whose clients include the National Football League, AT&T and General Electric. "It's just a question of timing."

HEADLINE: In America;
Out Of Work

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
A very small group of people at a church in Greenwich Village is attempting to seriously engage the most devastating issue of our time -- the wholesale elimination of employment.
Jeremy Rifkin titled his book on this frightening phenomenon "The End of Work." 
 Peter Laarman, the senior minister at Judson Memorial Church, calls it "the triumph of profits over people."
Judson Memorial is on the southern edge of Washington Square Park. Its congregants are mostly middle class, and thus increasingly vulnerable to the threat of joblessness that has spread anxiety across the country. What Mr. Laarman learned, soon after coming to the church in early 1994, was that the men and women who were losing their jobs often were too upset, and too ashamed, to even talk about it.
Talented, successful and mostly middle-aged, they were not prepared to cope with the hardships of unemployment that have always bedeviled the working classes and the poor.
"Losing my job," said Susan Boyer, who agreed only reluctantly to speak on the record about her experience, "felt just like it felt the time I got mugged. The awful feeling in the gut was exactly the same. There I was in this nice high-tech job, and then I got downsized. I felt, 'This can't be happening to me.' "
Mr. Laarman decided it would help if the church could provide a "safe place" in which people could "speak about their frustration and their anxiety related to the workplace." That modest effort grew, and eventually the church became the headquarters for the Employment Project, an ambitious attempt, still in its earliest stages, to get the religious community across the country more actively involved in the jobs crisis.
Mr. Laarman and the Rev. Paul Chapman, director of the Employment Project, are trying, among other things, to get the clergy to pay more attention to the pernicious combination of radical corporate downsizing and the flight of government from its responsibility to help people in need.
This combination is likely to insure that as times get tougher, more and more people will be left completely to their own devices.
"This is a moral crisis as well as an economic turning point," said Mr. Laarman. "My hope is that in various ways, partly by means of this project, the churches and synagogues and mosques will assume a degree of responsibility for leadership."
Mr. Laarman acknowledged that some religious organizations are already involved in the struggle against joblessness. But he believes that the clergy, for the most part, has not fulfilled its responsibility to counsel, support and fight on behalf of the millions of Americans for whom decent jobs are a thing of the past.
While the people at the top of the economic pyramid are accumulating unimaginable riches, enormous numbers of workers of all ages and in most economic categories are being discarded like so much rubbish. They are no longer needed. Often they are treated as if they are no longer human.
"Who would have thought it would come to this?" said David Johnson, a Judson Memorial member who twice was thrown out of work. He noted that the unemployed men and women who joined the discussion group at the church had many years of experience and "real technical expertise."
"We were as marketable as you could be," he said. "And yet, there we were -- on the outs, looking in."
The cold truth is that tens of millions of hard-working (or potentially hard-working) men and women have no real economic future in a system that is thoroughly dominated by a ruthless corporate elite and the politicians who do their bidding. As we close in on the 21st century, the ferocious parlay of technological advances, cheap foreign labor and corporate greed is being allowed to lay waste to the American dream.
We are allowing this to happen with little more than a whimper of protest.
Mr. Laarman and Mr. Chapman believe the religious community can and should serve as a crucial resource for workers abandoned by the business community, and increasingly by government as well.
"The loss of jobs is an awfully big issue and one that many people want to hide from," said Mr. Chapman. "But it needs to be faced."

HEADLINE: Governors Try To Find Unity On Medicaid

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., July 30

 BODY:
While welfare preoccupies Washington, the nation's governors are more worried about what cuts and changes Congress will make in Medicaid, and are searching at their annual summer meeting for a common position on how to alter the health care program for the poor.
Medicaid costs the states six times as much as welfare. So while many governors are reconciled to what Democrats call "cuts" and Republicans call "slower growth" in Federal Medicaid spending, they are arguing intensely about formulas for distributing the money to the states and the need to reduce Federal directives on how it gets spent. 
 While President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, plan to offer competing welfare plans when they speak on Monday at the National Governors' Association's 87th summer meeting here, the governors are focused on the Medicaid fight, which is likely to come to a head on Capitol Hill in late September.
A consensus among the governors, if one can be reached, would make it considerably easier for Congress to decide how Medicaid money should be divided among the states.
Today, much of the talk at the public meetings, in the corridors and in news conferences and interviews was about Medicaid and the governors' fears that Congress will cut their money without reducing the number of ways they are told to spend it.
Governor Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who heads the governors' group, said at a news conference today that the governors' greatest fear was that by the time Congress finished, "We get all the old rules and less money."
Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio, a Republican, said, "We could end up having our money cut and having no flexibility."
In addition to cuts in the growth of spending under the program, Republicans who control Congress have proposed changing the individual Federal Medicaid reimbursements for a system of lump-sum annual payments to states, known as block grants.
The Republican Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, said in an interview that he and other governors from Sun Belt states were worried that any block-grant program, by limiting the amount of money to the states, would not take account of their needs caused by rapid population growth.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee, told the association's first formal meeting today, "We didn't know the formula would be hard to put together." But he asked for help, saying "Get your act together, Democrats and Republicans."
Republicans, who hold the governorship in 30 states, including most of the largest ones, have been trying to agree among themselves about a Medicaid formula before trying to enlist Democratic allies. They met Saturday and again this morning. But their efforts are making only slow progress, said Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, who heads the Republican Governors Association.
"This stuff is still in midair," said another Republican, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.
But Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, the Wisconsin Republican who is about to succeed Mr. Dean as head of the national group, said that the governors were running out of time and that it was essential for both parties to agree because "we need a broad bipartisan coalition." The Medicaid issues were discussed, inconclusively, when the 40 or so governors here met in private after hearing Senator Domenici.
Democratic governors, while eager for fewer restrictions, remain skeptical about block grants and opposed to any diminished Federal commitment to Medicaid. Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana said he feared the block-grant approach. In a national recession that increased the need for Medicaid, he said, an unchanging Federal contribution would force states to turn away the needy or cut other spending, such as for education.
Another Democrat, Gov. Mike Lowry of Washington, insisted that "the cuts are going to be much deeper than the way they are described." He said that by cutting Medicaid more deeply than Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, Republicans were "attacking those who are less able to defend themselves."
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado told his Democratic colleagues that he thought it was important that states be required to keep spending at least as much as they do now, rather than take advantage of unconditional block grants to save money for other purposes.
Senator Domenici told the governors their complaints sounded like they were saying, "Don't put too much burden on us on Medicaid but we sure would like less strings."
But Mr. Domenici agreed that in general, fewer restrictions and Federal directives were desirable. Still, he asked, "You do expect to be challenged to use it only for the poor, not for highways, don't you?"
The budget resolution adopted by both houses of Congress calls for a reduction in the rate of growth of Federal Medicaid spending, now going up about 7 percent a year, to only 4 percent a year by 1998. That would save the Federal Government $182 billion over seven years. States now pay about half the costs of Medicaid, which amounts to about 20 percent of all state spending.
The larger Medicare program would be slowed to an 8 percent annual increase. That would save $270 billion. Together, these proposed entitlement cuts are essential components of the Republican effort to balance the budget by 2002.
Creating a system of block grants to replace the main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which consumes about 3 percent of state spending, has produced a similar dispute about the proper distribution formula. But Mr. Dole has pleased many governors here with a proposal that no state get less than it does now, and that some states with fast-growing rolls get extra. Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, said at today's meeting that he hoped that approach could be followed on Medicaid.
For some governors like George E. Pataki of New York, that would not be enough. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said in an interview, "Protecting the base in and of itself is not adequate." He said a state like his faced higher costs and some health problems, such as AIDS, that other states did not.
But, Mr. Pataki warned, "a fight over the formula" might hinder the governors' ability to get a block-grant program at all. Therefore, he said, there was a "very real political need to find common ground."
Many Democrats want to continue Medicaid as an individual entitlement, and President Clinton has proposed keeping it that way, but capping per-person spending with limits on annual increases. His proposal would save only $54 billion over seven years.
There is near unanimity in favor of fewer restrictions. A favorite target is an amendment to the Social Security Act that governors contend requires them to pay too much to nursing homes that serve the impoverished elderly.
Governor Bush argued today that there should not be Federal mandates on spending. "I wouldn't mind broad guidelines," he said, such as requiring the states not to use the money for the National Guard.

HEADLINE: To Help Keep Mexico Stable, U.S. Soft-Pedaled Drug War

SERIES: The New Drug Lords: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 30

 BODY:
Soon after becoming President at the end of 1988, Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent his new drug-enforcement chief to help rescue Mexico's troubled relationship with the United States.
The official, Javier Coello Trejo, quickly formed a 1,200-member task force, seized tons of drugs and put the most-wanted cocaine smuggler in Mexico behind bars. He brought the Government within reach of its broader goal, sufficiently impressing American officials with Mr. Salinas's resolve to dislodge the drug issue as an obstacle to closer ties between the countries. 
 But six years and much American praise later, law-enforcement officials say that Mexico's traffickers have grown more powerful and that their protection in the security forces remains widespread. Mr. Coello, removed from his post in 1990, was merely the first in a new series of Mexican officials to promise a tougher fight against the traffickers and then be accused of taking their bribes.
While the United States' influence in Mexico has risen steadily in recent years, interviews with dozens of current and former officials and a series of American government documents indicate that Washington has treated Mexico's drug problem as a special case.
Concerned for Mexican stability and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, officials said, the United States often exaggerated the Mexican Government's progress in the fight against drugs, playing down corruption and glossing over failures.
Just as American pressure helped to force the Colombian Government's recent crackdown against the Cali cartel, many of these officials said, the United States might have done much more to block the rise of a new generation of Mexican drug lords.
Major Mexican traffickers were sometimes captured and let go without a public word from American diplomats, the officials said. Slow movement by the Mexican Government to stop the laundering of drug profits was accepted almost patiently. Rather than push for the prosecution of the drug-related corruption, they added, American officials usually wrote off such episodes as unavoidable bumps in a long, bumpy road. Washington's approach was in part a result of misplaced trust, bureaucratic infighting and an abiding fear that Mexican leaders would react to perceived meddling in their affairs by curbing American drug enforcement here, officials said.
Above all, though, American officials said they were kept in check by the desire of the Clinton and Bush Administrations to keep problems of drugs and corruption from jeopardizing the trade accord and the new economic partnership it symbolized.
"People desperately wanted drugs not to become a complicating factor for Nafta," said John P. Walters, a senior official for international drug policy in the Bush White House. "There was a degree of illicit activity that was just accepted."
Some American officials argue that the approach was justified by the greater role that the trade accord has given the United States in Mexico's future. Others say that to have applied greater diplomatic pressure on a problem that is rooted fundamentally in Americans' demand for illegal drugs would have endangered the two countries' improving relationship.
Mr. Salinas's successor, Ernesto Zedillo, has made reform of the legal system a central goal for his six-year term, which began in December. During a surge of Congressional attention to the drug issue as Mexico sought billions of dollars in foreign loans last winter, Mr. Zedillo also agreed privately to a handful of new counternarcotics measures sought by the United States.
Some American drug-enforcement officials now say they have never worked more closely with their Mexican counterparts. But even so, many of the United States officials who deal most closely with the drug issue are pessimistic about Washington's focus and Mexico's future.
"Billions of dollars are flooding into Mexico, and it's going to corrupt everything, and that's not even popping up on peoples' radar screens," said a senior counternarcotics official in Washington. "We spend more time talking about Rwanda."
 
Salinas's Start
Despite Gains, Dark Figures Lurk
By comparison, more experienced officials recall, Mr. Salinas's start was even more impressive.
Eager to renegotiate a $100 billion foreign debt and warned by American officials that stronger ties would require stronger Mexican efforts to stop drugs, Mr. Salinas turned to Mr. Coello, a tough-talking former aide to one of the more feared military governors of southern Chiapas state.
As Mexico's first assistant attorney general for drug enforcement, Mr. Coello called on the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Mexico City, Edward Heath, and they began planning the capture of Mexico's two most notorious traffickers.
One of Mr. Coello's teams was to hunt for Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, then the reputed godfather of Mexican cocaine trafficking and a fugitive in the slaying four years earlier in Guadalajara of an American drug-enforcement agent, Enrique S. Camarena. Another was to go after Manuel Salcido, a particularly violent Felix Gallardo associate known as El Cochiloco, or the Mad Pig.
It took Mr. Coello's agents barely four months to bring in Mr. Felix Gallardo and raise drug seizures sharply. With the United States Congress debating Mexico's cooperation in anti-drug efforts, Mr. Heath told reporters that "President Salinas de Gortari means business."
Despite the optimism generated in Washington by the notion that young, honest technocrats had taken power in Mexico City, former Bush Administration officials now say they remained concerned about Mr. Salinas's dependence on some of the darker characters of the old regime.
Mr. Salinas's first Attorney General had been Governor of western Jalisco state when Mr. Camarena was kidnapped there by traffickers and state policemen. His Education Minister, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, had been implicated in the case while serving as Interior Minister.
Former officials said the Justice Department at one point considered trying to indict Mr. Bartlett in connection with the murder. But some officials questioned the evidence, which came from wiretaps, confidential informants and two former drug traffickers. Others said any action against Mr. Bartlett could destabilize the Salinas Government. It was also noted, former officials said, that in his previous job, Mr. Bartlett had helped United States intelligence agencies on matters ranging from the activities of leftist groups in Central America to the local operations of the Soviet and Cuban intelligence agencies.
What may have taken some pressure off the Salinas Government was the Medellin Cartel.
With Colombia racked by the terrorism of its cocaine traffickers, Bolivia struggling with its coca growers and Peru threatened by both drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas, the Bush Administration's drug policy had centered on the Andes from the start. Compared with the $2.2 billion it sought for drug programs there, its investment in Mexico was minimal.
"Mexico was an afterthought," one of the senior officials in charge of the strategy said. "We thought that if we could crush the problem in the Andes and reduce demand here, the corruption problem in Mexico would go down as the transit of drugs went down."
According to officials and drug-policy documents released under the Freedom of Information Act to the National Security Archive, a private research group, the goals of American efforts in Mexico were comparatively mundane: to work more closely with Mexican officials, to establish an operation to track drug-smuggling flights across Mexico and to provide helicopters to ferry Mexican police on drug operations.
The tracking operation was seen as a particular success. But in the long list of goals, several American officials complained that more basic aims like arresting big traffickers and cracking down on corrupt officials often seemed to get lost.
"We all kind of got seduced by certain things that Salinas appeared to be doing," a former Pentagon official said. "Their willingness to take helicopters from us -- it was amazing how their acceptance of this was taken as proof that they were taking the drug threat seriously."
 
Arrests
Some Traffickers Were Shielded
Though Mr. Felix Gallardo was captured in 1989, few other kingpins followed him to jail.
Among the more notable drug figures arrested during the next three years was a lieutenant to the Gulf-coast trafficker Juan Garcia Abrego, who was later charged in Texas with paying some $25 million to bribe high-ranking Mexican officials. Testifying in a separate case last year, another aide to Mr. Garcia Abrego said some of the money had gone to Mr. Coello, the drug-enforcement chief.
Despite accusations of human rights abuses against Mr. Coello and his agents, a classified cablegram to Washington from the United States Ambassador to Mexico, John D. Negroponte, reported that he left office in late 1990 "with an excellent record." Other officials said they saw Mr. Coello as part of a pattern in which Mexican commanders would strike at some traffickers while staying away from others who had presumably bought their protection.
Mr. Garcia Abrego seemed to go especially neglected, officials said. Mr. Salcido was finally killed in 1991, and his death exposed an embarrassing disguise: He had been living on a luxurious ranch in the western state of Colima, breeding horses and entertaining his friend the Governor.
In a report to Congress on Mexico's drug efforts in March 1991, the State Department asserted, "All but two of the major drug traffickers in Mexico have been jailed."
Several officials based in Mexico at the time said that no matter how old the list of traffickers from which the report's authors might have been working, the idea was absurd. Mexican and American officials also acknowledged that at least half a dozen top-level traffickers, including the man now considered Mexico's most powerful cocaine smuggler, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, were arrested during the Salinas Government and quietly freed by corrupt judges or the police.
In the case of Mr. Felix Gallardo, for three years after his arrest in 1989, the "godfather" and his associates were allowed cellular telephones and fax machines to run their smuggling operations from a well-appointed suite cells in a Mexico City jail.
 
Revolving Door
Corrupt Officials Merely Retired
While the system of drug corruption largely persisted under Mr. Salinas, its faces often changed. And with each reshuffling, government documents suggest, American hopes were revived.
When Mr. Coello was replaced at the Attorney General's office by a retired army general, Jorge Carrillo Olea, a State Department report predicted that the move "should improve cooperation" between the Mexican military and federal drug agents under the Attorney General.
But soon after the report appeared, American officials found themselves in the midst of one of the more serious drug incidents of the Salinas administration when army soldiers killed seven federal drug agents who had chased a planeload of drugs to a remote airstrip in the eastern state of Veracruz.
A videotape shot by United States Customs pilots who followed the agents to the scene appeared to show that the soldiers had been protecting the shipment. Autopsy reports showed that some of the agents had been shot dead at point-blank range.
Yet even when the Mexican Government initially tried to cover up the episode, American diplomats bent over backwards to avoid contradicting it, motivated by what one former official called concern for "the bigger picture."
In declassified notes from a closed Congressional briefing, one senior State Department official said the incident exposed the dangers of using "fixed-wing aircraft" instead of helicopters in the drug fight. Ambassador Negroponte called the shootings "a regrettable accident."
Other American officials eventually leaked the true story.
As the political fight over the free trade agreement grew more intense in Washington, the weight of "the bigger picture" on drug controversies grew heavier, many current and former officials said.
"Once Bush and Salinas decided to go with Nafta as the No. 1 goal, then everything else had to be made manageable," said a United States official who dealt extensively with the Mexicans. "On the issue of high-level officials being involved in drugs, we said, 'Carlos, as long as we are getting results, we are not going to micromanage.' "
Some former officials said they had argued that Mr. Salinas's pursuit of the trade pact gave the United States a unique opportunity to press Mexico for stronger measures on corruption and drugs, as it ultimately did on labor and the environment.
"They said we could not make drugs part of the debate," the former Customs Commissioner, Carol B. Hallett, recalled, referring to other senior Bush Administration officials. "I think it was a terrible mistake not to tie the two together."
Some officials question whether a more drastic American stance might have had the desired effect. "Say you got them to remove a few corrupt officials," said a former National Security Council official, "then other ones come in?"
But by a similar logic, other officials argued, the persistence of corruption in the Mexican police and military undermined drug-enforcement efforts to the point of almost making them futile. Operations based on D.E.A. intelligence were so often compromised by corrupt Mexican officials, officials said, that D.E.A. agents refused to work with many federal police commanders.
Mr. Salinas's attorneys general said hundreds of Mexican police agents were dismissed for suspected corruption. The attorneys general themselves were replaced four times in six years. Criminal prosecutions were so rare, however, that some American officials came to view the policy as simply a different form of impunity.
"The strategy was to retire people rather than prosecute them, and we told the Mexicans that that concerned us," said William J. Olson, a former senior State Department counternarcotics official. "They would say, 'Give us information that we can use.' But we were very concerned about compromising our sources and methods by turning over solid intelligence information."
 
New President
Rising Hopes And Some Doubts
Clinton Administration officials said they hoped that they had turned an important page on the drug problem in Mexico when Mr. Zedillo was inaugurated as President on Dec. 1.
In a highly unusual action shortly before the inauguration, officials said the American Ambassador, James R. Jones, presented the new Government with a list of about 15 active and former Mexican officials whom the United States suspected of corruption and hoped not to see in the new administration. An American official said none of those on the list joined the new Government.
Still, American officials who interpreted the Zedillo response to the list as a sign of new times might consult Glenn W. MacTaggart, a Federal prosecutor in San Antonio who wrote to Mexican officials this year requesting the removal of the Mexican Attorney General's attache there.
According to a copy of the confidential letter given to a reporter by a Mexican official, Mr. MacTaggart said the attache had socialized with a suspected drug trafficker, withheld information about the sighting of a political-murder suspect and apparently tried to block the extradition of a Mexican lawyer charged with paying off judges to free the convicted rapist of a young girl.
The attache's conduct, Mr. MacTaggart wrote, "has raised serious security concerns and precludes our willingness to conduct business with him on future law-enforcement matters in this district."
The attache was eventually transferred to Guatemala. But even then, the Zedillo Government would not acknowledge that he had done anything wrong.
A senior Mexican official dismissed Mr. MacTaggart's concerns as the product of unspecified "personal differences" that he said the prosecutor had had with the attache. The attache, who has never denied the accusations, could not be reached. Mr. MacTaggart declined to comment on the incident, except to say, "The letter pretty well speaks for itself."

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT'S MOBILIZATION: OVERVIEW;
Windows of Opportunity for Microsoft

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
REDMOND, Wash.
The Microspft Corporation plans to begin selling its 272d software title on Aug. 24.
But it is clear that Windows, 95, the latest version of the software that runs some 100 million of the world's personal computers, is much more than just another new product.
Windows 95 is a sign of the times, already creating a stir in markets worldwide, in Washington and on Wall Street, an indication of the inroads the personal comptuer has made into contemporary commerce and culture.
A video producer is churning out five million copies of a Windows 95 tape, convinced that sales of an instructional video on a software program will dwarf those of past best sellers, like the Cindy Crawford workout tapes.
The test versions of the software that Microsoft has been circulating for months have received microscopic scrutiny, not only for technical flaws but even for political slights. One version had a map with a misdrawn Latin American border, bringing fiery protest from Peru, which is in a border dispute with Ecuador.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department is racing to decide whether to stop Microsoft from using Windows 95 as a springboard for the company's new on-line service.
And the surge in stock prices this year has been led by technology companies, partly in anticipation of increased sales of computer hardware and software that analysts expect in the wake of the Windows 95 introduction on Aug. 24. Should sales of the new Microsoft program lag behind expectations, the stock market may well tumble.
The fascination, hype and controversy surrounding Windows 95 stems largely from the fact that PC's are now ubiquitous in the workplace and are fast becoming a mainstream consumer product. The $85- billion-a-year personal computer industry is recognized as a pillar of the American economy. And as a gateway to the Internet, cyberspace and multimedia, the personal computer affects everything from how people communicate with each other to how children are educated.
Even Brad Chase, the 34-year-old architect of Microsoft's marketing strategy for Windows 95, says he is amazed by all the attention the product has received. And he readily admits that the phenomenon is only partly explained by the big-budget marketing campaign he has led for the last year from Microsoft's pine-covered corporate campus here, outside Seattle.
"The breadth of interest in Windows 95 is because of all these things, from the Internet to the Justice Department investigation, coming together, all these stars getting into line at once," Mr. Chase said. "Windows 95 is a lot more than software."
And how is a single software program linked to all these larger trends and events? Simply put, because Windows 95 is a new operating system and because it is Microsoft's. An operating system controls the on-screen look of a personal computer and the keyboard-and-mouse steps required to use it, and more than 80 percent of all PC's use Microsoft's operating software. So when Microsoft overhauls its operating program, it is changing the language of personal computing.
Windows 95, by all accounts, is the most significant change Microsoft has made in its operating program since 1990. That was the year the company introduced its first Windows system, which borrowed an approach from Apple Computer's Macintosh by enabling a user to point and click on graphical icons instead of typing arcane commands.
Since then, Microsoft has improved Windows, notably with its Windows 3.1 version in 1992. But Windows 95 is an entirely new operating system built with 11 million lines of programming code, compared with 3 million lines for Windows 3.1.
All operating systems have their irritating quirks and shortcomings, and Windows 95, priced at less than $100, is no exception. Some existing programs do not yet run smoothly on Windows 95, and it requires more computer hard-disk space and memory to use than the previous generation of Windows. But analysts agree that Windows 95 represents a big step forward in making computers less confusing for someone writing a report, browsing the Internet or installing a new printer.
Technology purists point out that some of the new features of Microsoft's new system, like being able to have lengthy file names instead of the eight-character limit of Windows 3.1, are advantages that rival operating systems -- the Apple Macintosh and I.B.M.'s OS/2 -- have had for years. Yet even with a technical edge, Microsoft's competitors have not been able to challenge the company's dominance of the operating system market, which it attained shortly after I.B.M. chose Microsoft's Disk Operating System for the I.B.M. PC in 1980.
By now, in the PC operating system market, Microsoft has no genuine rival. The company's extraordinary marketing campaign, with an estimated budget of $150 million, is intended less to fend off competition than to move computer companies and users -- quickly -- to the new industry standard, Windows 95.
"For Microsoft, the marketing campaign is essentially a $150 million insurance policy to make sure that nothing happens to prevent Windows 95 from becoming by far the most successful product in the history of the business," said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
If Microsoft makes Windows 95 a success, it will have plenty of help from the rest of the personal computer industry. Dataquest, a market research firm, estimates that in addition to Microsoft's $150 million, other hardware and software companies, retailers and distributors will spend $350 million this year to market Windows 95 and their own Windows 95-related products.
Other software makers, in particular, tend to have a hate-you/need-you relationship with Microsoft. As the dominant producer, Microsoft makes not only operating software but also applications like word processing programs, data bases, spreadsheets, educational software and games. So it is the chief rival of most applications-software companies in the industry.
But because the software makers' products run on the Microsoft operating system, they have been rushing to develop products for the new Windows 95 platform.
A successful rollout of Windows 95 in the early months is vital to Microsoft, both to its corporate pride and its profits. Analysts' sales estimates vary considerably for the last four months of 1995, following the Aug. 24 debut. At the high end, Dataquest is forecasting sales of 29 million copies this year. International Data Corporation, another research firm, predicts 20 million. Another firm, Inteco, estimates it will be only 14 million.
At roughly $50 in revenue to Microsoft for each copy sold, the difference between a torrid and a not-so-fast rollout could make a striking difference in near-term revenues and profits. Selling 29 million copies this year means roughly $1.45 billion in revenue to Microsoft, while 14 million copies would be $700 million.
Responsibility for seeing that the Windows 95 marketing goes quickly and smoothly rests largely on the shoulders of Mr. Chase, the general manager of Microsoft's personal systems division, and seven group product managers. They are all men in their early 30's -- seasoned veterans by Microsoft standards. They are mainly M.B.A.'s from places like Wharton, Harvard and Northwestern. Most started in other fields, then recognized that technology was the future, and headed to Redmond.
Mr. Chase wrote the marketing blueprint one night, shortly before a March 1994 meeting with Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. It sketched out what Mr. Chase called the "E-strategy" for Educate, Excite and Engage, and it explained that the personal computer market has broadened so much since the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992, nearly tenfold, that an entirely different approach was needed this time.
And different it has been. The company has distributed 400,000 beta, or test, copies of Windows 95, many of them to corporate users licensed to put the software on more than one PC. By Aug. 24, an estimated million people will have used Windows 95 for nearly 75 million hours. This means that even before it officially hits the market, Windows 95 will have received more use than all but a few of the most successful software products receive in their entire several-year product cycles.
For more than a year, Microsoft has been bringing software developers, PC makers, corporate customers and members of the computer press to Redmond for briefing and cajoling. The company presented demonstrations to 50,000 individual customers during a 23-city, three-month tour of the United States..
Microsoft sent the finished code for Windows 95 to factories on July 14. And the company has revved up seven times its normal production capacity, contracting with 12 plants and engaging a fleet of 500 trucks, to insure that the new product will be at 20,000 retail outlets, from CompUSA to Wal-Mart, on Aug. 24. Consumers are expected to move quickly to Windows 95, particularly since it will be preloaded on the machines produced for the Christmas season by manufacturers like Compaq, Packard Bell, Gateway and Dell.
But corporate customers traditionally wait six to nine months to buy new operating systems, allowing the early programming bugs to be eliminated. To try to get companies to move quickly this time, Microsoft and distributors have offered large customers hundreds of free copies as an incentive to buy others. Companies that have agreed to deploy Windows 95 on many desktops by Aug. 24 include Ford, Dow Chemical, Sprint and Deloitte Touche.
Yet it seems doubtful how quickly even the Microsoft marketing arsenal can prompt companies to move to Windows 95. Surveys show most companies would wait until next year to make the transition.
"There's no question about it," Mr. Chase said, "inertia is our biggest competitor."
