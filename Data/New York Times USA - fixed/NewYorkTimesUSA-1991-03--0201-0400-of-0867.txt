HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Treasury Prices Soar

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds soared yesterday on expectations that Washington would report a sharp rise in unemployment this morning. If so, it would benefit investors in fixed-income securities because it would lessen the demand for loans, ease inflation pressures and possibly prompt the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates.
Any decline in interest rates would enhance the value of bonds outstanding and other fixed-income securities. As it was, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue due February 2021, were offered late in the session at 96 8/32, up 18/32 on the day. This caused the issue's yield to drop to 8.21 percent, from 8.27 percent the day before. 
 Gains were more modest among shorter Treasury coupon issues. The 6.75 percent notes of 1993, for example, rose 2/32, to 99 12/32, for a yield of 7.09 percent; the 7.5's of 1996 gained 7/32, at 99 5/32, to yield 7.70 percent; the long notes, the 7.75's of 2001, climbed 12/32, to 98, while the yield fell to 8.04 percent, from 8.10 percent the day before.
 
Covering Short Positions
 Some dealers said demand for the long bond came after the Chicago bond futures market closed. Although the Chicago futures represent 20-year Treasury bonds, and not the 30-year issue traded in the cash market, it is customary for those caught in unprofitable positions in Chicago to cover them in the cash market. In yesterday's case, some of those who had sold bond futures short moved to cover their positions by buying long bonds in the cash market.
The spot March Chicago bond futures closed at 96, up 17/32 on the day.
Dealers said the rebound in Treasury bond prices from Wednesday's sharp decline began during overnight trading in Tokyo and gathered force later in the New York cash and Chicago bond futures markets.
"The spark that ignited the bond market was a Government report that said initial claims for unemployment insurance in the week ended Feb. 23 were the highest in at least seven years," said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo.
Although the initial unemployment claims do not always telegraph what the jobs data for February will be, they impressed the bond buyers for two reasons, Mr. Braverman said. For one, the latest data on claims were for a holiday-shortened week, the first day of which was the Washington's Birthday holiday. The second factor was the size of the claims, 508,000, up 20,000 from the previous week.
 
More Fed Action
 Mr. Braverman said that "if this morning's report on unemployment in February is as dismal as the jump in initial insurance claims would indicate, it should jolt the Fed into taking further action to cut the cost of credit."
For its part, the Fed once again moved to add reserves to the banking system as the Federal funds rate climbed to nearly 6.5 percent, or a quarter-point above the Fed's perceived target level. The funds rate is what banks charge each other for overnight temporary loans and is thus considered the basic cost of credit.
Despite the infusion of reserves by the central bank system, the funds traded at 6.5 percent late in the day. But dealers said the funds rate had no impact on Treasury bills, which are normally most sensitive to any change in the funds rate.
The discount rate on 90-day bills dipped a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.08 percent; six-month bills slipped a basis point, to 6.05 percent.
But the average discount rate soared at the Treasury's monthly auction of one-year bills. The average rate climbed to 6.06 percent, from 5.85 percent a month ago. On a bond yield equivalent basis, the 6.06 percent rate translates into 6.46 percent a year.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Recovery Continues; Grain and Soybeans Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver rallied to a spot delivery price of just under $4 an ounce yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange, extending a recovery driven by perceptions that the recession is easing.
On other commodity markets, pork futures surged; cattle were mixed; energy futures fell, and grain and soybeans were lower. 
 Silver futures settled 10.5 cents to 12 cents higher in New York, with the contract for delivery in March at $3.973 an ounce. The March contract traded as high as $3.99 during the session, the highest spot silver price since Jan. 22.
Silver has risen by nearly 14 percent since Feb. 22, when it dropped briefly below $3.50 an ounce for the first time in 17 years.
The rally mainly reflects the belief that the end of the gulf war will hasten a turnaround in the economy and lead to increased industrial demand for silver, analysts said.
 
Pork Bellies Higher
 Some hog and pork belly futures rose by their permitted daily limits on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in anticipation of a seasonal upswing in the cash market tied to the beginning of spring planting in the Middle West. Hog marketings typically decline in late March as farmers concentrate on preparing their fields.
Live hog futures settled 0.20 cent to the limit of 1.50 cents higher, with April at 54.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.47 cents to the limit of 2 cents higher, with March at 67.20 cents a pound; live cattle were 0.20 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with April at 81.40 cents a pound, and feeder cattle were 0.07 cent lower to 0.15 cent higher, with March at 90.30 cents a pound.
Oil and gasoline futures weakened on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid profit taking and nervousness ahead of Monday's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva.
Light sweet crude oil finished 21 cents to 39 cents lower, with April at $19.42 a barrel; heating oil was 0.14 cent to 0.53 cent lower, with April at 55.55 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.41 cent to 0.95 cent lower, with April at 70.35 cents a gallon; natural gas was 0.2 cent lower to 1.3 cents higher, with April at $1.363 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures slipped on the Chicago Board of Trade amid prospects for improved growing conditions in some regions, including the United States winter wheat belt.
Wheat settled 1/2 cent to 2 cents lower, with March at $2.72 3/4 a bushel; corn was 1/2 cent lower to 1/4 cent higher, with March at $2.46 1/2 a bushel; oats were 1/4 cent to 3/4 cent lower, with March at $1.19 1/2 a bushel, and soybeans were 2 1/4 cents lower to 2 cents higher, with March at $5.92 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Plunged 4% in January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit fell at a 4 percent annual rate in January, the Government reported today. It was the steepest plunge in four years as recession and war curbed personal spending.
The Federal Reserve said consumer installment debt dropped a seasonally adjusted $2.44 billion, the biggest percentage decline since it fell 5 percent in February 1987. 
 It followed a revised six-tenths of 1 percent slip in December for the first back-to-back decline since a three-month string of losses that began in December 1986.
The $342 million drop in December was the first decline since a two-tenths of 1 percent dip in February 1989. December debt was reported earlier to have decreased at a 2.3 percent rate, to $1.45 billion.
 
Finances Consumer Spending
 Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It is tracked closely since it helps finance much of the spending by consumers, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
In recent months, the Persian Gulf war has eroded consumer confidence and the recession has reduced jobs and income. As a result, consumer spending fell six-tenths of 1 percent in January, its biggest drop since a 1.3 percent decline in January 1987, the Commerce Department reported. Retail sales were down nine-tenths of 1 percent, including the second consecutive 4.4 percent monthly drop in automobile sales.
Major retailers reported yesterday that buyers continued to avoid their stores in February, making that typically slow month even slower.
But although the recession persists, some economists have reported signs of improvement in some areas of the economy since consumer confidence plunged to a 10-year low in January as the Persian Gulf war broke out.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress on Wednesday that after the end of the war, traffic picked up in real estate offices and auto showrooms, raising "the possibility that stronger consumer demand may be emerging."
But in January, consumers had backed off. Auto loans, which had fallen for six months until picking up at a three-tenths of 1 percent rate in November and 3.6 percent in December, dropped again -- down a sharp 8.2 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $1.95 billion.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate plummeted 14.7 percent, or $2.63 billion, following a 5.8 percent gain a month earlier.
Consumers reached again for their credit cards, however, increasing revolving credit by a 7 percent rate, or $1.27 billion. Revolving credit had fallen by 8.3 percent in December.
Borrowing for mobile homes erased a 37.4 percent rate of decline in December by jumping 47.8 percent in January, or $868 million.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Debt Deal Favors Water St. Fund

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN the high-stakes, behind-the-scenes game that is the new world of corporate restructuring, bondholders who start out with similar holdings can wind up in very different positions.
That is what happened this week when the Journal Company, the largest of the three debt-laden newspaper companies once controlled by Ralph Ingersoll, announced a partial debt restructuring. 
 Its holdings include nine daily newspapers, among them The Trentonian in Trenton; The Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa.; The Herald News in Fall River, Mass., and The Record in Troy, N.Y. It also operates weeklies, including the Suburban Journals around St. Louis, which claim to be the largest group of weekly papers in the country. An attempt to start a St. Louis daily, The Sun, ended in failure last year.
The evident winner in the new deal is the Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund, a fund organized by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The loser for now appears to be the First Executive Corporation, the insurance company that owns large quantities of the Journal Company's 'junk bonds."
The overhaul of its debt did not get the Journal Company out of hot water, but it did avert an immediate crisis. Moreover, it shed light on the operating style of the $784 million Water Street fund, which is run by Mikael Salovaara, a hard-charging Goldman partner who told institutions that they could prosper by buying controlling positions in distressed securities and then making deals with the companies that issued them. This is the first such deal that has been disclosed in which Water Street played a leading role.
"This deal is excellent for them and it is excellent for the company," said John L. Vogelstein, the vice chairman of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, which controls the Journal Company, referring to Goldman. "It is a major first step in restructuring the company's finances."
The deal that Mr. Salovaara cut sacrifices current income for the fund by accepting lower interest rates, but it puts Water Street ahead of all other bondholders in two important ways. Water Street's new bonds mature in 1996, instead of 1999 and 2000 for the other bondholders, and they are secured and rank above the other bonds. If the Journal Company does end up going broke, Water Street is likely to get a full payout, while other bondholders could suffer losses.
Last year, Mr. Ingersoll and Warburg, Pincus, which had made joint investments, agreed to split his debt-laden newspaper empire, with the investment firm taking the American operations and Mr. Ingersoll getting the British ones. The smallest of the three related American operations, Community Newspapers, filed for bankruptcy last month after bondholders balked at a bond exchange offer. The third company in the complex, NH Acquisition, publishes The Register in New Haven. It is not in financial difficulty, and in fact is said by people with access to its financial reports to have posted record operating profits of $23 million last year.
But the Journal Company did not have the money to make a $7 million interest payment that was due on March 1, although Warburg, Pincus said it would have come up with the money before the grace period expired. Instead, the deal with Water Street enabled it to have to pay only about $3 million to other bondholders. That payment is to be made today.
The Journal Company had announced that it was in negotiations with two large bondholders. The second was not identified, but H. F. Pearson & Company, which monitors filings by bondholders, reported that First Executive held a large stake. First Executive officials did not return telephone calls, but some people familiar with the negotiations said it had held out for a better deal, involving stock in the Journal Company.
One reason that Water Street might have been more willing to accept the deal is that it bought its bonds late last year and early this year, after they had fallen sharply in price. If it is able to assure the eventual recovery of full face value, even with a reduced interest rate it will have an excellent investment. First Executive probably paid much more for its stake.
Other bondholders, including some mutual funds, were not offered a similar deal. Neither Mr. Vogelstein of Warburg, Pincus nor Robert M. Jelinic, the Journal Company's president, would comment on whether a future exchange offer would be made to them. But it appears that Journal needs more help, and a future restructuring is likely.
Late last year, the Journal Company told bondholders that it did not think its operating cash flow for this year would be enough to cover its expenses. Unless more is done soon, it is expected that Warburg, Pincus will have to come up with cash to make a $9 million interest payment due to bondholders on May 1.
Mr. Jelinic attributed the Journal Company's problems to the poor economy, the heavy debt load and the losses from The St. Louis Sun, which he said were continuing because the company was stuck with a lease on expensive office space. For the first nine months of last year, the company reported an operating loss of $16.9 million, on revenues of $131.1 million. That included $12.9 million in costs involved in shutting The Sun.

HEADLINE: Control Board Says Dinkins Plan 'Actually Disguises' Budget Gap

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The State Financial Control Board issued new warnings yesterday about New York City's handling of its long-term fiscal problems as Mayor David N. Dinkins struggled to rally support in an unusually pointed appeal to black New Yorkers.
The control board, set up to monitor the city's finances during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, said Mr. Dinkins would undoubtedly balance the budget for the coming fiscal year. But it said the Dinkins administration's plan for doing so "does not clearly portray the city's problems" and, despite large tax increases and service cuts, would certainly produce billion-dollar budget gaps in future years. 
 "In fact," the report said, the Mayor's preliminary $29 billion spending plan "actually disguises the persistence of imbalance," in part because of its reliance on a number of money-saving moves taken in this and recent years -- from bond refinancings to wage deferrals -- that will cost more in the future.
 
Special Troubles
 The report came a day after municipal union leaders harshly attacked the Mayor over suggestions that they agree to defer some wages and over disarray among his top staff members. It was one more sign of the special troubles Mr. Dinkins faces in striking a balance between his critics in the financial community and skeptics among his supporters in liberal and labor circles.
"Let me tell you something, there are a lot of folks who are not pleased that I am Mayor," an apparently frustrated Mr. Dinkins told listeners in an appearance on the black-oriented radio station WLIB-AM yesterday morning. Listeners questioned his handling of everything from labor relations to the black-led boycott of a Korean-American grocery in Brooklyn.
"So," the Mayor said, "I don't expect you all to agree with me because you're African-American and I'm African-American. That's nonsense. I can be wrong and you can be wrong. But let me tell you something: There are a lot of folks who don't want me to be right no how under any circumstances."
"And I think you need to think it through and decide there will be quarrels you will have with me from time to time, just like you have quarrels within your own family."
 
Concerns Shared
 Later, at a news conference at City Hall, Mr. Dinkins said he shared the Financial Control Board's concerns about assuring that the city's budget stayed balanced over the long term, as required by law, and that he was committed to taking whatever actions were necessary to make sure it would.
Senior mayoral aides found some vindication in the control board's prediction that the budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 would be balanced despite a projected total gap of more than $2 billion. If the city ran a deficit of $100 million or more, the board, headed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, could reassert binding powers over the city's fiscal affairs.
"Clearly, they're going to have to do some other actions, but I'm not worried about '91 and '92," said the board's executive director, Allen J. Proctor, who prepared the report. He said the city could probably keep its budget balanced for the coming year solely by letting thousands of positions fall vacant through attrition.
But he said this would have more damaging effects on services than a selective mix of layoffs and attrition since jobs did not always fall vacant in the places the city wanted to cut. Mr. Dinkins said later, "We can't do it all by attrition," though the precise mix is not yet clear.
 
Questions Raised
 The control board's report raised questions about the administration's plans for getting beyond the next 16 months. "In a time when fiscal stress is so great, we are particularly concerned that this modification lacks a clear and consistent articulation of mayoral tax and spending policies," it said.
That is so, the report said, because the administration is seeking real-estate tax increases of $770 million to meet one of its planned revenue targets, instead of the $300 million explicitly outlined in the preliminary budget proposed Jan. 16.
The report said the city's budget would be adequate only if it restructured the types and levels of services the city provided. While the city has proposed spending cuts that would produce growth slower than the inflation rate in most broad areas, the report said, spending in other areas continues to rise at a rate bound to produce future deficits, even assuming the city's most optimistic assumptions about the economy and state aid are borne out.
Those three areas are spending for debt service on the city's bonds for long-term project, for social services and for fringe benefits for city workers.
 
Administrative Costs
 The city has already cut back its capital plan to save money on debt service, and Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that further reductions would be needed and that he would look for more ways to cut administrative costs for social services. He also said the city expected to identify up to $750 million in unspecified additional measures to counter the effects of proposed state budget cuts.
Mr. Proctor of the control board said he was not accusing the administration of "malfeasance" in understating the long-term depth of the city's problem. "It's just the nature of the problem is such that how you cut it has become as important or more important than if you can cut it," he said.
In the last two fiscal years, Mr. Proctor said, the city has taken more than $1 billion in actions that either accelerated revenues or pushed expenses off to the future, "one shots" that made its long-term problems persist.
 
'How Much for How Long'
 Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that should the city defer payments of some wages for more workers to balance the budget now, it would create costs in the future. "Deferrals per se are not bad," he said. "It depends on how much for how long." And he said the city would continue to explore that option despite resistance from unions and worries by fiscal monitors.
Earlier, on the radio broadcast, after one questioner in the studio at the Apollo Theater in Harlem asked him what he had done for blacks after doing "something for the Jews" by going to Israel, Mr. Dinkins pointed to his efforts to increase the number of city contracts awarded to minority companies and to give city bond underwriting business to minority firms.
"First of all, I do feel that I'm Mayor of all the people," he said. "And the things I say here I say in the synagogue, or in St. Patrick's Cathedral. I'm the same person everywhere."

HEADLINE: House Approves $200 Million To Speed Benefits to Jobless

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today approved a $200 million grant to the states to help them speed the processing of unemployment benefit applications.
The funds, intended to reduce growing lines at state unemployment offices and delays in the mailing of benefit checks, are twice as much as the Bush Administration had requested for the purpose. They are part of a $4.1 billion supplemental budget appropriation that was approved by the House today on a vote of 365 to 43. 
 The Senate is expected to agree with the House and vote $200 million in administrative funds for the nation's unemployment system before Congress adjourns for its Easter recess on March 25.
While benefits paid to the unemployed come from state funds, the administrative costs of the unemployment system, including staff salaries, are a Federal responsibility. The Federal Government initially allotted $1.98 billion to cover that responsibility in the budget for the current fiscal year.
But with the unemployment rate climbing in recent months, the amount proved insufficient. State unemployment offices have been overwhelmed by a lack of adequate staff, and as a result applicants at some offices have waited four or five hours before being interviewed and up to six weeks before receiving their first benefit checks. The money voted by the House today would ease their problem by paying for additional staff members and other administrative improvements.
The House action came on a day when the Labor Department reported that 508,000 new applications for unemployment benefits were filed in the week ended Feb. 23, the largest number of new claims in eight years. And the total number of Americans receiving such benefits in that week also hit an eight-year high, at 3.254 million, the department said.
Because of the budget law enacted last year, any new Federal spending must be offset by an equal amount in reduction of other spending or in increased taxes, unless the President declares that the new spending is necessary to meet a national emergency. So far, President Bush has declined to declare an emergency, but Congress has not yet identified where the money for the new spending will come from.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Postwar Glow Dimmed by the Economy

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
The war in the Persian Gulf has given a striking boost to the nation's confidence and morale, but Americans are now turning their attention to the economy and other domestic concerns about which they are far less ebullient, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The poll found that President Bush was still on an extraordinary high with the American public, with an overall approval rating of 88 percent. It showed Americans setting a post-Vietnam record for confidence in the military and voicing a new conviction that their country was not a declining world power. 
 Even as they began to fret about the economy, more than half seemed willing to concede that Mr. Bush had other things on his mind in recent months.
But there are signs of vulnerability, too, or at least new challenges for the President, as the troops begin returning home from the gulf and domestic issues move up on the public's agenda.
 
Economy Is No. 1 Concern
 The economy is now mentioned more than anything as the No. 1 problem facing the country: 36 percent cited it this week, compared with 19 percent who gave that answer in October, when the economy was tied, roughly speaking, with the deficit and the Middle East as the top problems.
And Mr. Bush's grades on the economy are in stark contrast to his grades on foreign policy, according to the nationwide telephone poll of 1,252 adults. Forty-two percent approve of the way he is handling the economy, while 83 percent approve of his conduct of foreign policy.
This helps explain why the Democrats are so eager to turn the political debate back to domestic issues. Some strategists consider this their only hope of mounting a competitive challenge to Mr. Bush in the 1992 election. But the poll showed that the Democrats hardly had a clear shot on these issues: 42 percent of respondents said the Republican Party was "better able to insure a strong economy," compared with 27 percent who gave the edge to the Democratic Party.
In addition, the public seems to blame Ronald Reagan more than Mr. Bush for the current recession: 48 percent say they put a lot of the blame on the policies of the Reagan Administration, compared with 15 percent who put the blame primarily on the Bush Administration.
The survey, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, was conducted in telephone interviews Monday through Wednesday. No interviews were conducted after the President's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night, when he hailed the returning troops, pledged to get the economy rolling again and called for action on pressing domestic issues.
 
A Grace Period
 Because of the war, Mr. Bush has been given something of a grace period on the economy: 55 percent said the President paid as much attention as he could to the economy during the war. But now, 61 percent say Mr. Bush should be paying more attention to the economy than he is.
"Now it's time to concentrate on the home front, to help the American people and build the economy back to where it should be," Stephen Miller, 45, an assistant business manager in Clearwater, Fla., said in an interview after the poll was completed.
Sixty-three percent of the respondents said they knew someone well who is out of work and actively looking for a job. This is statistically equivalent to the 65 percent level registered in a January 1982 Times/CBS News Poll during the last major recession, which occurred in the first Reagan Administration.
For all of that, the war in the gulf left a remarkable afterglow in public attitudes. Confidence in the military stands at the highest level measured for any institution since the Gallup Poll began such measurements in 1973. In the Times/CBS Poll, 88 percent said they had "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in the military. The low point in confidence in the military since 1973 was registered in a 1981 Gallup Poll, when the level was 50 percent.
Trust in Government seems to be on the rebound: 47 percent said they trust the Government in Washington to do the right thing "just about always" or "most of the time," compared with 25 percent who held that view last October in the middle of the struggle over the budget between the White House and the Congress,
 
'Right Direction'
 And in a closely watched measure of the public mood, 51 percent now say the country is going in the "right direction," compared with 42 percent who felt the country was "off on the wrong track." This is a significant change from the polls last fall, when the pessimists outnumbered the optimists by a ratio of 2 or 3 to 1.
The gulf war has also transformed Americans' sense of their place in the world: 73 percent said they rejected the notion that the United States was in decline as a world power. Last June, 44 percent rejected it.
Still, there are underlying concerns that were much less affected by the post-war optimism. When asked to look ahead to the next century, 39 percent said they saw the United States as likely to be the No. 1 economic power in the world, while 43 percent said they saw Japan in that role.
Expectations about the long term remain tempered: 36 percent say life for the next generation of Americans will be better than life today, while 26 percent say it will be worse and 35 percent say it will be about the same.
 
War's Effect on Image
 While Mr. Bush emerged with a glowing image from the war, Vice President Quayle was not as fortunate: 19 percent gave him a favorable rating and 27 percent gave him an unfavorable rating, close to the previous level, recorded in January.
The poll gave some inkling of post-war politics. A majority of Democrats voted against the resolution in Congress to authorize the use of force in the gulf; and Republicans seem eager to make it an issue. But the survey found that in the view of 73 percent, both parties supported the war equally once it began.
Still, the poll suggested that the issue has potential for the Republicans: 52 percent said that if their congressional representatives voted against the resolution, it would make a difference in how the respondents would vote in that lawmaker's re-election. Moreover, by 4 to 1, these respondents said a vote against the President's proposal would make them less likely to vote for their lawmaker.
The effect of the gulf debate on party image was apparent in two other questions. Asked which party was more likely to keep the country out of war, 45 percent said the Democrats, while 23 percent said the Republicans.
But Republicans had an enormous edge when people were asked which party was more likely to "make sure U.S. military defenses are strong." Sixty-one percent said the Republicans, 14 percent said the Democrats.
Mr. Bush's overall popularity has soared during the gulf war, but there has been no major consistent change in his ratings on several domestic policy issues, including drugs, the environment and education. Fewer than four in ten say his Administration has made progress in dealing with those issues.
Still, he continues to match President Harry S. Truman's historic high for Presidential popularity, which came in June 1945 after the surrender of Germany and Mr. Truman's ascension to the White House.
But there is also an ominous precedent here for Mr. Bush: By 1951, Mr. Truman's approval rating had sunk to 23 percent, one of the lowest ever recorded for a President by the Gallup Poll.
 
How the Poll Was Taken
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Monday to Wednesday with 1,252 adults throughout the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
No interviews were conducted after the President's televised speech to Congress on Wednesday night.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 of 20 cases the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for either Democrats or Republicans it is plus or minus five percentage points.

HEADLINE: Catholic Schools Worry As Closings Draw Near

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
These are fretful times for New York's Roman Catholic schools. In the next few days, the Archdiocese of New York is expected to announce that, because of mounting deficits, a handful of the schools, all in poor neighborhoods, will have to shut their doors.
The threat of closing has been hanging over the schools for several months, but as the time for a decision draws near, pastors, principals and parents say that they are on edge. "Rumors are flying like crazy," said Sister Mary Ellen Fuhrman, principal of St. Pius V School in the South Bronx. 
 One rumor circulating in the Bronx is that five schools will close; another, heard in Manhattan, says 10. The secretary at one Bronx church said that she jumps every time the phone rings, afraid that it will bring bad news.
"I'm praying to St. Jude that it's not us," said Suzanne O'Reily, the principal of the Transfiguration School in Chinatown. "You know St. Jude, he's the saint of the impossible."
Apologies for the closings have already been made. In a lengthy column last month in Catholic New York, the weekly newspaper of the archdiocese, John Cardinal O'Connor wrote that he has tried to "move heaven and earth" to keep the doors of each and every school open but that fiscal realities have made that impossible. "We will have to close some schools before September 1991 -- this year." He did not mention how many but said he would keep it to "the bare-bone minimum."
Bishops in other cities around the country have been faced with similar decisions. Chicago, Detroit and Washington have closed schools in recent years, and the Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., announced a few days ago that it would have to shut four schools. All cite financial problems and declining populations in poorer urban areas.
Cardinal O'Connor, who is the head of the Archdiocese of New York, said that his decision would be made only after study, consultation and prayer.
A spokesman for the archdiocese said that meetings were held yesterday with some of the schools under consideration for closing at the Cardinal's office on First Avenue. In his newspaper column, the Cardinal had written that no school would close without his personal review. He added: "So whoever is looking for someone to blame can blame me."
The archdiocese and school officials declined to say yesterday which or how many schools had been called in. An announcement on the closings is expected within the next few days.
Talk of closings began to circulate in December when the archdiocese announced that it would have to slash by 50 percent the $20 million in subsidies it provides to 140 inner-city elementary and high schools. These schools represent 45 percent of the system's 312 schools; the balance are self-sustaining.
The diocese is made up of Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester and five other counties north of New York City. It runs the largest private school system in the region with 96,000 pupils. The 140 schools facing cuts range from Holy Cross at 332 West 43d Street, just off of Times Square, to St. Peter's in Liberty and Sacred Heart in Newburgh.
The archdiocese immediately organized the schools in geographical clusters and asked that they work together to draw up plans for economizing and possible consolidation. In January, the Cardinal announced the start of an effort to raise $100 million over three years to help save the inner-city schools.
As part of the campaign, the archdiocese tried to drive home the point that the Catholic schools serve a broad population that includes Catholics and non-Catholics and many minority groups. It also touted the schools' achievements, including statistics that show that 85 percent of its high school graduates go on to college and that fewer than 1 percent drop out.
Some school administrators and pastors have told of seesaw emotions in recent weeks. When two weeks ago a rumor swept Mount Carmel-Holy Rosary Consolidated School in East Harlem that it would close, parents organized an evening prayer vigil outside of the Cardinal's residence on Madison Avenue and 49th Street.
 
Cardinal Meets Parents
 As 40 parents stood out in the cold, the Cardinal's car pulled up. Parents who were there said that the Cardinal spoke with them for several minutes and assured them that he would do everything in his power to keep the school open. "I think it helped a lot in making them more secure in the fact that their children will continue to receive a good Catholic education," said Desiree Edwards, the principal. "It was good to hear."
One of the reasons for the concern among parents was that the school appeared to fit at least one of the criteria spelled out in the Cardinal's column. "I can no longer keep two schools open which are only a short distance from each other if neither has enough students or one has a building falling down," he wrote.
Mount Carmel-Holy Rosary, itself the result of a merger several years ago, is only four blocks from another Catholic school, St. Paul's at 118th and Lexington Avenue. "We didn't want to see Mount Carmel-Holy Rosary-St. Paul," said Mrs. Edwards. "That would be too much."
In his column, the Cardinal also sought to put to rest what he called "the myth" of a wealthy archdiocese that is playing Scrooge with the schools. "Why can people see so easily that the Federal Government is running an enormous deficit, as is the State of New York and the City of New York, but insist that the Church has untold wealth? One reason is that they see a lot of buildings owned by the Church, so they ask why we don't sell them.
"Did you ever try to sell a school that needs capital repairs to the tune of $800,000? How about a church with the walls caving in? More importantly, what do you do if you sell them? Where do you hold school -- on a vacant lot?"

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Israel;
Mideast Pact: Israelis' View

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 7

 BODY:
On four crucial points, almost everyone in the Israeli political establishment seems to agree:
 Never has there been a more opportune time for Israel to make peace with its Arab neighbors. 
 If progress is to be made, the nation must act fast.
When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d comes calling next week, the Government will have no new peace proposals to offer, and few if any original ideas.
So if progress is to made at this critical moment, it will have to be the result of someone else's initiative, Arab or American.
 
Arab-Israeli Talks
 As Justice Minister Dan Meridor put it, seeming to express the view of almost everyone in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Government: "America can tell the Arab states to come and talk with Israel. If they do this, the whole psychological area will change."
President Bush told Congress on Wednesday night that the United States was committed to working toward a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. But in a warning to both sides, he also said, "By now, it should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in the Middle East requires compromise."
Mr. Bush also repeated that any agreements should be based on Security Council Resolution 242 of November 1967, which in effect calls on Israel to return most if not all of the lands occupied in the 1967 war in exchange for having its borders recognized by Arab nations.
The political map of the region has changed little since 1979, when the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed a peace treaty with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt that was brokered by President Jimmy Carter. In return for peace, Israel returned all of the Sinai, which was seized from Egypt in 1967. Israel still controls the Golan Heights, taken from Syria in that war, and the West Bank of the Jordan, including the eastern part of Jerusalem, taken from Jordan. The current Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has taken a position opposing any further "peace for land" compromises with its Arab neighbors.
 
Problem of Coalition Politics
 Although Israeli officials agreed that the time was ripe for movement, they said they had no compromises to offer Syria or Jordan or the Palestinians, who clamor for their own homeland on the West Bank.
"They ask, what are we willing to give?" said Yossi Ben-Aharon, the Prime Minister's chief of staff. "We ask, what are the Syrians willing to give?"
Because of the intricacies of coalition politics, the Israelis have found it very hard to come up with peace initiatives. To stay in power, the Likud has made alliances with parties that are even less interested in making any concessions.
"It's the electoral system that creates these impossible coalitions," Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party, said when asked why Israel cannot seem to carry out any plans for peace.
 
Waning Support for Vote Plan
 Because Israel's system of proportional representation has not given a party a secure governing majority for years, "we must all the time be in the business of making coalitions," Mr. Peres said.
Mr. Shamir says his Government stands by its May 1989 initiative, which had as its central tenet elections in the occupied territories for Palestinians. That idea got nowhere at the time because the Israelis wanted to bar the Palestine Liberation Organization from taking part. And now that the P.L.O. is weakened politically because of its support for Iraq, senior Israeli officials indicate that the Government is not really committed to the idea of elections any longer -- partly because several far-right-wing ministers who together have the power to bring the Government down have made it clear they oppose it.
"The plan was adopted by the national unity Government in which the Labor Party was a 50 percent partner," said Science Minister Yuval Neeman of the far-right-wing Tehiya party. "I have no doubt that the Likud was obliged to compromise with Labor. These circumstances do not exist anymore."
He and several others, including Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who was instrumental in scuttling the elections plan a year ago, have formed a right-wing front within the Government that opposes any use of even the 1989 plan.
 
Peres to Offer a Plan
 On the left, Mr. Peres, whose Labor Party is now out of the Government, has drafted a comprehensive proposal calling for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to work out a settlement in the West Bank and Gaza.
The plan also calls for a demilitarized West Bank and for an international conference to establish an economic cooperation agreement for the entire Middle East. Mr. Peres said he hoped to meet with Mr. Baker to discuss the plan. At the same time, at least three Labor factions are trying to sink his plan or promote programs of their own.
Politics aside, officials of every political persuasion agree that now is the moment to act. With Iraq's military destroyed, the army's assessment is that the threat of serious attack from the east has been virtually eliminated.
The Palestinians' position has been considerably weakened as a result of their support for President Saddam Hussein. And the Scud missile attacks on Israel, coupled with the Government's decision not to respond, have raised Israel's image in the West to levels unknown in recent years.
"We can't waste time," Mr. Peres said. "We have maybe a year, probably less. Then there will be elections in the United States, and here."
"I totally agree," said Amnon Rubenstein, leader of the center-left Shinui party. But many people agreed with Mr. Rubenstein when he also said: "I'm not overly optimistic about this. I know a lot of people say there has never been a better moment. But things don't work that way."
The reason, he and others said, is fear.
Even as the war has created a favorable political moment for Israel, the missile attacks have also left its people dazed and afraid.
Mr. Rubenstein, a leader of the leftist peace camp, had to move out of his home in Tel Aviv for several days last month because it had no bomb shelter. Two missiles fell in his neighborhood. And as he put it this week: "Look, even the people here who truly want peace just don't trust the Arabs. People here just don't see any reliable interlocutors out there."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: War Budget;
House, Voting $15 Billion for War, Warns Allies to Pay Their Part

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted tonight to appropriate $15 billion to pay for the Persian Gulf war after warning other countries to make good on their pledges of aid and promising that Congress "may consider appropriate action" if those commitments were not fulfilled.
The statement of Congressional intent was added to a $4.3 billion supplemental appropriation bill intended to pay some of the domestic costs of the gulf war, provide aid to Israel, and pay for a variety of programs from Food Stamps to nuclear-waste cleanup to veterans pensions. 
 The $15 billion measure, adopted by a 380-to-19 vote, also spelled out procedures for using those contributions from other countries first and the United States dollars last.
The warning to other nations was adopted on a voice vote, despite a cautioning by Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, that "we'll get more money if we don't threaten them."
 
Complaints on Pledges
 The resolution was proposed by Representative Jim Chapman, Democrat of Texas, who complained about "allied pledges that the checks are in the mail." Other countries have pledged $54.5 billion in contributions to help pay for the war, but only $16.9 billion of it has been paid so far. Neither his proposal nor the debate offered any suggestions about what Congress might do if other countries did not meet the demand to achieve "substantial compliance or an agreed upon payment schedule no later than April 15."
After passage by a vote of 365 to 43, the supplemental appropriation bill went to the Senate, where complaints about slow payments from allies have also been voiced angrily and frequently.
On the aid for Israel, there were about two hours of debate before the 397-to-24 vote for $650 million for that country came. Most of the speakers supported the aid and wanted to get on record with their arguments that Israel, a steadfast ally of the United States, had suffered losses of at least that much because of the war -- from damage by Scud missiles to a continual air-force alert to the distribution of gas masks.
 
On Israelis' Defense
 The opponents generally insisted that they were supporters of Israel. But they said the $3 billion Israel now gets annually was enough. Representative Tim Valentine, Democrat of North Carolina, who offered the amendment, said more aid for Israel was inappropriate "when we are struggling under the weight of a recession."
But Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, insisted, "The Israelis simply want the wherewithal to defend themselves as the rest of the world turns against them."
And Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said he supported the Administration in its request for aid. He said the Administration needed support as it sought peace in the Mideast. He did complain that the original Israeli request for $1 billion was "outlandish."
 
An 'Emergency' Provision
 The aid to Israel was adopted under a provision of last year's budget act, under which "emergency" needs were exempt from the spending limits set at that time. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, voted for the aid to Israel, but warned against using the concept too loosely. "Let's not let the word 'emergency' fall victim to semantic inflation," he said.
The $650 million for Israel was included in a grab-bag $4.3 billion appropriations bill that also included $151 million to offset various domestic costs arising out of the war, especially security expenses for the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the Capitol Police and the District of Columbia police force. There were also war-related appropriations of $200 million for maintenance of military depots and $270 million for health-care costs for the military and their dependents.
The other big items in the bill were $1.5 billion for food stamps, $603 million for nuclear-waste cleanup, $303 million for veterans pensions, $232 million for supplemental security income payments by the Social Security Administration, $200 million to help states pay the costs of administering the unemployment compensation program, and $100 million for an increased Federal payment to the District of Columbia.
The bill also directed the Department of Defense to go ahead with a $988 million program of modernizing 12 Grumman F-14A aircraft, a plan the Pentagon seeks to cancel. It also told the department to spend previously appropriated funds on the vertical takeoff Osprey aircraft, another project the Pentagon resists.
The House did move to cut spending on one matter. At the urging of Representative Jim Slattery, Democrat of Kansas, it voted 71 to 11 to repeal a $500,000 appropriation to develop a tourist center around the restored birthplace of Lawrence Welk in Strasburg, N.D. "No issue caused us more grief last year," said Representative Dan Glickman, also a Kansas Democrat.
Despite Wednesday night's appeal by Persident Bush for rapid Congressional action on his domestic agenda, the House rejected, by a 246 to 177 vote, an effort to start spending money quickly on various new housing programs he pushed last year, including one that would enable public housing tenants to buy the housing they now rent.
Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgian who serves as Republican whip, urged passage of a plan to shift $779 million in funds already appropriated for other housing programs to those plans.
"How can you turn the President down," he said.
But Representative Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, said local communities were not ready to implement the new legislation and the proposal would "start the program off on the wrong foot by trying to force feed them."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Veterans;
Outpouring of Scholarships and Jobs Await Returning Heroes After the Ticker Tape

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
In a homecoming fit for conquering heroes, a grateful American public will bestow more than ticker tape on troops returning from the Persian Gulf. There are offers of college scholarships, carpenter jobs that pay $22 an hour, free weekends in wine country, even promises to baby-sit the children.
In what one Congressman described as a "maddening drive to the floor of the House," politicians in Washington and around the country are racing to outdo one another with bills that would benefit the troops. 
 And job recruiters say they will be eager to court those men and women whom President Bush described as "first-class talent."
"If we learn that an applicant has seen duty in the Persian Gulf," said Arnold Silberman, vice president of the Rust-Oleum Corporation, "that's something we're going to consider very, very highly."
 
Gratitude and Guilt
 One of the career choices the veterans might consider is public office. Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, is urging his party to nominate gulf war veterans to run against Democrats.
The extraordinary show of support is "almost out of proportion," said Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist who studies the military. The outpouring, he said, reveals a great sense of appreciation among Americans, but perhaps also some guilt.
"In some ways, I see this as a kind of moral payback for the short shrift we gave to the Vietnam veterans," said Mr. Moskos, who noted that 500 times as many troops died in Vietnam as in the Persian Gulf fighting. "I think there's also a measure of collective guilt among the American elite who knew that it wasn't their sons and daughters fighting over there."
The return of tens of thousands of troops from the Persian Gulf is not likely to have a wrenching effect on the economy, as did the two million soldiers mustered out of service in the year after the ending of World War II.
But ordinary Americans, too, have been lining up to do whatever they can to demonstrate support for the troops.
A plumbing contractor in Pleasanton, Calif., Frank Capilla, has already rounded up pledges of 30 jobs from businesses in his area. A suburban Minneapolis insurance salesman, Kenneth Smith, has secured a host of pledges of blue-collar and white-collar jobs for troops returning to Minnesota.
 
A Perfect Gift
 "What better gift can you give a serviceman than a job?" Mr. Capilla asked.
In Chicago, a radio talk show host challenged his listeners to "put up" something more tangible for the troops than yellow ribbons. The calls rushed in. Dozens of people called with offers to give up their tickets for a Cubs game, theater, a night at the symphony. One woman said she would donate her services as a baby sitter. Another promised to watch the pets.
"They actually came through," said the host, Stacy Taylor. "They called the station with pledges, and they left their names and telephone numbers."
In Congress, a dizzying array of proposals to help veterans are being considered. One measure would waive the usual 10 percent penalty for withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for the gulf troops. Another would raise the tax exemption on commissioned officers' combat pay to $2,000 from $500.
The rush for veterans-related legislation is strikingly different from what happened in the last Congress, when political maneuvering led to the blocking of a bill to provide cost-of-living increases to disabled veterans.
It is difficult to know, of course, how long the support will last. A year from now, when the euphoria over military victory has abated, will the troops be forgotten? If the troops do get any breaks in the job market, will appreciation turn to resentment among workers hurt by the recession?
"Next week, they're seen as conquering heroes," said Mr. Moskos. "But two years from now, when some of the troops get laid off, as we expect to happen, will the public simply view them as marginal?"
A note of skepticism was also sounded by Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat, who cautioned against raising "false hopes" among the veterans. "This maddening drive to the floor of the House is not a good way to do business," he said. "How are we going to pay for some of these things?"
Since many troops will continue to serve in the armed forces, the private sector will not be inundated with returning veterans. The thousands of troops, whose terms were extended during the war, will soon be discharged.
For the first time since World War II, the troops will return together in units, making it easier for communities to hold rallies and confer honors.
Ticker tape parades are scheduled in many cities, from New York to Jacksonville, N.C., where confetti will be dropped from ladders, since there are no tall buildings in the city.
When the time comes to enter the labor market, the troops will be coveted by many companies, according to recruitment specialists.
"Action in the Persian Gulf is going to look very good on a resume," said Kent Milius, the owner of Management Recruiters of Colorado. "They have demonstrated that they can take the pressure, and employers like that."
A few days ago, Mr. Milius was discussing the attributes of a job candidate with a prospective employer.
"When I mentioned that the man was a former Green Beret, my client really sat up and took notice," Mr. Milius said. "Six months ago, I don't think it would have worked that way."
The president of the American Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, has issued an appeal for veterans to consider teaching, a field expected to experience many vacancies in the next few years.
"We have a shortage of minority teachers in particular," he said, "and the people who served would make very good role models in the classroom."
 
Gain for Minority Workers
 Leaders of civil rights groups said they hoped the valor demonstrated by so many black and Hispanic soldiers, along with the leadership of Gen. Colin L. Powell, would convince corporations that minority workers could contribute mightily.
"The armed forces have proven that affirmative action and equal opportunity can work," said Benjamin Hooks, director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "If it can work in the biggest enterprise we have, it is foolish to think that it can't work in corporate and civilian life."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
With Victory, New Challenges

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN his address to Congress this week on the end of the Persian Gulf war, President Bush linked economic development to the peace process. With Iraq's aggression repulsed, the new challenge, he said, "is to reach higher -- to foster economic freedom and prosperity for all people of the region." Indeed, he went so far as to suggest that a solution in the Middle East would help bring about a new world order "in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations." The war, he said, had provided a first test of such a new world, and we had passed the test.
Immediately, however, comes the second test: resolving the clashing interests and ancient enmities that have survived the war. The Administration has begun a large-scale effort to think through the security and economic arrangements for an enduring peace in the Middle East. 
 In a briefing held shortly before the President addressed Congress Wednesday night, a senior Administration official said that in the last few weeks key departments of the Government, with the State Department foremost, had been producing papers on postwar arrangements in the Middle East. These were being integrated, he said, "to lay the foundation for an effort which Secretary Baker will clearly lead on the President's behalf."
He did not deny that the Administration has some "pretty explicit ideas" of its own, but Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, now on his trip to visit Arab and Israeli leaders, would first be taking the measure of "how the landscape has changed in the Middle East between the beginning of the war, or the prewar period and now." This would enable him to determine "degrees of congruence" between their ideas and ours, the official said. In fact, it seems evident that much has changed in the Arab world because of the war. Most important is the new perception of American power, with the American image changing from a declining to an ascending force in the world. The swiftness with which United States and coalition forces prevailed was overwhelmingly a consequence of American technology and of the skill and spirit of the men and women operating that technology. This was as true in the lightning war on the ground as in the air.
But what is true on the battlefield holds as well for the civilian economy. And the lesson for Iraq, and for third world and Communist nations, is that national power stems not from the weight of arms or material resources or numbers of people but from the quality of human resources.
A report just released by the United Nations Development Program, based on a conference held in Antalya, Turkey, three weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, declares, "Politics and economics must embrace all the concerns of humanity for sustainable strategies for ecological and human welfare, bearing in mind that human beings are more important than material resources." The report now appears prescient. And the victory in the gulf gives the Middle Eastern countries the opportunity, if they are to move ahead, to act on that principle of putting human skills -- and human values -- first and to act in their urgent common interest.
The war has left in its wake what has been described as the worst ecological threat in history, with millions of barrels of oil dumped by Iraq into the gulf and the burning of Kuwaiti oil wells by retreating Iraqis. Working together, and with Western help, the Arabs need to overcome that threat to their health and economies.
An even greater environmental threat lies ahead: the extreme shortage of water in the Middle East. As Joyce R. Starr writes in the new issue of Foreign Policy: "Water will become a more precious commodity than oil. The next war in the Middle East will be fought over water."
Environmental protection and economic development in the Middle East must be linked to the peace process. Even before Secretary Baker arrived for his discussions, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and six other Arab nations proposed creation of a peace-keeping force, to replace United States and Western forces.
This proposal may provide Mr. Baker with a handle to work out joint security arrangements, and, with American involvement by continued air and naval presence, link them to Israel's security. In the new spirit of the stunning victory in the gulf, things that looked impossible only weeks ago now seem possible.
That extends to the new confidence in the White House and Congress that economic and social problems here at home can be solved if the nation tackles them with the same "can do" spirit that brought such remarkable results in the war. In his victory speech, Mr. Bush lost no time in declaring his determination to end the recession and address social problems at home. But the follow-through will be even more difficult to execute than his brilliant success in the gulf.

HEADLINE: New World Bank Chief Seen Focusing on Debt

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Lewis T. Preston, retired chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company and President Bush's choice to head the World Bank, is likely to refocus attention on reducing the crushing debt burden of third world countries as a key to lifting global living standards.
A commercial banker's perspective sets him apart from his predecessor, Barber B. Conable Jr., a former Congressman from upstate New York. Mr. Conable not only enhanced the bank's image in Congress but also obtained a huge infusion of capital to further lending and technical assistance programs in more than 100 countries. 
 President Bush formally submitted Mr. Preston's name to the bank's executive board today, and little opposition is expected.
Although the bank -- which chiefly makes loans to build highways, dams, irrigation works and other long-term economic improvement projects -- has 155 member governments, the United States, as the largest donor, traditionally names the chief executive. Its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund, which helps countries pay short-term bills, is traditionally headed by a European. The current managing director is Michel Camdessus, a former French central banker.
Mr. Preston declined to be interviewed. His spokesman, John M. Morris, did issue a statement that Mr. Preston was excited by the nomination "at a time when the challenges before the World Bank have never been greater."
The bank's current importance is underscored by the fiscal constraints that Mr. Preston said were now affecting the traditional aid flows from the United States, Western Europe and Japan.
The bank's loans are expected to total well over $20 billion this year.
Mr. Preston "comes to the bank with a broad background in public policy," said C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury official who is director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based policy organization. "The job he did at Morgan also gives him great respect in the private sector."
Under his presidency, Morgan devised a debt reduction plan for Mexico that spurred a more sweeping plan adopted by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Mr. Preston's sensitivity to the problem may have been heightened by his position as head of Morgan's international banking department from 1968 to 1976 when Morgan itself was making many of the third world loans that countries like Mexico then found they could not repay. It was Mexico's inability to pay creditors that started the debt crisis in the summer of 1982.
As chairman of the nation's fourth-largest banking company during the last decade -- a period in which many investment banking and securities firms foundered -- the 64-year-old banker and World War II marine corporal took the bank into new revenue areas without sacrificing its reputation as a blue-chip banking firm.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Dividend Is Halved

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 7

 BODY:
The board of the Chrysler Corporation cut the auto maker's regular quarterly dividend in half today, to 15 cents a share from 30 cents.
The action, taken at the board's regular monthly meeting in New York, was widely expected by financial analysts. It will save Chrysler roughly $33 million quarterly. 
 "Reducing the dividend was the prudent and sensible thing to do in light of the dismal market conditions of the past few months," said Robert S. Miller Jr., Chrysler's vice chairman. "We still have a long-term confidence in the business, however, so it would have been inappropriate to eliminate the dividend."
 
Aggressive Cost-Cutting
 Chrysler and other auto makers in the United States have been cutting costs aggressively in the face of 18 months of sluggish sales. Earlier this year, the General Motors Corporation cut its quarterly dividend in half, and analysts expect the Ford Motor Company to cut its dividend when its directors meet on April 11.
Mr. Miller said an economic rebound might permit Chrysler to restore the dividend to 30 cents. The Big Three auto makers say orders from dealers have picked up since the end of the Persian Gulf war. But that optimism has not been reflected yet in retail sales, which were weak in the last 10 days of February.
The meeting yesterday provided an interesting footnote as Clarence M. Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety, was allowed to make a pitch to the board to improve vehicle safety. [Page D3.]
The money Chrysler will save by halving its dividend is not much, but it should send a positive signal to bankers that the company is doing everything it can to save money.
 
Bigger Credit Risk
 Chrysler's shaky financial condition has made it a bigger risk to lenders. It is currently trying to reach an accord with 38 banks on a new $1.7 billion line of credit. The banks, led by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, are considering the new, more modest credit line to replace a $2.6 billion loan agreement.
Neither the auto maker nor its finance subsidiary can borrow in the public credit markets because their securities are rated at "junk bond" levels. But Chrysler is trying to sell a stake in the finance subsidiary to a stronger company, which could result in higher ratings on the finance subsidiary's debt and allow the unit to sell bonds and commercial paper.
Chrysler shares rose 62.5 cents each on the New York Stock today to close at $14.50.

THE ECONOMY
Long-distance telephone companies are offering businesses more modern, precise methods of calculating service charges. But residential customers remain on the old system of rounding off each call to the next full minute, and pay an extra $2 billion a year in the process. [Page A1.]
Congress moved much closer to approving $30 billion more for the savings and loan bailout. Hundreds of failing savings and loans will have to be attended to. [D1.] 
 Most retailers report slow sales for February, with consumers apparently not showing much interest in spring clothing. [D1.]
The House of Representatives approved a $200 million grant to the states to help them speed the processing of applications for unemployment benefits. [A20.]
Consumer credit fell at a 4 percent annual rate in January, the Government reported. [D1.]
Three Congressmen say the Food and Drug Administration failed to take early action against abuses by some generic drug companies. [D3.]
The military won't try to use depictions of combat to attract recruits. Marketing and advertising officials say the reality of warfare could scare away potential enlistees. [D1.]
 
COMPANIES
NCR's chairman appeared to acknowledge that a takeover by A.T.&T. was all but inevitable. After a meeting with the company, analysts said Charles Exley accepted the idea that the deal would be completed. [D1.]

HEADLINE: Chief Seeks Charges in Police Beating

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 7

 BODY:
The Chief of Police of Los Angeles said today that he would seek felony criminal charges against three officers seen beating a prone suspect, apparently not resisting arrest, in an amateur videotape that has stirred national revulsion.
Calling the incident an aberration in a "well-disciplined department," Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said all 15 officers present at the beating late Sunday night would also face departmental charges. 
 He singled out the supervising sergeant at the scene who stood by while the officers rained from 53 to 56 nightstick blows on the subdued suspect and kicked him at least seven times, what Chief Gates conceded at a news conference was "excessive force" in a making an arrest.
Chief Gates said he did not seek criminal charges against the sergeant because he had not participated in the beating, apart from applying a shock from a stun gun, which he said was an accepted departmental procedure.
 
Defending the Department
 In his announcement, Chief Gates stoutly defended his department against charges that his officers regularly brutalized blacks and other minority members and defiantly rejected suggestions that he should resign.
"We do not and have never allowed our officers to use excessive force," he said, adding that two officers had been killed in the last four months and five shot. "Suddenly the tables are turned by one incident, and, unfortunately, we are painting 8,300 additional officers with this broad brush."
Today's action seemed unlikely to quiet the crescendo of calls for Chief Gates's resignation from political leaders who have charged he has failed to correct a pattern of police abuse.
"I have absolutely no thoughts of resigning," Chief Gates said.
His critics have included Mayor Tom Bradley, who met with his Police Commission, a five-member body that oversees the department but which has no authority to dismiss Chief Gates.
At news conference at City Hall this evening, Mayor Bradley, a former police officer, demanded a "speedy bringing to justice of the guilty," adding "This city will not tolerate that kind of conduct by its police officers."
He said the Police Commission would take a "comprehensive look" at the department's training and supervisory practices and at whether there were any patterns of racial discrimination in their behavior. He praised Mr. Gates for his action today, declining to renew his past criticism of the Chief.
 
Possible Assault Charges
 Chief Gates said that he would ask the District Attorney of Los Angeles County to bring criminal charges, probably including assault with a deadly weapon, against the three officers who could be identified in the videotape as administering the blows to Rodney Glen King, the 25-year-old suspect, after a chase on the Foothill Freeway in the northern part of the city.
Chief Gates said the names of the three officers would not be released until the District Attorney had filed charges.
Chief Gates was particularly critical of the sergeant because an explicit duty after a violent arrest is to prevent excited officers from inflicting unnecessary injury. He added that all other officers who did not intercede would be charged internally with neglect of duty.
A spokesman for District Attorney Ira Reiner said today that prosecutors were investigating the incident and that charges could be brought against more officers than just the three cited by Chief Gates.
The chief maintained race was not a factor in the beating. "We can turn up absolutely nothing except that the officers were white and the suspect black," he said.
With that much, at least, Mr. King apparently agreed. "We are not seeking to make a racial issue out of this," said one of his lawyers, Robert Rentzer. "This is simply a violation of one human being's human rights. It is a matter of human dignity, not a matter of racial dignity at this time."
He said Mr. King, an unemployed construction worker from Altadena who is on parole from a robbery conviction, was preparing to file a civil rights suit against the Police Department and had signed a criminal complaint against the men who beat him, at the request of the Police Department.
Mr. Rentzer said Mr. King would undergo tests to determine the extent of his injuries, including examinations of his eyes, a fractured ankle, possible internal injuries, a possible broken nose, dizziness and memory loss. He added that Mr. King's wife, Carol, would file a separate civil suit.
In defense of his officers, Chief Gates asserted that it was Mr. King who "created" the incident by speeding and evading arrest, adding that they suspected he was under the influence of alcohol or PCP, an illicit drug. The police report stated that Mr. King was driving at 115 miles an hour. Mr. Rentzer said tests were being conducted on the Hyundai sedan to determine whether it could have reached such a speed.
Chief Gates said he believed that Mr. King behaved in a threatening way at the beginning of the tape but that once he was on the ground and restrained further blows were "inappropriate."
Leaders of minority groups said the incident would have gone unnoticed had it not been videotaped by a man outside whose apartment the beating took place. The photographer, George Holliday, who lives in the San Fernando Valley, turned the tape over to a local independent television station, KTLA-TV, in Los Angeles, which gave it to the Cable News Network.
Chief Gates praised Mr. Holliday today as a citizen who "decided to get involved" and publicly assured him that his wife's fears of retribution by police officers were unfounded. He also thanked KTLA and Mayor Bradley.

HEADLINE: An Infant Boy Is Found Dead Of Starvation

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
An emaciated 7-month-old boy was found dead in a Bronx apartment yesterday morning, and the Medical Examiner's office said the child had died of starvation and dehydration.
The infant's mother, June Scott, 28, and his father, Jose Valez, 26, were arrested last night and charged with manslaughter and abandonment of the child. 
 Ms. Scott told investigators earlier yesterday that she had left her son, Daniel Scott, in the care of his father on the evening of March 1, Lieut. Donald Stephenson of the 44th Precinct detective squad said.
She was gone for six days, the lieutenant said. When she returned at 8 A.M. yesterday, he said, she found the child dead, lying next to his crib in the living room of her apartment on the second floor of 1106 Morris Avenue near East 166th Street in the Melrose section. There were small bruises on the child's forehead. Investigators said it appeared the starving baby had climbed out of the crib and fallen to the floor.
The police estimated the baby had been dead for at least 12 hours, and perhaps 16. He was dressed in a pair of filthy diapers. No food or baby formula was found in the apartment.
 
'Homicide by Neglect'
 Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office, said a coroner determined yesterday afternoon that the death was "homicide by neglect." The autopsy report said the baby had died from severe starvation and dehydration.
It was the second time in three weeks that the death of a baby in New York City was attributed to neglect. On Feb. 16, a month-old boy, Angel Lee, died en route to Harlem Hospital after falling unconscious in his parents' apartment at 227 West 145th Street in Harlem. A medical examiner later determined he had died of severe malnutrition and neglect. No charges have been filed against the parents, who have not been identified, but an investigation is continuing.
Miss Scott, who is unemployed, told the police that the baby's father was a homeless man who spent most of his time loitering on the streets near her apartment, Lieutenant Stephenson said.
Miss Scott told the police she had spent the six days she was gone on an extended crack binge, prostituting herself for drug money, the detective said.
"We're basically taking her word for the fact she wasn't there and she left the baby with the father," Lieutenant Stephenson said. "This is a horror story."

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
Sculpture Borne by the Earth and Lighted by the Sky

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON

 BODY:
Summer is no longer the only eventful season for outdoor sculpture. As sculpture -- so often costly to make and show -- seems more and more of an outcast in galleries during this economic crunch, it may be finding more of a home in New York City's parks and streets. Sculpture, and public art in general, now almost seems part of the fabric of New York rather than just a guest waiting, or sometimes demanding, to be invited in for a few months each year.
Not all the sculpture on view is worthy of attention; it never is. And some of the news from the outdoor-sculpture front is not good. Vandalism is so widespread that sculptors installing work outdoors have to consider it more than a remote possibility. But this is winter -- not summer, when sculpture is almost in the air -- and the thoughtful commitment to public art, throughout this city, is indicative of a healthy situation. 
 This winter offers three main events. One is taking place at the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center in the Bronx, which last year inaugurated a sculpture program unlike any other in the history of New York City. Another is at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, which is now the most influential and important outdoor sculpture site in New York. For sculptors and their supporters, these out-of-the-way parks are fields of dreams.
The third main event is taking place on bus shelters and billboards throughout the five boroughs. The promoter is the Public Art Fund, which commissioned works from Gran Fury, the Guerrilla Girls and Barbara Kruger. Their posters are nasty, alarming and absurd enough (those of Ms. Kruger feature photographs of hard-hat or yuppie men pleading for help after learning they are pregnant) to make some people think a bit differently about abortion, AIDS and censorship. Done well, this kind of art counters and questions the subliminal messages spread in subways and bus stops and other places where advertisements tend to be passively absorbed.
The Food Center Sculpture Park at Hunts Point is not yet a sculpture park but rather is an assortment of works installed in one of the largest food-market complexes in the world. The park's second annual exhibition is hardly even an exhibition, since there is no theme and little coherence to the selection and installation.
The roughly 20 works, most of them outdoors, include a number of John Ahearn's and Rigoberto Torres's portrait busts (from the mid-1980's) cast from ordinary people in the South Bronx, and Jonathan Silver's classically inspired "Small Venus" from 1979, an earthy yet fragmented nude that underlines the precariousness that can be felt throughout this site. The exhibition also includes a procession of abstract sculptures in wood and steel marching aimlessly across the pebbly front yard of the headquarters of National Foods.
More important than the limited success of this show is the very existence of sculpture in this raw, stripped-down neighborhood and the potential of this program to define many of the possibilities of sculpture in the 90's. It is startling to encounter sculptures behind barbed wire, or in a field alongside a Sanitation Department transfer station where garbage is loaded onto barges, or near Food Center Drive, a main thoroughfare on which an abandoned car that seems less stripped than raped can sit for weeks before authorities remove it.
If the future of the Hunts Point Sculpture Park is still up in the air, the next few years of the Socrates Sculpture Park look reasonably secure. The park has signed a temporary occupancy permit with the city through October 1992, and its officials hope to sign two more one-year permits afterward. The current exhibition, "No Man's Land," appears, like this park's previous exhibitions, to be something of a free-for-all, but it is in fact quite clear about the directions the park intends to follow.
There is nothing quite like this park. In its largely untamed site by the East River, visitors know right away this is not first of all their world. The park seems to belong to the sculptures, which over the years develop lives of their own. Only a sculptor -- Mark di Suvero, whose towering black steel beams preside over the park -- could have conceived a place in which sculpture can be so free.
Now for the bad news. The same climate of vulnerability and hostility that is creating more of a need for public art is also making it harder for it to survive. In the last year, one sculpture in the first annual Hunts Points exhibition was stolen; two sculptures in the current show at Socrates Sculpture Park were destroyed; an outdoor sculpture in TriBeCa was banged up, and a recent installation in a SoHo park had chained-in parts removed.
In light of this vandalism, public art in New York must be selected and installed with the kind of care that inspires respect. Some trivial works, like Keith Haring's sprightly red figures in Dante Park, in front of Lincoln Center, are probably harmless. Some, like Linda Cunningham's "Structural Transformations: An Environmental Memorial," a two-part installation that is totally out of place on the pavement of TriBeCa, are unfortunate. This installation combines natural and industrial materials like fossilized rock and steel and includes references to the fragility and survival of nature, but there is nothing redeeming about its materials or content. Such a work cannot make it easier for other outdoor sculptures to be protected and shown.
 
Food Center Sculpture Park at Hunts Point
Hunts Point Food Distribution Center
 The Bronx
 Through 1991
Although this exhibition includes several successful works, the Food Center Sculpture Park is still clearly searching for a firm foundation. The financing was very limited, only $15,000. One of the two site-specific projects, a sculpture by Martha Burgess, has yet to be installed. One other work, a mural by Richard Haas, is not yet in place. Some works accompanying the exhibition -- T-shirts and signs by Barbara Kruger and signs by Anton von Dalen -- are still being produced.
The sculptures with the most personality, by far, were made by Ming Fay for a small space by a staircase inside the wholesale produce market that looks a bit like a vast army barracks. In "Orange Queen," "Black Plum" and "Big Bosc," giant pieces of fruit seem to have been squeezed into packing crates so that each looks like an orangutan in a cage. In each work, the fruit seems imprisoned, eager to escape its commercial fate and gain the kind of freedom Mr. Fay confers on his fruit in his current SoHo installation at Exit Art (through March 23). The Chinese characters written on the crates suggest the exotic nature of the familiar freight. Stenciled letters on the crates spell out "handle with care" and "made in USA" and acknowledge the sponsors of the exhibition.
Other sculptures with some zip include Hank de Ricco's "Rounder" and "High Noon," both of which relate to activities in the market. Each of these wood sculptures looks like an armature: for a giant basket or refuse container ("Rounder"), or for a giant, crystalline toy or storage bin that can be stretched this way or that ("High Noon").
The exhibition provides an instructive example of how a site can affect art. In last year's show, the two wood sculptures by Peter Dudek were ineffective alongside company headquarters buildings. Now in an open field by the marine transfer station, the sculptures' taut grids and Mondrianlike colors bring to their bleak site a concentrated dose of energy and light.
The selection process for the exhibition was similar to last year's. The participating organizations either commissioned works or chose works from proposals made by a committee representing several commercial and arts organizations. The administrator of the show was Lyn Freeman, formerly of the Public Art Fund. Prominent figures in the sculpture park continue to be Sigmund R. Balka, the general counsel for Krasdale Foods; Coy LaSister, the director of markets for the City Department of Ports and Trade, and Betti-Sue Hertz of the Bronx Council on the Arts. For information on the show, call (212) 931-9500.
 
No Man's Land
Socrates Sculpture Park
 Broadway and Vernon Boulevard
 Long Island City, Queens
 Through March
"No Man's Land" provides a good idea of what the Socrates Sculpture Park is trying to do and where it is going. The exhibition gives gallery sculptors like Robin Hill a chance to show outdoors. It brings to New York sculptors like Vicki Scuri and Keith Oliver, who laid long shreds of tires in black paths that slither from the waterfront into the heart of the park. It encourages experimental work, with light (Ed Andrews) and water (Ray Kelly). Two large blue columns by the Mexican sculptor Sebastian demonstrate the park's interest in artists from outside the United States.
Several of the works are big. Mr. Andrews's 50-foot-tall column is made up of around 10 layers -- each resembling a stainless-steel grass skirt -- with a small wind sensor on top. The speed with which the sensor spins determines the amount of light produced by the neon camouflaged within the metal.
Jesse Moore is a talented young sculptor who is beginning to feel her oats. Her "Calling to Evangeline" brings to mind the big wood wheel by Martin Puryear and the wooden spokes in sculptures by Elizabeth Egbert. Her two wheels are enormous, and they support a long horn that can be looked through, as if it were a telescope, or spoken into, as if it were a megaphone trying to persuade the rest of the park and even Manhattan itself, across the river, to listen.
All the shows in this park are distinguished by a feeling for materials. Pat Dougherty is one of a number of contemporary sculptors looking to weave together industry and nature. His work includes a metal frame the size of a small house, which seems to have been settled by giant birds. Clusters of saplings are wound around two parts of the house. A third cluster sits on a lawn in the middle of the house like a child's castle or like the nest of a gigantic avian creature that will shortly return.
 
Mel Edwards
 Doris Freedman Plaza
 60th Street and Fifth Avenue
 Through May
"Tomorrow's Wind" is evidence of the large-scale, public-art side of Mel Edwards, who is best known for his small "Lynch Fragments" (a sculpture representing the third, polychrome side of his work is on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris). In June, "Tomorrow's Wind" is to be installed in the site for which it was made, Thomas Jefferson Park in East Harlem.
This 13 1/2-foot-tall, welded stainless-steel sculpture features a disk that tilts backward, reflecting light to the point where the heavy metal can seem like a silver sun. A second form, almost guarding the disk, is upright and blade-shaped. The third form looks like a piece of a house with a door cut out of it. With their hints of building blocks, tools, homes and stars, the forms are loaded with symbolic meaning.
The work is fully three-dimensional and loses its sculptural conviction only from the back, when it stops responding to its environment and turns inward. One problem people may have with the work is that its debt to the tradition of stainless-steel sculpture is so obvious. In his public art, Mr. Edwards is clearly less interested in originality than he is in making an intense and full human statement.
 
Gran Fury, Guerrilla Girls, Barbara Kruger
Bus shelters and billboards
New York City
On the 100 color posters by Gran Fury on bus shelters throughout the city, the English text (half the posters are in Spanish) includes the words: "Women don't get AIDS, they just die from it." In smaller letters, the posters call attention to the problem faced by women who test positive for the AIDS virus but whose infections don't fit the Centers for Disease Control's definition of AIDS, which Gran Fury says prevents these women from getting health care. In a kind of blue mist behind the letters are images of bathing beauties in a Miss America pageant. The reality of the words overpowers dreamy images of idealized women who seem little more than mouths and legs.
The posters by Barbara Kruger appear on 100 bus shelters around the city. One of her three images presents a young black man, another a middle-aged construction worker, another a yuppie father with his child. All have the word "help" plastered in red letters across their chests. On their bellies we read about their confusion now that they have found out they are pregnant and cannot follow the personal and professional lives they planned. The tone of these posters is deadpan. The effect is comic and pointed.
The Guerrilla Girls' poster, on 10 billboards throughout the city except Staten Island, is an attempt to link government control of women and censorship of art. "First they want to take away a woman's right to choose," read the red and black letters on a yellow ground. "Now they're censoring art." To the right of the words is an image of the "Mona Lisa" with a green fig leaf over her mouth. The poster has the Guerrilla Girls' graphic gift and ability to make a general point. It also has their weakness for blanket, us-versus-them statements that inflame passions and make it harder to think about actual, concrete situations.
(The Guerrilla Girls' posters remain up through March; the others remain up through April.)

PRESIDENT BUSH presented MARGARET THATCHER with the Presidential Medal of Freedom yesterday in the East Room of the White House. He recalled some advice the former British Prime Minister gave him during a telephone conversation early in the Persian Gulf crisis: "Remember, George: this is no time to go wobbly."
Mrs. Thatcher smiled as the President repeated her words and shifted in her chair as Mr. Bush said he kept her counsel in mind through the months leading up to the liberation of Kuwait.
Mr. Bush's citation, presented before guests who included former Secretary of State GEORGE P. SHULTZ and former Secretary of Defense CASPAR W. WEINBERGER, applauded Mrs. Thatcher for being a "steadfast and true ally and a firm friend of political and economic freedom throughout the world."

HEADLINE: Everywhere Flowers And a Topiary World

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The New York Flower Show has enough good-smelling greenery to shame a black-thumb gardener whose horticultural aspirations always seem to wither in the original pot on the way home from the neighborhood 5-and-10-cent store. With two acres of blossoms and blooms and trompe l'oeil gardens running the length of a huge pier on the Hudson River, the flower show is the kind of inspiration a luckless amateur needs to pick up a trowel and try again.
After all, every blade of grass at the flower show came in through the door. The weeping pine trees were hauled in from Oregon, the sod from Maryland, the bridal wreaths from Rikers Island. The conversation piece at the Garden Club of America exhibit is the conversation piece azalea. Josyane Colwell, who helped coordinate the display, said she put 3,000 miles on her car finding it, tracking down the right stone for the wall and locating the perfect mulch. 
 After planting and trimming and sculpturing, the exhibitors have hosed the mud off the floor and stowed away the hand trucks on which they wheeled in all the shrubs and flowers. The logistics were so complicated that one nursery in Rockland County in New York tried to deliver what it needed on a barge.
People attending the show, at Pier 92, can come by land.
 
Where the Bears Are
 The sponsor is the New York Horticultural Society, which is raising money for its community-service projects like Greenworks, which keeps a greenhouse on Rikers Island well stocked and well tended by inmates.
Each day will bring a celebration of a different theme. Japan Day, City Gardener Day and Daffodil Day are all on the schedule, with three lectures each day.
And each day will give visitors a peek at unseen props of the city. The Parks Department raided its warehouses and came up with items that no longer grace parks and monuments: an urn designed by McKim, Mead & White, a forest of elegant old-fashioned lampposts and a family of cast-iron bears that had been in a storage room under the Triborough Bridge. Not to worry. They are not as massive or menacing as their grizzly cousins in Alaska.
To someone befuddled by mere begonias, the fantasy world created by the 50 nurseries, florists, plant societies and garden clubs is nothing less than mind boggling.
"People seem to think that you freeze-dry the materials and haul them out of the closet once a year and fluff off the tulips," said Michael Riley of the Horticulture Society.
If only it were that simple. Spring begins in less than two weeks, but in the make-believe world of flower shows, it has to come early. So gardeners simulate spring in hothouses -- they call it forcing the blooms and blossoms -- to produce all those brilliant azaleas, rhododendrons, tulips and daffodils. Never mind global warming and ozone depletion. This is the greenhouse effect.
 
Dorothy's Green Slippers
 Flower shows cut across the social and economic strata of society, offering something for everyone, no matter how elaborate the displays, Mr. Riley said. Someone with a box and a sunny window can come away with planting tips. And someone with a big house and a big budget may borrow ideas from the elegant-looking town house gardens done by interior designers.
One is Cumulus IX, which is Cloud 9 to those who can never remember the names of the fuzzy white shapes in the sky or Roman numerals. It looks like a playful rendering of a Manhattan town house. The equally playful garden comes with mosaic stars and topiary shoes, a green greenhouse.
 
Where and When
 The New York Flower Show is to run through March 17 at Pier 92, 51st Street and the Hudson River in Manhattan. Weekend hours are 10 A.M to 8 P.M. today and 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday. Tickets are $8 today and $10 tomorrow and Sunday. Information: (212) 757-0915. The Long Island Rail Road is offering a free shuttle bus to the show from Penn Station and reduced admission to the show with a round-trip ticket. Information: (718) 217-5477 or (516) 822-5477.

HEADLINE: Gallery Etiquette: A Duel of Dealers and Browsers

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
WHEN the art dealer Holly Solomon had her gallery on the ground floor of a SoHo building, the scene got so vivid on Saturday afternoons that she put up a sign banning skateboards and fast foods. Then a kiddie stroller collided disastrously with a sculpture, and she added "No Strollers" to the list. Under it, the next day, she found a sardonic scrawl: "No People."
Things are more decorous now that the gallery is tucked away on the fifth floor of an imposing building on Fifth Avenue near 57th Street. But the faceoff between people and art can still be wearing. "I don't like it when they show disrespect for the work," she said, giving voice to a certain tension that exists between dealers and their visitors, a kind of love-hate relationship that can sometimes make the weekend gallerygoing experience in Manhattan a tribulation for both sides. 
 Dealers complain that visitors ask for prices or tips about neighborhood restaurants before they look at the art. They say they let their pets sniff, lick or chew the work, indulge in social chit-chat while they're looking, and request "something pastelly" for their living rooms.
Gallerygoers say that dealers deliberately foster a rarefied atmosphere -- what one calls the "Studio 54 mystique" -- aimed at making visitors feel it's a privilege to enter their precincts; that they assess prospective buyers by the way they are dressed, and that they make them feel, well, insecure about the art they are showing.
"I always check myself over before I visit the Mary Boone Gallery," said Marcia King, a well-groomed painter who actually seems to enjoy looking at other artists' work. "They scrutinize you like they have the profile of who's going to bomb an airplane." Other weekend gallerygoers complain about what they insist is a dress code not only at this particular SoHo emporium, but at many others, uptown and down, in which they say they are not-so-subtly given the onceover by staff members.
"A lot of front-desk people size you up to see if you're stylish enough," said Patti Kolodny of Princeton, N.J. "It's like saying, 'We're very busy; is it worth spending 20 minutes with you, are you going to buy?" With her husband, Frank, she has been collecting contemporary art for 20 years and remembers the good old days when dealers said hello before you bought. "But they're in a retail business, and in this time of recession they're going to have to learn to give real service again," she added.
Mary Boone, whose SoHo establishment does not have a reputation for coziness, is unmoved by such criticism. "If people feel intimidated or uncomfortable, it's because of their own preconceptions," she said. "They buy into cliches about galleries. And I don't subscribe to the idea that people have to be educated in art to look at it. I invite all kinds of communication, except hostility. I don't like people who say, aggressively but in an uninformed way, 'You mean this is art?' "
Dealers also dismiss the idea that they are influenced by what their visitors are wearing. "Believe me, I've found that the more they put on their backs, the less they put into art," said Marilyn Pearl, proprietor of a SoHo gallery bearing her name.
Irving Blum of the Blum Helman Gallery on West 57th Street said he didn't give two hoots about his visitors' get-up. "Once at the Ferus in the 70's," said Mr. Blum, recalling a Los Angeles gallery in which he was a partner, "a flower-generation guy came in wearing a white robe and thongs. He was very interested in a couple of small paintings, and said he'd have to go get the money to buy them. He was back in an hour carrying a bag stuffed with $100 bills. It turned out that his mother was a Brazilian coffee heiress." Since then, Mr. Blum said, he has not paid too much attention to what people are wearing.
 
The Favored Few
 More plaintive than the protests over clothes checks are those about dealers distancing themselves from all but favored clients. At galleries handling the works of sought-after artists -- Jasper Johns, Anselm Kiefer, Eric Fischl and the like -- visitors off the street (called "boardwalk traffic" in the trade) stand little or no chance of buying one, no matter how heavy their wallets. Such works are not sold over the counter; dealers reserve them for museums and other committed, deep-pocket clients who are often themselves on a highly competitive waiting list.
But some dealers don't bother at all, say gallerygoers, with potential buyers of less expensive works. They callously leave them to the tender mercies of the front desk, not going out of their way to greet them or encourage their interest. A lawyer with a mild feeling for art reports that last year he visited a certain SoHo gallery, looked at the paintings on view, then asked the desk clerk for information about the artist and the works. "They're all sold," was the response. Squelched, the lawyer left, his interest in art even milder than before.
But the blame was partly his, in the view of some seasoned buyers. "You don't act meek when you visit a gallery," said Gerald Elliott of Chicago, known for his collection of contemporary art. "If you do that, you never get by the front desk, and that's where the intimidation comes from, the kids sitting at the front desk who have a great degree of self-importance. You have to come into a gallery and assert yourself. If you can crack the front desk and get to the dealer, he or she will probably be genuinely nice. After all, we're through with the 1980's, when business was so good that they could afford to be haughty."
Still, dealers are often at a loss as to how to play host, Holly Solomon suggested. "It's hard for a dealer to decide how friendly to be," she said. "Half the time I figure if people want to say hello, they will. But sometimes they want to be anonymous. I tend to be shy myself, but sometimes I stop to talk, try to be hospitable and courteous and answer questions and maybe sell a painting. But at the same time I want to give people a little air and privacy. It's very tricky."
 
How to Be Sophisticated
 Anyway, how do you crack the staff at the front desk, which may itself be suffering from visitor burn-out? You could snow them with art lingo by boning up on, say, the current issue of Artforum. Use words like "contextualization," and bandy such phrases as "the perfect paradigm for the slippery dialectic between illusion and literality" or, "expressive rhetoric and the knowing stance of style revisited." But this can backfire, like trying your few shards of Hungarian in Budapest. What happens when you're answered in the same language and you've exhausted your repertory?
No, it may be better to do a little homework, as Irving Blum suggests. "It's important to be somewhat knowledgeable," he says. "Otherwise there just isn't enough time for the dealer to come out and focus. Or you can confess your naivete in advance of coming to the gallery. If someone calls me and says I don't know a lot but can I come in when it's convenient for you and get a brief immersion, I wouldn't resist. If you want special attention, you have to do a little homework, then call the dealer and engage him."
Lisa Spellman, proprietor of the 303 Gallery, which deals in some of the more challenging species of contemporary art, feels her SoHo gallery is providing a service in mounting shows. "But we have a small staff," she said, "and I lose my patience when people come in and want an art history seminar, say on the development of figuration through the late 20th century. I tell them to get a library card."
The need for homework is not accepted by some seasoned gallerygoers, however. "I don't think a person has the obligation to study up on an artist," said Norman Dubrow, a collector of contemporary drawings. "There are so many galleries. Dealers have to approach things with a little modesty and respect people's intelligence. They have to understand that everything they're showing isn't a masterpiece; in fact, a lot of it isn't very good."
Buyers who want to display real savvy, Mr. Dubrow advises, should ask for a discount when they are ready to close a sale. "It's so common in the trade," he added. "If they don't want to give it to you, they won't."
 
Buyers' Revenge
 Dealers are more likely to do that these days than they were a year or two ago. There are signs in the current recession that after a 10-year sellers' market, buyers are beginning to exact revenge for having been put on hold. "Now that they sense a weakened moment, they're zeroing in for the kill," said Lisa Spellman. "They're creating an antagonistic atmosphere by canceling or reneging on sales and bargaining for absurd prices. And whereas they bought or are trying to buy at low prices, they're now bringing back works for dealers to sell at highly inflated ones."
But such handwringing does not move Alan Hergott, an entertainment lawyer from Los Angeles, who feels he has had his share of put-downs by New York dealers. "A lot of collectors have been treated badly," he said. "There's been a pecking order, and people have been put on various planes. But the worm is turning, and collectors will have their day."
One of the few dealers that gallerygoers seem to have no quarrel with is the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo, which gets high marks for hospitality and helpfulness even from dedicated kvetchers. What is Sonnabend's secret? "We really think pretty much about interesting people in what we are interested in," said Antonio Homem, the gallery's co-director. "What we're trying to convey is our enthusiasm for and belief in artists. If there are going to be sales, they'll follow from there."
But even he is a little ambivalent. "I sometimes think if we played a bit harder to get," he said, "people would like it a lot more."

HEADLINE: Level With Labor -- and New York City

 BODY:
Municipal labor leaders are furious, and who can blame them? A misleading memo from New York City's Budget Director, Philip Michael, told a bond rating agency that negotiations were under way to defer part of the wage increases they had just won.
The episode -- an all-too-familiar display of City Hall ineptitude and internal feuding -- is yet more troubling evidence that Mayor David Dinkins still hasn't faced up to the urgency of the city's fiscal crisis, or the need to enlist labor and business in cooperative efforts to solve it. Having agreed to wage settlements the city cannot afford, Mr. Dinkins has yet to muster the courage to fully level with his old political allies in labor about the sacrifices now required for the city's survival, sacrifices he is apparently already counting on. 
 The need for stronger action by City Hall to avert fiscal disaster is underscored by a new report from the State Financial Control Board. It charges that the Mayor's latest financial plan "disguises the persistence of imbalance" and will lead to billion-dollar budget deficits in future years.
Mr. Dinkins says the problem with the memo to Moody's Investors Service was that it suggested negotiations were already under way to defer wages, when the city had only informally broached the subject in general terms with union leaders. That sounds like fudging. The memo was sent last month in an unsuccessful effort to forestall a drop in the city's bond rating. Essentially, City Hall was trying to tell a rating agency what it thought it wanted to hear, just as it was telling the unions what they wanted to hear when it approved higher wages. That's not a fiscal policy; that's incoherence.
The new report from the Financial Control Board makes clear the city's need to find several hundred million dollars in wage and benefit savings, productivity gains and other items. Why, a month after Mr. Michael's memo, have there still been no concrete talks about deferring wages?
New York's municipal labor leaders, and the employees they represent, were crucial partners in helping the city through the 1975 fiscal crisis. When tempers cool, there is reason to hope they will again rally to save the city. But that can't happen unless the Mayor unambiguously owns up to the reality of the situation, and develops a sound fiscal plan.

HEADLINE: Fine, 100 Days. But for What?

 BODY:
The challenge President Bush put to Congress Wednesday could hardly have been plainer. We have won the war in the gulf, he said. Now we must apply the same urgency and self-discipline "here at home." Then, invoking F.D.R., he sharpened the challenge: "If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely the Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days."
What legislation? Mr. Bush's roar brought forth two mice: a crime bill that would do little to fight crime. And a proposal to repair old roads and build new ones. Hardly a vision to send the Congressional troops charging out of the trenches. 
 Nobody could reasonably have denied George Bush his night in the sun, his right to savor the accolades for orchestrating the Persian Gulf war. And what a night it was: a pep rally and the State of the Union rolled into one, with flag-wearing Republicans and even dyspeptic Democrats on their feet, applauding again and again.
Mr. Bush resisted the temptation to criticize those in Congress who had opposed the war. He struck exactly the right notes about converting the "horrors of war" into a new "momentum for peace," especially peace between Israelis and Arabs. He was also right to summon Congress to convert triumph abroad into renewal at home. Yet it quickly became clear that Mr. Bush has either no coherent idea of how to do that or no compelling desire to do so.
The subjects of Mr. Bush's domestic proposals are worthy enough, although he might have chosen other examples to adumbrate his vision. The crime bill is in part a sop to death penalty advocates, and does nothing about the availability of the weapons that create so much urban carnage. The transportation plan would promote new highways but shortchange mass transit. Given the nation's energy and environmental concerns, Mr. Bush seems to have his priorities backward.
Yet even if these were sterling proposals, what kind of agenda do they make? True, there's not a lot of money lying around for big domestic initiatives. But that's all the more reason to ask for a sharper sense of priorities from the White House. The big problems are not hard to identify: a medical care system hopelessly out of control, states and cities staggering under impossible burdens, an educational system that leaves the nation increasingly vulnerable to international competition.
The public sees the discontinuity between Mr. Bush's strength abroad and his diffidence at home. He gets extraordinarily high marks for his handling of foreign policy -- 83 percent approval, according to today's New York Times/CBS Poll. Yet he fails to persuade even a bare majority that he's really interested in doing something about the economy or drugs or education.
There was a point in the speech when Mr. Bush, honoring the soldiers, came close to acknowledging the discrepancy. "We hear so often about our young people in turmoil, how our children fall short, how our schools fail us, how American products and American workers are second class. Well don't you believe it. The America we saw in Desert Storm was first-class talent."
It was indeed first class. And why? One reason, of course, was the dedication and spirit of the American forces. But another, surely, was that Mr. Bush gave them conviction, clarity of purpose and a gambler's courage. That is the job of a leader. At home, too.

HEADLINE: Hard Passage in India

 BODY:
India's politicians emerge with little glory from the quarrels that have brought down Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's minority Government. If they now maneuver to avoid elections, Mr. Shekhar's opponents can only deepen a crisis that has shaken the world's most populous democracy.
Giving the people a chance to judge their rulers has for the first time become prevailing practice elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan and Bangladesh have each recently transferred power through democratic elections, and tiny Nepal is about to follow suit by conducting the first contested elections in three decades. 
 When India last voted in 1989, an ambivalent electorate turned against Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party but failed to give a majority to any of its rivals. Successive Prime Ministers -- V. P. Singh and then Mr. Shekhar -- formed wobbly coalitions or minority regimes, each weakened by corrupting intrigues and venal party-switching. The result was disarray as India was shaken by separatist risings, communal clashes between Hindus and Muslims, and an economic crisis heightened by the Persian Gulf conflict.
Initially supported by Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Shekhar has turned bitterly against his former ally. Their breach ostensibly is owed to a petty scandal -- the posting by a local government of police snoopers outside Mr. Gandhi's home. More substantive was an earlier quarrel over the Government's agreement to refuel American military aircraft headed for the gulf. Mr. Shekhar insisted they were carrying non-lethal cargo, but Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Singh said this still collided with India's nonalignment.
What matters most from an American vantage is the promise of an election that can yield a stable government. Having led the way to self-government in South Asia, it would be curious indeed for India to evade the normal remedy for failure: a vote.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Break the Boycott

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The high-level emergency meeting of the Arab nations was held in private, in Damascus. It was called to deal with just one subject: the economic strangulation of Israel.
Representatives of Iraq and Kuwait were at the table, eagerly taking part. That was in July of 1990. 
 A couple of weeks later, the Iraqis gave the Kuwaitis something else to think about. Saddam Hussein taught them that their real enemy was not the distant Jewish nation but the Muslim neighbor next-door.
Now the very viciousness of the destruction of Kuwait gives its people and its Government the chance to bring peace an important step closer -- by turning away from that meeting in Damascus and what it means.
A little history. In 1948 the Arab nations imposed a boycott and embargo against Israel. Any company in the world that trades with Israel or makes any investment in the country is forbidden to do any business with any Arab state -- no oil deals, no investments, no exports or imports, no construction contracts, nothing.
The embargo has been a shackle on the Israeli economy. For foreign investors it meant lost opportunities. But for the Arab governments it is a fine way of controlling businesses around the world, including huge multinational corporations. And not incidentally, it gives the Arab states extra clout with trade-hungry governments -- Germany and Japan among many others.
The Damascus meeting was held at the request of the Palestine Liberation Organization to expand the boycott to any company that helps Soviet Jews settle in Israel. That would mean transportation, housing construction, insurance, hotel space, anything.
A half-year later, Kuwait is burning. It will cost at least $50 billion to reconstruct the country -- money Kuwait will draw from its enormous foreign holdings.
Will Kuwait continue the boycott and prevent companies doing business with Israel from getting reconstruction contracts?
Under U.S. law, American companies cannot tell the Arabs whether they do business with Israel. Now and then the Arabs decide that a particular American company is too important to them to blacklist even if it does business with Israel -- like weapons manufacturers or communications giants.
But most companies don't take chances. In the United States and the rest of the world an astounding number of companies have decided they are not interested in profitable business -- Israeli business. The Japanese have shown a particular aversion and Japan Air Lines can't seem to find Israel on the map.
The embargo became more powerful with the growth of multinational companies. Some of these huge multinationals specialize in the massive kind of construction Kuwait will need. They parcel out work to hundreds of smaller companies. Those known to do business with Israel don't get subcontracts.
 It will not be enough for the Kuwaitis to remain silent or allow a few companies that do have some business with Israel to take part in the rebuilding. Without a clear statement, business will assume the boycott continues, just as if the Persian Gulf war never happened.
American companies that do business with Israel stand to lose billions in Kuwaiti contracts. For their employees, that will be more emotional a matter than the Kuwaiti kisses planted on American soldiers.
Contracts are not nearly as important as the Kuwaiti opportunity to take one step toward Mideast conciliation. A couple of days ago I asked the Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington what Kuwait intended to do, and await a reply.
 I am not brimming over with optimism. The Kuwaiti Government has shown a taste for particular nastiness about Israel. But then I think -- Saddam Hussein and the P.L.O. opened a lot of Kuwaiti minds. Maybe they also opened some Kuwaiti hearts to the truth about friends and enemies.
 President Bush talked to Congress about the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the Palestinians. Immediately his words were interpreted as a threat to Israel. But it is better to wait, think and talk before pronouncing.
In any case, Mr. Bush knows no settlement can be imposed. Even Stormin' Norman can't help here. And he knows that nothing at all will move until the Arab states take a step that will cost them not a soldier, not a drop of oil, not an inch of land: ending the state of war with Israel.
Right now, the U.S., liberator of the Kuwaitis, has both the right and duty to ask them to do their part by turning the boycott, an act and weapon of war, into scrap.

Money in the Bank

 BODY:

How safe is your money when a bank or savings and loan institution fails? Federal regulators have a three-option plan: the institution can be sold, closed or its deposits transferred to another institution. Here is a guide to how depositors fare in each instance.
 
Closure: All accounts are closed; all insured depositors' money and any earned interest will be returned. 
 Sale: All accounts are automatically reopened with the new owner, often including uninsured balances over $100,000. The new bank or thrift has the option of lowering pre-existing C.D. rates, at which point the money can be withdrawn without penalty.
 
Transfer: Same conditions as sale, except that only insured amounts on deposit are usually transferred. Amounts above the insured amount of $100,000 could be at risk.

HEADLINE: Romanian Money Rules

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, March 8

 BODY:
Officials announced today that most restrictions on foreign exchange in Romania would be abolished in an effort to heal the economy and curb the black market.
The move is part of a package recommended by the International Monetary Fund, which will give Romania roughly $1 billion in aid on the condition that it swiftly puts a free market in place. 
 The national bank director, Mugur Isarescu, said the first installment of the grant was a $300 million loan from the Bank of International Settlements, which includes the national banks of the leading industrialized nations. The United States Federal Reserve provided $40 million of the loan, he said.
Mr. Isarescu said that beginning in April, some organizations and individuals would be permitted to trade in foreign currency through several authorized banks.
The national bank began experimental hard-currency trading in February, but it was limited to approved import-export companies.
The Government also plans to remove price controls on food in April, leaving energy as the only important area that will still be subsidized.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Advance by Dollar Surprises Many Traders

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a surprisingly strong advance yesterday despite declining interest rates and further negative data on the United States economy.
Traders said there was a strong demand for dollars on markets around the world, and many were puzzled by the keen interest in the currency. 
 The Labor Department's report on unemployment in February showed the jobless rate higher than expected, climbing to 6.5 percent from 6.2 percent in January.
Payrolls fell by 184,000 in February, the seventh straight month that more industries cut jobs than added them. Some traders were braced for a decline of 200,000 jobs, which may have accounted for the report's lack of effect on the dollar.
"Some are saying the bad news was priced in," said Jim McGroarty, a senior vice president at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn.
Later, analysts said, the Federal Reserve acted to push interest rates lower, another factor that is typically negative for the dollar, because lower American interest rates make investments in dollar-denominated securities less attractive. The central bank's move to add reserves to the banking system was widely interpreted as a signal that it had embarked on another round of easing credit.
Some traders speculated that much of the demand for the dollar was coming from the Middle East, since market fundamentals would call for a lower dollar.
Gilbert Cisneros, a trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York, said there were reports that dollar-buying was coming from Kuwait, which, he said, "needs to buy a lot of dollars to pay for reconstruction."
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.67 yen, to a closing 136.30 yen. Later in London, it was quoted lower at 136.20 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 136.82 yen, up from 135.65 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8720, from $1.8865 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.8645 to buy a pound, cheaper than the $1.8885 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5700 German marks, up from 1.5460; 1.3692 Swiss francs, up from 1.3480; 5.3515 French francs, up from 5.2645; 1,174.00 Italian lire, up from 1,154.50, and 1.1614 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1594.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5625 German marks, up from 1.5465; 1.3640 Swiss francs, up from 1.3495; 5.3210 French francs, up from 5.2675; 1.7610 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7430; 1,167.50 Italian lire, up from 1,155.25, and 1.1618 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1595.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Soars and Gold Is Up; Near-Term Oil Prices Dip

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver futures prices soared yesterday, marking a partial recovery from 17-year lows, as hopes for an economic turnaround continued.
Silver futures settled up 19.2 cents to 21.2 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in March at $4.162 an ounce, the highest daily settlement of spot silver since Jan. 16. The March contract traded as high as $4.195 during the session. 
 Gold prices also advanced. Gold for current delivery rose $2.80 an ounce to settle at $369.70 on the Commodity Exchange. The April contract was at $371.20 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank's late bid for gold was $369.50, up $2.90.
 
 Platinum Finishes Higher
 Platinum was $10.80 to $10.90 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the April contract at $411.40 an ounce.
Near-term crude oil futures fell slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange in quiet dealings before next week's OPEC meeting.
Traders sold positions near the end of the day, partly to hedge against changes in the market when the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet on Monday in Geneva to discuss crude production.
Light sweet crude oil ended 14 cents lower to 6 cents higher, with April at $19.31 a barrel. Heating oil was 0.16 cent to 0.49 cent lower, with April at 55.39 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline was 0.64 cent lower to 0.55 cent higher, with April at 69.98 cents a gallon. Natural gas was 1 cent lower to 0.7 cent higher, with April at $1.359 per 1,000 cubic feet.
 
Rose on Recovery Hopes
 Silver and platinum prices have risen sharply since late February on a belief that the end of the Persian Gulf war will speed an economic recovery in the United States and raise industrial demand for those metals. Unemployment figures for February showed continuing economic weakness, however, and prompted the Federal Reserve to lower an important interest rate.
Don Tierney, metals analyst with Fortune Commodities Inc., said lower interest rates to stimulate industrial production had helped silver and platinum.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Swing Wildly and End Lower

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Treasury securities market was buffeted by wild price swings yesterday, with dealers citing confusion about the apparent easing of credit by the Federal Reserve. The Fed did lower a key interest rate, but confusion remained.
Those who believed the Fed had indeed eased credit cited the systemwide infusion of reserves into the banking system at a time when most banks appeared well stocked with money. They also noted that the central bank moved to add reserves at 11:27 A.M., a few minutes earlier than it normally intervened in the credit market. For many Fed watchers such subtle moves are taken as bold statements. 
 "Of course the Fed eased interest rates, because any time the central system injects a large amount of reserves, interest rates will come under pressure," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, and a leading credit market expert. "But there are still people in the Street who have their doubts. The doubters weren't the only ones who contributed to the disarray we witnessed today."
 
 Fair Buying Overnight
 As Mr. Sullivan reconstructed the volatile session, he noted that Treasury bonds had enjoyed fair buying support overnight in Tokyo and Europe and were expected to extend their gains when the New York market opened, on the strength of expectations that a Government's report on employment would show the jobless rate rising. That in turn would allay inflation fears.
When the Government reported at 8:30 that unemployment in February soared three-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.5 percent, a four-year high, bond prices rose sharply, with the Treasury's benchmark long bond quickly soaring to what was to be its high during the day, 96 20/32.
In late trading, however, the bellwether long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, were being offered at 95 9/32, down 31/32 on the day, after hitting a low of 95 6/32. At 95 9/32, the long bond's yield climbed to 8.30 percent, from 8.21 percent the day before and 8.27 percent one week ago.
 
Roiled by Debate
 "Between the high and low," Mr. Sullivan continued, "the market was roiled not only by the debate over whether the Fed had eased or whether it had made a statement to that effect, but also by reports that Middle East interests were unloading some of the huge amount of Treasury bonds they bought when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Finally, there was the latest University of Michigan survey indicating a revival of consumer confidence."
What was not in question was that the Federal Reserve added a large amount of funds to the banking system through weekend repurchase agreements. These "repo" operations involve the Fed's purchase of Treasury securities, mostly bills and short-term notes, from dealers and some other financial entities, with the clear understanding that the sellers will buy back them back at the stated time.
The purpose of the exercise is to cause a large amount of funds to be deposited at once into banks by the "sellers." When the Fed wants to drain reserves from the banking system, it effects reverse repos, also referred to as matched sales, under the same terms, which in both cases make it financially worthwhile for the dealers and other participants.
 
Aimed at Funds Rate

In either case, Fed repo operations are really aimed at moving what is referred to as the Federal funds rate up or down. The funds rate is what banks charge one another for temporary loans and is thus considered the basic cost of credit. In theory, all other interest rates are based on the funds rate. The funds rate is also the only interest rate the Fed has direct control over.
When the Fed intervened, funds were trading at 6 1/8 percent, below the 6 1/4 percent level that has recently been perceived as the rate favored by the Fed. This also contributed to the belief the Fed was easing credit.

HEADLINE: Needed for Tough Times: A $75 Tie

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
For 77 years, American men of means have bought suits bearing the label of Oxxford Clothes, probably the nation's highest-priced domestic suits, at $1,100 to $2,500 each.
Now Oxxford, feeling the recession's pinch and hedged in by a self-limiting market, is looking to pick up some extra revenue by expanding its offerings to shirts, ties and cologne. 
 But will customers impressed by the Oxxford name and quality be willing to pay $100 for a shirt and $60 to $75 for a tie?
Jack R. McDonald, president of the Chicago-based Oxxford, thinks so. For the first time in its long history, his company is planning to add other items to go with its suits in stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Tripler's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York.
The new products are not being sold yet. In fact, Mr. McDonald is still looking for shirt, neckwear and other companies whose standards are high and that are willing to be acquired.
The Oxxford strategy to diversify into new products that would bear its brand name has been tried by others. But most brand transfers are accomplished through licensing and most fail, because the brand extension is too far afield from the original brand.
Hallmark Cards and Benson & Hedges tried to extend their brand names into luxury ball point pens, but the tests were not especially successful. Cartier jewelry granted a license to a company producing Cartier cigarettes, but that effort never took off.
In Oxxford's case, Mr. McDonald said he felt confident of his plan because the additions would be closely related to the original product, would attract the same customers and would be made by acquired companies, giving the parent the opportunity for direct quality control.
Despite what he called chaotic business conditions, Mr. McDonald said Oxxford's sales were ahead about 4 percent this year over the same time in 1990. He conceded, though, that the increase included a price rise to cover an October labor-rate increase and higher wool prices. That means his sales are essentially down.
Asked if slow business was a reason for the plan to diversify, Mr. McDonald acknowledged that it was but said it was not the main one.
 
 Pressure From Retailers
 "The real pressure comes from retailers who have been asking us to make other products," he said.
"We think that the combination of new products can add $10 million to $15 million to our present annual sales of $25 million," he said in a recent interview while visiting New York. "This should be accomplished within the year. The major problem is finding products with the appropriate quality that we put into our suits."
Some retailers confirmed their interest in new Oxxford lines.
"Aside from the competitive shirts and ties we 'marry' with Oxxford suits, I think our customers would welcome haberdashery with the Oxxford label," said John Fresco, vice president and merchandise manager for men's wear at Saks. "Some of our customers and our salespeople have been asking if this would be available."
Fred Pressman, president of Barneys, said: "If Oxxford would show us their own shirts and ties, I'd be interested in buying them. Their products represent the finest quality, and I'm sure that the new ones would be similar."
 
 High Degree of Handwork
 Oxxford's reputation for a quality that matches its high prices comes largely from the high degree of handwork and the expensive, imported fabrics it uses.
Oxxford garments are produced only when an order for them is received from the retailer. The suits are 90 percent handmade, with only the seams constructed by machine to reinforce them. Each garment is divided into sections, so that specialists among the 385 workers in the Chicago factory can develop strong skills in making each part of the suit.
Most clothing makers sell to several thousand retailers, but Oxxford restricts its distribution to 102 retailers who operate 165 stores because, Mr. McDonald said, department stores and others are not equipped adequately to sell and support the Oxxford line.
 
 No Sales Staff
 Also unusual is that Oxxford has no sales staff. It does all of its selling from its headquarters on Van Buren Street in Chicago. Store buyers visit that showroom twice a year to place orders, for spring and summer and for fall and winter.
Oxxford was founded in 1914 by Louis and Jack Weinberg, who decided on the distinctive spelling of Oxxford so as to differentiate it from the Oxford Manufacturing Company, a Southern clothing maker, and oxford cloth, a soft but durable fabric. One of its first big retail customers was Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based specialty-store chain, where in 1960 Mr. McDonald, who is from Chicago, became vice president.
In the mid-1960's when the Weinberg brothers began thinking of retirement, Mr. McDonald became concerned about what might happen to Oxxford's quality under new owners and suggested to Stanley Marcus, then chairman of Neiman Marcus, that he consider buying the company. Instead, the company was purchased by Byer-Rolnick, the hat and apparel maker in Dallas, which promptly decided on a new president -- Mr. McDonald.
Oxxford Clothes is now owned by Thomas H. Lee, the Boston financier who is also a large shareholder in other companies; the Harvard University Endowment Fund; Mr. McDonald, and four others.

HEADLINE: Economic Lift Is Predicted

DATELINE: PARIS, March 8

 BODY:
The end of the Persian Gulf war should lift the world's leading industrial economies out of a slowdown, a senior German monetary official said today.
Lower oil prices and increasing private sector confidence will contribute to stronger second-quarter growth, said Hans Tietmeyer, a member of the board of the Bundesbank, German' central bank.
Mr. Tietmeyer and top monetary officials of the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development met here Thursday and today to discuss the postwar economy.
"We're seeing more arguments in favor of a new upturn than of a global recession," Mr. Tietmeyer said, adding that prospects are better for 1992 than for 1991.
Officials at the meeting stressed the need for the United States and other countries, including Germany, to cut their budget deficits.

HEADLINE: Latest Victim of Airline Slump

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 8

 BODY:
The hard times in the airline industry claimed another victim today when Air Europe, a large British carrier, and its parent, the International Leisure Group Ltd., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors and grounded the airline's fleet, stranding 25,000 people.
And in another sign that airlines expect no quick recovery from the severe downturn gripping the industry, British Airways, Britain's largest airline, said it was withdrawing from five unprofitable routes. It is ending service between Gatwick Airport near London and Stockholm; Barcelona; Karachi, Pakistan; Banjul, Gambia, and Freetown, Sierra Leone. 
 British Airways had previously announced that it would withdraw from other routes, make big cuts in its work force and delay the delivery of ordered planes. "Since then, the situation has not improved and we have had to look closely at further uneconomic parts of the route network," Liam Strong, director of marketing and operations at British Airways, said today.
 
 'A Bad Omen'

Although dwarfed by British Airways, Air Europe expanded quickly and became Britain's second-largest scheduled international carrier. It has a fleet of 37 planes, 2,000 employees and offered scheduled service to 19 destinations in Europe, mostly from Gatwick Airport but also from Manchester. It also offered charter service in Europe and to Orlando, Fla.; North Africa, and East Asia.
Analysts said Air Europe was in the vanguard of the new airlines trying to exploit the opportunities created by the continuing deregulation of the European airline industry. The market is dominated by a handful of large carriers, most of which are at least partly owned by governments.
"The financial collapse of Air Europe is a bad omen because what it in effect says is the cost of entering the market is prohibitive," said Richard Whitaker, editor of Airline Business, a trade magazine. "Air Europe offered real competition because it flew head to head with major carriers on major routes like Paris and Brussels and offered cheaper fares."
Peter Bergius, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd., commented, "There will be other small airlines that go under or are forced to link with others." A small German carrier, German Wings, went out of business last year and a small British carrier, Dan-Air, is struggling.
Air Europe was founded in the late 1970's by Harry Goodman, a British entrepreneur who first focused on providing packaged holidays for Britons and then expanded into scheduled service. He hoped that by building a fleet of fuel-efficient planes, Air Europe would be able to capture business from the high-cost European giant airlines that dominate the market.
He seemed to be well on his way to succeeding. In the year that ended Oct. 31, Air Europe carried 3.7 million scheduled and chartered passengers.
Mr. Whitaker of Airline Business said Air Europe's scheduled service was similar in quality to that of the big airlines while the fares were about 15 percent less for business-class seats and about 10 percent less in the economy class.
The packaged holiday companies owned by International Leisure, which include Intasun, Select, Global and Lancaster, are collectively No. 2 in the business in Britain. But the company was pushed into a crisis by the combination of large debt, a sharp decline in the packaged holiday market that began in 1989, and the rise in fuel costs and the plunge in travelers because of the Persian Gulf conflict and the recession in Britain.
 
'Ran Out of Cash'

"It turned out to be too much, and they ran out of cash," said Timothy Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the accounting firm. Mr. Hayward, one of the court-appointed administrators for International Leisure, was pessimistic that the group would survive. He said it was more likely that its parts would be sold and said several airlines, which he declined to identify, had expressed interest.
Citibank disclosed today that a syndicate of 14 banks that it led had asked the court to appoint an administrative receiver to take control of 12 leased aircraft to cover the group's exposure to International Leisure. Others said the exposure was $315 million, which a banker confirmed.
Citibank said in a statement that the banks took action only after "we were advised by International Leisure Group that they had not been successful in raising the additional finance required for continuation of its operations."
Mr. Hayward also said the action by the banks "was not the cause of the company's collapse."
International Leisure is privately owned and does not regularly release financial figures. It said in its court filing that it had lost 50 million ($98.3 million) from November through January. Mr. Hayward said the group had total liabilities of 480 million, of which 200 million was related to leased planes. Its liabilities exceed its assets by 15.4 million, he said.
 
A Long Struggle
 The company was known to have been struggling for a long time and had acknowledged that it was talking with Lloyds Bank and several large shareholders about financial relief. It recently withdrew its applications to offer service to New York, Los Angeles, the Caribbean, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia.
Mr. Goodman seemed to get a reprieve in January, when Lloyds agreed to a plan that would have converted an overdraft of 50 million into equity. While the conversion has not yet been put into effect, Brian Butler, a Lloyds spokesman, said today's decision to seek bankruptcy protection was not the result of a change of mind by Lloyds.
"We certainly haven't withdrawn our support in any way at all," Mr. Butler said. "We're disappointed that the company has had to cease operations. We tried to find a way forward and will continue to do so."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Plans a New Group To Address Fiscal Troubles

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins plans to call together bankers, realtors, labor and other civic leaders in a group modeled after the bailout effort that pulled New York through the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, the First Deputy Mayor announced last night.
The First Deputy, Norman Steisel, said the Mayor decided to call a broad group together amid concerns that the city's fiscal problems were worsening and could require budget cuts that dwarf those of the mid-1970's. 
 "It is definitely time to rekindle the sense of purpose and spirit of '76," Mr. Steisel said.
 
Looking Ahead to 1993
 The announcement followed increasing pressure from both the business community and labor for the Mayor to take a stronger leadership stand on the city's fiscal affairs. Mr. Dinkins has been so much on the defensive recently that yesterday, on a live radio call-in show on WKRS-FM, he felt compelled to say for the first time that he intended to run for re-election in 1993, putting on notice any who would write his political obituary amid his current troubles.
"If I'm going to be Mayor and take all this heat during this time," he said, "I certainly intend to be around when things are better."
It was not clear whether the new fiscal coalition would be a public relations effort or play a central role in the budget process. During the mid-1970's, the group became a quasi-official body that helped shape the city's financial plans.
He said the Mayor would reveal more about the group in the next few days.
Last week, a group of the Mayor's advisers in the business community warned him that he was not dealing forcefully with gathering fiscal problems and urged him to form a coalition of important New Yorkers.
The business officials presented their warnings to the Mayor at a private meeting at Gracie Mansion. The meeting was described both by members of the Mayor's own top staff and the business leaders who spread word of it as an opportunity to try to get the Mayor's attention focused on a problem they worry he is not dealing with aggressively enough.
"In the 1970's we reached a point where we realized that problems went beyond politics and something dramatic had to happen," said Howard Rubenstein, a public relations executive who attended the meeting and served as an adviser to former Mayor Abraham D. Beame in the 1970's. "I think we are at that point now. The Mayor still has a reservoir of good will that can work for him. He has to come up with a courageous plan where everybody will bleed a little."
Municipal union leaders who were not at the meeting said they shared many of the sentiments of the business officials and have been meeting regularly with them for months.
Pressure for a forum to tackle the city's fiscal problems has been rising as the city's fiscal problems worsened.
At no time has this heightened concern been better illustrated, union leaders said, than when the administration appeared to fumble a plan this week to get city workers to defer portions of a wage increase to balance the budget, an approach last used in the 1970's. Union leaders who helped get the Mayor elected denounced him in personal terms Wednesday after learning from reporters about the deferral plan in a confidential memorandum prepared for a bond rating agency.
While the cries of backstabbing and betrayal may reflect a fair measure of union politics and posturing, they also conveyed a continuing complaint from labor leaders: that the administration had not brought the unions into a process that will prepare them for painful sacrifices in the future.
 
'It Will Never Make a Quilt'
 "What is missing is the spirit, the dynamics, the cohesiveness and the structures of the 1970's," said Jack Bigel, who was a major labor adviser in the 1970's and plays the same role today. "My heavens, their current approach is a kind of crazy patchwork. They are laying off. They are hiring. It will never make a quilt. I don't think we ever had any real in-depth discussions with them."
City Hall officials bristled at any suggestion that they have not been willing to take tough budget moves, even as they warned that New Yorkers will likely face far deeper budget cuts than they have seen to date. They said they welcomed an opportunity to strengthen ties with both business and labor.
"We have an economic crisis here that is creating a budgetary crisis and its impact is going to be much worse, proportionately greater, than we saw in the 70's," Mr. Steisel said.
While the administration has not calmed the concerns of municipal unions worried about layoffs and cutbacks, business leaders and fiscal analysts say he has failed to mollify them as well. They have watched, they say, the administration take a series of lurching steps; raising salaries of city workers, slashing services, announcing and then averting layoffs, negotiating wage deferrals to take away some of the wage increases already granted.
At the Gracie Mansion meeting, members of the Mayor's council of economic advisers warned that without strong leadership, the city could lose thousands of businesses and jobs. Companies, they said, were increasingly concerned about the prospect of rising taxes and declining services with no clear solutions in sight.
Raymond D. Horton, director of research for the Citizen's Budget Commission, a research group supported by the business community, said he has begun to see alarming similarities, between Mr. Beame's struggle through the early stages of the last fiscal crisis and how Mr. Dinkins is responding now: continued unfounded optimism, a series of halting steps that are rescinded and reactivated, the heads of municipal unions not convinced there is a problem and engaging in bargaining strategies and successes that make the problem worse.
"I don't think the Mayor has ever said there is a crisis and I think this is a very salient point," Mr. Horton said.
City officials say the administration has repeatedly met with union leader to discuss layoffs, and had set up a joint labor-business group that has been meeting regularly to study productivity improvements.
"If there is yet another forum that jells the whole thing, we are willing and able," said Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director. "We may have reached a critical mass and it is time to roll up the sleeves put aside parochial interests and hammer out a solution."
So far the administration's published financial plans call for more than $1 billion in tax increases and a reduction of more than 6,000 jobs from the current payroll level. But city officials have become increasingly gloomy, warning of far deeper job cuts when Mayor Dinkins issues his budget next month.
The crisis in the 1970's was clearly worse in some ways -- the city was unable to sell its bonds, and was found to have been hiding billions of dollars in deficits, by selling bonds and notes to cover operating expenses.
But many business and labor leaders said that the threat of imminent default on city bonds was a powerful force that brought groups together.
Yesterday at a council budget hearing, Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the City Council Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Dinkins's approach to the city's deficit.
"I believe that there is a tendency to not want to deal with this and I believe it's the wrong way to go," Mr. Berman of Brooklyn, said yesterday.

Crispino, Council members. (Neal Boenzi/The New York Times)(pg. 27)

HEADLINE: Many Public Employees Out of Jobs As Governments Try to Stem Deficits

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORWOOD, Mass.

 BODY:
At this time of the year, Rita Caulfield could usually be found on weekday mornings poring over tax filings in the Boston assessor's office, where she worked as an analyst. Instead, on a snowy New England morning Mrs. Caulfield was in line at the Massachusetts Employment and Training office in this Boston suburb, waiting to receive her unemployment check.
"This is a pretty sad ending for somebody who's been working all her life," said Mrs. Caulfield, 71 years old, who was laid off three days after Christmas. "I know we're entitled to the money, but I feel like I'm accepting some form of charity." 
 Mrs. Caulfield is not alone in her dismissal these days.
 
Many Are in Similar Straits
 Around the country, and particularly in the Northeast, thousands of state and municipal workers have been dismissed or are threatened with layoffs as states desperately try to eliminate yawning budget deficits.
Mrs. Caulfield considers her situation particularly galling because 15 years ago she gave up a struggling real estate and insurance business for what she thought would be the security of government employment. Now she finds herself out of work and, because of her age, she believes she has little hope of finding another job.
In addition, Mrs. Caulfield lost her government job before she had accumulated enough years to build up an adequate retirement pension. She has sued the state of Massachusetts over the dismissal, charging age discrimination.
The precise number of government workers who will be let go is not yet known because belt-tightening plans drawn up by a number of governors have yet to be approved by state legislatures. But officials at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees estimate that at least 50,000 state and local jobs could be lost nationwide through layoffs and early retirements.
In New York, where 1,000 workers have already been laid off in the last few months, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has talked of a further 10 percent reduction in the state's work force of about 180,000 employee in the next fiscal year.
Pennsylvania recently removed about 1,500 workers from its payroll. And in Massachusetts, Gov. William F. Weld's budget for the fiscal year 1992 calls for the elimination of nearly 7,600 state jobs.
"Working for the state," Mr. Weld noted, "is not a constitutional right."
In addition to layoffs, several states are requiring employees to take unpaid furloughs. In Rhode Island, for example, about 19,000 state workers were ordered to stay home on Friday, shutting down many state offices. The forced holiday was the first of 10 days of furloughs, part of Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun's attempt to close a $222 million deficit, equal to about 15 percent of the state's budget.
 
When Cutbacks Hit Home
 For those government workers nationwide who have received pink slips or who are facing layoffs in an economic downturn, the retrenchment by state and local governments has caused shock, disillusionment and fear.
"I'm a casualty of the state budget," said LuAnn Hebner, 32, who was laid off in January as a $31,000-a-year rehabilitation assistant at an outpatient mental health center in Dunkirk, N.Y.
Ms. Hebner is angry at Governor Cuomo, and she is saddened that she and her husband, a clerk at the State University of New York at Buffalo, allowed themselves to be lulled into such a sense of security in their state jobs that they were not more frugal with her earnings.
Sipping coffee in her living room in Forestville, N.Y., she talked wistfully of buying season tickets to Buffalo Bills games and of spending money in other ways.
"Ever since we've been married, we've always lived to the maximum of our incomes," she said. "I knew it was wrong, but that's what we've done. This is the day I've always dreaded."
 
The Job to Retire From
 Last fall, Doug Wilkowski, 26, quit his job as manager of a supermarket in Blasdell, outside Buffalo, to become a corrections officer in the state prison system. Mr. Wilkowski said he believed the job offered long-term security and better benefits. "It was the job I figured I'd work all my life and retire with good benefits and a good pension," Mr. Wilkowski said.
In November, after completing a monthlong training session at the department's Albany Training Academy, he and 152 other cadets were stunned when Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, the Corrections Commissioner, told them at graduation ceremonies that they would be laid off by the end of the year.
Since then Mr. Wilkowski has postponed his plans to marry and stopped looking for a house to buy with his fiancee. Instead, he has fruitlessly searched for another job, and he has vainly beseeched his former employer at the supermarket to reinstate him. He now spends most of his days watching television at his parents' house.
"I'd give anything to get my old job back so I could get on with my life," he said.
Those who have lost their jobs say that the public will suffer from lost or diminished government services and that bright and dedicated people will think twice about careers in the public sector.
 
'Goals of the Institute'
 Last year one such worker, Charles Morreal, a chemist at the Roswell Park Cancer Research Institute in Buffalo, a hospital run by New York State, developed an anticancer compound that was 80 percent effective in curing breast cancer in laboratory rats. Three weeks ago, a member of the staff at the National Institutes of Health told him that another compound he had developed showed some promise in the treatment of AIDS.
Days later he was notified by his superiors that his work "did not coincide with the goals of the institute" and that he was among the 29 staff members whose positions were being eliminated.
"To be told that is difficult to take," Mr. Morreal said. "It's like they're saying, 'Your research is useless. Get out.' "
Mr. Morreal, 59, who had worked at Roswell Park for 26 years, decided to retire, and he says he is not worried about his financial future. But he says that he is not sure whether anyone will follow up on his research and that he is concerned about the effects the layoffs will have on the recruitment of staff at Roswell Park.
The director at Roswell Park, Dr. Thomas Tomasi, was sympathetic. "We hated to lay anybody off, from the scientist to the animal tender to the general service people," he said. "They all have families and obligations. But we felt the elimination of these positions would be the least destructive of our program."
 
Work to Be Proud of
 In her 17 years as director of the Middlesex County Court Clinic in Cambridge, Mass., Barbara Hauser has built it from a one-person operation into a respected mental health center. The staff at the clinic, which provides counseling for couples in divorce proceedings or who are engaged in child custody fights, has published papers in scientific journals, and the clinic has been cited for its work by experts in divorce.
A month ago, Ms. Hauser and her six-member staff received layoff notices. To stave off the dismissals, the staff, along with other unionized employees of the state's court system, agreed to take a day off from work a month without pay until July 1.
Ms. Hauser said she is concerned about the 200 families who are receiving counseling at the clinic. Some, she said, cannot afford private counseling.
"If government doesn't respond to citizens in a way that citizens need it to respond, then government is failing," Ms. Hauser said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Backs School Geared to Minorities

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday endorsed the idea of an experimental public high school that would stress the education of young black and Hispanic men, taking sides on an issue that has divided his own longtime liberal and civil-rights coalition.
Mr. Dinkins made his comments in an interview on a live radio call-in show on WKRS-FM, a station aimed primarily at black listeners. 
 His support for the proposed experimental school, known as the Ujamaa Institute, came at the end of a week in which he suffered new attacks from his old allies in organized labor over his fiscal policies and turmoil among his top staff, and new warnings from fiscal monitors about his handling of the city's budget problems. The Mayor also used the same radio interview to affirm his intention to run for re-election.
Mr. Dinkins seemed to be taking some pains to embrace his political base in the face of criticism from right and left, and to remind New Yorkers of the strength of the electoral coalition that made him the city's first black mayor, although by the closest margin in a mayoral race since 1905.
In endorsing the concept of the special high school, Mr. Dinkins sided with some important political forces, including Assemblyman Roger L. Green of Brooklyn, who have supported it.
But he diverged from some others usually allied with him, including the New York Civil Liberties Union and Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, the psychologist whose research buttressed the United States Supreme Court's decision outlawing school segregation in 1954.
When the idea of an all-male high school for young black and Hispanic students was first broached some time ago, Mr. Dinkins said he could not support any proposal that was exclusionary. But the Board of Education has since broadened the concept to a school that would be open to both sexes and all races, while placing special emphasis on the problems of black and Hispanic men.
"The school is now going to have a multicultural curriculum with a focus prominently on the African-American contributions to the arts, the sciences and so forth, and it will foster pride in African-American history," Mr. Dinkins said on the radio. "I anticipate that as currently proposed and structured it will be very valuable."
 
Plan Moving Forward
 Repeating a theme he has often expressed, Mr. Dinkins said: "You know, when I was a boy, and somebody said Africa, that immediately conjured up in your mind Tarzan swinging through the trees. We did not know of the magnificent heritage that we had and the civilization that existed long ago. That pride in ourselves is so important."
In the radio interview, Mr. Dinkins also talked of his determination to run for mayor again.
"In the normal course you would hear from an incumbent, "Well, it's too early now and we're going to think about it and we'll see what the future holds,' " Mr. Dinkins said, but he said that he had already made up his mind.
"If I'm going to be Mayor and take all this heat during this time," he said, "I certainly intend to be around when times are better."
Later, elaborating on his resolve to run again, Mr. Dinkins told reporters at City Hall: "To my friends, to those who had faith in me and elected me, stood by me through difficult times, to them I have always said our dreams are but deferred, not denied. And to those who are sharpening their pencils and determining they may seek this office, obviously anyone has the right to run that wishes, but I don't intend to just leave."
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said yesterday that he had never discussed the high school proposal with the Mayor. He said the Board of Education was working with Dr. Edison O. Jackson, president of Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York, to develop a detailed proposal that was academically sound.
"We're moving full speed ahead," he said.
But the proposal for the school, to be known as the Ujamaa Institute after the Swahili word for family, has met much opposition. Opponents contend it could further isolate black youths, who already drop out of school, die violent deaths and are jailed in greatly disproportionate numbers.
Dr. Clark said in a telephone interview last night: "Ujamaa would be looked upon as something inferior, quite inferior, stigmatized, and as a sort of correctional institution prep school. I'm opposed to it."
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said: "We oppose the use of a curriculum that is Eurocentric, and have for years. By what logic would a curriculum that is Africa-centered be more acceptable?"
Supporters, however, say the school is an experimental attempt to deal with a daunting problem and could promote self-esteem and community service and encourage discipline.
An editorial in the current issue of The City Sun, a black weekly newspaper in Brooklyn, said: "What is not being said -- and so we'll say it -- is that these off-the wall reactions to the plan and its proponents are rooted in the belief that people of color must seek permission from the white-dominated system before they even think about exercising their prerogatives to control their destinies."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Iraqis Facing Food Shortages

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Despite anticipated bumper crops, Iraqis are expected to face food shortages this year because of the Persian Gulf war, a Congressional report says.
Because of the war and the economic embargo against Iraq, food stocks are currently at a record low, according to the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress. Without outside assistance, the report said, food shortages will occur across Iraq despite the fact that farmers nearly doubled wheat production last fall, and a record grain harvest is expected. 
 "Once the embargo was announced, Saddam Hussein essentially told every farmer to put every acre in wheat," said Susan B. Epstein, a food and agriculture specialist with the research service, who wrote the report. Nearly twice as many acres were planted over the year before, Ms. Epstein said.
The Congressional report further said the war has created manpower shortages for harvesting the crop and fuel shortages that will make it difficult to power mills and processing machinery. Bombed-out roads and bridges will make food delivery nearly impossible to some areas, the report said.

HEADLINE: Going Beyond Social Security

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
This is about the time of year when millions of people are receiving annual statements of the value of their personal retirement accounts and company pensions.
Pay attention to these statements, experts say. No matter what your age, it is always appropriate to think about your retirement needs and to figure out how much money you will have after your working days. If you discover that more is needed, now is the time to try to increase your savings to achieve your objectives. 
 Of course, Social Security benefits will supplement any private pension and savings plans. (For an estimate of the Government benefits you will be entitled to at ages 62, 65 and 70, complete Form SSA-7004, available from the Social Security Administration, Department 74, Pueblo, Colo. 81009, or call (800) 234-5772.)
"Social Security typically replaces only about 30 percent of preretirement income," said Alan W. Herman, senior vice president of Retirement System Group, an employee benefits consulting company. "But replacing 70 percent to 80 percent is the recommended goal. The question all working people eventually face is, where does the other 40 percent to 50 percent come from?"
For many of those who work for businesses with company-sponsored retirement plans -- about half of the American work force -- much of the money to replace 40 percent to 50 percent of preretirement income will come from a company benefits plan. These include defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Some companies have both.
Defined benefit plans promise a certain monthly pension based on a participant's salary and length of service, with the payments coming from contributions made by the employer plus voluntary contributions by the employee. Defined contribution plans let workers contribute part of their before-tax salaries (401(k) plans) or of their after-tax salaries (thrift plans).
The 401(k) plans, or salary reduction plans, are particularly attractive retirement savings devices at companies that have them. These plans let workers deduct from their paychecks, before income taxes, as much as $8,475, with the money going into a special account. As with other types of tax-deferred plans, the earnings on this account also grow tax free; taxes are paid as money is withdrawn after retirement.
At some companies, employers match all or part of their employees' contributions to a 401(k) plan. "Put in as much as your employer matches," advised Marvin Greene, a vice president of Towers Perrin, an employee benefits consulting firm.
 
Most Will Need to Save More
 There is general agreement among professionals in the field that company pensions and savings plans alone will not be enough to allow most workers to achieve their retirement income goals. "In many cases people have a little from a job here, a little from a job there and nothing substantial," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner of Weber Lipshie & Company, a certified public accounting firm. "And many companies are establishing early retirement dates and terminating people."
That leaves personal savings to take up the slack. Retirement specialists advise workers to save as much as possible in tax-deferred plans. These include individual retirement accounts for workers without company pension plans or with income under certain limits, or Keogh plans for those who are self-employed, including freelancers. But people who contribute up to the maximum allowed under such plans may still have to save or invest more on their own if they are to achieve that all-important nest egg for retirement.
 
'Save Now or. . . .'
 "People are not going to get enough out of their different company programs," said Herbert M. Paul, a New York tax lawyer. "So either they're going to save now or they're not going to have the life style at retirement that they want. The more time you have to accumulate, the less you have to put away each year."
Some economists and academics believe that in the next decade personal savings in this country will rise above the present average of about 5 percent of income, as more consumers recognize the importance of saving for retirement.
"As longevity increases, people will be more inclined to save in the conventional sense," said S. Jay Levy, chairman of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College.
The key point emphasized by planners, though, is for people to begin saving for retirement as soon as possible, despite the fact that there is no longer a mandatory retirement age for most people. "The earlier you can start, the earlier the powers of compound interest are in your favor," said Mr. Herman of Retirement Systems Group.

GRAPHIC: Table: "Building a $100,000 Nest Egg"
 
Annual investment needed to accumulate $100,000 for retirement in the amount of time shown. For example, one would need to invest $6,392 each year at 8 percent to have $100,000 in 10 years.

How Roosevelt's Successors Compare

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
The Riddle of Power
Presidential Leadership From Truman to Bush
By Robert Shogan
352 pages. Dutton. $21.95.
Since Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom most historians rank among the handful of greats in the history of the Republic, the United States has had nine Presidents: Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush. Have any of them approached Roosevelt in stature and public affection or attained similar success in both foreign and domestic affairs? 
 The sad conclusion of Robert Shogan in "The Riddle of Power" is: No.
The author, a veteran political correspondent in Washington for The Los Angeles Times, writes: "Our recent Presidents, of both parties, have led us down a road pitted with broken promises and misguided endeavors. Their combined performances have forced us to wonder what it takes to achieve success in the White House and how we should go about choosing a chief executive to lead the nation through the twilight years of this century and prepare it for the next millennium."
Mr. Shogan withholds judgment on George Bush's Presidency -- he finds it too soon to call -- even though politicians and pollsters immediately linked the successful war in the Persian Gulf to Mr. Bush's chance for re-election in 1992. He does, however, comment on the last Presidential election:
"As the election of George Bush in 1988 demonstrated only too well, Presidential campaigns have become a vicious, empty competition, dominated by mudslinging, evasion and deceit. The substantive value of that election can be judged by what is best remembered now: from the Republican side, Bush's mindless and ultimately hollow injunction to read his lips, and from the Democratic side, Lloyd Bentsen's disparaging suggestion to J. Danforth Quayle that he was not John Kennedy."
Mr. Shogan writes that regardless of the outcome of the war in the Middle East (his book went to press before Desert Shield turned into Desert Storm), the success or failure of the 41st President will still depend on how he responds to two major challenges. At home, he will need to reinvigorate the country's economy; abroad, he will have to define a new role for the country in a changing world. "In both instances," the author says, "if Bush is to rally public support he must establish a strong identity for himself and a clear direction for his Presidency, so that he can govern by actions, not reactions."
The author makes it easy for the reader to follow his standards of success or failure for each of the Presidencies by setting up three criteria: ideology, values and character. None of the Presidents since Roosevelt get top grades on all three tests. Americans who retain a memory of several or all of them, probably base their views on which lever they pulled in the voting booth. The author passes around praise where due, but also notes that some of the nine did nothing significant domestically, that others did too much militarily, and that at least one (Richard Nixon, because of Watergate) came close to impeachment and another (Ronald Reagan, because of Iran-Contra) became vulnerable to it.
"The Riddle of Power" is filled with Presidential anecdotes, many involving exchanges with the author himself during his three decades of political coverage.
Once during the Nixon Presidency, as former President Truman sat around with a group of correspondents, he was asked to evaluate Richard Nixon. Truman demurred, saying, "There is a lady present." Mr. Shogan asked him if he could "clean up" his answer. Truman replied: "No. Every time anything is said about him now it just means another headline for him. It gives him a chance to get out on the front page."
During the Nixon-Kennedy race in 1960, Mr. Shogan was working for The Miami News. Many voters found the idea of Kennedy as President difficult to accept because his credentials were slim and because his age, 43, made him seem "callow and opportunistic," the author says. When it finally became clear that Kennedy "had indeed eked out a narrow victory," he writes, the news editor at the paper "suggested a headline that would have summed up the widespread doubts about his candidacy and Presidency: 'It's a Boy!' "
One of the merits of this book is that it turns our minds to a chunk of time in this century, 1945-1990, when the postwar dream and the cold war terror collided and fused. As one goes down the list of Presidents who succeeded Roosevelt, it's interesting to note that almost every one of the nine was entangled in small or large military conflicts -- some inherited, some of their own making. These include Korea, Lebanon, Cuba, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama and the Persian Gulf, not to mention covert and proxy wars like Iran-Contra during the Reagan Administration.
In a preface to a revised edition of his classic study of the modern Presidency, "Presidential Power," Richard E. Neustadt wrote that Presidential weakness was the underlying theme of his book. One of the points Mr. Shogan makes is that the Presidency has become so complex a job that even if a President isn't weak when he enters the White House, he discovers that he cannot simply give orders to a chief of staff or try to do the job himself and expect that results will follow. Growth has made it harder to control the Federal bureaucracy and a President must still answer to Congress.
As a respected newspaperman, Mr. Shogan tries not to abandon his objectivity, but he admits that he allows his opinions to come out in this book. On the evidence presented here and elsewhere, most of these Presidents were far too ordinary to perform brilliantly in an extraordinary job. On balance, "The Riddle of Power" is a lively and straightforward primer on leadership, but it still leaves open the question why potentially great Presidents cannot be discovered, nominated and elected. That's still a riddle.

HEADLINE: Give Them More Than Parades

 BODY:
As the first troops return from Operation Desert Storm, jubilant Americans are offering them jobs and weekend jaunts, baseball tickets and free baby-sitting. President Bush has granted returning Government employees five days off. The generosity is richly deserved. But in the long run these and all other members of the armed forces will deserve more.
Desert Storm showcased human skill and dedication and the most dazzling weapons that money can buy. Yet it also revealed distressing official neglect for the personal concerns of military men and women. Outdated laws provide inadequate benefits for active members of the forces, as well as reservists and the National Guard. 
 Unemployment insurance offers a good example. A civilian who is laid off can collect benefits for 26 weeks. Discharged military personnel get only 13 weeks, and wait longer to get it. That's no problem for most of those who had jobs when they were called up; their slots are protected by law. But it's no help for those who were unemployed, or for those whose jobs were eliminated because of shrinking business while they were away. With unemployment rising nationwide, the military-civilian inequity is grossly unfair.
Senate Republicans propose putting the entire military on a par with civilians, but this runs up against the Administration's declaration that costs not directly related to Desert Storm must be offset by cuts elsewhere. Congress and the Administration agreed to this distinction in their overall budget agreement, but the line between war costs and non-war costs is already getting fuzzy.
The "emergency" appropriations that the House approved the other day include $438 million to buy 500 new Patriot missiles and upgrade others. That's far more than were fired at Iraqi Scuds in the war, but the $438 million is nonetheless offered as a war expense, not subject to budgetary limits.
If buying extra missiles is O.K., then why is it not equally O.K. to provide fair compensation for jobless veterans? The hard truth is that missiles have stronger lobbyists than unemployed soldiers.
Another example of inadequate benefits spotlighted by the war is the tax exemption for combat pay. Officers get a smaller exemption than enlisted personnel. The Administration says that's just too bad; fixing this inequity can't be called a war cost. Still another example is interest on mortgages and loans, reduced to 6 percent for those called to active duty. The same terms should be extended to student loans, which didn't exist when the law was written.
There are many more examples that need attention. For now, let the nation cheer its heroes. For the future, they need more than parades.

HEADLINE: Read Mario Bush's Lips

BYLINE: By Franz S. Leichter; Franz S. Leichter, Democrat, is State Senator from Upper Manhattan.

 BODY:
Mario Cuomo and George Bush have something in common: They don't like to tax the rich. To listen to the Governor, you might think the opposite. In a National Press Club speech last December, he blasted the Government for 10 years of a Robin-Hood-in-reverse economic strategy, "which operated from the naive assumption that you could ignore the middle class . . . giving the already wealthy more wealth through huge income tax cuts."
The Governor was right. However, New York has pursued its own Robin-Hood-in-reverse policy, cutting top income tax rates more than 50 percent in the last decade. The biggest beneficiaries have been the affluent. 
 The wealthiest 1 percent of the nation's population saw its share of total income increase by 86 percent during the 1980's. In New York, the income of the richest 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 137 percent.
While its share of income was increasing in the last decade, the nation's top 1 percent paid 15 percent less in income taxes. In New York, the wealthiest 1 percent paid 33 percent less in state income taxes.
While the rich became richer and paid less of their income in taxes, New York's middle class and poor became poorer in the 1980's, and the middle class paid a larger percent in income taxes, exceeding the national trend.
As a result of income tax cuts in New York, $7 billion in revenue has been lost. Owing to the reduction and a worsening economy, the state faces a $6 billion deficit. Mr. Cuomo would partly plug that hole with a regressive $500 million rise in gas taxes.
To offset U.S. and state spending cuts, local governments have had to further burden the middle class with taxes. Between 1986 and 1988, 82 percent of New York's cities and villages raised property taxes by an average of 19 percent. Since 1979, 19 counties and eight cities have begun charging sales taxes. Across the state, excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, which hit the poor and middle class hardest, have been the preferred method of plugging deficit holes.
 On Oct. 25, 1989, The Buffalo News reported that Mr. Cuomo, criticizing Washington's proposed gasoline tax, said: "I don't believe you should raise revenues on a taxicab driver or a struggling schoolteacher. You should tax the wealthiest people . . . Tax only the top, the people over $200,000."
Last November, a surcharge of 3 percent, to be applied to taxable income over $200,000, was proposed in the State Senate. Since then similar proposals have been made. Mr. Cuomo has rejected them all and promised to veto them. He says that increasing income taxes will send the rich across state borders and destroy New York's economic competitiveness. This argument is anecdotal. He has produced no document or study to show this is the case. Numerous studies show the opposite to be true. For most corporations, the prime factors in deciding where to do business are quality of life and workforce skills, with tax policy playing a minor role.
George Bush found he could not live up to his "read my lips" pledge. With huge deficits, it was unrealistic and did not serve the nation. Mario Cuomo ought to learn from that experience and withdraw his own pledge not to raise taxes.

HEADLINE: Nigerians Speak Warmly of the Peace Corps;
Reunion in August

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush, in his State of the Union Message, challenged each American "to get one addict off drugs. To convince one troubled teen-ager not to give up on life; to comfort one AIDS patient; to help one hungry child," and to "Join the community of conscience." For 30 years thousands of returned Peace Corps volunteers, after having served two or more years in developing countries, have come home and done just that.
There are now more than 120,000 former volunteers, a small peace army providing leadership in domestic volunteer activities ranging from organizing community food drives to refurbishing homes for the elderly to outreach for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
 Next Aug. 1 to 4 on the Mall in Washington, 7,000 to 10,000 former volunteers will gather for a conference and celebration marking three decades of Peace Corps service. And once again, the returned Peace Corps volunteer community will represent the best in domestic volunteerism. In partnership with the District of Columbia, all conference participants will serve one of the city's voluntary organizations for one day, called Volunteer Day.
Throughout Washington, returned volunteers will be working on worthwhile activities bringing national attention to the need for increased volunteerism in helping solve many national problems -- housing, health, illiteracy, environmental degradation. This day will serve as a model for similar events throughout the country. It is our hope that future conventions of any large group in the District of Columbia will be encouraged to perform volunteer service in their areas of expertise.
The National Council of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers has an affiliated membership of 15,000 returned volunteers and a data base of 25,000 other nonmembers. Unfortunately, addresses of many more thousands of returned volunteers are unknown. Yet the conference is open to all current and returned volunteers and staff. Former volunteers wishing information on the conference or local organizations of returned volunteers or organizations of former volunteers from particular countries, can call the council's headquarters in Washington, (202) 462-5938.
Returned volunteers have risen to the highest levels of corporate and nonprofit industry, as well as local, state and Federal Government and Congress over the last 30 years. As a group, former volunteers represent all shades of American political, economic and social life, defying categorization. Yet the one issue the returned Peace Corps volunteers are rallying round wholeheartedly is President Bush's call for more voluntary service.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Is at 4-Year High With Jump to 6.5% Last Month

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The nation's employment picture deteriorated significantly last month, with payrolls shrinking and the jobless rate rising to its highest point in nearly four years.
Hoping to give the economy a boost, the Federal Reserve responded to today's latest news of worsening recession by lowering an important interest rate another notch. It was the second time in two months that the central bank cut rates right after unfavorable employment statistics were released. 
 In the best gauge yet of economic activity in February, the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate reached 6.5 percent, up from 6.2 percent in January and that the number of non-farm jobs fell by 184,000. The jobless rate was at least a tenth of a point higher than most economists had expected, and the drop in payrolls was almost twice what had generally been forecast.
The economy may nonetheless pull out of the recession by late spring or early summer as the Bush Administration, the Federal Reserve and most private forecasters predict. But the employment report shows that the economic decline that began last summer had not begun to level off last month.
"It's certainly not good news," Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee today.
 
450,000 Jobs Lost
 She said that the increase of three-tenths of one percentage point in the unemployment rate was the largest one-month rise since 1986, that the rate had not been so high since March 1987, and that 450,000 individuals had been put out of work in February. But she urged the lawmakers to take a broad focus, and not simply look at one month's figures.
"The important point," Dr. Norwood said, "is that a year ago, the unemployment rate was 5.3 percent, and it's now 6.5 percent. That's a lot of unemployment."
Moreover, she said, the number of people who want to work full time but are working only part time has reached 6.1 million, the highest level since 1983.
The Bush Administration tried to put today's statistics in the best possible light.
For example, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher noted in an interview that the net loss of 184,000 non-farm positions was substantially less serious than a stunning drop of more than 232,000 jobs in January. "This is nothing to crow about," Mr. Mosbacher said of the February number, "but it's another indication that we're right at the bottom. I'm not going to say it's going to turn around in March or April, but by summer I think we're going to be on the way back up."
The Commerce Secretary said he
 saw "a very good chance that the President's tremendous popularity will translate into a boost in consumer confidence."
But private economists who were interviewed were less upbeat. "The data are just dreadfully weak," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist in the New York office of Lloyds Bank. He said the numbers clearly showed that "the end of the war by itself is not going to be sufficient to turn this recession around."
The Federal Reserve apparently reached that conclusion, too. In testimony on Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, said the central bank would not lower interest rates further without clearer data on economic trends.
But shortly after the employment statistics were released today, the Federal Reserve bought large quantities of Government securities to indicate to the financial markets that it wanted to lower its target for the crucial Federal funds rate, apparently to 6 percent, from the current 6 1/4 percent. The funds rate is what commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans and is often a determining factor in the interest rates that banks charge customers.
By cutting interest rates, the Federal Reserve hopes to make borrowing more attractive, and thus generate economic growth through increased spending by companies and individuals.
The Federal funds rate has now been driven down by two full percentage points since the central bank began cutting interest rates in earnest in October, but Mr. Greenspan conceded this week that so far the lower rates had not encouraged banks to make more loans.
On Feb. 1, after the data for January were announced, the central bank reduced the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point and also cut the discount rate to 6 percent, from 6 1/2 percent. The discount rate is what the central bank charges for direct loans to banks.
The view among Wall Street economists today was that the Federal Reserve would probably lower the discount rate again early next week. The central bank loses some measure of control over the economy when the Federal funds rate is higher than the discount rate.
The jobs picture was bleak across the board last month, but cutbacks were especially large in the automobile industry, fabricated metal products, industrial machinery and construction. Construction jobs have fallen by about 425,000 since May, and the drop in February was worse than it appeared because weather across the country was generally good for building last month.
Over all, manufacturing employment fell by 125,000 in February, continuing a trend that began two years ago. But the service sector of the economy has also been flagging recently. Jobs in retail trade fell by 70,000 last month, after seasonal adjustment, and 35,000 positions were lost in transportation, largely a reflection of the poor state of the airline industry. Altogether, 350,000 jobs have been lost in retail and wholesale trade since last summer.
The average workweek declined by 12 minutes last month, and overtime in manufacturing declined by 6 minutes.
The unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey declined slightly, but the declines were not suprising in light of the steep increases in the rates in both states in January. In New York, the rate fell to 6.2 percent in February, from 6.5 percent, and the New Jersey rate dropped to 6.3 percent, from 6.4 percent.
Among the large states, the situation was most severe in Michigan, where the rate was 9.8 percent, up from 7.2 percent in January, mainly because of layoffs in the auto industry, and in Massachusetts, where the rate rose to 9.3 percent from 8.6 percent. The large states with the healthiest job markets were Illinois, North Carolina and Texas, where the rates were between 5 percent and 6 percent.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front- page article on March 9 about the nation's unemployment rate misstated the effect of two interest rates on the Federal Reserve's control over the economy. The Federal Reserve loses some control when the discount rate is not below the Federal funds rate.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Waterworks Concern Sets Shift in Top Post

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Although a waterworks holds a spot on the Monopoly game board, water utilities owned by shareholders are not large American enterprises like electrical utilities. The largest, the American Water Works Company, has named a president-elect, George W. Johnstone, to take over its operations next year.
Mr. Johnstone, who is 52, is an engineer who has been with the nationwide company for 25 years. He will succeed James W. LaFrankie, the company's top officer, who plans to retire next year at age 65. In another change, Loren D. Mellendorf, 66, executive vice president and president of the company's American Water Works Service Company, plans to retire on July 1 and will not stand for re-election to the board. Mr. Johnstone, who is currently vice president, has been nominated to succeed him on the board. 
 American Water Works, based in Voorhees, N.J., owns water utilities in 20 states and provides water to 580 communities. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Britain has recently seen the privatization of several regional water companies, but water for United States communities is usually provided by municipal or private companies.
There are some 15 publicly held water utilities, with American Water Works far and away the largest, annually pumping $600 million in revenues from its various operations. The water utilities do not generally provide so high a dividend as electric utilities, but utility analysts say the companies' share prices are often more stable.
Mr. Johnstone said the company was constantly on the prowl for opportunities to buy new systems, but purchases have been relatively rare. American Water Works last bought a company in 1986, in New Mexico.
"With the need for investment to modernize systems, though, we may see that systems may turn to professionally owned and run utilities," Mr. Johnstone said.
The company was formed in 1947 in New Jersey by an entrepreneur, John H. Ware 2d, who put the water systems together. His granddaughter, Marilyn W. Lewis, is the current chairman.
Mr. Johnstone is a graduate of Penn State University and joined the waterworks in 1966. He became a vice president in 1980 and a senior vice president in 1983.
Providing such an essential service brings with it particular responsibilities, he noted. "The economic well-being of the entire area we serve is impacted by how well we do our particular job," he said.

THE WORK OF NATIONS
Preparing Ourselves for 21st-Century Capitalism.
By Robert B. Reich.
331 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
 Just about everyone agrees that the United States' growing involvement with the world economy is one of the great changes of our time. If you believe Robert B. Reich, we haven't seen anything yet. In his new book, "The Work of Nations," he predicts the end of "national economies, at least as we have come to understand that concept." Mr. Reich argues that in a world without economic borders all people will rise or fall to their market values; the skilled and talented will prosper, while the uneducated and unskilled will not. In his view, then, the "work" of a nation is to improve the skills of its people so that they will flourish in this new world order.
It is a plausible and seductive story that seems to explain the mysteries of daily economic headlines: persistent trade deficits, rising levels of foreign investment, and fluctuating exchange rates and oil prices. Surely no one can quarrel with Mr. Reich's basic prescription. The better educated we are, the better off we will be as a nation. And he contends convincingly -- in my judgment, at least -- that foreign investment in the United States can ultimately benefit Americans by improving technology, spreading new management techniques and training American workers. The problem with his ambitious book lies not so much in details as in his basic theme. Like many others, Mr. Reich, who teaches at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, vastly exaggerates the impact of the global economy on the United States.
His mistake is an understandable one. Since World War II, declining communication and transportation costs have enormously expanded global flows of products, services and technology. Arguably, our consciousness of this change has increased even more, in part because we have lost much of our self-confidence. Until the mid-1970's we assumed that American companies would perpetually dominate world markets and that our economy would always lead the globe in living standards and technology. Now the economic success of others has rattled us. The Japanese, who already make many of our cars and electronic chips, seem to be buying up Hollywood. The Germans have emerged as Europe's superpower. Some Americans fear that we are becoming a massive economic colony, dominated by foreign imports, foreign investment and foreign political influence.
Mr. Reich correctly rejects this economic paranoia. But in the process he embraces the conventional view about the huge influence of the world economy on the United States. In fact the conventional view is distorted. Most nations retain their economic identities: they represent separate systems of production and distribution shaped by national values, tastes, institutions, laws and politics. This is especially true of the United States, the world's largest market.
We delude ourselves if we think our major economic problems somehow originate abroad. Our basic economic problem is not some massive global shift but low productivity growth. It was terrible in the 1970's and, although it revived somewhat in the 1980's, is still lower than it was during the early postwar decades. Yet this development has little to do with the economy's increasingly international nature. We simply are not increasing output per worker fast enough to satisfy popular desires for higher living standards and more Government services (everything from health care to road renovation to police). American productivity mostly reflects American labor, management and Government. It has not suffered from foreign competition. Quite the opposite: foreign competition has become more intense precisely because American productivity has lagged.
In other areas, what happens to the American economy is also mostly a matter of what is happening within the United States. The economy's spending is mainly generated domestically. Recessions result primarily from spending shifts by American consumers and businesses. Inflation is determined for the most part by the Federal Reserve -- how tightly or loosely it controls money and credit -- and not by outside influences such as oil prices. Even though the economy's international connections have grown substantially, their influence remains fairly modest.
Against that background, it is hard to accept Mr. Reich's argument that the expansion of the global economy explains the widening gap between America's rich and poor. In his schema, the American labor force has split into three main groups: the "symbolic analysts," the "routine producers" and the "in-person servers."
Within this division, the symbolic analysts are the elite, and Mr. Reich says they alone have benefited from the global economy. These people manipulate "symbols -- data, words, oral and visual representations." Among others, this group includes entertainers, top corporate executives, engineers, consultants, lawyers and investment bankers. Because they "add value" to the global economy, their services are demanded by companies everywhere. Therefore their salaries and living standards rise.
By contrast, other Americans do not fare so well. The wages of routine producers -- essentially factory workers, their supervisors and midlevel managers -- are hurt by direct competition with low-paid workers abroad. Some good American production jobs will remain, Mr. Reich argues, but they will be scarce because they will exist in highly automated factories. As for the in-person servers -- among them store clerks, auto mechanics, secretaries, real estate agents, nurses and taxi drivers -- they also suffer. Although sheltered from global competition, they face increased domestic competition for their jobs from displaced routine producers -- and, in addition, some of their jobs are being automated.
There is obviously something to this -- but not as much as Mr. Reich contends. The global economy has clearly helped some Americans and hurt others. The more places Madonna can sell her music, the wealthier she will be. For genuinely global American companies, success abroad enriches their executives and shareholders. By the same token, global competition has weakened the bargaining power of some American unions. Wages have been affected, and some industries have lost jobs. But these are only modest influences on the well-being of most Americans, rich or poor.
Consider first the symbolic analysts. I'm one of them. My job as a columnist depends mostly on Newsweek's domestic advertising, because revenues from the magazine's overseas editions are small. If (heaven forbid) I'm ever fired, I'll be pounding the doors of other American publications; Le Monde wouldn't bid for my services. The same is true of most symbolic analysts: their jobs depend on the domestic economy. Wall Street investment bankers are now being laid off, and so are lawyers and accountants at major firms. Their troubles stem from the American recession and the aftermath of excesses in real estate and the stock market.
Likewise, it is the overall level of American productivity that mainly determines the wages of routine producers and in-person servers. As a nation, what we consume is essentially what we produce. Even at its peak in 1987, the trade deficit (which raised our consumption) equaled only 3.5 percent of gross national product. When higher productivity increases output, the rise in spending power spreads throughout the economy. This is why a barber in New York earns more than a barber in Beijing, even though they both may do the same thing. This is also why unskilled workers from less developed countries emigrate to the United States.
International competition may have contributed to the widening gap between rich and poor. But if so, it is one of many causes, most of which are unrelated to the world economy: changing skill levels and job requirements; more competition between men and women for jobs; more immigration; more cost-consciousness by companies; and the generational "congestion" of the baby boom (so many people of the same age competing for jobs that their wages suffer). Together these factors may have increased the pay of highly skilled workers and intensified competition for low-skill jobs.
Mr. Reich does not have much new to say about how to improve productivity. He scorns industrial policy -- the notion that the economy can benefit from government aid to key industries. This idea, he says, has been outmoded by the advent of global companies. The activities of big American firms are spread around the world. Thus, helping American companies doesn't necessarily help American workers. This is a reversal for Mr. Reich, who once advocated industrial policy. His current condemnation may be too sweeping, because aid to some industries may be justified on national security grounds. He acknowledges that problem only in passing.
Nor does he say much that is helpful about American education. Spend more, he proposes, as if low spending were the major problem. It isn't. Between 1970 and 1988, real spending per student in public schools rose more than 50 percent. There may be places where additional spending would help, but no amount of money will help students who do not study. About 60 percent of high school students do no homework or less than an hour's worth an evening. Moreover, Mr. Reich misleadingly argues that America's elite students (his future symbolic analysts) remain the best trained in the world. This is complacent. Even the best American students do not compare well internationally in such areas as language skills and scientific literacy.
Long suspicious of foreigners, Americans are understandably uneasy about the global economy. Coming to grips with it is a psychological as well as an economic challenge. Mr. Reich wisely warns against a zealous economic nationalism that would not help us and might hurt the world economy. He is also expert in explaining the ways in which many large American and foreign companies are growing more global, moving products, ideas and technologies around the world. But otherwise his book is disappointing. It is littered with meaningless new labels ("symbolic analysts" and "routine producers" are only samples) and flawed generalizations. Mr. Reich strains too hard to be original. In the end he doesn't dazzle his readers so much as confuse them.

THE END OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE
National Purpose and the Global Economy
After the Cold War.
By Robert Kuttner.
304 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $22.95. 
 One wonders how many times Robert Kuttner's title, "The End of Laissez-Faire," has been used in the last century and a half for speeches, symposiums, articles, books, even as a slogan. Mr. Kuttner has purposefully borrowed it from what is perhaps its most famous previous use: as the title for an essay by John Maynard Keynes, written in 1926.
Keynes's essay was not concerned with the condition of domestic market economies but with international economics -- with trade balances and currency exchange rates, tariffs and customs unions, the gold standard and world capital markets. Keynes's theme was how to avoid the beggar-thy-neighbor excesses of protectionism without succumbing to the utopianism of free trade, so beloved by orthodox economists then and now. This is Mr. Kuttner's theme, too.
In 1984, in "The Economic Illusion," he argued the case against pure laissez-faire in the management of a domestic economy. This volume amounts to a sequel, extending the argument to the more complex world of the international economy, "a realm in which the forces of private commerce are far more difficult to tame, for the obvious reason that the reach of the nation-state ends at its borders." Mr. Kuttner, an economics correspondent for The New Republic and a columnist for Business Week, insists that his "quarrel . . . is not with capitalism itself, only with its utopian variation, and I quarrel in the spirit of Keynes." His book appears at a moment of transition in world politics and economics that is comparable to the fateful period of postwar instability when Keynes wrote his essay.
Mr. Kuttner observes that his subject is "the second end of laissez-faire." For if Keynes's advice was not heeded in the 1920's, the Great Depression of the 30's and the Government interventions unleashed by World War II had the effect of retrospectively elevating him to prophetic stature. Not only did he become the virtual architect of the fiscal interventionism and, to a lesser extent, the welfare-state policies adopted by the American and British Governments that came after the war, but he also played a leading role at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference. Intended to establish a new international economic order free of the disastrous instabilities of the previous decade, the conference created a global interventionist framework featuring fixed exchange rates and centered on two new institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Yet after these reforms, belief in laissez-faire made a steady comeback, culminating in the antigovernment policies of the Reagan Administration. "The intriguing question," Mr. Kuttner writes, "is why the utopian vision of a pure market economy proved so potent -- why it came back to life, after being so thoroughly discredited by events half a century ago and after most advanced nations successfully built their postwar societies very much in the spirit of a mixed economy rather than a laissez-faire one." Roughly half of "The End of Laissez-Faire" tries to answer this question, focusing on the United States; the other half advances prescriptions for a new regulated world economic order that, far from challenging American national purpose, could, in Mr. Kuttner's view, reinvigorate it.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank never became the genuinely supranational authorities envisaged by Keynes. Essentially, they developed into institutions that provided loans and economic advice, primarily to less developed nations. They were not permitted to take the key step of establishing an international unit of exchange, a standard by which national currencies could be both measured and regulated. Instead, under Bretton Woods, the United States dollar, the currency of the dominant political and economic power in the postwar world, emerged as a kind of international unit of exchange, although philosophically the United States was unprepared to play the role of world banker that its currency's position seemed to require. Washington ardently supported unrestricted free trade on ideological grounds. Moreover, given the productive superiority of the American economy, free trade served American interests just as it had those of Britain in the 19th century, when the British were the major world power and a lack of trade restrictions assured their economic dominance.
The United States, however, has clung to a belief in the unqualified virtues of a free world market long after the loss of its postwar economic dominance, and despite the manifest failure of Japan and Europe to practice laissez-faire, either domestically or internationally. The combined effect of the Japanese and European revival in the 1960's and the domestic American inflation resulting from the war in Vietnam so weakened the dollar that its position as an international unit of exchange became untenable. This led President Richard Nixon to abandon the Bretton Woods exchange rates agreements in 1970. The United States announced it would no longer defend the position of the dollar on international markets and no longer exchange gold for dollars. Henceforth, the American currency "floated."
The pressures on the dollar were due, Mr. Kuttner explains, to the contradictions between the role of the United States as the leader of the Western alliance and its persistent affirmation of international laissez-faire. A good part of his story consists of pointing up those contradictions. Thus he argues that a free market with floating exchange rates would have been catastrophic for the European standard of living after the war, so Bretton Woods and the Marshall Plan, hardly consonant with laissez-faire economics, were adopted to strengthen the Western powers. Mr. Kuttner also devotes an entire chapter to the export controls instituted by the Pentagon in the name of military security. These, he maintains, have resulted in American companies losing high-tech markets abroad to the Japanese and the Europeans.
After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, though the United States remained the geopolitical leader of the West, its domestic politics turned increasingly away from the Keynesian-welfare state heritage of the New Deal. Finally, Mr. Kuttner contends, "the policies of Reagan and Thatcher . . . all but obliterated the political logic of the postwar mixed economy." The Reagan years brought both an intensification of American militancy in waging the cold war and a further downgrading of interventionist economics.
Mr. Kuttner thinks that the end of the cold war creates an opportune moment for facing the realities of the world economy. (Most of his book was obviously written before Iraq invaded Kuwait, although he briefly comments in the introduction that "the Kuwait crisis underscored the United States' continuing image of itself as a hegemonic power while its major allies retained the habit of acting as free riders on the system.") His general argument is that the United States no longer has a geopolitical-military excuse for turning a blind eye on the partly managed trade policies of its allies, who are clearly not now going to embrace the free-trade faith they rejected even when in need of American military protection. The world, as the title of Mr. Kuttner's penultimate chapter suggests, is "Slouching Toward Pluralism."
Nations can now be distributed along a continuum from mercantilism to free trade, but none are situated at the extreme free-trade end -- not even the United States. As Mr. Kuttner shows, it has never fully practiced what it preaches, neither with regard to steel and semiconductors, sectors that affect national security, nor even in so nonmilitary an industry as textiles. Japan stands close to the mercantilist pole of the continuum, and Mr. Kuttner provides an informed chapter on the Japanese pursuit of export markets, often at the expense of domestic consumers.
Does he, then, urge a protectionist economic nationalism as recently advocated, at least tacitly, by some commentators on both the right and the left? He insists not, asserting that his goal is a global mixed economy that would create the conditions for peace and prosperity: "After a detour of nearly fifty years, we have cycled back to the agenda of 1944: pluralism, peace and planning." He wants a world system that will "discourage individual nations from running chronic trade surpluses" and suggests that European-Japanese trade relations provide a model for such a system.
Critics will contend that in practice Mr. Kuttner's prescriptions would lead to fierce economic competition among nations that would be devastating for the losers, whose ranks might very well include the United States. Mr. Kuttner himself recognizes as "two nagging political questions" the degree of farsightedness of American voters and the relative competence of the American public sector. Acknowledging the prevailing post-Reagan antigovernment mood shared even by the Democrats, he nevertheless expresses a cautious optimism that a new "planning coalition" including segments of business is forming. Whether one agrees with this or not, the richly detailed evidence Mr. Kuttner has assembled will have to be taken into account by anyone assessing the present state of the world economy.

HEADLINE: The Empire Strikes Back

BYLINE: By Craig R. Whitney; Craig R. Whitney is chief of the London bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
The Flying Scud is a 100-year-old pub on Hackney Road in East London, where Nazi air raids inflicted such suffering 50 years ago. Since the beginning of the war in the Persian Gulf, its owner, Graham Warden, has had the place decked out in Union Jack bunting, and he doesn't give a damn if brazen patriotism offends the Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan who have displaced most other people like him from the neighborhood.
The regulars who come to shoot darts by the doorway include a couple of reservists and even a local named John Major, so Warden claims. For 2.50 ($5), the 33-year-old publican will make you a "Scud missile," with a chemical warhead of Middle Eastern arrack liquor, vodka and bitter lemon, or a "Patriot missile," with American Jack Daniel's, English gin and grenadine. "The place has been called the Flying Scud since the 1880's," Warden explains. "It's actually the foam the wind whips up." 
 At the Flying Scud there has never been any doubt who would win the gulf war, just as there hasn't been any at Buckingham Palace. Soon after the allied ground offensive started on Feb. 24, Queen Elizabeth II, in a rare televised broadcast from the palace, asked the nation to pray that British success would be as swift as it was certain. In short order, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said "those of us who have contributed a lot" to the war effort "now have a stake" in the postwar arrangements. In the postwar period, he added, it should be made clear "that Saddam Hussein was completely a bogus, puffed-up frog of a man insofar as he claimed to be spokesman for the Arab world."
The British are fond of saying they may not get much else right but they know how and when to go to war and how to keep a stiff upper lip. Where, they ask smugly, were the Germans and the Japanese when the call to duty came? The British seized it almost gratefully, as though it were another chance to relive their finest hour. Without much ado, they sent more than 40,000 troops east of Suez to help 500,000 Yanks liberate Kuwait from Iraq. It was almost like having the empire back, what with Lieut. Gen. Sir Peter Edgar de la Cour de la Billiere, the commander of British forces in the gulf, rattling around like Field Marshal Montgomery in a desert region Lawrence of Arabia knew so well.
Compared with the American war machine in the gulf, the British contribution hasn't seemed like much, but it has been the biggest British deployment anywhere since World War II and by far the largest European contribution. Supported by a broad consensus of all the major parties in the House of Commons, the Government sent, along with its troops, 11 combatant ships, 12 support vessels, 100 or so attack aircraft, about 60 helicopters, and hundreds of artillery pieces and tanks.
As long as the war lasted, Britain was right in the war zone, with American B-52's flying combat missions from the Royal Air Force base in Fairford, about 70 miles west of London. The big planes had been using the base for years, pulling out last year after the cold war ended. The 2,500 people of the small Cotswold town gave a warm welcome-back to the air crews and the 1,000 Air Force medical personnel who came to run a military evacuation hospital for war casualties. The townspeople collected blankets and donated them to the Americans, who flew in from Texas, Mississippi and California unprepared for the cold.
"The atmosphere is very much like before the start of the last war," Ruth Ritter recalled recently. Ritter is the 65-year-old Mayor of Fairford and widow of a Royal Air Force veteran. "I was a child then, and all the grown-ups were talking about this awful thing that was going to happen, but it had to take its course and we had to make the best of it. We were all terribly excited and rushed outside to dig tank traps and that sort of thing. Now we come to an adult stage, and we are reliving those serious, whispered conversations of our parents then. The war in the gulf is a terrible thing, but it's got to be done."
This time, people rushed off, too -- many to donate blood; others to enlist. In London, at the British Army recruiting office on the Strand near Trafalgar Square, Command Sgt. Maj. Les Griffiths sits in a booth behind a vitrine full of tin soldiers that seems to lure as many tourists as prospective volunteers to the sparsely furnished room. As soon as the war began, Griffiths says, about five times as many volunteers as usual began coming in.
"There was one 63-year-old ex-soldier who was terminally ill," he continues. "He asked us to send him to the gulf and spare one of the young soldiers." The man was gently turned away. The all-volunteer army will take only people who want to make it a life career, and is not upping its national quota of 16,000 male and female volunteers this year, war or no war.
Social class lines still run clear in the British Army, where military leadership style hasn't changed much in 50 years and most officers join their regiments by invitation, usually after an interview at one of the elite public schools, not on Trafalgar Square. Sir Peter is a good example of the creme de la creme, a distinguished-looking aristocrat who wears the sand-colored military beret of the Special Air Service commando regiment, Britain's most elite force. A graduate of Harrow and a member of a Huguenot family, he served for 30 years in Britain's colonial wars in Malaya, Oman and the deserts of the Persian Gulf, and in the campaign to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982.
Last September, the highly decorated general was about to retire to hobbies he listed in Who's Who as "family, squash, down market apiculture, tennis perhaps, farming, sailing," when Margaret Thatcher picked him to lead the British forces under Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf of the United States. It is hard to imagine "Stormin' Norman" delivering a line like this one from Sir Peter about Saddam Hussein: "It is the sort of behavior you'd expect from the rather low-grade, second-hand sort of person that he is."
Violent talk or glorification of violence upsets the British, even if violence and war itself don't. Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, otherwise widely admired, shocked many people in Britain by the way he described what the allies would do to the Iraqi force in Kuwait. "First," Powell said, "we're going to cut it off, and then we're going to kill it." Sir David Craig, an air marshal and chief of the British defense staff, has made it sound more like a pruning operation on a genteel country weekend. "Our overall aim," he said, "has been to cut the limbs and branches from the Iraqi war machine so that it no longer casts its dark shadow over Kuwait."
That was also about all he said. British commanders generally don't like telling civilians any more than they need to know about how they run a war. During World War II, they had complete military censorship, and during the Falklands conflict all British correspondents were cooped up at sea, in military vessels, until British troops secured victory ashore. Some of Sir David's subordinates have the impression he would have liked that kind of arrangement in the gulf.
Although British correspondents in Saudi Arabia have been subject to the same pool restrictions as their American counterparts, in Britain a clubby, informal system of deciding what is fit to print or broadcast is in place, backed by British secrecy regulations that allow Ministry of Defense officials to call up any editor and suppress anything they deem a military secret.

THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN have been side by side in the gulf since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2, when Thatcher, then the Prime Minister, happened to be at President Bush's side in Aspen, Colo. There, in the vacation home of the American Ambassador to London, Henry E. Catto, the two leaders agreed in a two-hour talk that Saddam Hussein's aggression must not be allowed to stand.
In the fortress-like American Embassy on Grosvenor Square, Catto -- who will be leaving for Washington this week because Bush wants him to run the United States Information Agency -- mused recently about the nature of the "special relationship" between Britain and the United States.
"It builds on itself like a coral reef, and the longer it lasts, the sturdier it gets," he said. "Anguished Britons asked me all throughout 1990 why suddenly we seemed to be more involved with Germany than with them. I invariably answered that this was a function of the fact that the most dramatic change happening in the world then was in Germany. Britain was not reuniting; Germany was. And it was natural that the President should be more concerned with German affairs when the situation in Britain was quite serene." But, Catto added, "a couple of high American officials" had told him: "It looks like the only people we can really rely on are the Brits."
Since the beginning of the war, Major and Bush have been conferring by telephone every five days or so, even though, according to British officials, Bush is the Commander in Chief, and all the major decisions are his alone. That included decisions on the responses to the Soviet peace initiatives that started shortly before Feb. 15, when Saddam Hussein first acknowledged he would consider a withdrawal from Kuwait, and on the date to begin the allied ground assault.
Britain's voice, however, may carry further after the war. To prepare the way for peace, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd traveled to the gulf states in early February to elicit ideas on the kind of British and allied presence they would like to have after the war. Senior British diplomats say they do not expect Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to agree to a permanent Western force in the Persian Gulf. "They'd like to have us just below the horizon," one says, "ready to come in and rescue them if they're threatened again." As a former colonial power with extensive knowledge of the region, Britain has expected to play a prominent role in the peace negotiations.
Not everyone has supported the British involvement in the gulf. Tony Benn, a former viscount and the most visible antiwar leader in the House of Commons, not only derides this idea but dismisses the "special relationship" with the United States as an opiate of the British ruling classes. "It became clear to the United States some time ago that Saddam Hussein had gotten too big for his britches and they were going to cut him down to size," he says. "With the decline of the Soviet Union, the United States has seized this opportunity to reimpose control, and the British are piggybacking their way back. It is really the old imperial role."
There are also those who contend that, as with the Falklands war, the British Government has been distracting its people from domestic woes with prospects of a razzle-dazzle military victory in the gulf. In some ways, wartime London 1991 is a surreal reprise of the city in "the last war." Then, Britain had a sagging economy and daily life was reduced to the barest necessities. Today, the economy is in a free fall, driven into a deep recession by anti-inflationary policies the Government can't relax too quickly. Jobs are disappearing at the rate of about 3,000 a day. Unemployment rose to 6.6 percent at the end of January, with the largest monthly increase in five years, and inflation, while on the way down, is still 9 percent, the highest in Western Europe outside of Portugal and Greece. To keep inflation under control, the Government has kept interest rates painfully high, inflicting pain and hardship on hundreds of thousands of homeowners with variable-rate mortgages. As if all this isn't bad enough, hotels and department stores have been almost deserted as business travelers and foreign tourists, terrified of terrorism, have stayed at home.

THE COMPOSITION OF JOHN MAJOR'S War Cabinet tells a great deal about this particular war. There are the usual suspects: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd; Defense Secretary Tom King; the Chief of the Defense Staff, Sir David Craig; the Prime Minister's foreign policy and security adviser, Sir Percy Cradock, and Thatcher's longtime private secretary, Sir Charles Powell (who is serving Major until the gulf crisis is over). But the group also includes the Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, for advice on international law, and Energy Secretary John Wakeham, who is also the Government's publicity co-ordinator.
The War Cabinet, in other words, was running the war effort and worrying about its portrayal in the news media. It had plenty to worry about after the American precision bombing, on Feb. 13, of a Baghdad target the Pentagon described as a military command bunker. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians died in that attack, and the BBC and the Independent Television Network showed images of burnt bodies and distraught relatives, with commentators hinting not-so-subtly that a horrible mistake had been made.
Major's Government regretted the deaths but not the choice of target. The jingoistic British tabloid press had no regrets. The Sun, which ran the headline "GOTCHA!," when 368 Argentine sailors were killed on the cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands war, announced this time: "Saddam Hussein tried to trick the world yesterday by saying hundreds of women and children died in a bomb attack on an 'air raid shelter.' He cunningly arranged TV scenes designed to shock and appall. But the victims were sent to their deaths by the Iraqi leader himself."
War is hell, most of the British people seemed to feel, and if Saddam Hussein didn't want his people to get hurt in a war, he should have pulled out of Kuwait earlier. According to polls taken a month after the bombs started to fall on Iraq, almost 90 percent of the British people supported the war fully, a figure that is not expected to fall since British casualties have been amazingly light. The day of the cease-fire, John Major told the House of Commons that 16 had been killed (9 by so-called friendly fire), 7 were seriously injured and 12 airmen were missing.
 Millions of Britons remember that their country went to war nearly 52 years ago against a rapacious dictator because he had invaded a defenseless, faraway country. Many have taken at face value their Government's reason for getting involved in the gulf conflict: to assert the principles of a new world order violated by Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait.
This has also been broadly accepted across party lines in the House of Commons. Labor's leader, Neil Kinnock, has not let continuing pressure from his party's back-bench radicals, or his own anxieties about a general election after the war, keep him from supporting the war effort and reaffirming that support when the ground offensive began.
After the beginning of the air bombing campaign in January, antiwar protesters held rallies in London almost every weekend, but none of them came close to the size of the 150,000-strong peace demonstration in Bonn at the end of January. The long stretch of bitter cold weather that began when the war did might have something to do with it.
British intellectuals have been remarkably quiet about the war, almost as if those who object to it feel bullied into silence and those who support it feel too awkward to say so. Robert Giddings, a writer who teaches at Bournemouth Polytechnic, says he thinks part of the reason is that leftists opposed to the war feel betrayed by Kinnock, who has suppressed dissent by his back-benchers, forcing five of his shadow cabinet ministers to resign.
New Statesman & Society, the small left-wing weekly, has not been mincing words in condemning the war, and there have been critical editorials and articles in The Guardian and The Independent newspapers. The actress Vanessa Redgrave, who has political aspirations, has deplored, evenhandedly she insists, the bombing of Iraqis by the allies, the bombing of Israelis by the Iraqis and the continuing repression of Palestinians on the West Bank.
In one of the crowded, noisy strangers' rooms -- cafeterias -- at the House of Commons, Tony Benn, the radical Labor Member of Parliament, brews a pot of tea and tries to explain why people like him seem to be in such a minority these days.
"Britain is a feudal society in which the powers of the crown have been undiluted since the 17th century, but are now exercised by the Prime Minister instead of the monarch," he says. "The Prime Minister has unfettered royal powers which can be exercised in times of war. We are a nation of cap-doffers, and people defer to that kind of power without questioning it. And don't forget, the BBC is a state radio, and it suppresses the considerable public opposition to the war. I've had 8,000 letters of support for my position, and only 200 against."
Although little remarked on in Britain, powerful currents of submerged ethnic and racial hostility have also fanned jingoistic flames. "True Brits," as The Sun calls them, were baffled and irritated in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence on the writer Salman Rushdie, a sentence that found widespread support among British Muslims. Now Britons could show what they thought by dropping bombs on Saddam Hussein -- never mind that Syria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, their allies, are also Arab, Muslim countries.
The Muslim population -- about one million people in a country of 57.5 million -- is one segment of British society that did not even exist during the last war, and its attitudes toward this one have been decidedly uneasy. Some worship at the golden-domed President Saddam Hussein Mosque in Birmingham, built before the war with the help of a $3.2 million donation from the Iraqi leader, who insisted that the place bear his name. There have been firebomb attacks on at least three mosques around the country, but not there, according to a man who answered the telephone one recent Friday. "We are all British Muslims," says Hazratmia Kazi, president of the mosque. "Our first allegiance is to our Government."
Almost all British Muslims, in Birmingham and elsewhere, are Asians, not Arabs, but the community is more complex and divided than it appears. Some factions are pro-Saudi; others, pro-Iranian. And attitudes about the war range from outright opposition to support but tending mostly to uneasy silence. Some employers and municipal authorities in places like Bradford, with a heavy Muslim concentration, urged their staff not to wear the Union Jack on their sleeves -- as The Sun suggested all patriotic Brits do as a sign of support for the war -- to avoid offending Muslim colleagues opposed to the British presence in the gulf.
In January, the authorities rounded up 52 Arabs living in Britain, putting 34 of them, because of their military status, in a prisoner-of-war camp near Salisbury and placing others in prisons in Yorkshire and London. In all, according to the Home Office, 176 people were served with deportation notices between Aug. 2 and late February, including 164 Iraqi citizens. About 80 have left voluntarily. Besides those in the P.O.W. camp, 44 are being held in civilian jails or reporting regularly to police officers; 16 have won their appeals for freedom.
One of those detained in January was a 31-year-old Palestinian who has lived as an orphan in Britain since 1977 and whose sole offense is that he is a nephew of Abu Nidal, the terrorist, whom he said he had met once at a family gathering in 1976. Another was Abbas Cheblak, a 47-year-old Palestinian writer who has lived in London for 16 years and has a wife and two young children. He is also an executive member of the Arab Human Rights Committee, a group that has campaigned against Saddam Hussein.
Britain doesn't have a written Constitution or a Bill of Rights, and Cheblak and others like him could only look to the Government's own review procedures for protection. British civil courts would claim no jurisdiction. With few exceptions, leaders of British public opinion do not see the detention of Arab residents as a constitutional issue.
Cheblak hired a solicitor and his wife got a Conservative M.P., Sir Dennis Walters, to take up his case. Sir Dennis said he had agreed because the Government had never offered a reason for Cheblak's detention and he felt that in fairness it should have. The Government's advisory panel lifted the expulsion order and set Cheblak free, but never told him why. It let stand the order against Abu Nidal's nephew, whose identity has been kept secret by court order, but allowed him to return to his home in South London -- so that he can apply for asylum in the same country that wants to expel him in the first place.
For officials at 10 Downing Street, these are just two more unavoidable casualties of war. "There are people actually trying to blow us up, you know," one of them says, referring to the recent terrorist attacks by the Irish Republican Army.

EVEN BEFORE THE I.R.A. bombings in London, Americans stopped coming to Britain because of the gulf war. And there has been considerable British griping about the lack of American civilian nerve, as though Americans were the only ones not going anyplace.
"I have to relate a shameful example of apparent mass cowardice -- I cannot, in conscience, employ a less emotive word -- on the part of our American cousins," Stephen Wood wrote to The Spectator the other day, relating his frustration in trying to arrange a tour of Scotland next September by the American Society of Arms Collectors. "I discovered not only that the society's governing council had withdrawn its official backing to the tour but also that, of the original 200 people booked to attend, 112 had canceled," he wrote in "amazement, disbelief and disgust."
One can just imagine what Thatcher would have said about such pusillanimity. Actually, a surprising number of British Government officials have said privately they are relieved she hasn't been leading the British war effort. She would have been provocative and bellicose, they say, much as she was in the Falklands war. And unlike Major, she wouldn't have been content to cash in the opposition Labor Party's support for the war at face value -- she would have probed its divisions and forced its large, repressed antiwar faction out into the open. Judging by the opinion polls, the British people like their new leader's more laid-back style, rating him as the most popular Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, who led the country in "the last war."
Like George Bush, John Major wanted to avoid heavy British casualties in gigantic tank and infantry battles in the desert, and the Government supported a continuation of the air bombing campaign with that aim in mind. Insisting on eliminating Saddam Hussein before ending the war would also have endangered the broad political consensus in support of it, and Major has not pushed the point. Again, like Bush, he has hinted that with the dictator in place, the United Nations mandate to restore peace and stability to the gulf region can hardly be fulfilled.
"He is a man without pity and, whatever his fate may be, I, for one, will not weep for him," Major said in the House of Commons on Jan. 22, soon after seven battered allied airmen, two British fliers among them, were displayed on Iraqi television, with Saddam Hussein declaring that the prisoners would be deployed as human shields at strategic sites. Major's statement was only one of many British hints that Iraqis would be the best judges of the Iraqi dictator's fate after the fighting stops.
And what of the fate of the P.M. himself after peace has been declared? After a clear and quick victory, Major could risk a general election as early as May or June rather than wait for July 1992, when the writ of the current Parliament runs out. If he should fail in the polls, it would not be the first British victory on the battlefield that evaporated during peacetime -- as Churchill, turned out by the voters in his hour of triumph in 1945, would be the first to tell his successors.

HEADLINE: In the Land of Lambada

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is head of the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
ON April 22, 1500, a Portuguese nobleman stood on the rolling deck of a caravel and recorded Europe's first vision of what is now called Brazil: coral reefs, fingers of fine white sand, windblown coconut palms and lush mangrove thickets rich with crabs and splashed with the red and green plumage of parrots.
From the wooden cross that the nobleman, Pedro Alvares Cabral, erected a few days later at Porto Seguro (safe harbor) small Portuguese villages soon grew -- humble stucco cottages dominated by whitewashed churches. But in subsequent decades Portugal's vast South Atlantic colony grew in other directions, and Brazil's Plymouth Rock lapsed into tropical neglect. 
 Principal access to Porto Seguro, 110 miles south of Ilheus, continued to be by sea until 1972, the year a paved road was pushed through to the coast. When pioneering tourists -- largely Brazilian and European hippies -- ventured to Trancoso, a neighboring village, they introduced a money economy to a community that had long since reverted to barter.
Today scheduled airlines bring in tourists daily from Brazil's largest cities. The country's most popular tourist destination in the northeast after Salvador and Recife, Porto Seguro, which has a population of about 5,000, offers comfortable hotels and excellent seafood restaurants in a setting of primeval beauty that struck Portuguese explorers almost 500 years ago.
The hippies' political legacy is a large and militant local chapter of Brazil's Green Party. Zoning laws are zealously enforced to preserve beaches and historic buildings, some of which rank among the oldest in South America. Indeed, much of the coast of southern Bahia State is still wilderness.
Modern American visitors too will feel a sense of discovery here. While Brazilian guidebooks list as many as 100 hotels and guesthouses in Porto Seguro and the neighboring villages of Trancoso and Arraial d'Ajuda, English-language guidebooks devote relatively little space to this remote corner of southern Bahia State. When Americans think of vacationing on Brazilian beaches, they think of Copacabana and Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro. When Rio residents think of vacationing on Brazilian beaches, they head for Porto Seguro.
"Less than 1 percent of our tourists are foreigners," said Cicero G. de Sena Neto, former director of the local trade association and now manager of the Portobello Praia Hotel, one of Porto Seguro's top four hotels.
For visitors strolling the cobblestone streets, shaded by breadfruit and weeping fig trees, Porto Seguro offers a spirit that is fading from Brazil's coastal megapolises -- honesty, amiability and a guileless smile. As tourism has grown in recent years, Porto Seguro has also won a niche in Brazilian mythology for string bikini sensuality and bronzed beach athletics. The town's two international exports reflect this: a world windsurfing champion and the sensuous dance called the lambada.
 Because seasons are reversed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Americans can visit Porto Seguro in the off season, March through June and August through November. During Brazil's summer, December through February, and during winter break in July, the fishing villages can become so crowded that they take on the air of a Brazilian Fort Lauderdale. But off season, prices are lower, restaurants and hotels are less crowded and the local people are more patient with tourists who do not speak Portuguese.
Our trip last June started from Rio's downtown Santos Dumont airport. Shortly after taking off in a 14-seater plane of Nordeste Airlines, the pilot pointed north and the co-pilot settled into reading the sports section of a newspaper. Passengers watched the changing coastline below -- the salt flats of Cabo Frio, the yachts and turquoise-green swimming pools of Buzios and the eucalyptus plantations of Espirito Santo. We stopped to refuel at a southern Bahian town named, appropriately, Caravelas. For scuba divers, Caravelas is now the jumping-off point for boat tours of the Abrolhos National Marine Park, an uninhabited archipelago 40 miles offshore.
 From Porto Seguro airport, it was a 10-minute taxi ride to our hotel, the Portobello Praia. Porto Seguro has several car rental agencies, but with driving reduced to one beach road, we found it simpler to have the hotel receptionist telephone for cabs. The hotel, reflecting local taste and zoning restrictions, is a Mediterranean-style two-story building with a decor of natural materials -- black wood trim, beige roofing tiles and red hibiscus blooms brushing against whitewashed walls.
 Crossing the coast road to Itaperapua beach, a two-minute walk, one appreciated the zealousness of Porto Seguro's Green Party. Viewed from the water's edge, the beach road and the low, setback hotel disappeared behind a long line of native vegetation, largely coconut palms. A series of immaculate beaches and coves runs for roughly 10 miles along the beach drive, protected by offshore reefs and affording good swimming. The only signs of man on Porto Seguro's beaches were palhocas, wooden restaurant-bars with round thatched roofs. At Boto's, the inescapable lambada music blasted from loudspeakers as beachgoers snacked on fried shrimp and sipped batidas de coco, stiff iced drinks of half coconut milk and half locally distilled sugar cane rum.
Lambada is the theme that links the scattered villages of southern Bahia's coast. By Porto Seguro's docks, a few yards from one of two competing crosses that supposedly mark the site of the first Roman Catholic Mass in Brazil, a sandy lane named Discovery Avenue now houses a string of open-air lambaterias. There, tourists from southern Brazil pay loose-hipped dance instructors to discover that they are stiff-jointed.

IN 1988 a French entrepreneur, Olivier Lamotte d'Incamps, visited Porto Seguro and discovered locals dancing the tightly syncopated lambada to a melody that turned out to be Bolivian. With a blitz of publicity, Mr. Lamotte d'Incamps launched the lambada craze, largely by promoting a European tour of Kaoma, a Porto Seguro dance group. Forgettable movies followed.
The lambada meteor eventually crashed , but only after Kaoma sold over seven million records. Down on Discovery Avenue, local teen-agers dance on, dreaming of making it in groups that still tour Brazil under names like "Do Do From Bahia and the Virgins From Porto Seguro."
For more highbrow entertainment, a hike up a nearby bluff takes a visitor to the colonial heart of Porto Seguro. Declared a National Historic and Artistic Monument in 1973 and closed to cars old Porto Seguro includes Our Lady of Mercy Church (1523), reputedly Brazil's oldest church still in use, Our Lady of the Blacks, built by and for African slaves, and a white and mustard-trim town council house and jail whose Baroque style has survived untouched since construction in 1772. Set against a sweeping view of the sea, a roughly hewn white marble marker bears the arms of Portugal and the cross of Prince Henry the Navigator. Erected in 1503, the marker is generally considered Brazil's oldest surviving colonial monument. Every April 22 Portuguese diplomats gather here to celebrate Discovery Day. As Porto Seguro has blossomed into a full-fledged resort, the diplomats' interest in fulfilling this official chore has grown.
Descending a cobblestone lane, one arrives at Porto Seguro's main oceanfront street, Avenida Portugal. Nicknamed Passarela do Alcool, literally Alcohol Alley, the street is lined with sidewalk cafes, stand-up bars, resort-style pizzerias, handcraft boutiques and seafood restaurants. All are housed in the traditional one-story fishermen's cottages, with pastel stucco facades. Items for sale include hand-embroidered cotton tablecloths, painted clay figurines from the rural Northeast and baskets woven locally from white creeper vines.
On the Passarela, Tres Vintens offers rich Afro-Brazilian seafood dishes bubbling hot in earthenware pots. The 1970's decor -- geometric designs by Max Escher -- can seem overwhelming after a few batidas of coconut milk or passion fruit juice. Nearby, Ilha do Mel (Honey Island) offers Charles Aznavour music while waiters serve slices of California pizza (topped with peaches and figs) and glasses of draft beer chilled to what Brazilians call "stupefyingly cold." For dessert, an espresso bar next door serves chilled slices of lime pie and ricotta pie.

A FEW blocks away, on Avenida des Navegantes, the Porto Oriental restaurant offers bossa nova music and Chinese food cooked with local shrimp. With one of Brazil's richest fishing grounds offshore, Porto Seguro fishermen bring home varied catches: shrimp, octopus, mullet, snook, sea bass, red snapper, swordfish, mackerel, anchovies and flatfish.
For excursions out of Porto Seguro, the paved beach road continues 15 miles north to Santa Cruz de Cabralia, a colonial-era village named in honor of the Portuguese explorer. Along the way, it is not worth stopping at Ponta da Coroa Vermelha (Red Reef Point), where there is a brazilwood cross marking another reputed site of the first Mass in Brazil. The site is surrounded by a Pataxos Indian community. Today's Pataxos dress up as Indians and jog alongside tourists' cars, peddling neo-Pataxos trinkets and tomahawks.
Cabralia, the northern terminus of the beach drive, offers a hilltop colonial church and an embarkation point for schooner tours of offshore reefs. We set off for a day tour in the Luanda, a schooner that takes tourists cruising; it is owned by a Portuguese who fled Angola after colonial rule collapsed there. With the inescapable lambada medleys wafting over the waters, the blue and white trim Luanda glided past mangrove swamps until anchoring at Coroa Alta reef. With sneakers protecting their feet, passengers spent the morning clambering over the milelong coral reef, inspecting pools where luminiscent fish were trapped by tides in temporary tropical aquariums. On high ground, two men sold chilled coconuts for 75 cents apiece to the thirsty amateur naturalists.
The $16-a-day excursion rate included a Bahian lunch buffet at a beachfront restaurant accessible only by boat.
Boat tours also head south for the less-visited beaches of Arraial d'Ajuda and Trancoso. But these beaches are generally unprotected by coral reefs and the ride is in the rough open sea. An alternative is to go to the ferry dock in Porto Seguro and cross the Buranhem River in a 15-minute ferry ride (40 cents). On the other side, a city bus will lurch over a pitted dirt road to Arraial (15 minutes) and on to Trancoso (another 45 minutes; $1.20). The road to Trancoso is so bad that it is usually impassable after heavy rains. Arraial's church dates back to 1549. Trancoso's church is comparatively modern, dating only to 1656 -- 36 years after the first English settlement in Plymouth Rock.

HEADLINE: 'Other Boroughs' Strategy Bucks Difficult Times

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A FIVE-YEAR campaign to lure office development to the New York City boroughs outside Manhattan is scoring scattered new successes but encountering tough resistance because of the city's real estate and business downturn.
The program, called the "other boroughs" strategy during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, has relied on an array of financial incentives -- including tax abatements, moving allowances and cut-rate electricity -- to make development sites in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island more competitive. Similar inducements are available to businesses and developers north of 96th Street in Manhattan. 
 Experts say the effort has bogged down, largely because of the weak market for office space in Manhattan, where many landlords are now offering good space for as little as $20 to $25 a square foot. Space in buildings outside Manhattan costs office tenants just as much, even when the savings from the city incentives are figured in.
Some say the program, however well intentioned, is far from well timed. "It is hard for local government to play a counter-cyclical policy game," said Raymond Horton, director of the Citizens Budget Committee, a watchdog group.
But officials of the Dinkins administration say they are not deterred. The long-range intent of the program, they say, is to spur construction and business expansion in the city's dormant or declining neighborhoods and make them more competitive with Jersey City, Stamford, Conn., and other nearby office centers that have been courting banks, securities firms and other Manhattan companies.
"If there is one policy that stands out that is something we have carried over from the Koch administration, it is the emphasis on the other boroughs," said Jeanne P. Nathan, a spokeswoman for Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
Yet recent demand for offices outside Manhattan has come mostly from city, state and Federal agencies. And analysts say marketing the space to private companies has become increasing difficult because of layoffs, reduced earnings and tabled expansion plans.
Several transactions that have been completed over the last month or are widely believed to be pending promise a small new flurry of development, particularly in downtown Brooklyn, which has so far emerged as the major focus of the other-boroughs program.
In a deal described by officials of several city agencies, the Brooklyn District Attorney, with a staff of 1,000 lawyers and support personnel, is in final negotiations for a lease on 200,000 to 350,000 square feet of offices in Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza, a complex planned by the Muss Development Company of Manhattan since 1984 above a municipal garage on Jay Street.
Spokesmen for Muss and Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, declined to confirm the transaction. But others said the deal is likely to mean that construction will begin this year on the complex, which is to include a 356-room Hilton Hotel, the first new Brooklyn hotel in decades, as well as 600,000 square feet of offices.
Forest City Enterprises, the largest developer in downtown Brooklyn, said in late February that it would join Rose Associates, another development firm, in the long-delayed Atlantic Center project. The complex is ultimately to include 1.8 million square feet of office space, 189 townhouses, stores and movie theaters in a complex over the Long Island Rail Road Station on Atlantic Avenue.
Bruce Ratner, president of Forest City, declined to say how much the firm would invest in the project. Because of the weak office market, he said, construction of housing will begin as soon as two lawsuits that challenge the projects size and density are resolved, but office construction may be put on hold for years.
Forest City is also the developer of Metrotech, a 4-million-square-foot complex of new and rehabilitated offices covering 10 blocks in downtown Brooklyn that is now more than half complete. In a separate development, Mr. Ratner said last week that the Internal Revenue Service had signed a lease for the former Barton Candy Company building, a 300,000-square-foot structure that Forest City had acquired just south of Metrotech on Fulton Street and that rehabilitation of the building had begun.
THE latest round of deals comes amid a spate of new construction that began in 1987 and has been prompted in part by the city's incentives. Over 10 million square feet of offices -- more than the total of the twin towers of the World Trade Center -- was completed, being built or in the planning pipeline by the end of the decade in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.
In Long Island City, Queens, Citcorp at Court Square, a 42-story, 1.25-million-square-foot tower completed in early 1989, has been filled by 3,000 executives, data processers and other employees of Citibank. Like several other large banks, Citibank has announced extensive job cuts, saying it would lay off 8,000 workers around the world by mid-1992. It declined last week to say if any jobs would be cut in the Queens building.
Citicorp, the bank's corporate parent, also obtained city approval in the late 1980's to build a second, 1.2 million office tower another site it owns across 43d Street. But it said it has not decided whether to proceed with construction.
On Staten Island, Teleport II, a three-story, 165,000-square-foot office building, was completed in December as part of the five-year-old Teleport complex. Four other office buildings in the complex have already been fully leased by corporate tenants, including Merrill Lynch, Dunn and Bradstreet and the Allstate Insurance Company and New York City's Public Development Corporation said it was seeking other securities firms, banks and high-technology tenants for the new building.
A long troubled building in the Bronx, Fordham Plaza, with 350,000 square feet of offices at Fordham Road and Webster Street, is now more than 95 percent occupied, according to Kathy Zamechansky, a spokeswoman for the building.
Completed in 1985 by a group of private developers, the buiding sat more than half empty for over four years. But several large tenants, including the administrative staff of Montefiore Medical Center, have signed leases over the last 12e months.
In downtown Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would begin moving 2,000 workers by May into Livingston Plaza, a 12-story, 500,000-square-foot building nearing completion at Livingston Street and Boerum Place. Built with city incentives by Cohen Brothers Realty and the Starrett Housing Corporation, the building was bought by the mass-transit agency for $120 million in November 1989.
Metrotech, the largest project outside Manhattan, may now pose the biggest test of the city's other-boroughs campaign. Although Forest City had signed leases for most of the complex before it began construction in early 1988, it will have 390,000 square feet ready to rent to new corporate tenants in September. That space is part of a 21 story tower -- the tallest in the Metrotech complex -- in which the Brooklyn Union Gas Company has already leased space for its headquarters.
Because rents have declined in Manhattan, "there are a lot of companies that suddenly won't consider Brooklyn, New Jersey or any other alternative," said Mr. Ratner.
But he added that negotiations are "very active" with several companies interested in the Metrotech space and that Forest City is not considering government agencies as tenants.
The biggest Metrotech tenant, the Chase Manhattan Bank, said last week it has not changed its plan to move 6,000 workers to the complex in October, despite its recent announcement of more than 5,000 layoffs worldwide.
The Securities Industry Automation Corporation moved its headquarters and 800 workers to the complex late last year and the Brooklyn Union Gas Company will move its headquarters into Metrotech later this year.
One benefit of the recent downturn in rents is that, by making Manhattan less expensive, it has prevented some businesses from moving out and persuaded others to expand. But city officials acknowledge that it has made their other-boroughs campaign more difficult.
"As Manhattan rents come down, the role of the other boroughs as a lower-cost alternative changes somewhat," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Public Development Corporation, the city's development arm. Nonetheless, he added that some areas outside Manhattan, particularly downtown Brooklyn, have established "a center of gravity that supports itself" and could compete even without offering steep price discounts.
 Some real estate executives are unconvinced.
Despite the large leases signed by Citibank, Chase and others in the late 1980's, "we have all be disappointed that we haven't seen continued out-borough growth," said John Ritter, a broker with Sholom and Zuckerbrot, a Long Island City firm that deals in office space throughout Brooklyn and Queens.
He added that many Manhattan landlords, particularly those with older buildings on the side streets of Midtown and the Wall Street area, are now offering space for no more than is asked at Teleport, Metrotech or other new buildings in the other boroughs.
"There is no impetus to move out of Manhattan," he said.
At City Hall, Ms. Nathan of the Finance and Economic Development office said officials do not expect a new surge of large- scale office developments outside Manhattan any time soon.
"You are not going to see humongous projects going up in the middle of nowhere," she said, adding that the aim of the Dinkins administration was to foster small-scale development and business expansion in established office locations and retail strips of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
INCENTIVES offered by the city's other-boroughs program, established by Mayor Koch and retained by Mayor David N. Dinkins, include the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, in which businesses are given tax abatements amounting to $500 for each of their employees for 12 years.
Others include city grants of up to $60,000 to help defray the cost of a business' moving from Midtown or Lower Manhattan to another borough. Additional tax abatements are designed to reduce electrical bills by up to 30 percent for companies that move to another borough.
The Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program is due to expire in December. Ms. Nathan said the her office was preparing a recommendation to the City Council that it be renewed and amended to offer even bigger tax savings to firms moving to what she called the "more distressed" sections of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island and Manhattan above 96th Street.
One project that remains in the pipeline after years of planning, and would have a highly visible impact on Brooklyn, is the development of the idle Piers 1 through 5, with 70 acres of waterfront land below the Brooklyn Heights esplanade. The property is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was forced last year, under pressure from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and others, to abandon its plan to sell the site to Larry Silverstein and Arthur Cohen, private developers who planned a hotel, shops, marinas and expensive condominiums.
That plan was opposed vigorously by many civic organizations, including the Brooklyn Bridge Park Coalition, an umbrella group that has proposed that more than half the land be set aside for parks, and the remainder be developed in a way that minimizes structural density.
Since Governor Cuomo instructed the Port Authority and other agencies late last year to devise a plan for the site, a series of negotiations have ensued, but so far with little apparent progress. After a meeting on Tuesday, officials of the Urban Development Corporation, the state's development agency, and the Public Development Corporation, said many options remained under study, including building offices, restaurants, shops and apartments.

HEADLINE: 6 Opinions on School Finance Law

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
WHILE the debate in Trenton about education has recently focused on the amount of money that should be shifted from the Quality Education Act, Gov. Jim Florio's sweeping overhaul of New Jersey public school financing, to property tax relief, other aspects of the law continue to provoke controversy.
Dozens of bills have been introduced to amend the act, which took only 22 days last spring to clear the Legislature but will probably take months to reach its final form. 
 Stung by complaints from angry taxpayers that a $1.1 billion increase in state education spending was excessive and by criticism from wealthy communities that the law imperiled the quality of education they can offer, Governor Florio has announced that the entire law is open to being amended. Criticism of the act centers on a number of fundamental issues, including questions of accountability, what a community's fair share of education costs should be and what a "quality education" actually entails.
Several people outside government who have been following the evolution of the act were asked to comment on aspects of the law they felt were most in need of being amended. All thought the law represented an improvement over the current system of financing public education, but still felt there were wrinkles to be worked out.
Dr. Reock says he is troubled by the use of personal income as a measure of what a community can afford to pay for its public education system. Although the current formula relies only on property wealth, the new law weighs property wealth and personal income equally in an effort to address the problem of rapidly increasing property values in the 1980's that far outpaced personal income gains.
"The problem is, school districts can't tax personal income, and when you measure the wealth of a community using that as one of the factors, it causes a lot of anomalies," Dr. Reock said.
Dr. Reock said that among those who would be hurt by the change were people with low incomes who live in wealthy communities and those on fixed incomes. He said he believed that the law would also be a windfall to commercial and industrial property owners in relatively low-income school districts and to seasonal resort properties, where the year-round population is generally small and relatively poor.
Dr. Reock said even urban areas would be hurt by the addition of an income factor since the spread of incomes in these areas is generally less than the range of property values. For example, Orange's property values, when related to school enrollment, are only 30 percent of the state average, while the community's personal income factor is 90 percent of the state average. Thus, its average state wealth will be 60 percent under the new system, as opposed to 30 percent currently.
"If they just did it on property value, they'd get a lot more state aid and their property taxes would be down," Dr. Reock said.
To circumvent the problem, he said, property value should remain the sole index of determining state aid to education, as it has been for 15 years.
Mr. Coe, who presides over the 13,300-member association of mostly small and middle-sized companies, is not averse to a huge increase in new state aid into the schools, but he is concerned how the money will be spent.
"One the greatest things a governor can do in terms of economic development for the future is to invest in education, particularly in the new, knowledge-based economy," Mr. Coe said. "But before doing too much on the money side, wouldn't it be nice to know exactly what you're doing?"
All the changes Mr. Coe would like to see made to the law would actually add to its expense. He wants the state to continue to pay teacher pension and Social Security costs, estimated to be nearly $900 million a year, and he thinks that wealthy districts have been too severely penalized in the way state aid is meted out.
But the biggest problem with the law, as far as Mr. Coe is concerned, is accountability.
"At the same time the State Department of Education has been given the awesome responsibility of overseeing how the money is spent, its budget is being cut from $45 million to $37 million," Mr. Coe said. "From my standpoint, I'd rather be very comfortable that Ellis had the managerial power and the dollars needed to do a superior job in that connection." He was referring to Dr. John Ellis, the State Commissioner of Education.
Last month, Dr. Ellis acknowledged that the proposed budget cuts for his department would make it very difficult for him to insure the funds were properly spent.
Mr. Tractenberg, founder of the Newark-based Education Law Center, which challenged New Jersey's current system of financing public education, had hoped to see New Jersey adopt a system of full state financing of the schools through an income tax. He thinks that the Quality Education Act does not go far enough in assuring that educational spending in poor urban districts and wealthier ones will be equalized.
"There's a kind of hope and prayer approach, but no specificity about it being accomplished," he said.
The act sets up a formula for general education aid that weighs poorer districts more heavily and is subject to periodic review by the Commissioner of Education, but that is not precise enough for Mr. Tractenberg.
"To close the gap it seems to me one could take a somewhat comparable approach to the way aid will be phased out for the wealthy districts," he said. "You can identify the gap now and say the formula has to cut it by 25 percent a year so that equality of expenditure is achieved."
Mr. Tractenberg said he was also troubled by the way state aid for at-risk and bilingual students would be determined. "The figures are based on what's always been the case, without any requirement that somebody really look at what a good program costs and make sure that that money is available," he said.
Mr. Tractenberg said that recent legislative efforts to divert part of the school aid to property tax relief would almost inevitably lead to future court challenges.
"They fly about as directly in the face of what the Supreme Court said as one can imagine," Mr. Tractenberg said.
Dr. Goertz, who has been analyzing New Jersey's system of financing public education since 1976, says that the biggest flaw in the Quality Education Act is the lack of a strong mechanism to force the state to close spending disparities among school districts. In addition, she says she is concerned that the law does not adequately address the problem of insufficient and aging school buildings.
"As we increase the number of services for students, we're going to have to increase the amount of space available," Dr. Goertz said. "For all-day kindergartens, we need to double the kindergarten space, and if we're hiring more counselors, we need some place to put them."
The act allocates $110 a pupil for buildings, enough, Dr. Goertz said, for maintenance. A $600 million general facilities state bond issue is currently before the Legislature, but Dr. Goertz said that would make only a "dent" in the estimated $2 billion to $4 billion needed to upgrade or expand school buildings. She called for a long-range program, lasting 10 to 20 years, to be developed within the act or in separate legislation that addresses the building-improvements issue comprehensively.
"It's a large problem, and it's not only just an inner-city problem," she said.
 Dr. Smith may hold an unpopular opinion in this wealthy Union County community.
"The act itself is a movement in the right direction for New Jersey," he said. "We do need to provide more resources to urban areas and other tax-poor areas, and we also need to shift resources from more wealthy areas to others."
That said, however, Dr. Smith is disturbed at a number of aspects of the law, including the provision that shifts pension costs from the state to local districts, a restricted cap placed on local spending and the virtual elimination of state aid for at-risk students in wealthy districts. But Dr. Smith's chief complaint is a broader, more philosophical one.
"It fails completely to address the continuing problem in New Jersey of the state mandating all sorts of programs and services and then not providing any assistance," he said.
As an example of excessive intrusiveness, Dr. Smith cited state regulations that require aspirin to be dispensed to a child only by a fully certified school nurse.
"What that has done has required lots of school districts to add certified school nurses," he said. "It's conceivable that a school district might choose not to spend the money on that but to spend the money on a music teacher and let the principal give out the aspirin."
With the elimination of minimum aid for wealthy school districts, Westfield will lose at least $4 million in state aid over the next four years. "That means that we're going to have to eliminate $4 million of what we are doing now," said Dr. Smith, a member of a commission appointed by Governor Florio to review the Quality Education Act and make recommendations on changing the law and shaping what the Governor called a "world class" education for the state's schoolchildren.
"As we wrestle with that very difficult situation, I don't think there should be areas that are out of bounds because the state has passed a law about them," he said.
One of the most debated parts of the Quality Education Act is the provision that shifts pension and Social Security costs from the state to local school districts. Pressed by the New Jersey School Boards Association and other education groups, legislators have introduced more than a dozen bills to reverse the move.
"The problem is, though school boards negotiate salaries, they don't negotiate pension benefits and changes in the state system," Dr. Boose said.
Mr. Florio has agreed to a two-year moratorium on the pension issue while the commission he appointed to review the law completes its study.
But the heated debate about pension costs has obscured an even more fundamental problem with the law, Dr. Boose said. He said school districts needed direction as well as money.
"The Commissioner of Education has talked long and hard about a 'world class' education," he said. "The Department of Education has to divine where they'd like districts to be going. That debate has not taken place.
 "It is incumbent upon the department and the Commissioner that once the ink is dried on the next chapter of this act, that that discussion take place."
The recent emphasis on the act as a means of property tax relief has obscured the purpose of the law, Dr. Boose said.
"There's a need for the Quality Education Act to be viewed as the Quality Education Act and not the quality tax reform act," he said. "There has been a major shift by the politicians to make this act, which was an act for children, an act for taxpayers."

HEADLINE: Bursting With Change, New Jersey's Soul Becomes More Diverse

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AFTER Hong Yoon graduated from dental school and set up his Manhattan practice, he wanted to move his family out of the city and into suburbia. In his search for a community that would offer a touch of Korean culture, Dr. Yoon headed across the Hudson River to New Jersey and found what he was looking for in Fort Lee.
When Gary Repetti and his wife, Barbara, both lifelong Hoboken residents, began thinking about starting a family, they wanted to move to a community that had clean air, open spaces and a better-than-average school system. They left Hoboken, headed south on the Garden State Parkway and found what they were looking for in Toms River. 
 And when Brian, Bradley and Bonnie Burns, two brothers and a sister from Closter, left their parents' Bergen County home in search of apartments, and adventures, of their own, they found what they were looking for in Union City, the municipality that their parents left behind more than 35 years before.
 
Shifting Population
 Such scenes, and thousands like them, underlie the statistics that have been pouring out of government computers since the completion of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. Experts say that those statistics depict a New Jersey boiling with change -- its suburbs rapidly expanding, its cities radically changing character, its soul becoming increasingly heterogenous and its people taking on a more ethnic hue.
 "The state's center of gravity is changing," said Marilyn Marks Rubin, an associate professor of economics and public administration at the City University of New York. "We're seeing a population shift from the older, more industrial areas in the northeast to the newer, more suburban growth areas in the middle and southern parts of the state."
Ms. Rubin said that while such a shift was predicted by experts and officials, the 1990 census figures have ratified those predictions. Essex County, for example, lost 73,098 residents, or 8.6 percent of its total population, over the last 10 years. During that same time period Ocean County gained 87,165 residents, increasing its population by 25.6 percent. And Atlantic County, benefiting from increased employment in Atlantic City, has seen its population grow by more than 30,000 people.
And to the extent that counties like Passaic and Camden managed to show modest gains in population, Ms. Rubin said, those gains must be attributed in large part to massive migrations of Hispanic people into cities like Passaic, Paterson and Camden.
"Without the influx of the Hispanic population," Ms. Rubin said, "I believe you would have seen a continuing decline in all of the state's major urban areas."
According to the 1990 population counts, which are still subject to revision, 17 of the state's 21 counties showed gains in population while four -- Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Union -- showed losses. Over all, the state grew by 5 percent, or 365,177 residents, for a total of 7,730,188 people.
 But of those new residents only 2,998 were non-Hispanic whites; the remaining 362,179 new arrivals were black, Hispanic, American Indian, Pacific Island, Indian, Arab, Haitian, Jamaican, Asian residents and more than a dozen other ethnic and racial minority groups.
"If there is anything about the census that surprised us, it is the increasing diversity of the population," said Dr. James W. Hughes, chairman of the graduate department of urban planning and policy at Rutgers-New Brunswick.
 "During the 1980's we've had some suburbanization of blacks and Hispanics," Mr. Hughes said. "And the replacement populations have been more Hispanics and other new immigrants."
According to the census, the state's black population grew by 111,759, or 12.1 percent. The Hispanic population, which was just short of a half million in 1980, increased dramatically over the last 10 years to 739,861. And other various racial and ethnic groups, which include many new immigrants, grew by 75,359 to 275,407.
 
Asians in Suburbs
 "New Jersey has always been an easy place for immigrants to settle," Mr. Hughes said. "Our cities have always been replenished by immigration."
And while Hispanic and other immigrants are moving into the cities, he said, another growing group of new arrivals is in large part bypassing the cities entirely and moving directly into suburbia.
"Certain groups of Asians arrive in this country almost fully Americanized," Mr. Hughes said. "They fit in almost immediately."
The highest percentage change in any immigrant population over the last 10 years has been with the Asian community. In 1980 there were an estimated 103,800 immigrants of Asian or Pacific Island origin. Since then their numbers increased by 168,673 to 272,521; an increase of more than 162 percent.
"The numbers reflect the changing face of New Jersey," Mr. Hughes said. "Visually people can see it. Just go into any shopping center."
 Yaohan Plaza in Edgewater, while not just any shopping center, provides clear evidence of the foothold that the Asian community has gained in New Jersey. One of six such centers in the country -- the five others are in California -- Yaohan caters almost exclusively to Asian tastes.
 
Asian and Hispanic Influence
 With its large supermarket, food court, specialty stores and even a video rental store with Japanese-language films, Yaohan attracts Japanese, Chinese, Pacific Islander and Korean immigrants from throughout the region. Dr. Yoon, who had originally considered moving to Flushing, Queens, after setting up his dental practice, discovered New Jersey's Korean population as the result of shopping at Yaohan.
And though referred to as the company's "New York store" in advertisements, it was no coincidence that Yaohan U.S.A. Corporation officials put their only East Coast center on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River. Bergen County, long the refuge of white middle-class families fleeing the cities, is now home to more than 54,000 Asian immigrants, the highest such concentration of Asians in the state.
In fact, Asians apparently did for Bergen County what Hispanic people did for the state's larger cities -- help to offset a diminishing population. Even with more than 54,000 Asians living there, the largest minority population in the county, Bergen lost more than 20,000 residents over the last 10 years.
"The empty-nest syndrome is continuing," said Connie O. Hughes, assistant director of planning and development in the State Department of Labor. "In many cases, 20, 30 years ago, couples moved in, bought big houses and had their three kids or what have you." Mrs. Hughes is married to Dr. James W. Hughes.
 
Smaller Households
 But through the 1980's, as property values increased dramatically, many Bergen County homes were priced out of the reach of young families and first-time home buyers, including the sons and daughters of Bergen County residents themselves.
"The reason for the decline in the population in Bergen is the decline in the average household size," Mrs. Hughes said. "The kids have grown up and moved out and the parents are remaining behind."
Helynn Masullo Burns and her husband, Charles, for example, moved into a large house in Closter in 1953 so that their children, Brian, Bradley, Bonnie and Bruce, would not be raised in Hudson County. Now, the children have moved out, and Mr. and Mrs. Burns remain in a house with four empty bedrooms. They had considered, briefly, moving to Florida.
"But my roots are here," Mrs. Burns said, "and my friends. What would I do without my friends?"
Another reason for remaining in Closter, Mrs. Burns said, is that her children are still relatively close by; as close, that is, as Union City.
"They're a half a block away from where we came from," Mrs. Burns said. "They made a complete circle after we worked so hard to get them out here."
 
Change in Hudson County
 Hudson County, the first stop for the huge wave of Italian, Irish and German immigrants who arrived at the turn of the century, has taken on a new, attractive aura after a decade or two of decline. Fueled largely by a substantial Cuban immigration during the 1950's and 60's, the "Gold Coast," as it is often called, is now attracting young, single educated professionals who are bored with the peace and quiet that their parents sought so ardently in the suburbs.
But Hudson is losing residents, though barely. In 1980 there were 556,972 people in the county's 12 municipalities. In 1990, that figure declined to 553,099. The biggest part of Hudson's decline took place in what is considered its most desirable city: Hoboken.
Ten years ago, Hoboken had 42,460 residents. That number dropped consistently through the decade to a present level of 33,397.
Hoboken's business administrator, Edwin Chius, said part of the decline was the result of immigration. Relatively affluent new arrivals, he said, are buying the turn-of-the-century brownstones that used to house two or three traditionally large immigrant families and turning them into one-family showpieces occupied by childless single people and newly married couples.
 
Looking for Fresh Air
 At the same time, the sons and daughters of longtime Hoboken families who are beginning to start families of their own are now being priced out of the Hoboken housing market. Some, like the Repettis , have chosen to forgo the traditional first move that most Hudson County exiles make to Bergen County, and, like thousands of other North Jersey residents, have discovered Ocean County.
"There's fresh air, less crime, better schools and more activity down here," Mr. Repetti said. "Bergen County was out for me; it's a little too crowded. And western New Jersey might have been an idea, but once I got a feel for Ocean County, I fell in love with it."
So did 87,165 other men and women, mostly from the northern part of the state, during the last 10 years. Ocean County showed the largest percentage gain in population of any county in New Jersey. Many who moved there were retirees who flocked to the sprawling retirement villages scattered throughout the county.
But many others, like the Repettis, are young couples who, like their parents, wanted to raise their children away from the turmoil of the city. And many, like Mr. Repetti, who is a Hoboken firefighter, commute from their Shore homes to their jobs in northern New Jersey and Manhattan.
"It's worth the two-hour drive," Mr. Repetti said. "I just put the car on auto-pilot and think of all the time I'm saving by not having to look for a parking space when I get home."

Scientist Seeks Ways to Speed Growth of Fish

DATELINE: COLLEGE PARK, Md.

 BODY:
The world may soon be able to use genetic engineering or special hormones to make fish grow to market size faster and to increase world food supplies, says a University of Maryland marine biologist who is working to make it happen.
Thomas Chen, a biologist and professor in the biological sciences department at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, says he already has rainbow trout and oysters growing at least 20 percent faster -- and sometimes as much as 50 percent faster -- than normal, depending on the method used. 
 Dr. Chen said his project was one of several in which researchers are concentrating on fish, rather than cattle, partly because fish could be a readily available, economical food source for much of the world, and partly to reduce the United States' dependence on fish imports. The United States trade deficit for fish products was about $4 billion in 1989, he said.
"The idea to make fish grow faster has been around for a long time," said Dr. Chen, who has been experimenting at the Center for Marine Biotechnology at Baltimore Community College, a two-year college in the University of Maryland system.
"From a scientific standpoint," Dr. Chen said, "fish represent a good model system because there are several different species, from simple to highly evolved. A pragmatic reason is the ongoing situation with population increases and awareness of nutrition. Fish show a great potential to feed people."
 
 A Gene for Growth
 Dr. Chen and two collaborators at other universities are experimenting with two different processes.
The first approach relies on a growth hormone cloned from rainbow trout. Fish are dipped in water that has the hormone dissolved in it for a minute and a half once weekly for four weeks. The second approach involves altering the genetic makeup of a fish by transferring a gene for growth into the fish, which is passed on to subsequent generations.
Unlike humans, fish continue to grow throughout their lives, but Dr. Chen said he and his eight graduate-student assistants are not interested in creating bigger fish. They simply want fish to reach market size faster, thus getting more fish to market in a shorter time and saving fish farmers money.
Dr. Chen has been working on fish growth since 1982, starting at McMaster College in Hamilton, Ontario. He came to Maryland in 1986, when he began his collaboration with Dennis Powers at Stanford University and Rex Dunham at Auburn University. The project is underwritten by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Federal Government and state grants from the Department of Natural Resources and the Maryland University Sea Grant.
 
 Need Further Testing
 The effects of both experimental processes need further testing, Dr. Chen said. He also said that he and his colleagues must research methods for producing large quantities of the growth hormone economically before they can make it available commercially. The timetable will depend on the project's finances, Dr. Chen said.
Dr. Chen says rainbow trout and oysters have responded to both methods, growing 20 to 50 percent faster with the dipping process and 20 to 40 percent faster with the gene transfers.
But he said the researchers needed to determine which nutrients, and in what amounts, to feed to the fish so that they do not grow abnormally.
"A trout usually takes two years to get to market size, which is about a pound to a pound and a half," Dr. Chen said, adding that with the application of the hormones or using the gene-transfer technique, the fish should reach market size in a year and a few months.
 
 'We Only Use a Small Dose'
 Dr. Chen said he could not foresee any negative effects of the techniques on fish, humans or the environment.
"We have done experiments with higher doses of hormones, and they won't make the fish grow faster, so we only use a small dose," he said. And he said, "because the hormone is a protein, the hormone will be degraded in the fish," unlike the growth hormone, estrogen, that was once used to increase growth in beef cattle, but was found to leave residues.
He noted, too, that "We are not letting the fish run free. We harvest every single one. None are released into the environment" to endanger the natural food chain.
With continued research, Dr. Chen said he hoped that the hormone would be available for government approval in two to four years and the gene transfer in five to eight years.
"The work we are doing is especially important for developing countries," said Yan Lin Tang, a graduate student in biotechnology from China, who has been working on the project for three years while attending the College Park campus. "After working on the gene, we can watch the process of evolution, and we can use this gene and this hormone to study from."

HEADLINE: Stamps

BYLINE: By Barth Healey

 BODY:
There are a lot of collectors -- hoarders, really -- who accumulate modern stamps for the wrong reason: to make money.
A week does not pass without a letter arriving that asks, in effect, "Will my stock of old 3- , 4- and 5-cent United States stamps ever make me rich?" Alas, no. 
 Anyone who stashes away 50-stamp panes of new stamps might just as well keep only the block of stamps with the plate numbers in the margin and use the rest for postage. The same applies to older collections that were started by children, abandoned and have just been found in the attic. Most children, after all, did not spend much on their collections in the 1930's or 40's, acquiring common stamps that remain common today.
A bit of supply-and-demand sense must prevail: There are millions, indeed billions of United States stamps printed each year. There are only perhaps 250,000 active collectors. Supply far outweighs demand.
A review of the quantities of stamps issued by the United States, summarized in Linn's Stamp Almanac, turns up some very large numbers: From October 1981 to October 1985, for example, the issues of all but one of the commemorative United States stamps were over 100 million; for 12 commemoratives, the total exceeded 700 million each. That was when postal rates were changing fairly often, requiring a lot of new stamps.
From May 1964 to March 1972, a time of less frequent rate changes, only three commemorative issues fell below the 100 million mark, and eight topped a billion. In fact, except for some special printings, no commemorative in this century has had a print run of less than a million stamps.
To get an idea of what old stamps are worth, consider the 1941 3-cent stamp marking the sesquicentennial of Vermont statehood, an occasion mirrored Friday with an issue for Vermont's bicentennial. Fifty-four million Vermont stamps were issued in 1941. The Scott catalogue estimates that one stamp would fetch 14 cents at retail today; the wholesale value is less than half that. Taking inflation into consideration, 3 cents in 1941 would be worth about 25 cents today and so the 3-cent Vermont stamps would not seem to have been a particularly good investment. (The plate number block did better; it is priced by Scott at $1.75, but can often be bought for much less.)
There are some exceptions. High-value definitives, of $1 face value and more, have risen in price because fewer collectors buy expensive stamps when they come out.
Error stamps, which might lack perforations, or be missing a color, or show the center of the stamp inverted, can be worth thousands. But the chance of buying such stamps over the post office counter is slight, even though, with high-speed presses and mechanized packaging of stamps, such errors are increasingly common. Some imperforate coil stamps can be had for a few dollars.
And there are the genuine 20th-century rarities. The three zeppelin airmails, which were on sale for less than three months in early 1930 and of which only 62,000 complete sets were printed, are valued by Scott at $2,000 the set. Their total face value, $4.55, was a very large sum to spend on a hobby in 1930.
So what is one to make of the Postal Service's vigorous promotion of stamp sales to collectors? Paul T. Clark, of Hilton Head Island, S.C., asked the service just that question. Mr. Clark said in a telephone interview that, when he began to accumulate panes of new stamps several years ago, he felt the post office was emphasizing investment potential.
Not so, answered Mary Margaret Grant, director of new markets for the Postal Service. In a letter to Mr. Clark, she said: "You are correct in noting that my job is to sell stamps. But, in the 10 years that I have worked in the philatelic department, I have not seen any material from the Postal Service that indicated that stamps would appreciate in value."
The hobby, she added, is merely "educational and pleasant." Mr. Clark now uses his old stamps for postage.

Wages of War: A Dearth Of Capital

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The war is won. Now the world will get to pay for it. One cost may be higher interest rates.
An emerging worldwide shortage of capital may help to explain the fact short-term rates have plunged while long-term ones have not, despite the Fed's repeated easing of credit. 
 In the 1980's, there seemed to be a surplus of capital, as Japan and rich oil states exported it. But, says Alan C. Lerner, an economist at Bankers Trust, "We won't see the same sort of thing in the first half of the 90's. Western Europe will need capital, Eastern Europe will need capital, the Middle East will need capital and the United States is going to need capital. We definitely don't save enough here to offset our public demands for capital."
The American need for public capital is clear from the budget deficits and the infrastructure problems shown by crumbling bridges. But what is different is the need to rebuild Eastern Europe, coming at a time when the Japanese economy is slowing and the Japanese people are showing less willingness to delay consumption. The Mideast war has turned Kuwait from a huge capital exporter into an importer, a situation that may last for a sustained period of time.
With all those demands for cash, it is easy to imagine a situation of competitive interest-rate increases to attract funds. If that happens, it probably is bad news for stock markets, whose advances are predicated in part on lower interest rates. With most of the English-speaking world in recession, those central banks have been easing credit. But the German and Japanese monetary authorities so far have been reluctant to go along.
Ed Kerschner of Paine Webber is one bull on stocks who thinks those central banks will fall in line with the trend to lower interest rates, producing "the big easy" that drives down interest rates everywhere, and causes long-term bond yields to fall rapidly in this country. But he adds that stock prices here may be overvalued if long-term rates do not fall.
The American markets now are more focused on guessing what the Fed will do. Friday's employment report from February was bad, and some thought they saw a sign of further Fed easing in the Fed funds market. But bond prices still fell, and there is doubt that there will be much more from the Fed until evidence starts to build on just how much of a jump-start the economy got from the public euphoria brought on by the end of the war.
In the meantime, the 3,000 Dow is still an elusive goal. The second assault on that level last week, coming more than seven months after the first one, was repulsed, and the index ended the week up 45.30 points, to 2,955.20.
It may be worth noting that while three-month Treasury bills -- which the Fed strongly influences -- now are 1.64 percentage points below where they were when the last run at 3,000 was made, 30-year Treasury bond yields declined less and have been rising since mid-February, to within 0.14 points of the level last July. Despite the Fed's efforts, long-term capital is not getting less expensive.

HEADLINE: A Financial Giant's Slippery Slope

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The Tokyo stock market is finally recovering from a vicious year-long plunge, Wall Street is showing signs of a rejuvenation and, most important, financial systems around the globe are being deregulated. It would seem to be a time of fresh opportunity, yet Yoshihisa Tabuchi, the most powerful individual in Japan's financial markets, speaks like a troubled man.
"Over the past few years, we may have overemphasized the positive side of all the changes taking place," said Mr. Tabuchi, president and chief executive of the Nomura Securities Company, the world's largest brokerage house. "There was a relatively small amount of discussion of the negative side, the limits that we would face. Especially when I look at the American financial markets, I see confusion." 
 Indeed, even for a formidable global colossus like Nomura -- it has a staggering $14.7 billion in equity behind it, four-and-a-half times as much as Merrill Lynch & Company, America's largest brokerage house -- these are trying times. The firm's profits are expected to plunge up to 60 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, from $2.1 billion the previous year.
The performance is expected to be better than Nomura's Japanese rivals, the other members of the so-called Big Four. All were battered by the market plunge, set off by a steep rise in interest rates and then Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But that is scant comfort since none of the others -- Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi -- has set its sights as high, or taken such bold steps to become a global financial supermarket.
Nomura's dominant position in many businesses is under siege, too. For instance, it retained its No. 1 ranking last year for underwritings in the Euromarket, the fourth straight year it has held the top spot. But its market share was slashed almost in half, to less than 9 percent. In Tokyo, it was late in taking up the newest imported fad, computerized program trading, and thus finds itself a distant fourth in the lucrative activity -- behind three American securities houses.
 
Worried and Ambivalent
 The firm's challenges run much deeper than a bad year, however, and that is what worries the 58-year-old Mr. Tabuchi, who became chief executive in 1985. Securities executives have long claimed their business thrives on change, and fundamental shifts are indeed gripping the financial world. But Mr. Tabuchi expressed a thoroughly ambivalent attitude toward those prospects: while fighting to instill new thinking at Nomura, where he has spent his entire 35-year career, Mr. Tabuchi is resisting mightily the fundamental liberalization of the heavily regulated Tokyo financial markets, the source of Nomura's raw power.
It is a contradiction that speaks volumes about Nomura. It also provides a sobering insight into how elusive a goal globalization, in which Nomura had been expected to take a lead, is proving.
There are two types of deregulation being debated here. One is to permit the use of new financial products and to ease outmoded controls, such as those on interest rates. The other type, lowering the rigid barriers that limit competition between different kinds of financial institutions, is much more threatening. Japanese trust banks, commercial banks and long-term credit banks cannot invade each others' turf, and thus enjoy cartel-like benefits.
More important, Japanese banks are prohibited from entering most areas of the securities business -- as in the United States. Those days appear to be ending, however. In a historic move, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady early last month proposed scrapping the wall separating the two financial areas in the United States. Japan's Finance Ministry has also made it clear that, in one form or another, it intends to force Nomura and the other securities houses to share their cozy domain with Japan's giant banks, perhaps by 1993.
 
Question of Ethics
 Nomura is fighting hard against that threat, warning of the damage liberalization has allegedly caused.
"During the course of deregulation and financial innovation, people tended to forget about the ethics of the market," Mr. Tabuchi said. "Whatever new business you do you must remember to protect your customers and investors. But the tendency was for players to forget these ethics for their own immediate profits. The desirable approach is not to ask who does what and who is not supposed to do what, but how efficient and how convenient the new financial system will be."
"Having said that," Mr. Tabuchi added, in a telling afterthought, "further deregulation of new financial products should progress. That is an entirely different issue, how to innovate and make these new securities available to investors."
Mr. Tabuchi issued his brooding, if ambiguous, verdicts in firm but measured tones, puffing on one cigarette after another in an executive suite that lies on the most elite plane in Japan's securities world. The whisper-quiet hallways at Nomura's squat brick headquarters are elegantly hung with Chagalls and Corots. There is an air of haughty self-assurance, for few Japanese companies dominate their business as Nomura does.
To stand on Nomura's immense, sparkling new trading floor is to be at the center of power in the Japanese market. Along with its affiliates, Nomura, which has total assets of $47 billion, accounts for almost 20 percent of the trading volume on the Tokyo market and about 30 percent of the investment trust, or Japanese mutual fund, business. It has 4,400 retail brokers, the backbone of its business, and another 2,900 salespeople, all women, who peddle stocks and other investments door-to-door.
With that heft, it is widely believed Nomura can manipulate individual stocks, even the market, at will. Officially, that is always denied; in private, Nomura executives occasionally acknowledge that their firm, as well as the other Big Four, can -- and do -- push share prices at times. Nomura, in short, is feared as much if not more than it is respected.
Although expanding profits are important to the money machine over which he presides, Mr. Tabuchi, a hard-driving man who is also a fancier of fine wines and art, has set an even more ambitious goal for his tenure. He is attempting to transform what is essentially a huge distribution network, which relies on raw marketing muscle to outsell everyone else, into a genuinely modern securities house with the innovative savvy of Wall Street's best.
 
New World Order
 Nomura wants to be as comfortable cutting real estate deals, devising new mortgage-backed securities, constructing computer trading strategies, writing sophisticated lease financings, arranging mergers and creating new corporate structures anywhere in the world as it is at sales of stocks and bonds.
A few years ago, in better times, its leap into a greater global role had seemed a modest step considering its success, size and willingness to experiment. But the hurdles in its path are growing more obvious:
* Its once-booming European business has slowed as Japanese companies, stung by soaring interest rates, have pulled back from issuing Euromarket securities. A major portion of Nomura's business in the Euromarkets is still with Japanese companies and institutions, not Europeans. "In 1988 and 1989, the contribution to our profits from Japanese money flowing to the Euromarkets had been staggering," said Hitoshi Tonomura, head of international operations. "That has been substantially reduced."
* Nomura has taken the lead in acquiring a stake in specialized American financial firms to advance into businesses in which it lacks expertise, including mergers, leasing and real estate. Just a week ago, it formed a joint venture with a commodities trading specialist, the Tudor Investment Corporation. Some Nomura executives in the United States have complained, though, that those operations have left Nomura's activities fragmented.
* The firm suffered a black eye with the publication last year of "The House of Nomura," a book that suggested Nomura routinely breaks the rules -- manipulating share prices, for example. Nomura has filed a libel suit against Al Alletzhauser, the author, which is pending in London, but that only attracted more attention to the reported improprieties.
* The firm is still struggling to cast off its image as a "kabuya," a derisive term that might be translated as "stock shop," the way one would refer to a fish store. The moniker suggests the giant securities houses are nothing but merchants, selling their wares for a commission. In fact, since commission rates are fixed in Japan, those simple fees for executing trades still account for 41 percent of Nomura's consolidated revenues. Merrill Lynch, to which Nomura is sometimes compared, gets 15 percent of revenues from commissions.
 
Coveted Role
 Brokerage houses here have traditionally relied on these basic transactions rather than building intimate relationships with the real movers of corporate Japan. That coveted role, which is essential for the future, is held by commercial banks.
"In Japan, the banking industry and the securities industry are oriented on very different cultures," conceded Hideo Sakamaki, Nomura's head of strategic planning and human resources, who is leading the diversification effort.
When Wasserstein, Perella & Company, the American mergers specialist that sold a 20 percent share to Nomura, initially considered taking on a Japanese partner, it spoke first to the elite Industrial Bank of Japan as the best entree to corporate Japan. (A Wasserstein, Perella executive disputed this, but others with knowledge of the dealings confirmed the discussions, led by Joseph Perella.)
"If you come right down to it, Nomura has a franchise called the Tokyo Stock Exchange," said Robert Zielinski, an analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities and author of a recent book on the Japanese market. "They have exploited that franchise to the fullest extent. But except for size, there's nothing to distinguish them from the other Big Four firms. They'll never do as well in any other market as they have here."
Evidence of the struggle to adopt a new image crops up everywhere. Asked if its sales network was not the heart of Nomura, Yoshikazu Kitsuda, who runs the securities sales and trading operations and is rumored to be a possible successor to Mr. Tabuchi, responded crisply, "Exactly! Placement power." He was quickly corrected by Michio Katsumata, a public relations executive, who added, "And brain power, too."
An even more telling sign is the acknowledged weakness of Nomura's operations in the United States, despite years of effort and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars. On Wall Street, Nomura's operations generated just $20 million in pre-tax income in the last fiscal year -- a third of the income Nomura earned in Hong Kong and one-eighth of its income in London. Using another measure, Nomura devoted about 20 percent of its assets to the United States in the last fiscal year, but received just 4 percent of its overall revenues there.
Because Wall Street is the most liberalized major financial market, it is regarded as a test of how well the giant broker can compete in an arena where ideas and an ability to take risks count for more than a huge capital base and sales muscle.
"Nomura has a lot of marketing power in Japan and Europe," Mr. Sakamaki commented. "But we are really just starting in the United States. It will take a little more time."
Max C. Chapman Jr., a former top executive at Kidder, Peabody & Company, is co-chairman of Nomura's American unit. Last year, he was invited to join the parent company's board in Tokyo, the first time an outsider had been so honored. It was a pithy symbol, but Mr. Chapman said he still has to work hard to get Nomura's executives to appreciate that some of the practices that are an asset in Tokyo are liabilities in the more competitive Wall Street arena.
 
Pushing for Change
 These include the traditional aversion to using the firm's own capital in trading, called principal trading; the lack of a history of maintaining tight bonds between the research, trading and investment banking departments in order to create new products, and the practice of rotating professionals every couple of years. That creates generalists who often lack the expertise needed to engage in higher-risk and demanding businesses.
"We have to turn this into more of a principal business," Mr. Chapman said. "That makes them nervous."
Some at Nomura agree such skills might be needed overseas, but shrink from the idea that the firm should adopt them at home. "We have to add some Japanese flavor to whatever we bring back," said Mr. Tonomura.
However, to underscore the need to change the old patterns of thought, Nomura broke out its training division as a separate company, giving it more visibility and influence. Mr. Tabuchi is chairman of the unit, the only subsidiary at which he has a title, another sign of the unit's importance.
As chief executive, he has prodded and pulled at this unwieldy giant, which has 16,000 employees, to try to shake it from its old ways. In one published interview, Mr. Tabuchi even said it might be a good thing if Nomura suffered some sort of failure -- an almost unthinkable calamity for a proud Nomura man -- to pry his executives away from the view that what worked in the past will work in the future.
Mr. Tabuchi has been bold in his overseas moves, something rare at a large Japanese company, and more successful than his Japanese competitors. But the setbacks of the past year have made his task heavier rather than lighter as he moves into what are expected to be the final few years of his rule.
Mr. Tabuchi does not deny feeling frustrated on the road to globalization: "A C.E.O. who has no frustrations better resign at once. Frustration in running a large organization is a burden a C.E.O. has to bear."
 
DANCING TO WALL STREET'S M.&A. TUNE
 If there is one business that symbolizes the kind of firm the Nomura Securities Company hopes to remake itself into, it is mergers and acquisitions. The business involves selling ideas rather than products, requires tact and nimbleness and is becoming increasingly international.
In fact, Nomura has been in the business for some time in Japan. But there is one big difference between the traditional Japanese style of M.&A. and Wall Street's: in Japan, rarely has it generated fees.
"This business was often done by politicians or some kind of fixer, and they would receive a gift, not really a fee," said Mitsuo Goto, head of Nomura's budding mergers practice. "When it was done by a securities firm, it was a free service."
Nomura has set out to change that. It has joined forces with Wasserstein, Perella & Company, the Wall Street merger specialist. The Americans have a great deal more experience in the nuts and bolts of these deals, and if there is one thing Wasserstein, Perella does well, it is to charge fees.
Nomura bought 20 percent of the American firm for $100 million in 1988, and set up a new unit in Japan, the Nomura Wasserstein Perella Company, as a joint venture.
Nomura has picked up another authentic American practice from its new partner: an unashamed desire to grab credit for deals. That is something of a contrast to the discretion expected of corporate matchmakers in Japan, but times are changing.
The shift was never more in evidence than during the acquisition of MCA Inc. late last year by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. Matsushita disclosed that its investment banking adviser was Allen & Company. But no sooner had the two sides shaken hands than N.W.P. announced that it had also advised Matsushita, albeit in a secret capacity. That prompted a miffed Matsushita executive to quip that he found it a bit unusual to publicly declare supposed secrets.
"I can say we've learned a lot about M.&A. from the U.S.," said Mr. Goto, president of N.W.P.
The creation of the mergers unit, one of four such partnerships between Nomura and American financial specialists, is an admission of Nomura's inability to develop the businesses from within, Mr. Goto acknowledged, adding that he felt the arrangements had been a success.
"Investment banking is a kind of clubby world," he said. "We were invited to the party, but we couldn't get the business."
Nomura Wasserstein Perella has not engaged in the series of blockbuster deals some had envisioned, but Mr. Goto said it has served as an adviser in 44 completed transactions.
 
HOMEY SIDE OF THE HARD SELL
 To most Japanese, the Nomura Securities Company means hard sell. Its broker force is renowned for its don't-take-no-for-an-answer style.
But there are still many Japanese who disdain such aggressive methods and prefer a homier, traditional approach. Nomura has an answer for them, too: what it calls "middies," women who peddle investment products door-to-door like Avon ladies.
Middies is short for middle-aged, a reference to the fact that the 2,900 troops who fill these slots in the Nomura sales army are women in their late 30's to early 50's. Nomura says they generally are housewives with a family who take the job for the extra money. They are paid a salary plus commissions and usually have a regular group of long-time customers.
Nomura first employed middies in 1953, in the lean postwar years. Housewives were given locked boxes in which they could deposit savings. When the boxes were filled, Nomura sent women around to pick them up in exchange for shares in investment trusts, or mutual funds.
Nomura is not alone. The other large brokerages also employ this shoe-leather approach, and much of the life insurance sold in Japan is peddled door-to-door, by one housewife to another.
The middies are a throwback in more ways than one. They can sell only bonds and investment trusts. Their license forbids them from selling stocks or the fancier products becoming popular here, futures and options. That job is left to the regular branch office sales force, which is largely male.
Nomura says the middies do not account for a major share of its retail sales. But their continued role is a symbol of the firm's deep roots in the retail brokerage business, and the stubbornly traditional style of salesmanship that business demands.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Searching for the Dollar's Top

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Since the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, the consensus view on the dollar has reversed quickly. And the change could significantly effect Americans who invest abroad.
Many analysts think the dollar has finally hit bottom. "We now feel we know where the bottom is," said Nicholas Sargen, director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. "Now the question is 'Where is the top?' " 
 Since it hit a new record low against the mark of 1.4475 four weeks ago, the dollar has jumped to 1.5694, a rise of 8.4 percent. While analysts disagree on how high the dollar might climb, the fact that a further dramatic fall is no longer expected changes the terms -- especially the outlook for profits -- for Americans investing abroad.
Now, after several years of relatively easy gains from favorable exchange rates, there is a greater risk of a loss when foreign profits are turned back into dollars. "The value in international markets is overseas but you might get killed now by the currency," said Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist and strategist at James Capel Inc. in New York. "If people bought bonds and stocks in Europe as a currency play, they may be wrong a lot quicker than they thought."
One of the pivotal factors in the dollar's rise was the decision in late February by the German coalition Government led by Helmut Kohl to raise taxes to help pay for the unification and reconstruction of the old East Germany. The announcement reverses the pledge against tax increases that Chancellor Kohl made before the first election in unified Germany last year. Many analysts thought Chancellor Kohl would have to raise taxes. But until he acted, they could not adjust their forecasts for interest rates and therefore, the dollar.
The tax increases change the outlook for the dollar by increasing revenues, reducing the growing German budget deficit and, in the process, taking some pressure off the German Bundesbank. The central bank has been raising interest rates to fight the inflationary impact of German unification. The President of the central bank, Karl Otto Pohl had made it clear that interest rates, which last increased at the end of January, might move higher if the Government continued to insist on borrowing to pay for the unification rather than raising taxes.
Now, there is less of a chance that German interest rates will rise any further. In fact, rates could begin to fall by the end of the year, some analysts predict. This helps the dollar by reducing the allure of mark-denominated securities.
Michael R. Rosenberg, manager of international fixed income research at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, said the tax increases would slow German economic growth and add to inflation. This has forced him to change his economic model forecast for the dollar. Before the German action, he was bearish on the dollar, predicting as recently as two weeks ago that it would end the year at 1.45 marks. But he now projects a rally to 1.70 marks.
The other major factor shaping the new thinking on the dollar was the quick end to the war and the growing belief that the recession in the United States will not be severe. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, supported this perspective in testimony before Congress last week.
Short-term rates may fall a little further, as was indicated on Friday, when the Federal Reserve may have nudged down the Federal funds rate. But because the recovery appears imminent, analysts no longer expect that the Federal Reserve will have to lower interest rates aggressively to revive the economy. It was this expectation that had sent the dollar to new lows. Lower rates make the dollar less attractive to investors.
"I don't have the expectation any more that the Fed will go pedal-to-the-metal on lowering interest rates," said Mr. Sargen of Salomon Brothers.
The change in view has come so quickly that advice written just weeks ago has become outdated. Mr. Sargen and John Lipsky, a Salomon Brothers research director in London, recommended nondollar bond markets strongly in a report in mid-February. At the time, the dollar was trading at about 1.49 marks, and they assumed that it would decline to new lows near 1.40 against the German mark before rallying a little.
The changing scenario will alter investment decisions. Mr. Sargen and Mr. Lipsky had thought the risk of the dollar rising would not be a worry until the end of this year. Now, said Mr. Sargen, "the risk has been brought foreward. You can not now rush to Europe for the currency play."
But there is a plus side in the rise of the dollar. Stocks of European companies that are major exporters to the United States or that have major subsidiaries here will benefit. The stronger dollar will make their products more competitive and their American earnings will not suffer a currency loss when they are converted back home.
And many analysts argue that European bonds will outperform United States bonds this year because of the expected steeper drop in interest rates there. This means that as a hedge against the rise in the dollar, these nondollar bonds can still be attractive.

One Way for Business to Go Green

BYLINE: By JACK DOYLE; Jack Doyle is senior analyst of technology and corporate policy for Friends of the Earth in Washington.

 BODY:
Last April, Du Pont's oil subsidiary, Conoco, announced it would build new double-hulled oil tankers designed to reduce oil spills. A few days later, the H. J. Heinz Company said it would no longer fish for tuna on dolphin sightings or use drift nets. And in November, McDonald's announced it would do away with its plastic foam "clamshell" hamburger box. These headline-making actions, and others like them, signal important changes in corporate environmental thinking. Yet, double-hulled tankers, dolphin-safe tuna and abandoned polystyrene packaging -- while praiseworthy -- do not make corporations environmentally responsible.
One way for multinationals like Du Pont, Heinz and McDonald's to become more environmentally responsible is for them to sign the Valdez Principles, named after the Exxon Valdez, the oil tanker that ran aground in Alaska causing a massive oil spill. This is a code of conduct aimed at improving the entire company's environmental performance. The principles not only require companies to respect the environment but also to market safe products and services and accept responsibility for any environmental damage they may cause. These principles require companies to disclose operations that might cause harm to the environment and to appoint at least one director to represent environmental interests. They also require an annual environmental audit. 
 The Valdez Principles are the brainchild of a group of environmental, investor, religious and consumer interests called the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies. This is the largest and most significant environmental and investor coalition now working to change corporate environmental practices. It includes the National Wildlife Federation, the New York City and California state pension funds and the National Council of Churches, among others. Since the formulation of the Valdez Principles in September 1989, the Fortune 500 companies have resisted signing, though a number of large concerns are now negotiating with the coalition. Representatives of the chemical and energy industries have let the word go out that no company should break ranks by signing the Valdez Principles. Instead, these industry groups have advanced their own principles.
But industry codes are not likely to be trusted by a public already skeptical about corporate environmental claims. Who will check on these companies? That is where the Valdez Principles and the annual coalition review could play an invaluable role in communicating progress to the news media and the public. For the Valdez Principles try to establish a standard disclosure process, something that industry needs but cannot provide.
The Valdez Principles can also help companies hone their resource and production efficiencies to competitive advantage. In the 1990's and beyond, a company's competitive position may well turn on its net environmental performance.
What is needed then is a special group of corporate leaders with the courage to sign onto a process with investors, environmentalists and consumers that will not be a cakewalk. Clearly, companies need something more than problem-of-the-month environmental fixes. They need to institute "whole company" environmentalism -- programs that internalize environmental protection throughout the company.

Blame the Recession on Tax Reform

BYLINE: By RONALD G. WEINER; Ronald G. Weiner is president of Weiner Associates, an accounting firm in New York.

 BODY:
It is clear to all we are in a recession. But what is not so clear is the causal relationship between the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and today's economy. In essence, the act and its successors reduced tax rates and brackets and substantially unified the treatment of taxable income. But it also reduced the incentive to incur debt and take entrepreneurial risk. Investment in real estate also lost many of its incentives.
Because of the 1986 law, consumer spending is down, businesses are weaker and real estate values have been decimated. Trying to revitalize the economy by lowering interest rates alone will not be sufficient. Tax law and policy must be revised. 
 The economics of business investment were profoundly affected by the elimination of the differential between capital gains and ordinary income tax rates. There is no longer the same incentive for making higher risk investments.
The interplay between tax rates and interest costs has a profound effect on the acquisition of capital equipment. When the tax rate was 50 percent and interest was 10 percent, the post-tax cost would have been 5 percent, or roughly today's rate of inflation. But with a tax rate of 33 percent, the post-tax cost is about 7 percent. This means that the investment return must be 40 percent greater than before reform to achieve the break-even point on a leveraged investment decision.
Real estate values were particularly affected by lower tax rates coupled with other restrictions. Before, investors benefited from tax laws that enabled real property to be depreciated over an -- artificially low -- estimated useful life of 18 years. Tax benefits were often created by accruing, but not paying, interest on mortgages.
These benefits were brought to an abrupt halt by the 1986 tax law. Real estate losses became deductible only upon the sale of the property or when offsetting income from other real estate activities. By restricting losses, real estate was no longer viable as an investment vehicle for all but a few.
The basic concept of the 1986 tax law was to create equitable economic decision-making and to discourage consumer debt. These were healthy ideas, but their consequences tilted against our own national interest by lowering asset values. This must be corrected by eliminating restrictions on the deductibility on real business losses, whether from real estate or investments. Artificial noncash losses can continue to be restricted. As an additional step, tax credits or preferential tax rates, should be provided to encourage savings.
Existing tax rates may have to be revised, but given our overall economic condition, it is a small cost for national solvency.

HEADLINE: Designers Try to Fit The Price to the Times

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
When Mary Ann Restivo founded her business, her prices rarely topped $400, but little by little they rose, like everyone else's, with inflation. Now she has joined the ranks of designers and manufacturers forced to offer shoppers fashionable clothes at more reasonable prices.
"Everybody knows people are not spending a lot on clothes, so we decided to go back to where we were when we started 10 years ago," she said. 
 Designers like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Louis Dell'Olio for Anne Klein have accomplished this by adding secondary collections, usually of more casual clothes. But Ms. Restivo, who sold her company to Leslie Fay in 1987, remaining as executive design director, has restructured the business to offer lower prices, which run from $110 for a sweater to $400 for a jacket for fall.
Stores refer to this range as "bridge" because it bridges the distance between moderate-priced clothing and designer lines. As more women have entered the business world, this so-called bridge area has grown tremendously because it offers good career clothes at a reasonable price. The group includes Ellen Tracy, Adrienne Vittadini, Dana Buchman and of course Anne Klein II.
Ms. Restivo has retained her familiar blazers and kimono jackets, shifts and trapeze-shaped dresses but, to lower prices, is concentrating on more basic, less luxurious fabrics.
"We're using gabardine, wool crepe and flannel for the good, solid base clothes," she said, "then adding novelties like houndstooth checks and a plaid fabric woven with loopy yarns. To make the clothes special, we're using details like contrast piping, soutache embroidery and diamond-shaped cutouts."
To compete in the United States, European designers and companies like Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace, Franco Moschino, Genny, Byblos and Emanuel Ungaro have added secondary lines. But mostly these lines cost more than American bridge collections, often hitting the $1,000 mark. That, too, is starting to change.
 
A Challenge to America
 With the recent introductions of Ungaro's Emanuel and Escada's Apriori, Europe is challenging America's dominance of the bridge market with clothes priced under $500.
Emanuel, which was developed specifically for the United States by Gruppo GFT, is an extensive collection of sportswear that includes basic stretch bodysuits, pants and skirts, draped jersey and velvet dresses, tailored jackets and coats that reverse from printed poplin to fake fur.
The collection adds a sexy French twist to classic American sportswear. A glen plaid blazer, for example, is draped to button on one side, and a checked scuba jacket has Ungaro's gathered sides.
Apriori is the lowest-priced division of Escada, a German manufacturer that also produces the Laurel and Crisca lines. The latest endeavor, first sold in Europe a year and a half ago, has been restyled for the United States. Like Emanuel, it ranges from casual country clothes to dressy career styles.
The sporty segment includes ribbed wool-and-cashmere sweaters, cire anoraks and baseball jackets of patterned microfiber with a silky finish. Citified styles include a long one-button blazer, a cropped plaid jacket and a stretch flannel jacket with a black velvet collar.
Come July, when all these collections reach the department stores, the customer will decide if they tempt her pocketbook.

HEADLINE: Tunica Journal;
The Shacks Disappear, but the Poverty Lives On

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNICA, Miss.

 BODY:
The story of Sugar Ditch, America's most famous sewer, came to a quiet close recently when the families of 11 black tenants vacated the last of the shacks beside it.
They left behind leaky roofs, perforated walls, the smell of garbage and the scratch of rats. Some tenants lacked toilets, and all either flushed or carried their waste into the stagnant ditch just yards away. This ramshackle row was tucked away from public view, half a block behind the proud facades of the downtown business district. 
 Their shacks condemned and razed, the families have moved into new apartments filled with comforts that many had never known: not just toilets but freshly painted white walls, hot running water and rooms that keep the rain out and the heat in.
But most had little to say about their new homes.
"I like it all right," Johnnie Mae Milbrooks said of her new apartment, where a Federal subsidy puts her share of the rent at $2 a month.
The new apartments aside, much in Tunica County has not changed, ever since mechanized farming ended the sharecropper system decades ago while offering few jobs to replace it. The 1980 census, which provides the most recent figures, ranked Tunica as America's poorest county, with 53 percent of its 9,600 residents living below the poverty level.
For the county's blacks, political power has been about as elusive as jobs. Though the county is 73 percent black, its Board of Supervisors has a white majority. The 1,300 residents of the town of Tunica, the county seat, are overwhelmingly white. And they control a local government that Federal officials have said discriminates against blacks.
For local black leaders, the new apartments represent a rare victory and a reminder of the legacy of defeat.
"It's a success story in one way, and in another we didn't make no kind of strides," said Henry Pious, an unemployed plumber who was one of a handful of local blacks pushing for changes at Sugar Ditch. "There are still no jobs. The people are still on welfare."
The decrepit homes along Sugar Ditch had been there for decades, but it was not until 1984 that anyone started complaining. Mr. Pious and others involved in a voter registration drive began pointing to the conditions there when stressing the need for more political power for blacks.
At the time, the town had received a $500,000 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- not to fix the houses but to beautify the downtown business district.
That summer, H.U.D. officials came to Tunica to present the town with an award for its improvement efforts. But after a black State Representative led reporters on a detour to the Ditch, word of the conditions began to spread.
By November, the Governor of Mississippi was standing in Ms. Milbrooks's home, promising to have her out soon. The next year, Jesse Jackson visited three times in one week, trailed by Congressmen and cameramen. The CBS News program "60 Minutes" followed.
If Sugar Ditch was dismal, the program explained, it was not because of a lack of Federal aid. The town had received more than $1 million for sewer improvements, most of them for white subdivisions, in a pattern that investigators from the United States Treasury Department called racially discriminatory.
One person who was not moved by the talk of rats, roaches and racial oppression was Robert Mangum, Ms. Milbrooks's landlord at Sugar Ditch. He collected $50 a month for each of 10 concrete block homes he had helped his father build in 1951.
Mr. Mangum is a gruff, bearded man, who owns a hardware store in Tunica and speaks of "colored" people. He said he is tired of being depicted as a villain.
"They didn't start out rag-shack," he said of his former properties. "It's just time and age."
Though he acknowledged that many of the homes were infested, he said, "Bugs have to do with personal hygiene, not with surroundings, really."
Mr. Mangum lives nearby in a two-story house with four white Corinthian columns. His tone changes when he shows a visitor the Special Olympics medals won by his teen-age son, who has Down syndrome. The boy has brought a special kind of love to his family, he says.
Mr. Mangum said that visitors might ask, "Why should somebody have a nice house like that and somebody else not?"
He offered this answer: "I work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day." As for people who are unemployed or on public assistance, "the ones that are 21 and healthy, I have no cares about what they get," he said.
Publicity came quicker to Sugar Ditch than new housing. One reason for the delay was the fight between voting rights advocates who wanted the 92 black families along Sugar Ditch to stay inside the town limits, and the town government, which said no suitable land could be found there.
Beginning in 1986, Sugar Ditch residents were relocated to one trailer site and three new apartment complexes, all outside the town.
Ms. Milbrooks, who is 40, had lived on Sugar Ditch since she was 13, when she moved there to get away from sharecropper life and arguments with her stepfather. She worked as a maid until the first of her five children was born. Since then, she has been supported by welfare and disability checks.
She described the homes she lived in on Sugar Ditch as "raggery." The first had no toilet, the second had no hot water and both were near a dumpster that in the summer would "be stinking so bad it make you sick."
Did she ever complain?
Ms. Milbrooks found the question ludicrous. "You'd probably get put out of doors with nowhere to stay," she replied.
Though almost seven years have passed since the Governor's promise, she says she is neither angry nor impatient. "Around here, you expect anything," she said. "Never get your hopes up, because you don't know how nothing's going to come out."

HEADLINE: Panel Asks Stiffer Preparation for CUNY Students

BYLINE: By SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
A faculty panel has recommended that students entering the City University of New York complete a set of college preparatory courses as tough as those New York State requires for its best high-school graduates.
The panel made the recommendations at the request of Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who recently convinced the university's trustees to approve a broad plan to toughen requirements to graduate at the university. 
 Under Dr. Reynolds's plan, students entering the university in the fall of 1992 would be expected to have completed a full program of collegepreparatory courses in high school. Those who did not would not be denied admission to the university, but they would be required to make up deficiencies by taking extra courses in college before they could graduate.
University officials say they want to put pressure on the city's public-school system to prepare students better for college work. In approving their broad plan, the trustees did not specify the high-school course requirements to be met by freshmen but gave the chancellor until January 1992 to draw up a list.
In anticipation of this, Dr. Reynolds several months ago charged the University Faculty Senate with preparing a preliminary set of "expectations" to be met by Cuniversity freshmen. A copy of the proposals of the Senate's Advisory Committee on the College Preparatory Curriculum was obtained by The New York Times.
 
University Requirements

The committee calls for students entering the university to have taken four years of college-preparatory English, four years of social studies, three years of mathematics, two years of laboratory sciences, two years of a foreign language and one year of visual and performing arts.
New York State high-school students now earning a Regents-endorsed diploma must complete four years of college-preparatory English, four years of social studies, three years of foreign language, two years of sciences, two years of mathematics and one year of art and music.
 
Admission Is Guaranteed

According to the New York City Board of Education, only about 20 percent of its high-school graduates now earn such a diploma. As an alternative a high-school student can earn a Board of Education diploma by completing a combination of college-preparatory courses, remedial classes and various electives, like business mathematics, that the university would not consider "academic."
Currently admission to the City University is guaranteed to any highschool graduate. Although attention is paid to the student's high-school grade-point average in assigning him to a four-year or two-year college, little attention is paid to the type of classes the students took in high school.
The faculty committee spelled out college-preparatory course sequences that should be fulfilled by entering students. In social studies, for example, it called for students to take global history, American studies, and electives that could be chosen from economics or political science, among others.
In mathematics, students would take elementary and intermediate algebra, geometry and courses that could include trigonometry, mathematical logic and statistics.
While the report concentrates on what it describes as "minimum university expectations," it noted that students intending to major in the sciences should take a year of calculus in addition to the required courses, as well as a third year of science. It also said that for "optimum preparation" for college, students should complete four years of study in a foreign language, instead of the two-year minimum the committee recommends.
 
Approval Is Expected

The panel's proposals, now being circulated in draft form, are expected to be approved by the University Faculty Senate later this month and sent to the Chancellor by April 1. Dr. Reynolds is then expected to review the faculty proposals with the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, and his staff in detail before submitting her own recommendations to the university' trustees next January.

HEADLINE: It Takes People to Make a Strike: Tales of Fear and Courage at The News

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
It has all the elements of a great Daily News story -- violence, ambition, moral dilemmas and the struggle of common people. For the last 137 days, though, the story has been about the paper itself.
The struggle over the future of The News, once the country's largest metropolitan daily, has been played out on a broad public stage before a bitterly divisive strike began on Oct. 25. But the protracted showdown between The News and its battle-scarred unions has obscured the private sagas of hundreds of News employees. 
 For Joanne Wasserman, a veteran reporter who is six months pregnant, going on strike has threatened the health coverage that she will need in June, when her first child is due.
For Scott Browne, a librarian at the paper, the strike presented an ethical dilemma: whether to stay out on strike with his colleagues or return to protect his job.
For Joanna Hernandez, a single mother hired by The News to replace striking reporters, the labor dispute offered a chance to clear up $20,000 in debts and break into big-city journalism.
And for Larry Farrell, a pressman who has been working almost full time at his union local's headquarters, the strike has stoked the fervor of labor solidarity.
With the battle over The News nearing its culmination, these four workers are among strikers, replacements, crossovers and management supervisors who shared their thoughts and feelings last week. Nearly all took risks -- whether they went on strike, crossed a picket line or replaced a striker -- and many will pay a price no matter what happens.
The fate of The News will be decided in the next few days as the British publisher Robert Maxwell, the paper's nine striking unions and its current owner, the Tribune Company of Chicago, try to wrap up complex negotiations over a possible purchase by Mr. Maxwell. Executives of The News say the paper will cease publication on Friday if the sale cannot be completed.

 
 
 An Untold Story: Producing the Paper
 The News has continued to publish every day during the four months of the strike, produced by nonunion supervisors, replacement workers and union members who returned to work. Matthew Storin contends that the untold story of the strike has been these workers' quiet commitment to putting out the paper. Mr. Storin has some standing for his news judgment: he is managing editor of The News.
"It was easy for people to romanticize people on the picket lines leading the fight, but no one romanticized people putting the thing out," said Mr. Storin, a 48-year-old editor who came to The News in 1989. "We as managers very much felt it was our duty to keep this paper alive and keep the standards as high as we could."
Particularly early in the strike, there was a feeling of isolation in the newsroom on the seventh floor of the News Building on East 42d Street, Mr. Storin said. "We did everything we could to maintain normalcy," he said. "We tried to hold meetings at the same time, to tell the same bad jokes. We asked the same questions. Daily rituals were comforting."
Sometimes, there was comfort in old connections with staff members out on strike. The editors submitted nominations for Pulitzer Prizes, and most reporters nominated were on strike. "We're rooting for them as hard as if they were still working here," Mr. Storin said. Other times, relations were severely strained. Mr. Storin said it hurt when people on the picket lines called him names because he was hiring replacements. "We may not have agreed with everything the Tribune Company did, but we were trying to put out the best paper we could," he said.
Other supervisors shared Mr. Storin's belief that their efforts to keep the paper functioning have gone unnoticed in the attention paid to the strike. Some also went out of their way to distance themselves from the Tribune Company and its hardball approach to the unions.
The deputy managing editor for features, Fran Wood, said she had been working 11-hour days, assuming all sorts of new duties, to help keep The News alive. "What was lost in all of this were the efforts of the people in the editorial department who came back to see the continuation of The Daily News," Ms. Wood said. "We didn't have any interaction with the Tribune Company. I don't think of myself as the Tribune Company. I think of myself as The Daily News."
Mr. Storin said his worst memory was the day when Gail Collins, a respected columnist who was hired by New York Newsday during the strike, came to clean out her desk.
"I wanted to say something, to take note of the fact that the paper was losing one of its most valued contributors, but I could see that she was not open to that, so we had one of those 'Good luck' conversations," he said. "We were not particularly close, but it was what her leaving represented to the paper that got me."

 
 
 Finding Warmth in Fire of Unionism
 While the strike has been a burden for supervisors, at least they had a steady income. The strike is now in its 20th week, and as time has passed, many strikers have found it difficult to get by. Union strike benefits and unemployment insurance have cushioned the blow somewhat, many people said.
Paddy Loughlin, a 61-year-old pressman, said that the strike had cost him about $10,000 so far but that he had got by because he had prepared. "I saw this coming about a year beforehand and started socking some money away," Mr. Loughlin said. "Now most of that is gone."
Like Mr. Farrell, a younger colleague, Mr. Loughlin has been working at union headquarters as a strike coordinator. His motivation is both principled and pragmatic. "I owe something to all the union men who came before me and made a life for me," Mr. Loughlin said.
And Mr. Farrell said the union work had helped preserve a sense of confidence. "Working here every day has kept me focused," he said. "It's been a therapy of sorts that's kept my mind on winning this strike and off things like 'How am I going to pay for things? And how am I going to get on with my life when this is settled?' "
Mr. Farrell, who has worked on the presses at The News for 11 years, said the strike had galvanized his interest in union affairs. He recently began taking college courses in labor relations and hopes someday to work as a union official. "I always had the fire of unionism in my belly, but this has put gasoline on it," Mr. Farrell said.
Both men were pleased when Mr. Maxwell stepped in as a possible savior of The News, but their hopes are tempered. Mr. Maxwell said Thursday that he was looking to trim at least 800 jobs at the paper.
"This guy is very savvy, and he's not in it to do us any favors," Mr. Farrell said. "Hopefully, we can work something out. But I'm sure that if we are lucky enough to do that, a lot of us won't be going back to work."

 
 
 Living New Life; Wishing for Old One
 Many reporters who are on strike have found opportunities for freelance work at magazines and at television production companies. But many hope that they will soon be returning to The News.
JoAnne Wasserman has been a reporter at The News for four years and worked at The New York Post for seven years before that. During the strike, she has been preoccupied with her pregnancy and with her fear that she will give birth without the benefit of health insurance. Ms. Wasserman and her husband, Stuart Marques, also a News reporter, have found temporary work.
"I would have liked to have gone through my pregnancy without having to worry about this," she said. "That's why it would be great to go back, to go back to the routine. I wouldn't mind going back to my desk on the seventh floor."
Martha Southgate, a feature writer in the entertainment section, has been freelancing at magazines. Ms. Southgate and her husband had wanted to buy an apartment, but the drop in her income forced them to postpone their plan.
Ms. Southgate is concerned that she will not be invited back to work if the strike is settled. Because she came to The News last year, Ms. Southgate, who is 30, has little seniority.
"I'm prepared for that," she said. "This has been so long and so nasty. I probably would go back, but I'm not dying to. The whole thing has been so strenuous, and I don't feel the same way about the place."

 
 
 Making the Most of a Rare Chance
 Hundreds of replacement workers are aware that they are not likely to be working at The News after Friday, whether the paper is saved or shut down. Mr. Maxwell has said all replacements would be dropped if he took over the paper.
Even so, many of the replacements view their experience as a singular opportunity. Ms. Hernandez has worked at The Bridgeport Post in Connecticut and at a weekly paper in New Haven. But since the New Haven paper shut down a year ago, she did some freelance writing and worked temporarily as a secretary. With two children to support by herself -- she has a 13-year-old daughter, Sheena, and an 11-year-old son, Gary -- Ms. Hernandez slipped quickly into debt.
Ms. Hernandez, who is 33, had applied for a reporter's job at The News in March 1990 and got no response. The paper invited her in for an interview the day after the strike began last October. She said she had some qualms about taking a striker's job, but her financial needs overcame her concern.
"I decided I would only work there if they paid enough to provide for my children and get me out of debt," Ms. Hernandez recalled. She braced herself for a tough negotiation with The News, but the paper offered her $200 more a week than she had been prepared to ask. Like most of the replacement reporters, Ms. Hernandez is making about $900 a week.
She is working as a police reporter. Occasionally, people have refused to be interviewed by her or to cooperate in any other way because she was a replacement worker. Ms. Hernandez said she had also received messages on her telephone answering machine calling her a scab.
Ms. Hernandez knows her time at The News is limited, and she has been sending resumes to large newspapers across the country. She hopes her clips from The News will help her land a permanent position at a large paper. "I came here to give my career a boost," she said. "That's what I've gotten."

 
 
Breaking Old Ties to Try to Save Job
 Scott Browne, on the other hand, went back to work to save his job at The News. Mr. Browne crossed the picket line five days into the strike and returned to his job in the paper's library. Mr. Browne, who is 39, has worked at The News for more than 14 years. He said he had returned because he feared he would never work at The News again if a replacement took his place.
"People yelled 'scab' at me, and 'Jew bastard,' " Mr. Browne said. "I had many sleepless nights."
"I know there are some people I will never speak to again except professionally," he said of colleagues who have remained on strike. "I ran into someone I knew today on the street. He said, 'Are you out?' And I said, 'I'm in." And he said, 'Well then, I can't talk to you.' "

HEADLINE: Alabama Leads Push for Cleaner Offshore Drilling

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAUPHIN ISLAND, Ala.

 BODY:
Here aboard the drilling platform Glomar Highland IV, a vibrating cacophony of shouting men and squealing steel, the Mobil Oil Corporation is tapping into one of the largest strikes of natural gas ever made in North America.
But the size of the gas reserve buried deep beneath the floor of Mobile Bay is only part of the story. Prodded by stringent state law, public sentiment and aggressive enforcement, Mobil and two competitors, Shell and Exxon, have taken extraordinary steps to protect a marine estuary renowned for its rich catches of shrimp, oysters and fish. 
 Instead of discharging chemicals and sewage into the water, a practice followed on nearly all the 3,600 offshore drilling platforms in the United States, the companies are collecting thousands of barrels of drilling mud, lubricant, human waste, even rainwater that drips off equipment, and are putting them into barges for treatment and disposal on land. Mobil says it is spending up to $150,000 a week on waste disposal alone.
As the Bush Administration prepares to open vast undersea tracts off the East Coast, Florida, Southern California and Alaska to exploration for oil and natural gas, such costly measures are becoming the focus of intense debate. The offshore oil industry, though proud of its environmental record here, says requirements like Alabama's are unnecessary and could even prove hazardous. Environmental groups and state officials reply that Alabama has established a model of ecological safety that should be the nationwide standard for drilling operations close to shore.
 
Many Rules, More Rewards

In February, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed tightening regulations for discharges from offshore platforms in Federal waters, which begin three miles from shore in most states. The regulations, though not as strict as Alabama's, would require more thorough treatment than currently practiced before wastes could be discharged.
Environmentalists here and in other states say the experience in Mobile Bay shows how far the oil industry is prepared to go to gain economic rewards from offshore drilling. Mobil's natural gas reserves beneath Mobile Bay are estimated to be worth at least $650 million at current prices.
Neither Mobil nor the two other oil companies agreed willingly to abide by Alabama's rules. Almost a decade ago, after Mobil was discovered pouring untreated sludge and toxic drilling mud into the bay, the company paid a $2 million penalty to the state and agreed to pay at least $500,000 to dredge up yards of chemical-soaked bay bottom.
And it agreed to Alabama's zero-discharge rules, which environmentalists say are working well. "It's a pretty clean operation. It really is," said Dr. George F. Crozier, a marine biologist and executive director of the Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory who has been one of the oil industry's sharpest critics in Alabama. "The bay is relatively healthy, and their plans for drilling 12 more wells over the next three years are not likely to have any profound environmental effects."
 
Safeguarding Shrimp
 Aboard the Glomar Highland, an 11-year-old drilling platform, Mobil employees from supervisors to the roughnecks who man the equipment are eager to describe the steps they have taken not to harm "a single little shrimp," as one roughneck put it.
Each week thousands of gallons of drilling solution, pulverized rock, motor oil, and lubricant are pumped into one of two barges tied to the platform. Rainwater and sewage go into the second barge. Employees caught throwing garbage into the bay have been dismissed, and workers say men even spitting into the bay have been reprimanded.
Elray Foret, Mobil's 49-year-old drilling superintendent, says it costs the company $58,000 to dispose of each barge of chemical wastes, and $28,000 to treat and dispose of a load on a sewage barge. "It's a lot of money, but we're doing it," said Mr. Foret. "Over in Florida, I can't understand why they don't want us. You can see, this ain't going to hurt the environment. There's nothing here that can hurt the environment."
The company's engineers say similar controls on discharges from platforms in the ocean are unnecessary and warn that in a heavy storm, waste barges could smash into the steel legs of a deep water platform and threaten the lives of the crew.
 
The Focus on Natural Gas
 Federal law already requires sewage to be treated on drilling rigs before it is released into the water, and the proposed regulations would tighten those standards. Lubricants and hazardous chemicals are collected in barrels and transported to shore for disposal. Specialists for Mobil say the ocean dilutes other wastes, like drilling mud and pulverized rock, rendering them harmless.
"Around our deep-water offshore platforms, the fish are doing just fine," said H. Lew Herrin, an environmental engineering adviser for Mobil. "You know, we're required to treat our wastes. But stand out there and watch 150 dolphins swim by. The Government doesn't require treatment of their wastes."
In other respects, the activities in and around Mobile Bay signal the direction the American offshore industry is likely to take in the 21st century. The prize here is natural gas, a cleaner alternative to oil that can also be processed into liquid methanol and burned as a substitute for gasoline.
The United States gets 25 percent of its natural gas from offshore wells, and the White House energy plan envisions that at least 60 percent of the fossil fuels recovered offshore in the 21st century will be gas, not oil.
 
The Gleam of Oil
 Although drilling for gas can be dangerous because of the chance of an explosion, it does not present the same risks to the environment. Gas evaporates into the atmosphere and cannot wash up on shore. Mobil transports gas to shore here through a pipeline buried beneath the bay bottom and beneath the marshes near its new processing plant.
Environmental groups are not quieted by such assurances. They argue that the Administration and the oil industry also have every intention of tapping the 18 billion barrels of oil believed to lie offshore. At the nation's current rate of demand, 17 million barrels a day, that is about three years' supply -- not worth the risk of a catastrophic oil spill, the environmental groups say.
"The oil industry would like us to believe they have the technology to acquire these supplies safely," said Robert Sulnick, executive director of the American Oceans Campaign, an environmental group in Santa Monica, Calif. "But this is not a debate about hardware. It's a debate about the future security of the nation."
Among the most influential supporters of this school of thought are the Governors of Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey and California, who oppose the Administration's offshore drilling plan because of concern about the safety of their states' coasts.
In the oil industry, there is a strong sense of frustration with the views of coastal governors and residents. Since 1969, when a Chevron well blew out in Santa Barbara, Calif., smothering beaches and birds in 3.25 million gallons of crude oil, the offshore industry has developed new kinds of blowout prevention devices and advanced equipment to monitor oil and gas wells, technology that has largely prevented oil spills from offshore platforms.
 
Despite Better Safety, Suspicion
 According to a report by the Department of the Interior, the cause of most oil spills is oil tanker accidents, like the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989. Not since 1969 has the offshore industry been responsible for an oil spill that exceeded 800,000 gallons, less than one-tenth the size of the Alaska spill, and the industry says most of the oil was dissipated at sea.
"I tell you, let me be President and I'd fix the whole thing," said Mr. Foret. "If we didn't give another drop of oil to Florida, or North Carolina, or California, they'd all be begging to let us come to drill. Take no time at all."
Opposition to the drilling boom that began in 1979 has never been overwhelming along Alabama's coast, but there was a lingering suspicion among residents about the oil industry's willingness to comply with state environmental laws. Fishermen and shoreline homeowners kept a close eye on Mobil's drilling rig, and in 1981, after a fishing crew pulled up a catch of flounder coated in oil, Mobil and the state began an investigation.
"What these guys were doing was putting the discharge hoses between the barges, and all that lubricating oil and drilling mud was dropping straight into the bay," said Dr. Crozier, who assisted investigators. "I took a state inspector out there one day and we put a probe down and came up with muck drenched in oil.
"There's always been a resistance to big money in this part of the world, sort of a bit of native spite," he went on. "Once Mobil was caught polluting, the die was cast, and people here simply said the oil industry will not be allowed to proceed without strict controls."

HEADLINE: An Exception to Rule of War: Inflation Threat Is Receding

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
From the Revolution to Vietnam, virtually every American war has sparked a round of inflation. But the Persian Gulf war looks as if it will be an exception. A barrage of signals -- including cheaper oil and raw materials, softer prices at factories, swelling cattle herds and shrinking bonuses for sales workers -- suggests that inflation may retreat.
The drop could be striking, and price increases could well stay low for years. The most compelling reason for thinking so is the Federal Reserve's four-year spell of stinginess in pumping cash and credit into the economy. Since 1987, the money supply has grown, on average, at just half the rate of the early 80's. 
 "We've built the foundation for lower inflation," said W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, noting that the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have been committed to nudging inflation down by gradually reducing money growth.
 
Economy Would Gain
 If inflation stays low, the economy would benefit. The United States would fall closer in line with such rich and powerful nations as Germany and Japan, whose inflation rates have averaged half of the United States rate, or less, in the last decade. And long-term interest rates could edge down as investors' fears of future inflation eased.
What is more, future recessions would probably be milder than the harsh downturns that ruptured the high-inflation years. One reason that most economists expect the current recession to be shorter and shallower is that inflation has not raced out of control.
Many forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, expect consumer price inflation to average 3 to 4 percent this year, compared with an annual rate of almost 7 percent in the second half of 1990. For the next few months, the rate could hover around 2 percent, forecasters at DRI/McGraw-Hill said, as the lower cost of a barrel of crude oil works its way into a broad spectrum of consumer prices. Last fall, spot oil prices shot toward $40 a barrel; now, oil is trading at about $18 a barrel.
That would give consumer buying power a welcome boost and help stabilize spending. "It's like a $16 billion personal tax cut and is worth $170 per household," said Roger E. Brinner, the chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
Among the reasons the Persian Gulf War seems not to have been inflationary are that it lasted only 42 days, quickly contained the threat to oil supplies, was financed in part by American allies and was fought with armstaken from inventory. Ordinarily, military spending overheats the economy as production surges to supply the war effort, leaving fewer goods available for civilian consumption. As a result prices rise.
 
 More Room for the Fed

The lower oil prices now give the Federal Reserve more room to fight the recession. "Because a lessening of cost pressures has improved the outlook for prices, the easing of policy has been possible without raising new concerns in the financial markets about inflation prospects." Mr. Greenspan testified before Congress on Wednesday. And on Friday, the Federal Reserve once again pushed down interest rates.
This low-inflation scenario could stumble if, for example, oil prices took off again, the dollar suddenly plunged, or state and local governments jacked up taxes sky high in an attempt to solve their budget problems. But the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report, issued on Feb. 20, alludes to the "downward tilt of the underlying inflation trend." That view is shared by Administration and Congressional economists, as well as many private forecasters.
There has already been a basic improvement in price trends -- as any driver who has recently pulled up to a gasoline pump can attest -- but it has been largely obscured in official inflation measures because of a rash of one-time events and statistical flukes.
 
 One-Time Hits

To take just one example: Higher Federal excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes will probably exaggerate this winter's inflation rate by more than one-third, John F. Peterson, an economist at the Congressional Budget Office, estimated. Other special factors were the 17 percent postal rate increase that went into effect last month and the second installment of the minimum wage increase. These onetime hits should be absorbed in a month or two.
Four forces are helping to beat down inflation, most economists agree: weaker commodity prices, especially for energy and food, which together account for about one-fifth of consumer spending; the recession, preceded by a year and a half of extremely sluggish economic growth; slackening wage gains, and, finally, signs that productivity outside manufacturing is holding up better than expected during the downturn. A major factor in each, most analysts say, is the Federal Reserve's monetary restraint in recent years.
The immediate source of relief is, of course, cheaper crude oil. At around $18, oil prices are back where they were in the first half of 1990. They should bobble around $20 in this year's second half, down from $24.40 in the comparable period last year, said Adam E. Sieminski, an economist at the Washington Analysis Group.
Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, commented, "Indirectly, that's slowing prices charged by metals and paper manufacturers, on the one hand, and airlines and hotels on the other."
And David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, said, "The prices of key industrial commodities are falling because the world economy is much weaker now."
California's drought and recent freeze notwithstanding, food prices are also moderating. Prices had been climbing at close to a 6 percent rate for the last two years, faster than inflation. Now the Department of Agriculture's official forecast calls for advances of 2 to 5 percent, with the department's chief forecaster, Ralph Parlett, saying that "awful things would have to happen to hit the upper forecast range."
Though the Fed has been loosening gradually since the spring of 1989 and more aggressively this winter, money growth on average has been far lower in the last four years than in the first half of the 80's. In particular, the Federal Reserve did not react to last summer's oil price shock by flooding the economy with money. "That was a very important decision," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp. "Very few companies were able to pass on the rise in energy costs."
 
Sluggish Growth
 The consequence of monetary restraint was sluggish growth even before Saddam Hussein toppled the economy into recession. "Spare capacity in factories and looser labor markets make it harder for business and workers to push for price and wage gains," Mr. Rippe of Dean Witter Reynolds said.
As a consequence, compensation costs are moderating. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment cost index rose 4.6 percent in December from a year earlier, down from an increase of 5.2 percent in June. Slow growth and recession pushed unemployment up to 6.5 percent in February from its low of 5.3 percent last June. As long as unemployment stays above what is considered full employment -- which most economists put at 5.5 to 6 percent -- employment costs should keep moderating.
The trend is especially evident among service companies that are squeezing some of their highest-paid help, salespeople, real estate agents and stockbrokers. "The upscale labor market is flabbier than it's ever been," said Stephen Strongin of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
 
Basic Change Seen
 Smaller raises may reflect a fundamental change in the job market, suggested Daniel J. B. Mitchell, a professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Workers are less cushioned from market forces by union contracts or paternalistic employers; union membership is down to 12 percent of private, non-government workers. While small-business payrolls swelled by 15 million during the 80's, Fortune 500 companies shed 2 million jobs. In deciding how much to raise pay last year, Mr. Mitchell said, "employers looked to conditions in the labor market, not to some notion of protecting workers' purchasing power."
But permanent progress on the inflation front ultimately depends on faster productivity growth, almost everyone agrees. "The only way to have strong growth without inflation is to increase productivity faster," said Mr. Hale of Kemper Financial Services. Otherwise, he said, low inflation comes at the cost of stagnating living standards.
There has been an early sign that the productivity trend might be improving. Productivity rose slightly in the recession's first quarter, instead of declining along with output as it usually does at the start of a downturn. At the beginning of the 1981-82 slump, by contrast, productivity plunged at a 5.5 percent annual rate. Since companies laid off workers a lot sooner in the current slump, some economists say, once output picks up in a recovery, productivity gains could be sizable.

HEADLINE: 3 Unions at The News Would Bear Brunt of Job Cuts, Leaders Say

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
As talks on the fate of The Daily News continued last night, union leaders negotiating with Robert Maxwell said that almost 700 of the 800 jobs the British publisher wants to eliminate would be from three large unions, the pressmen, the drivers and the Newspaper Guild.
The proposal would reduce the number of pressmen at The News to about 200 from 400, the union leaders said. The drivers would lose 300 of 700 jobs, and the Guild, which represents newsroom, advertising and clerical employees, would lose about 180 from the current level of more than 700 workers. 
 The union officials, who acknowledged that large job reductions would be required to make the paper profitable, said they would be making counterproposals, as the deadline of 10 A.M. tomorrow imposed by Mr. Maxwell approached.
Michael Alvino, president of the drivers' union, said that Mr. Maxwell had held out the possibility of rehiring some of those laid off, if The News could regain the circulation it lost during the four-month strike.
 
Talks Have Until Friday
 If the prospective buyer and the paper's nine striking unions can agree on new labor contracts, Mr. Maxwell, who owns a number of media properties in this country and abroad, would then try to complete his conditional agreement to buy The News from its corporate parent, the Tribune Company of Chicago. If the talks fail, executives of The News have said they would cease publication of the 71-year-old paper, once the nation's largest daily, on Friday.
 
'Doing Their Best'
 At 1:30 P.M. yesterday, Mr. Maxwell ambled through the lobby of the headquarters of Macmillan Inc., the publishing company he owns, on Third Avenue near 53d Street, saying that he "just wanted to take a breath of fresh air."
Mr. Maxwell, who was alone, said that negotiations were going "fine" and that he continued to be "reasonably optimistic." He said that the unions were "doing their best" but that the outcome was still uncertain.
"Lovely day you're having in New York," he said as he strolled north on Third Avenue. He returned about five minutes later.
 
Maxwell Seeks Huge Reductions
 The possible sale to Mr. Maxwell apparently represents the final chance to save The News, which has lost money for most of the last decade. Negotiations between the paper's management and unions, which had gone on intermittently for 13 months, were abandoned 10 days ago with the sides deadlocked. Nine of the paper's 10 unions have been on strike since Oct. 25.
Mr. Maxwell contends -- as did the Tribune Company -- that he needs huge concessions from the unions to make The News profitable. During the talks that began Thursday, he told the unions that he needs reductions of more than $70 million a year in labor costs.
That is the equivalent of about 800 jobs, or a little more than a third of the unionized positions at The News. The proposal would not necessarily mean that 800 people would lose their jobs, because some savings could be achieved by eliminating guaranteed overtime and other work rules.
Mr. Maxwell's bargaining with the unions, which is taking place out of public view on the 14th floor of the Macmillan building, appears to be going better than did the talks between the unions and the Tribune Company.
Labor leaders said Mr. Maxwell initially made some major concessions on issues common to all the unions. He pledged not to keep permanently any of the 800 or so replacement workers who are filling strikers' jobs at The News. He also told the unions that a condition of his letter of intent to purchase the paper was that the Tribune Company would drop lawsuits it filed against the unions during the strike.
The union leaders also complained repeatedly during the last year of negotiations that the Tribune Company would not specify in dollars how much it wanted to cut its labor costs. Instead, they said, management kept insisting on the absolute right to set staffing levels and other working conditions -- issues that had traditionally been the subject of collective bargaining.
Although Mr. Maxwell is bargaining in the manner favored by the unions, by stating his economic objectives, the reductions he seeks are very large and may be difficult to obtain. He is demanding staff cuts and work-rule changes that would produce annual savings of between $72.8 million and $83.6 million.
 
No Charge for the Paper
 If the unions and Mr. Maxwell can reach agreement, he will then have until Thursday to complete his purchase agreement with the Tribune Company.
The potential transfer of ownership of The News is correctly called a sale, but its terms are highly unusual. Mr. Maxwell would not directly pay a penny for the paper, which has suffered circulation declines and operating deficits for most of the last decade. Both circulation and advertising have dropped precipitously during the four-month strike.
The Tribune Company would pay Mr. Maxwell $60 million for taking over the paper and assuming most of its long-term liabilities. Those include severance pay in the event of a shutdown, estimated at $25 million, and lifetime guarantees to the paper's printers, whose value has been estimated anywhere from $20 million to $100 million.

HEADLINE: Hard Days for Sports in Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: SEVILLE, Spain

 BODY:
Lia Manoliu, the president of Romania's national Olympic committee, arrived in London last week for two days of meetings with other European Olympic officials. Then, she was scheduled to return home. What she really wanted to do was come here to Seville first and watch a day or two of the world indoor track and field championships. Romania has a small team competing, and track and field, after all, remains her first love. She was the Olympic discus bronze medalist in 1960 and 1964.
But such a change was impossible, of course. Her round-trip ticket was booked on Tarom, the national airline of Romania, which accepts lei, the Romanian currency, which is virtually useless elsewhere. To extend her trip would have required pounds or dollars or marks or francs, all of which are scarce in Romania and were even scarcer in her handbag, as she sat in her hotel lobby wishing the impossible. 
 "I would like to see our team," she said, looking ever so sad. "If only I had the money."
She is hardly alone in disappointment.
All across Eastern Europe, in countries now trying to build democracies after decades of rigid Communist rule, dire economic conditions persist. The sports communities, no longer high priorities in countries where citizens stuggle to obtain food and the bare essentials of living, have been severely affected.
No longer are governments fully subsidizing the national sports systems and Olympic programs. With so many more urgent needs, they can no longer afford it. As a result, athletes now find themselves competing as much for sponsorships and support as medals and records. Coaches, trainers and medical experts are losing their jobs. Travel has been reduced significantly. Romania is sending a team of gymnasts to the United States later this year for a dual meet only because the United States Gymnastics Federation agreed to pay for everything.
From a national standpoint, a change has left five of the countries -- Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania -- faint hope for improvements over their more recent Olympic efforts. A sixth, East Germany, gained an advantage through unification with West Germany.
But in a larger context, the possible erosion of high-performance sports in the other countries, combined with continuing struggles of third-world nations to develop competitive teams, could eventually lead to an unsightly imbalance in which the wealthiest countries, like the United States and Germany, would dominate the medal standings even more than they do now.
The International Olympic Committee, well aware of the potential domino effect, is either powerless or unwilling to throw foundering countries much of a life jacket. As caretaker of the Games, the I.O.C. selects sites, negotiates marketing and television contracts, then does everything possible to make sure every country shows up. Aside from disbursing revenues to the national Olympic committees that participate in the Games, covering the costs of participation and holding marketing seminars, the I.O.C. has not engaged in any large-scale charity work.
"Assuming we even had the funds to finance them, that is not the answer," said Francois Carrard, the director general of the I.O.C. "That would be artificial support. We have to change the mentality and habits of these countries and try convincing the governments to keep within their priorities an interest in sport. Our hope is that they start to reconsider."
While money for sports remains tight throughout all of Eastern Europe, nowhere does the financial pinch seem more acute than in Bulgaria and Romania, countries that have generally fared well in the Summer Olympics. In the 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Bulgaria won 35 medals, most among Eastern European countries after East Germany, with 102. Romania was next with 24.
In Bulgaria, one of the last of the countries in the region to throw out its hard-line Communist leaders, the Government has almost eliminated support for sports as an item in the national budget. Before, said Ivan Slavkov, an I.O.C. member since 1987 and the son-in-law of the last Communist ruler, Todor Zhivkov, "we got 80 percent of our support from the Government."
"Now," he said, "they are not paying any attention to sports because sports are not considered the most important. And they're not the most important." Meanwhile, with high prices, soaring inflation and a market economy still embryonic, the sports community has been left in a vacuum.
Like other Eastern European national Olympic committees, Bulgaria's has appealed for help to the I.O.C. and the international sports federations, which sponsor major events.
"We're contacting all international federations," Slavkov said. "That's the only way we can survive."
The Bulgarians have also sought help from other national Olympic committees, including those of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. They have heard from only one, the United States. "They're not interested," Slavkov said.
In Romania, the post-Ceausescu Government continues to support sports programs, designating 500 million lei this year, double the figure for 1990. But the figure is misleading, and problems there may be worse than in Bulgaria. Lei are virtually worthless outside Romania, and the Government's attempt to change the economy has led to higher prices on all goods, effectively reducing buying power to a level below last year's. Further, most of the factories and enterprises that for years had supported local sports clubs have stopped doing so, and federal law requires all athletes to pay 50 percent of the hard currency they win as taxes.
The right each citizen now has to travel has also hurt the sports system. Manoliu said that at least 40 elite-level coaches and trainers have left the country in the last year, including Adrian Goreac, the 1988 Olympic gymnastics coach, who has moved to France.
"We have lost so many of our sportsmen," she said. "The secret of our success was our coaches, and it's difficult to remake them."
Unlike the United States and other countries that send as many athletes as possible to the Olympics, Romanian officials set unusually high qualifying standards and sent only those athletes they felt could win medals. As a result, only 62 Romanians participated in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and 73 in Seoul four years later. The strategy worked, as Romanians won 53 medals in 1984 and 24 in 1988.
It was a crafty strategy, in that it kept down costs and maintained pressure on athletes at the highest level to produce, thus justifying the government's investment.
But Manoliu wants to change all that by lowering standards and sending as many Romanians to next year's Games as possible. No matter how autonomous the Olympic committee may be, she fears the Government will not allow her to implement her ideas.
"I am still dreaming. I have so many ideas," she said. "Even when I tell these ideas to my people, they are still afraid. They are not used to someone asking their advice without being guided. They don't dare say I am crazy, but I feel they think it."
So far, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland have endured somewhat less severe economic stress than Bulgaria and Romania. By no means wealthy, these countries at least have had a head start with democracy and market economies, although convincing political leaders that Olympic programs deserve more than passing attention remains a difficult sell.
The United States Olympic Comittee, which has become one of the richest national committees, earning an automatic 10 percent of any contract between an American television network and the I.O.C., has not turned a completely deaf ear to the weaker nations. But these days, the U.S.O.C. is less inclined to write a check. Rather, its marketing officials have offered to show countries how to adapt to the new market conditions. In one recent project, the U.S.O.C. sold at cost several hundred thousand dollars worth of American-made merchandise, like T-shirts, windbreakers and sweatshirts, to Yugoslavia's Olympic commttee for a newly opened store in Sarajevo. The store keeps all the profit.
"We want to provide the seeds, rather than the flower," said John Krimsky, the deputy secretary general of the U.S.O.C. and its chief marketing officer. "Absent direct funding, which we cannot do, all sorts of things are possible."
It is that period before the bloom, however, that most worries the I.O.C, an organization ever so concerned that world opinion might not regard its quadrennial party as the best sporting event on earth.
"These countries had been perfectly structured for top sports," said Carrard, the I.O.C. officer. "With their systems of administration, if you properly lobbied the leaders of the country, you got what you wanted. Now, these same people have no idea how to raise $2,000. They are completely at a loss. They just don't know where to start."

He Missed Series, but He's Happy

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Ron Robinson has a red beard on his face but no World Series ring on his finger. "I spent a lot of time there," he said of his six years with the Cincinnati Reds. "I wish I had been there. But" -- and it was a big but -- "I felt I wasn't treated right there and it was time to move on. Instead of fighting for a job there, I have a job here."
 Here is the Milwaukee Brewers, who traded for Robinson last June 9, which happened to be the 62d day of the 178 days the Reds spent in first place. Robinson wasn't around for the final 116 days of Cincinnati's seasonlong stay in first or the 17-day period in which the Reds won the National League pennant and the World Series, but given his circumstances and his feeling about Lou Piniella, he was willing to forgo the festivities for the artistic and economic success he achieved with the Brewers. 
 "I got frustrated sitting on the bench in Cincinnati," said Robinson, who compiled a 12-5 record and gained a three-year, $3.3 million contract after leaving the Reds. "I was healthy, but I wasn't pitching. Lou Piniella didn't know who I was. He didn't know anything about me. He told us in spring training everybody was the No. 1 pitcher. Nobody was better than anyone else. But then he went right back on his word."
 When asked about Robinson, Piniella said: "We had a very short spring training and very little time to get pitchers in shape, plus we had eight or nine veteran pitchers. He wasn't ready when we left spring training so he wasn't pitching on a regular basis, and because of that he wasn't happy."
After making 100 consecutive relief appearances for the Reds in 1986 and '87, Robinson moved into the starting rotation in 1987 and remained there for two and a half seasons, except for the times his right elbow wouldn't let him pitch. He had three operations on his elbow in 18 months, but was healthy when the Reds began the 1990 season with Piniella, and not Pete Rose, as their manager.
 "Lou told me one time I'd never pitch in that uniform again," Robinson related. "That was April 15. They said they couldn't trade me because no one wanted me, which I knew was a lie. But on April 29 I pitched because Danny Jackson got hurt."
 What prompted the temperamental Piniella to erupt at Robinson?
 "I got tired of what was going on and I kept pressing him to find out what was going on," Robinson said. "I wanted to pitch. In your free-agent year, you don't want to sit on the bench. I'm only 29. Lou's a smooth talker. He can make it sound good. But they said I was a me-me-I-I guy. Who's going to look out for you? Not Bob Quinn. Lou isn't. Now I'm making a pretty good living. If I had been there all year, I wouldn't have this contract. I'd still have to prove myself."
 Robinson, who in two months with the Reds last season started sporadically, pitching not at all for 10 days after reeling off 13 successive scoreless innings in two starts, compiled a 2.91 earned run average in 22 starts with the Brewers.
 "The Reds said I couldn't pitch complete games," he said. "Nobody left me in there. I pitched seven here."
 Robinson hasn't dismissed Piniella completely. "Maybe Lou and me will cross paths later in life," he said.
 
Backman Optimistic
 Even though the ingredients for self-destruction are on the surface for everyone to see, Wally Backman does not believe the Pittsburgh Pirates will single-handedly wreck their chances for repeating as National League East champions. Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla, the Pirates' two most menacing players, are unhappy with their $2-million-plus salaries, and Bonds's outburst last week was one of the best in recent years.
 "Knowing the type of guy Jim Leyland is, I don't think it'll happen," said Backman, who played for Leyland and the Pirates last year. "In one year's time, I got to know him well. He'll keep things under control. He's the easiest guy I ever played for. You'll always have contract problems, but once you go between the lines, the kind of manager Jimmy is, he'll have them ready to play."
 Backman, who has moved east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike to Philadelphia, said that Bonds's tantrum at cameramen and assorted Pirates employees did not surprise him.
 "I wouldn't expect that will happen with Barry again this year," he said. "He respects Jimmy, but sometimes he gets in a mood where he thinks everybody comes down on him. He might have said some things that got him in trouble, but he's a good player."
 Off the field, Backman explained, Bonds sometimes alienates people with his comments.
 "You have to be more team-oriented as opposed to being self-oriented," he said. "He'll say things about himself where he should be talking about the team. He gets himself into jams. He won't admit mistakes. When he gets in these situations, he'll argue."
 More than the effect an unhappy Bonds and Bonilla might have on the Pirates, Backman said, could be the impact of Sid Bream's absence.
 "I think they're going to miss him more than people think," Backman said of the first baseman, who went to Atlanta as a free agent. "Sid was one of the biggest assets on the club. He was right there with Barry, Bobby and Andy Van Slyke. Down the stretch, he was one of the guys you wanted out there."
 
Parker Makes Some Points
 He would not talk about his contract, Dave Parker said. He had nothing to say about the rumors that he wants Milwaukee to improve the contract or give him an extension. "I have no comment on that," said Parker, who has a $1.4 million salary this year and the same next year if the Brewers exercise their option. Many less productive players will earn more than he does, and he is reportedly unhappy about it.
 But he would talk about how people had him washed up as far back as 1982 and how, nine years and three teams later, he is 408 hits from 3,000 and 72 home runs from 400, dual levels attained by only Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Carl Yastrzemski. He also talked about how he really didn't mind moving around as he has in recent years.
 After two World Series in two years with Oakland, he said, it was time to move on. "It was a contract thing," he explained. "They didn't want to give me more than one year, and I went out and got more than one year."
 Then, without breaking verbal stride, he went on: "The market exploded after I went to Milwaukee and guys doing what I'm doing are making $2 million and $1 million more than me. The way the market has exploded I feel there should be an adjustment salarywise."
 But he wouldn't talk about his contract.
 
Mariners' Eternal Struggle
 With each passing year, the litany grows more aggravating and makes the albatross heavier: Never in their history have the Seattle Mariners finished with a .500 record. This will be the 15th year that the Mariners try to pluck the wings from the albatross, but Jim Lefebvre, the Mariners' manager, has opted for a new approach this season.
 "We have to forget the .500 mark," he said. "We have to think about being a contender. Everybody talks about .500, but there's no question in our mind we would've been over .500 if we didn't have all the injuries last year."
 The Mariners were at or over .500 from June 29 through Aug. 18 last season, but they collapsed under the weight of their injuries and finished with a 77-85 record.
 "We hate the question," Lefebvre said, meaning the .500 question, "but we're going to keep hearing it until we do it."
 
Trials of a Prospect
 Lance Dickson must have thought he was a traveling salesman last year. After pitching for the University of Arizona in Tucson, he became the Chicago Cubs' first-round choice in the June draft and proceeded to play in Geneva, N.Y.; Peoria, Ill.; Charlotte, S.C., and Chicago.
 He did a great selling job in his first three stops but had the door slammed in his face in Chicago.
 At Class A Geneva, he had a 2-1 record and 0.53 earned run average in three starts; at a more advanced Class A Peoria, 3-1 and 1.51 in five starts and at Class AA Charlotte, 2-1 and 0.38 in three starts. In a total of 76 1/3 minor league innings, he allowed 40 hits and 18 walks -- an average of 6.8 base runners per nine innings -- and struck out 111.
 With the Cubs, however, the left-hander had an 0-3 record and 7.24 e.r.a. in three starts, permitting 20 hits, four walks and 15.8 baserunners per nine while striking out four in 13 2/3 innings.
 "Everybody said what a great curveball he has," Don Zimmer, the Cubs' manager, said. "Tommy Helms called me and said what a great curveball he had. But I didn't see the curve. After two or three starts, we told him to shut it down and go home. He had thrown so many pitches in college and in the minors, he wore out."
 If Dickson, 21 years old, can show Zimmer his "great curveball" consistently in the next four weeks, he would have a chance of stealing a spot in the Cubs' starting rotation.
 
Reggie Reflects
 Reggie Jackson reflected on Jim Palmer's attempted comeback six years after he last played and disclosed that he, too, had considered trying to play again.
 "I had thought about it a couple times," said Jackson, who last played in 1987. "People say, 'Gosh, Reggie, you look a lot better than when you played.' But once your reflexes and quickness are gone, you can't get them back. The thought that has overridden my thoughts about coming back is the picture I've left with people when I left the game. That outweighs my thoughts about a comeback attempt."
 Jackson is back in uniform, as a part-time coach for Oakland, some of whose games he also will work on cable television.
 "I'm fortunate to come in on this level, the major league level," Jackson said. "It satisfies a need Reggie Jackson has. I appreciate that. For me to be involved with this organization, with these people, is a star for Reggie Jackson, a stripe on my sleeve."

U.S. Sets a Cautious Course on Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST as President Bush was about to go to Capitol Hill for his address to Congress on the war last week, his advisers rushed up with a change for the speech. It was only seven words, but for them it was the definition of the postwar Middle East, the heralded "new world order."
 In the original text, Mr. Bush cautioned that "even the new world order cannot guarantee an era of perpetual peace." Some advisers felt that sounded too pessimistic. So Mr. Bush added: "But enduring peace must be our mission." 
 As the United States begins the work of postwar diplomacy, the change in tone seemed to make at least three things clear: The Administration is still sorting out its approach to the long-intractable problems of the Middle East. It is adjusting the vision that was needed to bring the country into war to suit the realities of the region. And, at least for now, the President's plans seem to be more modest than might have been suggested by his expansive wartime talk of lasting peace rising from the flames in the Persian Gulf.
 "It's very high tone and kind of limited," a senior official said, explaining that Mr. Bush was not aiming for "some vision of universal peace with democracy everywhere."
 Just as the President's determination to stop Iraq's expansion reflected his fear of being another Neville Chamberlain, he is now rejecting the mantle of Woodrow Wilson. Indeed, Mr. Bush said last Wednesday night in Congress that his war against Iraq "was not waged as a 'war to end all wars.' "
 "What it means is really not a lot more than, 'You can't invade your neighbor,' " an official said. "We're not going to intervene everywhere, force the Arabs to recognize Israel and the Israelis to deal with the Palestinians. Progress of democracy, yes, but in an incremental way, a la Eastern Europe."
 This not to say that Mr. Bush is abandoning his promise that "no one will work harder for a stable peace in the region than we will." He may be trying to diminish expectations, but he is on record as saying that the best prospects in decades for a broader peace now exist. What it does suggest is that the effort will be conducted in classic George Bush fashion -- striking for the center, and not committing to anything until the odds of failure are reduced as much as possible. That is the reason Mr. Bush sent Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to the Middle East last week and it is the style in which he conducted the war, making sure the coalition backed each step and that every weapon was cocked before fighting started.
 American officials are keeping much of what they intend for the Middle East secret, but it is possible to discern some of what they are most eager to accomplish and what they believe is feasible.
 At the top of Washington's priorities is Saddam Hussein. Mr. Bush insists he is not trying to overthrow Mr. Hussein, but seems prepared to use force again to keep the pressure on. Administration officials said the Pentagon mapped possible air strikes on Friday after intercepting an Iraqi order to use poison gas against rebels in Iraq. "We can't live with him, period," an official said, adding that the only question was how long he could stay in power.
More easily solved is the domestic and international political imperative of bringing home American troops. "There have been two equally important parts to the equation of Bush's credibility," a senior official said. "One is that he said we would come to the aid of the Saudis and Kuwaitis. We did. The other is that he said we would get out quickly. We will."
 This conflicts with the desire to end the Arab-Israeli race to acquire the biggest and most modern armies; if American troops are withdrawn, that makes it militarily dangerous and politically impossible to seek to disarm friendly countries. The United States argues that the war proved that territory and large armies cannot guarantee security, but officials acknowledge that the Middle East will not reduce its armies until it sees progress toward an Arab-Israeli peace.
 So Washington suggests reducing the spread of ballistic missiles, and chemical and biological weapons. This is a smaller problem that can be addressed outside the region with the few countries, including the United States, France, Germany, Britain, the Soviet Union and China, that have such weapons.
 Similarly, the United States seems to be trying not to approach the Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts head-on. Although Mr. Bush said he was fighting Iraq to enforce the principles of national sovereignty, the rule of law and peaceful coexistence, that does not mean the Administration is ready to enforce them across the region.
 The Administration is counting on its Arab allies, especially Saudi Arabia, to repay the United States for its military aid by taking steps toward settling the Arab-Israeli disputes. But Administration officials say there will be no call for a large international conference on the Palestinian question. "We're not going to try to settle the question of who will represent the Palestinians and we're not going to push the Arabs to recognize Israel," an official said. Although Mr. Bush has suggested that Israel contemplate territorial concessions, officials said he will not apply heavy pressure to do so.
 Instead, the Administration will encourage smaller steps: notification of each other by the Middle Eastern countries before conducting military maneuvers; an exchange of Arab and Israeli prisoners; an easing of Israeli travel restrictions in the occupied territories; water-sharing agreements between Israel and Jordan, and Israel and Syria; a re-evaluation by Arab states of their financial support for the Palestine Liberation Organization, and a lowering of voices on all sides.
These are Mr. Baker's "confidence-building" measures. At the same time, the end of the war raises anew an apparent conflict between the American policy of promoting democracy and the restoration of the Emir of Kuwait. But Administration officials say there will be no push for rapid democratization in the area. Instead, Mr. Baker is offering "suggestions" for reducing the gap between rich and poor, hoping economic stability will lead to eventual reform. In a region where the most organized political opposition is either fundamentalist Muslim or radical Palestinian, it is not clear to the Administration that speedy elections are in its best interests.
 As it strives, again, for small steps in inter-Arab relations, the Administration has been encouraged by evident improvement in Saudi Arabia's relationships with Syria and Egypt, which symbolize divisions between rich and poor. "The Saudi-Egypt relationship at this point is very, very good," a senior official said. "The whole Camp David aspect is probably behind them."
 Mr. Bush may have one major advantage as he confronts these issues. "He is the first popular President ever to tackle the Middle East," said William Quandt, who worked on the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter. "Lyndon Johnson was tied down with Vietnam and finally threw in the towel. Nixon had Watergate. Carter's fortunes were going downhill before Camp David. Reagan didn't bother."
 But Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was Mr. Carter's national security adviser, said Mr. Bush will have to risk his political fortunes in peace as he did in war. "American leverage in the Middle East requires the President to put himself on the line," he said. "I don't know if the Administration is ready to bite the bullet, but if they don't, the question arises: What did the war accomplish?"

The Sun Has Trouble Setting on the Soviet Empire

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
GEORGE SMILEY might have felt some sympathy for the old Soviet commissars and generals watching Americans take Iraq apart.
Like them, Le Carre's aging British spy had been reared to serve an empire, not to watch from the sidelines as old enemies made mincemeat of old allies. Smiley, to be sure, would never have let his pique show quite so blatantly as the Soviet cold warriors did, shouting in the Supreme Soviet and in their newspapers that the United States was trying to obliterate Iraq and slaughter its people to gain hegemony in the Middle East. 
 There was nothing really surprising in this behavior, especially while their military budget was being slashed, their Warsaw Pact was being trashed and the Red Army was being shooed out of Europe. It would have been more curious, in fact, if the generals and hero-workers who had spent years arming Iraq and decades fighting the cold war had taken to cheering Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf as he took out their Scuds, T-72's and MIG-29's.
The reaction of the old guard was a reminder that the habits of a superpower cannot be erased with a presidential decree and a dash of perestroika. The growls came instinctively when the adversary of 40 years unsheathed new weapons within a cannon shot of Soviet land, and an arms client of long standing came under threat from NATO.
The more intriguing question was why Mikhail S. Gorbachev decided to launch an 11th-hour mediating effort, if he knew, as Soviet satellites and analysts must have told him by early February, that a rout was imminent.
On the face of it, perhaps, the move made some sense. However reduced in strength, the Soviet Union as a major Asian power with its own restive Moslem population cannot be denied a permanent interest in the Middle East. In this case, America was poised to take out a major regional power, and Moscow's interest in averting a land war so near its borders, or at least in staking out some turf in the postwar realignment of forces, could be understood.
 
Under Fire at Home
 Mr. Gorbachev is also under pressure at home, and here he had a chance to mollify his right wing, to show that he had done what he could, as he approached a political showdown with his archrival, Boris N. Yeltsin.
If the East-West romance were still in full bloom, these explanations might have sufficed. This was Mr. Gorbachev the peacemaker and master politician at work again, and if it interfered a bit with President Bush's planned finale, it was only sporting to give Saddam Hussein a last chance to back down.
What made it different was that Iraq was the first major test of Mr. Gorbachev's foreign policy since he shifted rightward, shedding what one former ally called his liberal dilettantes for a team of hard-nosed commissars. Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the architect of "new thinking" in foreign policy who had aligned Moscow firmly behind Washington at the United Nations after Iraq invaded Kuwait, had departed in December, and the noises from the Kremlin had begun to sound harsher.
The West's reaction to the shift and its outcry over the shootings in Lithuania and Latvia seemed to sting Mr. Gorbachev to the quick. Western visitors described him in a huff over what he perceived as hasty judgment, and he complained how quick the world was to forget all he had achieved.
So when Mr. Gorbachev suddenly declared that the anti-Iraqi coalition was about to overstep its mandate and dispatched an aide, Yevgeny M. Primakov, to talk to Saddam Hussein, Western eyebrows rose. Did Mr. Gorbachev tacitly share the wounded pride of his generals? Was he reverting to old habits, maneuvering for some political advantage in a regional crisis?
The war ended too quickly for an unambiguous answer. The mass surrender of Iraqi troops, the unilateral halt of its land offensive by the coalition, the evidence of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait all took the wind out of the right-wing campaign, and Mr. Gorbachev's mediating effort became all but lost in history.
Mr. Gorbachev's spokesmen dropped peevish hints that Washington had never really considered the "Gorbachev plan," and had resolved on a ground offensive all along. But they took pains to stress that there had been no deviation from the line of East-West friendship, that the Kremlin had never wavered in its allegiance to the cause for which the coalition fought.
 
Staying the Course
 In the end, Mr. Gorbachev appeared to recognize that whatever his domestic political imperatives, he could literally not afford to abandon the course of seeking closer ties with the West. With the Soviet economy in deep crisis, there was simply no way to re-enter the debilitating arms race, nor could Moscow relinquish economic assistance from the West. The arms race, Mr. Gorbachev told critics in Minsk last week, had "exhausted our economy."
Washington and its allies, for their part, chose to declare that they had no bone to pick with Mr. Gorbachev, that they in fact appreciated his support and his efforts. Whatever they really felt, they appeared to conclude that Mr. Gorbachev was still the man to back in the Kremlin, especially since he probably had helped force Mr. Hussein to recognize the folly of resistance.
But none of the declarations from Washington or Moscow could fully conceal the pique and suspicion. If the gulf crisis opened with the romantic notion of two great superpowers teaming up to establish a new world order, it ended with the realization that mutual trust remained a brittle commodity when confronted with real wars, popular passions and old suspicions. As Mr. Gorbachev noted in Minsk, progress in United States-Soviet relations remained "very fragile," and a "great sense of responsibility" was needed to avoid destroying what was already achieved.
There were those, like Aleksei Vasilyev, an expert on Mideastern affairs, who took a pessimistic view. "After the Persian Gulf," he wrote in Komsomolskaya Pravda, "Moscow and Washington will never trust each other to the degree that cooperation in establishing a 'new world order' requires."
But Mr. Shevardnadze, the architect of that cooperation and now head of a new liberal think-tank, argued that there was no going back. "I do not think that this failed initiative caused or could cause any serious friction in Soviet-American relations, as some argue now," he said in an interview with Moscow News last week. "Our relations have moved too far, and they promise too much in the future, for something like this to darken them."

Medicare Prognosis: Unwieldy Growth Fueled by More Fees and Beneficiaries

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MEDICARE has emerged from 10 years of aggressive cost-control efforts as the fastest-growing major program in the Federal budget, and experts see little chance of slowing its growth as the elderly become more numerous and live longer while costs, led by payments to physicians, continue to rise relentlessly.
The nation's bill for Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 33 million elderly and disabled people, grew 14 percent last year, or twice as fast as Social Security, which serves a similar population. 
 Medicare outlays totaled $110 billion last year, or 9 percent of all Federal spending in 1990. By comparison, military spending accounted for 24 percent of the Federal budget.
One of the biggest factors in Medicare's increased costs has been a dramatic rise in the volume of physician services used by the average Medicare beneficiary. Critics say doctors have themselves generated some of the extra business by prescribing additional and sometimes unneeded services to compensate for cutbacks in Medicare reimbursement.
Over the last decade, Medicare outlays for inpatient hospital care grew an average of 9.9 percent a year, while spending for doctors' services rose 15 percent a year, quadrupling in 10 years. Growth in the volume of physician services completely offset the effects of a Federal law that froze Medicare physician fees from 1984 to 1986, the Congressional Budget Office found.
The growth of Medicare reflects several other trends as well:
* The elderly population grows slowly but steadily: 2 percent a year, or double the rate for the United States population as a whole. Moreover, the elderly population itself is aging, with a larger proportion consisting of people over 75 years old, who require more care than those 65 to 75.
* Doctors' fees, hospital charges, drug prices and other health-care costs have risen rapidly, outstripping the Consumer Price Index for all items.
* A cutback in one type of service, like inpatient hospital care, often produces a surge in other services, like outpatient care in clinics and doctors' offices.
Medicare covers 40 percent of all hospital patients and accounts for more than 25 percent of the average doctor's income from the practice of medicine. Two-thirds of hospitals report that they lose money treating Medicare patients. Doctors' total incomes, which averaged $155,800 in 1989, are about five times the average for all workers in the United States, just as in the early 1970's. And while the Government has moved to restrain payments to hospitals, a number of experts say the savings have been largely offset by increases in payments to doctors.
Medicare spending for doctors' services is "absolutely out of control," said Dr. Philip R. Lee, chairman of the Physician Payment Review Commission, established by Congress in 1986 to advise lawmakers on the payment of doctors under Medicare.
Dr. John M. Eisenberg, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said: "I would estimate that 10 percent of physician services are of no real value to the patient. A larger proportion of services, perhaps 20 to 25 percent, are of some small value to the patient, but it's not clear whether they are worth the cost in society's eyes."
For their part, doctors insist that Medicare payments often fail to cover their costs. To make up the difference, doctors may increase their charges to other patients and to private insurers. Doctors also complain that Medicare is crushing them with paperwork and inappropriately second-guessing their clinical judgments.
"Medicare makes it difficult for me to care for my patients," said Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, a family physician in Richmond, Tex., expressing the concern of many of her colleagues across the country. "In its efforts to control utilization and cost, Medicare denigrates the doctor-patient relationship, suggesting to my patients that I am incompetent, doing unnecessary procedures and charging too much."
The dispute underscores the broader questions being asked about Medicare among lawmakers, hospital groups and representatives of the elderly. Has Congress failed in efforts to control Medicare costs? Has the increase in spending produced a commensurate improvement in the health of Medicare beneficiaries?
Next year the Government will introduce a new method of paying doctors, with a national fee schedule meant to reduce wide disparities in the prices of specific procedures. The Government will also set overall goals for the growth of Medicare spending on physician services.
The system, mandated by a 1989 law, is not explicitly intended to save money at first, but could easily be used for that purpose in later years. Since Medicare started paying hospitals a fixed amount for each admission in 1983, the growth of Medicare spending for hospital care has slowed considerably, and a national study concluded that the quality of care did not suffer.
Other components of the Medicare program are surging. The use of diagnostic tests and procedures has increased dramatically because of new technology and equipment. In addition, many doctors perform extra tests to protect themselves against malpractice suits. Medicare payments to independent laboratories doubled in the last four years, to $1.4 billion in 1990. Payments for home health services have risen as Medicare prods hospitals to discharge patients sooner, sometimes even before they completely recuperate.
For the Government, the administrative costs of Medicare are relatively small, amounting to less than 2.5 percent of total Medicare outlays in recent years.
But doctors and hospitals say Medicare imposes a substantial administrative burden on them. After years of Congressional efforts to curb its growth, Medicare is so complex that patients, doctors and hospitals can no longer calculate how much they are entitled to receive for any service.
The complexity creates countless opportunities for doctors, hospitals, laboratories and suppliers of medical equipment to manipulate the system and maximize their reimbursement, often with the help of consultants who tell them how to do it.
Dr. Lee, who is director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco, said that many surgeons "unbundle" services, billing the Government separately for three or four procedures that should be reported and reimbursed as a single operation. A total hysterectomy, for instance, might be listed as several separate procedures, including exploration of the abdomen, removal of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, appendectomy and cutting away scar tissue in the pelvis.
Likewise, Dr. Lee said, doctors often bill Medicare for a more costly service than they actually perform. A doctor might charge $35 for an extended office visit, though entitled to only $27 for a shorter visit. Such "upcoding" is possible because doctors have wide discretion in deciding whether to classify an office visit as brief, intermediate or extended.
In a recent study of Medicare records, John F. Holahan, a health economist at the Urban Institute here, found that the number of claims for brief office visits was decreasing while claims for more expensive extended visits were increasing, with the result that Medicare payments were rising. In each medical specialty, there has been a shift toward "the highest-paying procedures," Mr. Holahan said.
Whatever strain the Federal budget experiences with the ballooning Medicare costs, the burden of medical expenses for the elderly remains. Medicare generally does not pay for outpatient prescription drugs, and it covers little of the cost of nursing home care, which averages $25,000 a year.
Households headed by an elderly person spent 12.5 percent of their after-tax income on health care in 1988, up from 7.8 percent in 1972 and 1973. As long as that trend continues, Congress will find it politically difficult to cut Medicare benefits or require any but the most affluent beneficiaries to pay more for their coverage.

For a Key to Economic Health, See the 'Help Wanted' Ads

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FOR days, there were signals that the recession might be lifting. New figures showed that factory production rose a bit in February. The war's end suggested that consumers would soon be in a spending mood again. The stock market boomed, and home sales even began to rise. But then on Friday, the Labor Department dashed these incipient hopes, announcing in effect that the recession's end was not in sight after all.
When it comes to spotting an upturn in the economy, the Labor Department's monthly employment numbers outweigh all other data. No matter how favorable the other economic indicators, a recession isn't over, most economists agree, until jobs increase -- or at least stop disappearing by the tens of thousands. And last month 208,000 jobs disappeared in the private sector, mostly because of layoffs. The unemployment rate, as a result, swelled to 6.5 percent from 6.2 percent. 
 Perhaps no forecaster has been more optimistic in recent weeks than Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache, the Wall Street investment house. He insists that the recession is on the verge of ending. Still, the February job loss jolted him. "Employment is the make-or-break number for anyone's forecast," Mr. Yardeni said, "and if you get a really bad number like February's, then you might just as well take the rest of the month off while you hope for a better figure for March."
The economics that make the job figures so important are simple enough. If jobs are disappearing and incomes with them, then people cannot afford the spending that reawakens an economy. Not only have 1.2 million private-sector jobs disappeared since last August, but with them more than $52 billion in wages and salaries. If that money had been earned and spent instead, the recession might never have occurred.
Somehow, the spending has to resume for the recession to end. Maybe a few million consumers will dig reluctantly into savings to replace a dilapidated car or an old suit or to take a long-delayed vacation. Or maybe foreigners can be talked into importing much more of the output of American factories than they already buy.
 
Still in the Woods
 Only then might demand be sufficient to justify hiring again at retail stores, auto showrooms, restaurants, appliance outlets and, above all, factories. The rehired workers, in turn, would use their wages to multiply spending, and the recession would end.
"Until you see the employment upturn, you don't know you're out of the woods," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist.
Some economists already see signs of enough sales to get hiring going again. Sales of American-made cars, for example, have reportedly risen in recent weeks to the point that cars are being sold faster than they are being manufactured. If such sales hold up, car manufacturers will soon have to increase production to satisfy the new demand, rehiring enough people to assemble the extra cars.
The manufacturers will not be able to wait because auto dealers have no big inventories to draw on. Neither, for that matter, do clothing stores or appliance dealers or numerous other businesses. For many economists, the unusually small inventory backlog in this recession justifies optimism that the upturn can come quickly -- if people would only be willing to buy again.
"You can't have an economic upturn until jobs increase, but powerful forces are in place to bring about the turnaround," said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "The main one is the low level of inventories."
Whatever the forces, the rehiring has not yet materialized. Quite the contrary, 125,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared last month and for those who were left on the job, the number of hours worked each week declined. The Labor Department data painted similar pictures for retailers, wholesalers, airlines and the trucking, banking, real estate and finance industries. Only health care, government and food processing showed much job growth, the latter apparently to meet the needs of American forces in the Persian Gulf, said Thomas Plewes, an associate commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Another troubling statistic also surfaced on Friday. Usually, about 5 million Americans hold part-time jobs but would prefer to work full-time, if they could get such a job -- a preference that adds them in a fashion to the unemployment rolls. Their numbers rose to 5.5 million from last summer through January, and then in February alone the number leaped to 6 million. Economists wondered if so huge a one-month jump was a statistical error, but Mr. Plewes said that the number of "involuntary part-timers" has jumped similarly in the past.
The 6 million figure was projected from the Labor Department's February survey of 60,000 households. "Part-timers who really want to work full-time often take a while to admit this to us," Mr. Plewes said.
Still, as gloomy as the February numbers are, they might be out of date. For one thing, the data were gathered during the week of Feb. 12, before the gulf war ended, and consumers perhaps became more willing to spend. For another, recessions end when output -- at factories, stores, restaurants, even law firms -- rises, and that can sometimes happen without raising employment levels, said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard University labor economist.
An auto manufacturer, for example, might increase efficiency by replacing two assembly-line workers with an engineer or a computer specialist. National income might rise, or at least not fall, because the engineer might be paid as much as the two line workers combined.
Some of this occurred in the 1980's and also in the current recession, as hundreds of companies became more efficient. And with this in mind, many forecasters said they would have declared the recession near an end last Friday if no more than 100,000 jobs had disappeared. Instead, 208,000 were lost in the private sector, and there was a net loss of 185,000 when the rise in government employment is included.
 "The bottom line for the economy is income, and that still means jobs and hiring," Mr. Plewes said.

HEADLINE: Oil Profits Made the Mideast a Weapons Bazaar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In 1961, Iraq claimed Kuwait and mobilized on its border. Iraq stopped when the British flew in about 5,000 troops. Thirty years later, it took half a million and huge devastation. 
 The difference was in massive oil revenues, which gave Iraq the cash and credit to invest in armaments with which to seek two great oil revenue prizes: first Iran, then Kuwait.
About $3 trillion (at 1991 prices) have flowed to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries since their cartel took off in 1971, following the Teheran "agreements" for which our State Department rightly claimed credit. And it is clear from the remarks of Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, to Leonard Silk (Economic Scene column, March 1) that they still have no idea that high oil prices resulted not from some vague political acts, but from a group of nations forming the mother of all cartels.
These nations, like good managers and good soldiers, knew how to seize opportunities, some of which they created. But their aim was and is simple: maximum wealth. Much of that wealth will go into arms, however we try to "regulate" the traffic.
Letting the price find a competitive level, which would be less than half the current level, would be in our political as well as economic interest. At the very least, we should be firm to reject any attempt to shore up the price or any policy that would have that effect. We might also reflect that a gasoline tax would in large measure fall not on consumers, but on the producing countries. That they hate such taxes shows they understand the market.

HEADLINE: Capital Games

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign to lower the capital-gains tax has clung to many rationales. The tax cut, its supporters have claimed, would lower the Federal deficit, spur investment and growth and energize venture capitalists. Yet all these ration-ales are unproven, and it's plain, even from the fine print of White House testimony, that many of these claims are wildly exaggerated.
Now there is a new rationale floating around Washington. Why cut the capital-gains tax? To save the banks! The idea is that the tax cut would prompt real estate values to rise, and that, in turn, would pump up collateral for many bank loans. 
 This claim is even more pathetic than the other rationales. It makes about as much sense as attacking Scud missiles in Iraq by carpet bombing the entire Middle East. A sweeping tax cut would provide troubled banks with only a little relief, and then only at the risk of wrecking the tax code and damaging the economy.
 Proof that the President's tax-cut proposal wouldn't help the economy very much lurks in the White House's own estimates: the deficit would fall by about $11 billion and economic production would rise by about $60 billion over five years. These numbers, though exaggerated, are nevertheless insubstantial. During the same five years, the economy is expected to generate $30 trillion of output and $5 trillion in Federal taxes.
Neither would the tax cut do much for the banks, which do not directly invest in real estate. True, real estate values would rise a bit, so fewer developers would default. And loans that did sour would have higher salvage value. But this relief would be indirect and limited. Indeed, all the proposal would accomplish for the banks is to drive up the value of real estate by the amount of the tax cut. In essence, Mr. Bush would transfer to developers money from taxpayers, who would have to make up the revenue losses.
Other approaches, more carefully targeted, would help banks far more than indiscriminately showering billions in windfall profits on wealthy investors. Congress can start by adopting the bank reforms recently proposed by the Treasury. They include permitting banks to create branches across state lines and enter the insurance, mutual funds and securities industries. If Congress decided a quicker boost was needed, it could grant a temporary tax break to banks.
Here's an even better idea: Pay interest to banks on the funds they are required to deposit with the Federal Reserve System. That could pump about $3 billion into the banks, enough to offset recent hikes in premiums they must pay on insured deposits. The $3 billion would come out of the profit that the Fed returns to the Treasury each year -- a modest drain, especially if the interest payments were made only until the banks recovered.
If Congress chooses instead to cut the tax on capital gains, it will resurrect the wasteful, corrosive tax shelters that were killed off by the 1986 tax reform. The half-empty office buildings and shopping centers that dot the Southwest stand as monuments to the old law that created private profit out of social waste.
This newest entry in the parade of justifications for the tax cut is even less credible than its predecessors. Mr. Bush's obsessive campaign deserves a burial, this time for good.

Pay Cut

 BODY:
Public interest in Michael Milken, the king of junk bonds, has focused on how long a sentence he would be ordered to serve. Originally, it was 10 years, and the sentencing judge later recommended that he be paroled after three years. Now that he has begun serving his time, at the Federal Correctional Institution in Pleasanton, Calif., attention turns to another way of measuring the transformation of his life.
Mr. Milken was the highest-paid financier in history. Between 1983 and 1987 he made $1.1 billion from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. plus income from other investments. 
 His earnings exceeded those of many corporations and the gross domestic product of some third world countries. In 1987 alone, he made $550 million. That comes to $275,000 per hour.
Mr. Milken is about to start a different job. Depending on whether he is assigned to be an electrician, cook or other job, the hourly pay of Federal prisoner 16126-054 will now be, at most, 40 cents.

HEADLINE: The Struggle Within

BYLINE: By Judith Miller; Judith Miller is a Times correspondent and the author, with Laurie Mylroie, of "Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf."

 BODY:
Mohammed glared at the depressingly familiar mustachioed face that filled the screen. The giant television occupied a place of honor inside his vast Bedouin-style tent, complete with satellite TV receiver and crystal chandeliers.
Within the permanently pitched structure next to the house in a suburb of Riyadh, enclosed by walls assuring privacy, Mohammed and his young friends were sprawled on the Oriental carpets, leaning against replicas of camel saddles covered with sheepskin throws, sipping sweet tea -- and arguing. 
 "The Americans should never have been invited here," declared Abdul Rahman, drawing quickly on his Marlboro. "We've become an occupied country."
"Would you prefer to have been occupied by Saddam Hussein?" snapped Mohammed, gesturing in disgust at the screen.
"Why was that our only choice?" said Abdul Rahman. "What happened to the billions and billions we spent on defense?"
Mohammed ignored the question. "Saddam Hussein is a monster," he replied. Mohammed knew that firsthand. Soon after Iraq's invasion, he had driven into Kuwait to rescue his sister, who was married to a Kuwaiti. Their uncle had been recovering from heart surgery in a Kuwaiti hospital when Iraqi troops rolled across the tiny sheikdom. Soldiers had burst into the hospital and severed his life-support lines. Then they shot him in the head.
"Saddam," Mohammed said, almost as a curse. "We would have been next. We had no choice."
Abdulaziz, who had been silent, spoke up. "I hate Saddam Hussein," he said. "He's ruined the hunting season." He was not joking.
 THERE IS NO SINGLE response to the Persian Gulf war in Saudi Arabia. But on one point Saudis agree: the cataclysmic event has turned this devout, puritanical and deeply conservative society topsy-turvy.
The tranquillity of the desert skies has been shattered by screeching jet fighters and C-130 supply planes. Business and leisure are disrupted. In their place is a rare and unsettling spontaneity. The argument inside Mohammed's tent in January would never have occurred had it not been for Saddam Hussein -- and surely never in front of a foreigner, an infidel and a woman.
Not since the kingdom discovered oil in 1938, six years after its unification under the young and ambitious King Abdel Aziz ibn Saud, has there been such ferment in the house of Saud. Saudis at all levels of sophistication and wealth are passionately debating their future. Almost everyone accepts the rule of the Saud family and the notion that the country should be strictly governed by the laws of Islam. But for the first time, there are public, and growing, demands for increased participation in decision-making and for greater accountability, if not Western-style democracy. People want to see more of, and hear more from, their reclusive King. They want him to end the corruption around him. They want greater access to him and greater responsiveness from him.
Many Westernized liberal Saudis -- known as the technocrats -- are also fed up with the restraints on public discussion and the press. They are demanding, also for the first time, an end to censorship. They want the right to organize politically and socially. They want the right to debate publicly without fear of being ostracized or stigmatized by the dreaded appellation "kafir," nonbeliever.
These educated young Saudis -- the country's seven major universities graduate thousands of men and women every year -- are restless, underemployed. There are too few jobs, with the lack of opportunity most acute for women. The crisis in the gulf last fall spawned a messy and much publicized demonstration by women, who dumped their chauffeurs and drove in convoy, defying an informal ban on driving by women. The incident prompted a vicious campaign against them by religious fanatics, with Government acquiescence.
Underlying these strains is the question of how much power the religious establishment should have, particularly the religious police, or mutawwa. The rank and file of these guardians of moral virtue are drawn both from older salaried men and young fanatical volunteers whom the Government wants to monitor. They patrol the streets and shopping malls, telling women to cover their faces and young men to pray.
Longstanding tension between religious radicals and liberal reformers has traditionally been mediated by the King. But the war has polarized the two sides, and many Saudis anticipate a fierce, even violent, clash.
Still, Saudis are euphoric about their new ability to discuss these issues more or less publicly. Many declare that the debate itself signals liberalization. The expression "baad al azimah" -- after the crisis -- has been on people's lips since the war began.
But a few are pessimistic. "After the crisis, this Government will have to respond -- either by opening up or cracking down," said Kiren Chaudhry, an expert on Saudi Arabia who teaches political science at the University of California at Berkeley. "I suspect they'll crack down."
 THE WAR IS THE SECOND profound event in the short history of the current kingdom. The first was its breathtaking transformation in less than three decades from a primitive land -- mud huts, no roads, slavery -- into a technologically advanced society.
This is the third kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The first Saudi state emerged in the late 18th century, drawing its enduring legitimacy from a partnership of religious and political forces.
Mohammed bin Abdul Wahhab, the strict and literal-minded teacher of Islam, and Mohammed bin Saud banded together to spread Islam and Saudi political power. But in 1818 the first state and its capital, Diriyah, were destroyed by Egypt at the urging of jealous Ottomans. The second state, a turbulent series of efforts by competing Saudi princes in central Arabia, culminated in civil war that ended in the 1890's with the temporary displacement of the house of Saud by a clan in northern Arabia. The modern kingdom, less than 60 years old, is again the product of political ambition and religious fervor, with a difference -- oil.
Oil had not been discovered in 1902 when Abdel Aziz ibn Saud set out from exile and impoverishment in Kuwait to reconquer his country. The Nejd, the modern-day conservative heartland, was still controlled by the rival clan; the north was the preserve of nomadic tribes; the east and the west were under Ottoman control. By 1932, he had unified these into one enormous kingdom a third the size of the continental United States.
Then, less than a decade later, the Sauds became the political guardians of a quarter of the world's oil reserves. Suddenly the house of Saud held the key to almost unimaginable wealth. Seemingly overnight God had played a trick on the more numerous, more cultured, more sophisticated Arabs in Damascus and Cairo. He had placed these enormous resources in the land of the relatively few and ostensibly more primitive Saudis. No longer were they merely the custodians of Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina -- and the grateful recipients of charity from Egypt and other Arab states that helped finance the annual pilgrimages. The Sauds had become, in fact, the custodians of three mosques -- the most envied being the Saudi treasury. Their neighbors would hate them for it.
It was oil that paid for the modern state: the world's most advanced highway and telecommunications systems; spectacular public architecture; vast and lush gardens, including more than a million date palm trees in Riyadh alone. And gratitude to the Sauds lingers. Saudis recall with no nostalgia conditions a mere 30 years ago: 120-degree days without air-conditioning; never eating at a table with knife and fork; leaky mud-brick houses; the goats, sheep, snakes and spiders that shared those houses. Some even remember hunger.
"This society is obnoxiously, knee-jerk status quo because, after all, it made us rich," one Saudi professional observed.
Some Saudis today denigrate these achievements. "Any idiot could have developed the country with some $564 billion to spend," said one Saudi professional. They stress instead what many regard as the Sauds' true genius -- the family's ability to maintain stability by balancing competing forces, by paying off and playing off rivals, by rewarding friends generously and bribing enemies, also generously. "Toe the line and we'll make you rich," is how one young Saudi businessman put it. In domestic and foreign policy, what is now derided by many intellectuals as "riyal politik" (for the national currency) worked brilliantly for years.
Unlike its neighbors, Saudi Arabia did not succumb to the seductive, secular and ultimately tyrannical ideologies that gripped the region in the 1950's and 60's -- Baathism in Iraq and Syria, the various Arab nationalisms spawned by Gamal Abdel Nasser from Egypt. Because it carefully pitted its military factions against one another, Saudi Arabia did not become a military dictatorship. The price was to be dependence on foreign military rescue in a crisis.
"Saudi stability is anchored positively by the Government's ability to insure prosperity and security," said Abdulaziz H. Fahad, a Saudi lawyer who writes about Saudi political life, "and negatively by a lack of encouraging alternatives." These pillars, coupled with Saudi Arabia's guardianship of what is widely viewed as pure Islam, have been responsible for the country's remarkable steadfastness in the face of modernization.
Yet even before the gulf crisis, the foundations were under attack. Young fanatics were criticizing the puritanical leadership of the Government-appointed religious hierarchy as insufficiently pious. In sermons from mosques and in cassette-recorded homilies, these extremists attacked the Government as corrupt in a way that no other political force dared do.
The collapse of oil prices in the 1980's and the recession that followed meant that there were fewer large contracts with which to buy the loyalty of the business community. Many of its American-educated "modernists" were both terrified by the religious extremists and angered by the monopolization of a declining pool of business by certain princes.
When Iraq invaded Kuwait, defying Saudi mediation and most political calculations, the kingdom's stability was threatened. Suddenly everyone -- from religious fanatics to the merchant class to those who desired a stronger military -- was demanding changes in the Saudi system. The debate about the kingdom's future, and its stewardship, had begun.
 CALLS FOR GREATER PARTICIPATION IN decision-making were the first and most obvious political effect of the crisis. The Government responded predictably. In a speech in October, King Fahd promised, almost apologetically, that he would create a majlis al shura, or consultative council, that would compensate for weaknesses in the system and previous unresponsiveness.
This majlis would be a formal national body, unlike the traditional majlises held by members of the royal family in their homes several times a week. These are forums for age-old popular grievances -- disputes about land, blood feuds, requests for financial or political help -- and their shortcomings have long been acknowledged. It would be lese majesty for a citizen to broach the state of the economy, the need for political liberalization, corruption among the elite or other delicate subjects within the kingdom.
King Fahd's pledge was familiar. When Abdel Aziz proclaimed the kingdom in 1932, he established a shura, which technically still exists though it is inactive. Every Saudi king has reiterated the goal. In 1982, King Fahd said a council would be established "soon." In December 1984, he told The Sunday Times of London that the council would be formed within three months.
"King Fahd seems prone to bouts of amnesia when it comes to promises of political reform," said one Saudi businessman.
Such skepticism is fed by the repression of the official press. Even the most anti-Western Saudis rely on the BBC or Voice of America, never the Saudi press, which has no credibility.
The contrast between what Saudis know and what they can read in their newspapers and magazines or see on their two television channels has been sharpened by the arrival of CNN. For between $20,000 and $25,000, well-connected Saudis can affix satellite dishes to their roofs and get the news the rest of the world is watching. At night, ministers, Government officials and Saudi businessmen congregate to follow the latest developments in the region.
The war has highlighted the failings of the local media. For three days after Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, the Saudi press contained nothing about the event -- silence that triggered panic within the kingdom. "Then the King figured out where he stood and invited foreign forces and, bam, there was instant glasnost -- Saudi-style, of course," one Western diplomat said.
Though few visas have ordinarily been issued to journalists, the Government gave out more than 1,500 after the invasion.
Suddenly, the Saudi press reverberated with diatribes against Saddam Hussein, whom the kingdom and the rest of the gulf had ardently supported during the Iran-Iraq war and only days before the invasion of Kuwait. Saddam Hussein was a monster. Full stop. Baathism was a bankrupt ideology. Period. The Arab world was appalled by what was taking place in Kuwait.
Every part of the Saudi news media did its share to reeducate public opinion. In September, Sayidaty, a women's magazine that usually features cheerful stories about family life, ran a harrowing account of a Sudanese woman's rape by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait. The English-language Arab News published excerpts from the U.S. State Department's 1989 report on the status of human rights in Iraq. Publishing a document so critical of an Arab state's internal affairs would have been unthinkable before the crisis.
But the freedom given the Saudi press has not been extended to domestic matters. No Saudi newspaper, for example, would dare publish the American Government's human rights report on Saudi Arabia. And there have been many great gaps in coverage that have invited scorn in Riyadh. Saudi newspapers, for example, waited a full day to report that Tel Aviv had been hit by Iraqi Scud missiles in the early days of the war.
"Although there was no official comment on the attack, we wrote two editorials about it," said Turki al-Sedairi, the chief editor of Al Riyadh, one of the kingdom's largest Arabic daily newspapers.
Neither his paper nor the other Saudi dailies covered the women's driving protest. 'We feel it is our duty to lessen the gap between opposing trends in this society," Sedairi said, "not to aggravate it through our coverage." Saudi Arabia, he stressed, wanted to avoid the clashes between modernizers and fundamentalists that have gripped Tunisia and other countries in North Africa. "We don't treat news just as news, but in a social context."
Despite such comments, Sedairi is no apologist for the Saudi Government. He was once dismissed from his present job by the late King Khalid for a scathing attack on the Ministry of Information, which he called little more than a "Ministry of Denial." A few months later, he was forgiven and reinstated, once again through a royal order.
The editor's fortunes show how sensitive the Saudi Government is to everything published or broadcast. That sensitivity starts at the top.
A portrait of King Fahd reading Al Riyadh hangs over Sedairi's desk. And, in fact, the King does read the paper -- every word of it. "He's a real addict," Sedairi said. "He doesn't call up, but when he's displeased, we know about it."
What Sedairi did not say was that King Fahd is the country's chief censor. It was he who quietly decreed that no senior Government officials would speak about the crisis without his personal approval. He personally barred reporters and editors who work directly for the Ministry of Information -- like radio and television journalists -- from granting interviews to the foreign press. He ordered the news blackout on the Kuwaiti invasion.
"When he was a minister, and even when he was Crown Prince," a Saudi official said of King Fahd, "he used to surround himself with a fairly wide circle of intellectuals, writers and foreigners. But now he meets with almost no one. And he's become enormously sensitive to even a hint of criticism."
 SINCE THERE IS NO free press or consultative council, Saudis can only complain among themselves. That means that Riyadh is drowning in rumors -- some true, many false, all widely believed. One of the chief complaints these days is about corruption.
"There really is no petty bribery or corruption in this country, as there is in Egypt and other Arab states," said one Saudi businessman who travels widely. "Here, it's at the top."
Consider gas masks. The capital was in near turmoil when, despite weeks of advertisement, the gas masks ordered by the Civil Defense Directorate failed to arrive. After the first attack of Scud missiles against the capital, thousands of Saudis and foreign workers scrambled for masks, but the 70 local distribution points had been given just a few hundred each. Only later did an explanation begin to trickle out in Riyadh.
Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the son of the Minister of Interior, had been awarded a noncompetitive contract to import the masks, a well-connected Saudi businessman said. After war erupted and insurance rates skyrocketed, the contract became less profitable; the Prince told authorities that he could not afford the higher rates. Four weeks into the war, there was still a gas-mask shortage in Riyadh. Neither Prince Mohammed nor the Civil Defense Directorate would be interviewed for this article.
Gas masks are not the only windfall contract of the gulf crisis. Television has proved to be another lucrative source of princely income to those with what is known as "Vitamin O" -- for the Arabic word "wasta," or influence, which begins with a letter that resembles an "o."
One beneficiary is a production company called ARA International, owned by Khaled Al-Ibrahim, one of the King's brothers-in-law. ARA is richly rewarded to produce slavishly laudatory mini-films and songs for the kingdom. One Saudi businessman said the King himself occasionally assisted in the final editing.
The commission issue is a longstanding one in Saudi Arabia. The King and his younger brother, Prince Sultan, who is the Defense Minister, are among the principal recipients. This bestowal of enormous sums enrages many Saudis, who maintain that control of the Saudi treasury and the stipends given every prince by the royal court are more than enough for the royal family. Many senior members of the family are said to oppose these commissions. Among them are Prince Salman, the Governor of Riyadh, and his son, Prince Abdulaziz, both of whom enjoy a reputation for financial probity.
Prince Salman, who refused to be interviewed, is said to have fierce integrity, tinged with a temper that he has occasionally displayed publicly before princes and wealthy Saudis. When a Saudi businessman was said to have provided drugs to a high-ranking young prince, Prince Salman summoned the businessman to his majlis and beat him. When the same businessman, a Palestinian by birth, lost several million dollars in a much-publicized gambling binge in Monte Carlo at the beginning of the gulf crisis, Prince Salman seized his passport, effectively barring him from leaving the kingdom.
Earlier this winter, Prince Salman had a young prince named Bader publicly flogged for getting into a fistfight with members of the religious police who had supposedly harassed his female relative at a downtown shopping center.
But such men are the exceptions in the Saudi system. Most princes, unable or unwilling to live on their stipends, supplement their incomes with huge commissions from foreign companies that do business in the country. The system, which is as Saudi as sand, is nonetheless increasingly resented by many of the technocrats.
 WHILE CORRUPTION IS widely seen as a problem whose solution lies with the country's political leadership, other issues seem beyond the Government's ability to solve by edict or example.
Among the most difficult is the subservient and totally segregated role of women. While the Government, including the King, is known to support more freedom for Saudi women, the response to the women's protest over driving illustrates the lengths to which the Government is willing to go to accommodate the religious conservatives.
Some Saudis -- men and women -- were deeply impressed by the women's tiny rebellion. The only people with spine in this society were the 47 women who drove, one Saudi intellectual said. "And look at what happened to them. They were thrown to the wolves." The Government, in fact, punished them as severely as it would any public protesters. Virtually all of those who taught at one university were dismissed by order of the King. The women, as well as their husbands and even some of their other relatives, were forbidden to leave the kingdom, a particularly harsh measure in the mobile Saudi society. They were ordered not to meet with Western reporters or to discuss their situation with any outsider, and they were warned of further reprisals if they attempted to drive again or stage any other demonstration.
But the Government's abuse of these women was mild compared with their treatment by the religious establishment, particularly the Islamic extremists who have increasingly challenged the Government-dominated religious hierarchy.
Before the women were dismissed or harassed by the Government, the fundamentalist sheiks denounced them from one of the kingdom's most powerful political platforms, the mosque pulpits. In the Friday sermons after the protest, the women were branded as "red communists," "dirty American secularists," "whores and prostitutes," "fallen women" and "advocates of vice." Their names, occupations, addresses and phone numbers were, in violation of traditional Saudi insistence on "protecting" women, distributed in leaflets around mosques and other public places. One leaflet accused them of having renounced Islam, an offense punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Another called upon "every Muslim to cut out the roots of this evil plant before it spreads to every part of our holy land."
Several of the women who met with me, despite the ban on such contacts, said they had feared for their safety and that of their families.
Soon after the protest, Sheik Abdulaziz bin Baz, the head of the Council of the Higher Ulema, Islamic scholars who are the Government's religious authority, issued a fatwa, or religious decree, forbidding women from driving for the time being.
"I was, of course, disappointed in the decree," one of the women said. "But I was more disappointed that the King did so little for us. And even more disappointed in some of our friends."
Many of those who initially voiced support abruptly shunned the women after it became clear that they would be punished. The modernizers and technocrats, who would have been natural allies in this struggle, were silent. The leaflets circulated against the women also attacked modernizers and liberals as "dirty secularists."
Three months after the crisis, a strong self-serving consensus developed in Riyadh that the women had not only acted inappropriately, they had done immeasurable harm to the cause, at least in the short-run. "I support women driving," said Ahmed Al-Tuwaigeri, dean of the College of Education at King Saud University, "but their timing and their methods were counterproductive."
Several of the women have remained unrepentant, convinced that eventually the issue of their status will be addressed. "The issue is not driving," one of them said. "It is that here in Saudi Arabia, I exist as a person from the bellybutton to the knees."

TRADITIONALLY, THE Government, especially the King, pioneered daring social changes that were essential for modernizing the country.
In the late 1940's, King Abdel Aziz introduced radio, over loud objections from the religious establishment. In 1959, his son, Faisal, permitted education for girls, and he sent troops to protect the television station in 1965 when it was besieged by a tiny band of religious extremists. His nephew was killed in the ensuing clash.
Religious opposition to change is a fact of life in Saudi Arabia. "There was a fatwa against radio, a fatwa against television," one Saudi intellectual said. "This country is littered with fatwas that the Government has disregarded when the interests of the kingdom were at stake. What has weakened is the King's determination to promote change in the society."
At the beginning of the war, some Saudis hoped King Fahd would use the occasion to enhance employment prospects for women and shed some of the restraints on their mobility and independence. After all, the kingdom was threatened. The crisis had highlighted to the six million to eight million Saudi Arabians (the Government insists that there are at least 13 million, but experts say this is a gross overestimate) the risk of their dependence on more than four million foreign workers. Many of the foreign workers tried to leave shortly after the invasion and had to be induced to stay through large bonuses.
The wisdom of barring Saudi women from vast sectors of the work force was widely discussed last fall after the crisis began. It would have been natural, many of the Saudi modernists argued, for the King to have permitted women doctors and other female medical personnel to drive to their jobs to assist Saudi soldiers and others in need.
But King Fahd did not do so. Many technocrats and diplomats note that the paralysis is typical, that unlike his predecessors he has almost never been willing to challenge religious forces.
Some Saudis attribute the King's reticence to his personal life. The dynamic founder of the Saudi state, King Abdel Aziz, and Fahd's more recent precedessors were deeply austere and pious rulers above moral suspicion. King Fahd, by contrast, had a well-documented reputation in his younger years as a gambler and rake. Although a new Fahd has emerged since he became King eight years ago, a sober (and thinner) ruler who has relinquished his indolent ways and a taste for the good life, some Saudis believe he is unwilling to challenge the religious extremists because he feels vulnerable and must constantly prove his piety and Islamic credentials.
Others say the issue is temperament. This King is somewhat lazy, they maintain, and avoids potentially bruising confrontations.
There are those who ardently contest these explanations. It was this King, they argue, who had the courage to risk Saudi and Arab scorn by inviting the infidel Americans into the kingdom to protect it. It was Fahd, they argue, who abandoned the self-deluding mythologies and empty rhetoric of Arab solidarity in the face of new realities imposed by Saddam Hussein. And it was he who insisted that Saudi Arabia's friends and supporters stand up and be counted as part of a new Arab order, a more sober and pragmatic order in which Riyadh would be a major factor.
These Saudis see a shrewd calculation in his decision to abandon the women to Islamic radicals and not to press for jolting changes at this time. When King Fahd's predecessors imposed change, said Fahd A. Al-Semmari, a history professor at Imam Mohammed ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, they knew that a majority of the country supported them. This was not the case with women driving. "It's the opposite today," he asserted. "A minority favors it and most still oppose."
And some see an urgent pragmatism. "The King could not take the women's side because of the war," said one well-respected analyst of Islamic politics in the kingdom. "He needed the support of the sheiks and muftis -- all of them, especially the extremists -- for the war and Saudi Arabia's stance."
Another Saudi professor agreed: "It was a political compromise, pure and simple. The religious opposition opposed both the foreign troops and the women's driving. He gave them one, and demanded acquiescence, if not outright support on the other. And he got it."
Some evidence supports the theory that there was such an implicit deal. The pamphlets and cassettes attacking the foreign troops that circulated last fall have all but disappeared. The Friday sermons at fundamentalist mosques have recently dealt with subjects other than the war. And when Sheik bin Baz issued his controversial fatwa in January authorizing a holy war against Saddam Hussein and blessing all those -- including non-Muslim foreign forces -- who helped Saudi Arabia in this crisis, the fundamentalist preachers remained silent.
Some of the extremists, however, interpreted the trade-off as a sign of weakness by the Government. After the women's driving incident, the religious police outraged liberals and modernizers by a series of well-publicized raids on the compounds of rich and politically well-connected Saudis. In one of these highly unusual raids, the King's translator was arrested and detained in prison for attending a party at which alcohol was consumed and single women were present.
The Government responded by appointing a new head of the mutawwa, known for his pliability. He quickly signaled that such raids would end. In an interview with Okaz, an Arabic daily newspaper, he argued that the role of his organization was not only to urge prayer but also to set a good example by praying.
 THE FUNDAMENTALISTS terrify many Saudis, including some in the royal family. Who are these people that can spread such fear and paralyze a King? And what is their source of power?
Though their spokesmen number fewer than a dozen and tend to be young -- most are under 35 -- their names have become well known in Saudi households. Their pulpits are the public mosques or college classrooms, through which they have organized a devout and devoted following.
Some of the religious establishment dismiss them. The extremists are "a tiny minority," said a senior Government-appointed religious official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
"This Government and the society at large adhere to Islamic principles," he said. "We never abandoned Islam, so there is no need to 'return' to it as there is in other societies."
But others disagree. They believe that the fundamentalists are gaining strength, fueled by the double standards and hypocrisy that infuriate many Saudi liberals. Much of what is officially "haram," or forbidden, to the less influential Saudis is readily available to the rich and well-connected. Alcohol, for example, is banned, but a good bottle of Scotch, smuggled through Yemen and foreign embassies, can easily be purchased for $240 a bottle on the black market. So while raiding the houses of the rich and famous was unpopular among liberals, many ordinary citizens, subject to intense scrutiny by the religious police for minor offenses, felt it was long overdue.
The extremists have also been fueled by resentment over the growing maldistribution of wealth. While almost no Saudi goes hungry or wants for the necessities of life, the gap between the princes and their commission-bolstered incomes and the salaried Saudi has bred envy that is often fodder for extremist forces.
To some extent, the problem is perception. "This is a very large family, and I know princes who have a hard time paying the rent," said Prince Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki, president of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu and one of the younger generation of princes respected for his modest life style and hard work. But flamboyance and ostentation are more typical among the kingdom's 5,000 princes and princesses. And while their proliferation is viewed as a source of stability, it is also a growing problem for the kingdom.
 A SIMPLER EXPLANATION for King's Fahd's unwillingness to confront the extremists -- who are, in effect, challenging his rule -- is that the legitimacy of the royal family has always rested on Islam.
All public debates in the kingdom are contained in an exclusively Islamic context; Islam is, in fact, the only vehicle for political opposition. Criticism in the name of Islam cannot be silenced and must be rebutted in the same terms, a confrontation that is usually stacked against the modernizers.
The Sauds' reluctance to crack down on the fundamentalists also reflects their general attitude toward dissent. Unlike most other Arab regimes, the Saudis are extremely hesitant to resort to force. While Saudi Arabia is no paradise for free political discourse, neither is it a police state.
The lavish subsidies that the Government has bestowed on the Saudi citizenry are a reflection of the desire to preempt confrontation. In any other society this would be a time of national sacrifice, with imposition of a draft for the army and taxes to finance the enormous cost of battle. Instead, the war became an occasion for the Saudi Government to forgive two years of debt repayment on housing loans, to slash domestic air fares and to increase the subsidy on grain, a gift to the Bedouins. Such largesse was all the more remarkable since the war had depleted the kingdom's treasury; these gifts would be financed by foreign borrowing.
 IT IS SAUDI ARABIA'S great and good fortune -- America's as well -- that Saddam Hussein is not a patient man. Had he waited five more years to seize Kuwait and fulfill his grandiose ambitions, his arsenal would have been far deadlier and the Saudis still woefully unprepared.
Saudi Arabia is likely to emerge from the crisis with a more aggressive foreign policy, as Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Washington's effective Ambassador, has long advocated. While the Saudis are unlikely to abandon their penchant for buying off trouble, from now on there may be no alternative but to pursue Saudi interests more openly and to help those who stood with the kingdom in time of need. The Saudis, not just the Americans, fought bravely and with a success that astonished them.
"We are certain to have a better appreciation of who our friends are," said Prince Abdullah of the Royal Commission.
"What happened to us is rather simple," said Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman bin Saud, at the age of 30 a senior consultant at the Ministry of Petroleum. "You have a neighbor, a longtime friend. And one day another neighbor comes to his home, rapes his wife, kills his children for trying to resist, ransacks his house and occupies it and declares it his own. Your neighbor and friend cries out for your help. What do you do?
"There is only one answer. Yes or no. Not maybe, or not in this fashion, or I'll consider if you do the following 10 things. Just yes or no. I'll help or I won't."
But in terms of domestic policy, things for Saudi Arabia will not be as clear. To continue modernizing the kingdom, the King will eventually have to challenge the Islamic extremists, most diplomats and liberals agree. To do so, he will need the support of the technocrats, who do not enjoy the organizational base of the mosques.
Because of its extreme sensitivity toward any public debate on any contentious issue, the Government has undermined its natural allies in this impending power struggle. The technocrats are frightened. So despite official American certainty that a crackdown on religious extremism is likely after the war, many people fear that King Fahd will shrink from such a confrontation.
The outcome of the gulf war is likely to strengthen the King's position. Had the conflict been long, bloody or indecisive, Fahd would have been weakened. Saudi xenophobia would have reasserted itself; the fundamentalists would have been emboldened.
But the war was short, relatively bloodless for the allies, and the victory decisive. The King's judgment to invite the Americans into Arabia was vindicated. So King Fahd, having triumphed over the greatest external challenge to his sovereignty thus far, is now in a strong position to confront the dangerous internal opponents of his system's own creation. The question is: Will he choose to do so?

An article in The Times Magazine today about Britain's role in the Persian Gulf war says that after the war began, British authorities put 34 Arabs in a war-prisoner camp because of their military status, and put other Arabs in prisons in Yorkshire and London. On Wednesday, after the magazine went to press, Britain freed 32 Iraqi men who were held in the camp. On Friday Britain said it would drop all actions against 33 other Arabs it had sought to deport as possible threats to domestic security.

HEADLINE: Power Skating

BYLINE: By Jared Lubarsky; Jared Lubarsky is an American journalist based in Tokyo.

 BODY:
You don't have to know much about figure skating to know that something special is happening when Midori Ito executes a triple Axel. Skimming -- sprinting -- across the rink at 20 miles an hour, she pushes off with her left foot, leaps clear of the ice, spins three and a half times in midair and lands on her right foot, skating backward. The crowds roar. Rival coaches shake their heads. The triple Axel, named after Axel Paulsen, a Norwegian skater from the early 1900's, is one of the most difficult jumps rated by the International Skating Union. In 1988 Ito became the first woman to perform it successfully in international competition.
In fact, until recently, Ito -- the 1989 world champion and Japan's best hope for a gold medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics -- was the only woman to have landed the jump in competition. She last executed the triple Axel in January at the All-Japan Figure Skating Championships in Yokohama, which she won, to nobody's surprise. Then, last month, at the United States Figure Skating Championships in Minneapolis, Tonya Harding duplicated the feat, won the women's title and instantly became Ito's most formidable rival. Barring an unforeseen mishap, both women will compete at the World Figure Skating Championships this week in Munich, Germany. (For a moment in mid-February, there were doubts that Ito, who underwent surgery a few weeks earlier on her jaw, would make the trip.) 
 To watch Ito in action is to realize that she is in a category all her own, notwithstanding the challenge from Harding. For one thing, she doesn't even look like other figure skaters. She is just 4 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 98 pounds. Her legs are short and sturdy and, well, a little bowed. At presentation ceremonies, the runners-up standing one step down on the medal-winners' stand can look the champion square in the eye. Nor does she perform like other skaters. Waiting their turn on the ice, her rivals are keyed up like race horses, shrugging their shoulders, shaking the kinks out of their legs. Ito is impassive, almost grim-faced. The gate opens for her, and she goes through it like a gladiator into battle: This space is mine.
Figure skating is partly showmanship. Skaters work "Saturday Night Fever" poses into their routines; they make dramatic finishes on one knee; they smile automatically as they glide past the television cameras. Ito's routines are not that different from those of other skaters, but she carries the field not so much as a better performer than as an immeasurably better athlete. She moves faster, jumps higher, covers more of the ice. Most skaters can manage a triple jump (a half-turn short of a triple Axel) followed by a double; Ito can do consecutive triples. Most skaters also need the whole rink to build up enough momentum for a triple jump; Ito jumps with room to spare.
"Actually," she confesses, "I didn't do as well as I wanted to in Yokohama. I've missed a lot of practice this year." On top of her recent hospitalization, the 21-year-old skater has been suffering from a number of leg injuries.
Ito has consented to be interviewed not at home but in the office of the Osumo skating rink in Nagoya, where she has been training since 1974. The office is a small cramped space at the back of the building. Small boys on rented skates crowd around the snack bar outside, its concrete floor littered with food wrappers and discarded chopsticks. Ito hardly seems to notice her surroundings.
Soft-spoken, her hair pulled back from her face, Ito in person shows little of the sheer presence that she displays on the ice. Questions don't open into conversations. She answers them one by one -- briefly, soberly -- speaking only in Japanese, and stops, earnest and composed in her chair, to wait for the next question. What stands out most about her responses is that she refers to herself in the third person, as Midori. It's a habit that children develop early in Japan and usually drop by the age of 5 or 6, when they first go to school. Some women hang on to the habit into their teens and 20's, but only with close friends and family. Most Japanese, hearing Ito speak of herself this way to outsiders, would assume that she was simply immature.
The assumption would be hasty. Until 1985, Ito was just a promising local skater, having yet to win even a national competition. Four years later, she was a world champion, bathing in the peculiar adulation the Japanese reserve for those who achieve something -- anything -- outstanding in the outside world.
Although little in Ito's background prepared her to deal with people on the scale that her sudden celebrity demands, she gives the impression of having mastered the problem the way she would master a new jump, with the same deliberate homage to form and technique. She is self-confident without being self-absorbed, aware of the limelight but determined to keep it at a distance. Crowds -- delighted audiences -- make her happy; individuals make her cautious.
Midori Ito was born in Nagoya, the fourth-largest city in Japan, on Aug. 13, 1969. She started skating at the age of 4, when her parents began taking her once a week on family outings to the Osumo rink. One day, seeing Machiko Yamada coaching a group of preschoolers in the middle of the ice, she asked if she could also take lessons.
"I've been coaching for 25 years now," Yamada says. "Most of the kids I work with start at about age 5 or 6. Still, the first time I saw Midori, I felt there was something unusual -- something different -- about her. There was a kind of concentration about her already, for somebody so young. You could tell that she'd been thinking a lot about what she wanted and how to get it."
Ito's formal training began when she was 5. The bond between student and teacher was immediate and strong, so much so that when Ito's parents separated the following year she began to spend more and more time with the Yamadas at home. When she was 10, she moved in, and she has been there ever since. Over the past 10 years, she has had little contact with her own family (she has an older brother and a younger sister), who still live in Nagoya, and in that time they have not seen her skate in competition. Neither Ito nor Yamada will discuss what happened; it is a part of their lives that they have successfully hidden from the notoriously inquisitive Japanese press. "I don't really remember much," Ito says. "It all just seemed to work out that way before I knew it."
The Yamadas live in a brick-front, two-story house in a largely residential area about 10 minutes by car from the Osumo rink. The living room is overfurnished; like many middle-class Japanese, the Yamadas have abandoned the traditionally spare interior decor for the often cluttered Western look. A sideboard along one wall is piled high with Ito's trophies. Along the entire opposite wall there is an array of hi-fi equipment: decks and amps and mixers that might well belong in a professional studio. The equipment is a hobby for Yamada's husband, Hiroki, who is general manager of a local motorcycle and automotive tire company. Machiko Yamada uses it to edit the music for Ito's skating programs.
"When Midori was younger," she says, "we used to put selections together from marches -- upbeat pieces with nice clear tempos. Now she's become fond of classical music." Ito's interest in Western music does not really go beyond what appeals to her sense of rhythm as a skater, but she will spend hours in record shops, browsing for new pieces. This year she got interested in piano concertos.
"Yamada-sensei is very strict as a coach," Ito says, "but at home I have a very ordinary life. Her daughter, Mikiko, is my age. They treat me like her sister."
Yamada has a slightly different view of the relationship. "After all, we're two women," she says. "When we get grumpy with each other at the rink, a lot of times we can't just leave it there; we wind up taking it home. Luckily, there's the rest of the family. My husband or my daughter -- she has no interest in skating -- can usually get us talking about something else."
A trim, handsome woman of 47, her long hair dyed a fashionable auburn, Yamada could easily be taken for 35. She is comfortable with people, has a sense of humor and a low and throaty laugh. She talks easily about Ito, and seems to be able to step back from their relationship. One imagines that achieving that psychic distance, balancing her roles of coach and foster parent, took some effort. This is obvious when Ito competes. Other coaches are there -- touching, encouraging, calling their skaters to the fence during warm-up sessions to dispense last-minute instructions, raising the emotional ante. Yamada, who sometimes appears at the rink in an ankle-length fur coat, seems almost to ignore her protegee. The connection is invisible, but it never wavers.
"The toughest time was when Midori was 13 or 14," Yamada continues. "That's a rebellious time of life for kids anyhow, and whatever you said, she would take the opposite tack. At one point, she wanted to give up skating altogether. Now that she's older, she's not what you would call feminine, but she has developed a basically cheerful disposition. I think we get along pretty well."

AT AGE 11 ITO QUALIFIED TO COMPETE in the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in London, Ontario. She finished eighth. "I thought then she just might make an interesting competition skater," Yamada says, "but I never figured that she would turn out as strong as she did. Here in Nagoya we sort of expect the top skaters to come out of Tokyo." This kind of deprecating comment is often heard in Nagoya. An industrial giant of 2.2 million people, the city nurses a half-envious, half-resentful vision of the capital, two hours north by train.
In 1983, at the world junior championships in Sapporo, Ito finished third -- qualifying, although she was only 14, to compete as a senior the following season. "It never crossed my mind then that I could be a world champion," she says. "I just wanted to do my best in every competition. I'd watch skaters like Katarina Witt or Scott Hamilton, and think, 'Wouldn't it be great if I could skate like that someday?' "
Ito made her international debut as a senior at the 1984 world championships in Ottawa. Over three days of competition she rose from 16th to 7th place; digging herself out of the hole was becoming her trademark. "Even so," she says, "starting way behind and moving up was a lot better than starting high and falling back."
For the next few years, playing catch-up was mostly what she did. Why? Simply put, the girl who would become the world's best woman figure skater could barely muster a competitive figure eight.
Until last year, competitions sanctioned by the International Skating Union had been made up of three events: an individually composed short, or original, program of 2 minutes, 40 seconds; a choreographed free-skating program of 4 minutes, and the compulsories, which gave the skater no latitude at all. The rules called for the execution of selections from 41 different figures, performed to instructions that specified even whether the skater should trace the line on the ice with the inside or outside edge of the skate. Each figure had to be repeated twice, "without skids or scrapes, double tracings or unpermitted changes of edge." It was akin to an archer putting an arrow through a previous bull's-eye, then splitting the second arrow with a third. Mistakes, flawed circles, deviations from the axis were easy to determine; the judges went out on the ice when the skater was finished and examined the traces. The compulsories were often called school figures. Traditionalists believe that the combination of grace and precision they demand are the very heart of the sport.
According to Kashio Takizawa, director and secretary general of the Japan Skating Federation, "Japanese skaters have never done very well in the compulsories because they don't get enough practice on clean ice, where they can see the tracings." In all of Japan, there are only 28 skating rinks open year round; just 13 of these are 30 by 60 meters (about 100 by 200 feet), the competition size. All of them are jammed throughout the day with recreational skaters, chewing the surface.
The Osumo rink in Nagoya, where Ito trains, is a notable handicap. Built in 1953, it is a little smaller than standard. Legions of wobbly recreational skaters have left it with scars that never have time to heal. As a child, Ito would practice there in a group from 6 to 7:30 A.M., go to school, and come back again from 5 to 8 P.M.
"I've never had any confidence about my figures," Ito confesses. "I could never really trace well." Still, this is not simply a matter of practice; it's a matter of temperament. The compulsories demand a submission to the geometry; Ito wants to dominate the rink. "For the compulsories," Yamada says, "you have to skate slowly, deliberately -- you have to be composed. That's just not Midori's personality at all. Her style is quick and energetic. She's an attacker."
In June 1988, the attacker got her big break. The International Skating Union met in Davos, Switzerland, to consider eliminating the compulsory figures from competition. Opinion was divided. Member countries traditionally strong in the figures -- among them the United States and Canada -- were reluctant to give them up. They also happened to have lots of year-round skating facilities where training could be done. Member nations not so happily endowed, including Japan, were ranged on the other side.
"Spectators," Takizawa notes, "can't see the tracing on the ice. Most of them have no idea why one skater gets a higher score than another." The compulsories were more than a mystery, the argument went. They were time-consuming and downright dull. Without them, figure skating would draw more attention.
"Of course, we depend a lot on television for financial support," says Katsuichiro Hisanaga, chairman of the Japan Skating Federation's figure-skating committee. "The compulsories were taking up enormous amounts of time, and the television networks just didn't want to cover them."
In the end, the majority of voters favored the figure-skating audience. As of July 1, 1990, declared the I.S.U., the compulsories would no longer be a required event. The short program would count for one-third of the overall score and free skating for two-thirds.

BUT UNTIL THE RULES were changed, Ito managed the best she could. At the 1985 world championships in Tokyo, she wanted to become the first woman ever to land a triple Axel in competition.
All the jumps in the figure-skating repertoire end with the skater gliding backward. Except for the Axel, all the jumps also begin with the skater gliding backward, and the spin involves one or more complete 360-degree rotations of the body. With the Axel, the skater enters the jump facing forward, into the direction of the glide, so in order to land facing backward, a skater has to execute an extra half-rotation: two and a half spins for a double Axel; three and a half for a triple Axel. Jumping high enough to make three and a half spins requires tremendous strength in the legs and arms -- and superb balance. Few performers -- men or women -- have the strength to get high enough for the extra 180-degree spin.
The day before the championships, however, Ito broke her right leg in a practice session. "It was just an accumulation of strains," she says, with no hint of the enormous disappointment that must have meant. She couldn't start training again for six months.
Ito finally landed the triple Axel on Nov. 2, 1988. Hardly anyone noticed. The occasion was a small free-skating competition in Aichi prefecture, where Nagoya is located, and Ito's feat received only local coverage. The following week, however, when Ito landed the jump at the All-Japan Figure Skating Championships in Osaka, it was a different story.
"I don't think too many people watching really knew what happened," recalls Hirotaro Yagami, a reporter for the daily Sports Nippon newspaper who has followed Ito's career closely. "But the next day the major national papers were all over it." By the end of the day, the whole country knew that Midori Ito had done something extraordinary, something no woman had ever done before.
Nine months before, at the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Ito gave a dazzling free-skating performance and for the first time gained worldwide attention, but she finished just out of the running for a medal. It wasn't until the World Figure Skating Championships in Paris in 1989 that Ito finally managed to be strong enough in the original and free-skating programs to overcome her weak compulsory figures, becoming the first Asian skater ever to win the gold medal. At the end of the first day, she was well back in sixth place. Winning the second round of competition with a nearly impeccable performance -- two of the judges gave her the only perfect scores of the day -- she moved up to third place. On the final day, Ito's routine included six different jumps, including the triple Axel, and she won the title.
The 1989 world championships were a kind of watershed for the entire sport. Figure skating would no longer be dominated by the flowing, elegant style of European and North American skaters like Brian Orser and Katarina Witt. From then on it would belong to more dynamic and acrobatic performers like Ito -- and it promised, for a while, to belong to Ito alone. "She's the only woman I've seen," commented Canada's Kurt Browning, the men's gold medalist, "who could compete with the top men. Her jumping ability is incredible."
Ito's victory brought to the fore an old debate: Is figure skating essentially balletic or gymnastic? In the long run, the decision to drop compulsory figures promises to dissolve, rather than resolve, the debate.
Coaches still make their students learn the compulsories, especially in the early stages of their training. Although some feel that Ito is in the vanguard of a new breed of athletes poised to turn the sport into acrobatics on ice, figure skating continues to demand a special dimension of grace and style.
Performances in the short and free-skating programs are still scored in two categories: technical merit and artistic impression. In the free-skating program, moreover, if two competitors get the same number of points from any judge, the skater with the higher score for artistic impression is ranked higher. Artistry is clearly no small factor. If the athlete has the edge now, the graceful athlete has an even greater edge.
Still, Ito may be a special case; her scores for technical merit have been so high that she could afford to give away the edge. The future of the sport is likely to belong to skaters with a combination of athletic strength and traditional grace -- like Kristi Yamaguchi, 19, and Tonya Harding, 20, both of the United States, and Surya Bonaly, 17, of France.
At the recent United States Figure Skating Championships in Minneapolis, Yamaguchi was the odds-on favorite to win the women's title until Harding overtook her with her flawless completion of seven triple jumps, including the Axel. Bonaly, who was last year's world junior champion and the surprise winner of the European Figure Skating Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, in January, began her career as a gymnast. She also has the distinction of having landed a quadruple jump in exhibition, something Ito had hoped to do in Munich, but which is now unlikely.

WITH HER VICTORY IN the 1989 world championships, Midori Ito became a national hero. The Japan Amateur Sports Association awarded her a group "A" category stipend of about $1,500 a month. In December 1989, she was awarded the 39th annual Japan Amateur Sports Grand Prix, given for the top performance of the year by an athlete or team; she was the first figure skater to win it, and the first woman in 13 years.
Ito's Japanese fans were now taking it for granted that Ito would run away with another world title. The 1990 championships, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was the last international competition to include the compulsory figures. But Ito turned in a catastrophic performance during the first round and ended up in 10th place. Leading the field at that point was Jill Trenary, the three-time United States national champion. Ito won the original program, advancing to fourth place. On the final day, her winning routine again included seven triple jumps, one of them the triple Axel. The nine judges awarded her three 6.0's (perfect scores) and six 5.9's for technical merit. But Trenary -- who outscored Ito only in the compulsories -- took the gold.
"Everybody said it was too bad," Ito notes, "but I didn't go into it with the feeling that I was defending my title. Sure, I wanted to win -- but you know, it's hard enough to be world champion even once. I did the kind of original program and free program I wanted to. I don't have any regrets."
Now, without the compulsories to worry about, Ito's one remaining vulnerability is a want of grace. Her scores for artistic impression are still a little low, but they have been getting better in the past two years. The ballet lessons she started when she was 11 are paying off.
"Midori's improvement has more to do with her age," Yamada says. "She's had some experience of life now. She's centered more, and it shows up in her sense of self-expression."
Last April, Ito graduated from Tokai Gakuen Junior College in Nagoya (her major: home economics) and was hired by the Prince Hotels. She is nominally to work in the general-affairs department of the company headquarters in Tokyo, although she continues to live and train in Nagoya. Like American universities, leading Japanese corporations recruit aggressively for outstanding athletes. A lot of prestige is on the line.
In Ito's case, she does not skate "for" the Prince Hotels, but her official affiliation is now the company's own skating club. Twice a week, on the average, she takes the train up from Nagoya to Tokyo, puts on the company uniform and shuffles some of the routine paper work normally assigned to new employees. Otherwise, she is free to do what she does best. Her salary is the same as any other first-year clerk's: about $1,100 a month.
It was natural that Ito would join the Prince Hotels. The Prince chain is the flagship company of the Seibu Railway Group. Its chairman, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi (according to the Sept. 10, 1990, Fortune magazine, the seventh-richest man in the world), is the eminence grise of Japanese winter sports. The Seibu Group sponsors the strongest hockey team in Japan's company league; operates 34 ski resorts, and owns 11 of the country's 200 or so hockey rinks, including the sites of the last three All-Japan Figure Skating Championships.
So far, the current season -- which ends this week in Munich -- has not been good for Midori Ito. At the Skate America competition last October in Buffalo, she placed second to Kristi Yamaguchi. Her performances in January at the national championships in Yokohama were good enough to win, but most observers agreed they were cautious and uninspired.
"Midori's legs haven't been in really good shape for a while," Yamada explains. "She had that break in 1985, then trouble with her knees -- one thing after another. She could ignore all that when she was 18; now she doesn't have the same stamina. Katarina Witt used to have two or three different triple jumps at most in her programs; that's why she could compete until she was 22 or 23. Midori has five different triples and the triple Axel, and her jumps are higher than anybody else's."
Ito cut back considerably on competition appearances for the 1990-91 season, saving herself for Munich. She has also adopted a less demanding training schedule. (For every week of practice, she spends three to five days in a Prince-owned hotel at the Yunohana hot springs in Hakone, a resort area near Mount Fuji.) Then, in late January, she was briefly hospitalized for removal of a stone in a salivary gland.
Ito tends to turn aside questions about her retirement from amateur figure skating or about her future plans. "I like to take one season at a time," she says. "I have this vague feeling that the Olympics are coming up, and it would be great if I could go, but right now I just want to do well in Munich."
"The Olympics," her coach says, "will probably be the last time Midori competes as an amateur."
One career Ito absolutely rules out is coaching. "She's been watching me do what I do for 15 years now," Yamada says, "and she admits she hasn't got the temperament for it."
Skaters of Ito's stature occasionally turn professional -- become entertainers in ice shows and exhibitions -- and this she finds attractive, although the chances are slim that she would find the backing in Japan to develop and produce her own show. Would she join an existing show? Hire an agent? Skate abroad?
"What should I do, what should I do?" she says, and the stern little face wrinkles in dismay. "I really don't know." It's hard to take that dismay seriously. Midori Ito, after all, has been thinking about what she wants and how to get it since she was 4 years old.

HEADLINE: Harvard Panel Narrows Its Search for President

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 7

 BODY:
The committee to select a successor to Harvard University's president, Derek C. Bok, has narrowed its search to four or five finalists, but with its self-imposed deadline approaching at the end of this month, the committee is still seriously divided, university officials say.
The result, they say, may be a decision to turn to Henry Rosovsky, the acting dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who has long been the favorite of many Harvard faculty members. 
 But choosing the popular and widely respected Mr. Rosovsky would be difficult, because at the age of 63 he is considered too old for the job and because he is a member of the eight-person search committee. In addition, Mr. Rosovsky announced last summer that he would not be a candidate to succeed Mr. Bok, who will retire in June after 20 years as Harvard's president, often considered the nation's most prestigious academic position.
The committee's finalists, university officials say, include Martin S. Feldstein, 51 years old, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan; Philip Leder, 56, a professor of genetics at the Harvard Medical School, and Neil L. Rudenstine, also 56, the executive vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, who was the provost at Princeton University for 10 years.
Friends and colleagues of each of the three men say they have been intensively interviewed by the search committee in the past few weeks.
Another contender, some officials say, is Gerhard Casper, the 53-year-old provost of the University of Chicago, who was born and educated in Germany and taught at the University of California at Berkeley before going to Chicago as a professor of law.
In addition, The Harvard Crimson, the undergraduate daily newspaper, said last month that the committee is still considering several other candidates. It named Jeremy R. Knowles, a British-born professor of chemistry at Harvard; Michael B. McElroy, a professor of atmospheric science at Harvard; Stephen G. Breyer, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, and a former law professor at Harvard, and Donald C. Hood, a professor of psychology at Columbia University and a former vice president there.
Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Leder are graduates of Harvard College, the undergraduate school, in the past a prerequisite for being president. Mr. Rudenstine graduated summa cum laude from Princeton but received his Ph.D. in English literature from Harvard.
 
'There Is No Perfect Candidate'

Members of the search committee refuse to comment on their work. The committee is made up of five members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers, the two bodies that govern the university.
But one official knowledgeable about the committee's work, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: "The committee didn't realize that there is no perfect candidate. They are all impressive, but none of them quite strikes it. So the committee is deadlocked."
If that remains the case, this official added, "We already have the guy here who can step in -- Henry Rosovsky."
Mr. Rosovsky, who was born in Poland, won a large following while serving as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard from 1973 to 1984, when he pushed through a new undergraduate curriculum, known as the Core Curriculum. During that time he turned down an offer to be president of Yale University.
Although he has publicly renounced any intention to be president, friends say he would still like the job.
Harvard is about to embark on a $2 billion fund-raising campaign, the largest in the history of American education, and the new president will have to spend much of his time seeking contributions from alumni at a time of economic austerity.
Harvard also faces a deficit in its operating budget for the first time in many years, and despite having the largest endowment of any university in the nation, it is taking tough steps to try to reduce expenses.
A major question for the next president will be whether to continue Harvard's tradition of decentralized management, under which each of the university's component schools is responsible for its own finances.
The new president will also confront growing concern that Harvard has given priority to its graduate and professional schools at the expense of undergraduate education, with many professors more interested in research and consulting for business or government than in teaching.
To further complicate the situation, the search committee is expected to make a recommendation on whether Harvard should establish a new post of provost. Because of the decentralization of the schools both financially and academically, some officials see a need for better coordination among them, and they believe that the committee will suggest the creation of a provost, although his selection would be up to the next president.

HEADLINE: Route From College to Career Keeps Getting Bumpier

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
AS a sophomore at the University of Connecticut, Steven Hopley began priming himself for success. With dreams of a stellar career in advertising or public relations, he said, he took on an internship at an advertising agency in Hartford without pay or college credit. He then served as the assistant to the university's director of public relations for two years, organizing the mailing of news releases and planning major events. Hoping to keep in touch with professionals in the field, Mr. Hopley said, he joined a statewide public relations association. All the while, he said, "I kept telling myself, 'This is going to pay off.' "
But now, after spending hundreds of dollars on postage, resumes and phone calls to dozens of companies, only to hear that most had no openings, Mr. Hopley, who graduated in December, said he is revising his goals. "At this point, I'd be satisfied just to find a job that pays for food," he said. 
 Educated in the highly confident 1980's, Connecticut's college graduates of the 1990's are confronting the stark realities of a recessionary job market. With companies throughout the region trimming expenses by hiring fewer people or considering only experienced applicants, the job prospects for new graduates have narrowed considerably, said employers and career counselors. Their observations coincide with a survey from Northwestern University, which reported recently that of 320 companies around the nation, 42 percent said they were hiring fewer people with bachelor's degrees.
Career counselors at colleges across Connecticut said that on-campus interviews with company recruiters have decreased by at least 20 percent from a year ago. And among the recruiters who still visit, some were uncertain if their companies would have openings by the summer, the counselors said. Other indicators of the tight market include the overall decline in employment advertising in newspapers in the Northeast; it dropped by one-third since last year, said the Conference Board, an organization in Manhattan that tracks economic trends.
Steven Spinner, an ecomomics major at Wesleyan University in Middletown, is one of the students and recent graduates who have learned about the economic downturn firsthand. "Even a year ago, the strongest candidates at Wesleyan got first-round interviews at all the top investment banks," he said. "Now, students are getting rejection letters left and right from firms that in years past were not that difficult to get job offers from."
In a three-bedroom suite on the Yale University campus, Matthew Neely, a history major, and two of his roommates, both ecomomics majors, have plastered the four walls of their living room with a combined total of 60 rejection letters. "We call it the Wall of Shame," said Mr. Neely.
The 22-year-old senior, who helped to create and coordinate a number of mentor programs involving Yale students and a New Haven elementary school, said that after graduation he will return to his home in Oakland, Calif., where the job market is more promising.
"If you're already from out of state, now's the time to get out of New England," said Mr. Neely.
Accountants, engineers and health care professionals remain in demand, said employment experts around the state, but opportunities in banking, insurance, teaching and finance have been dwindling. Campus counselors said they were scrambling to help seniors adjust to the shift in employment options by redesigning seminars on resume writing and interview skills.
Job counselors at Fairfield University recently offered a workshop called "How to Get a Job in a Recessionary Market," which urged participants to seek out industries that have not been hard hit. Career planning at Wesleyan includes an off-campus recruitment program in which students will visit businesses and nonprofit organizations during their spring break.
Students' frustration is clearly rising, counselors said. "We've had more incidents of students swearing at staff and throwing resumes in their faces," said Douglas Daring, UConn's director of career counseling. "There's a lot of heightened intensity."
Mr. Spinner of Wesleyan said he sent resumes last fall to several Wall Street investment banks. So far, he said, he has received rejection letters from two of them and has had interviews with two others. Mr. Spinner, who also serves as the captain of the university's cross-country track team, said he prepared himself by undergoing several videotaped mock interviews and a workshop in corporate table etiquette. He also keeps himself informed on current events, he said, in case such subjects should arise in an interview.
"These days, job searching is like taking another subject," said Mr. Spinner. "You kill yourself getting together cover letters and resumes and preparing for the interviews. Then the waiting begins."
Kara Marchetti, a marketing major at Fairfield University, said she opted to work part time at the university's career counseling center this year to keep up with job offerings and hone her interview skills. She attends job seminars regularly, she said, and takes advantage of a reciprocal job-search program with Boston College to find out what firms are hiring in Massachusetts.
"So far, the response has been positive," said Ms. Marchetti, who was recently interviewed for a job as an insurance underwriter and for a training program in marketing and sales for an international liquor distributor.
 
Struggling for Interviews
 Other students, like Christine Pina of Wesleyan, are also broadening their job searches, determined to cover all bases. An African-American studies major who has served as a residential adviser and spent two summers as a congressional intern in Washington, she recalled spending hours this fall on her resume, accenting her most marketable skills.
Now pursuing opportunities in education and business, she said, she has lined up interviews with an investment banking firm in Manhattan and has also been offered a teaching job at a private boarding school. But overall, said Ms. Pina, "many students are really struggling to get that first interview."
Those who work at career centers, like Ms. Marchetti of Fairfield, have observed that students are hustling to secure job offers before they graduate by sending out resumes earlier and in greater volume. "A lot of students feel that now isn't the time to be picky," she said.
Recruiters and personnel managers around the state say they are noticing the growing sense of desperation. K.M.S. Advertising in Stamford reported a 20 percent jump in resumes from a year ago. And incoming resumes have increased at Chubb & Son, the insurance company, in New Haven, which now limits campus recruiting "only to schools where we've been successful," said Michael Dayton, a recruiter.
Nonprofit organizations are also sensing the panic. When the Legal Aid Society in Hartford advertised recently for someone to screen incoming phone calls, it received 350 applications in one week, said Lucy Potter, a staff lawyer. The applicants, she said, included college seniors, lawyers and other professionals.
Some students said they hoped to ride out the recession by attending graduate school. Nancy Dart, associate dean of UConn's law school, said the admissions office sent out 13,000 catalogues last year, up 3,000 from 1989. Law applications have also increased at the University of Bridgeport, said a university spokeswoman.
 
Hoping for Any Job
 A growing number of students are considering alternatives like the Peace Corps and Teach for America, which recruits students to teach in disadvantaged schools. Many are adopting attitudes similar to that of Ms. Pina of Wesleyan. "It's important to me to find a job that's meaningful and that doesn't necessarily mean making a lot of money," she said.
Others said they simply hope to find a job, period.
As for Mr. Hopley, the University of Connecticut graduate, the quest continues. Like clockwork, he said, he drives every Monday from his home in Windsor Locks to a newspaper stand in Boston that carries The Los Angeles Times, The Atlanta Constitution and other far-flung papers. If he spots any possibilities, he sends out his resume the same day, he said. In addition, he pores over local newspapers and employment newsletters, and he asks friends, neighbors and relatives if they know of any leads.
Unless he finds something soon, said Mr. Hopley, he will move to California and find a job that pays minimum wage while he searches for opportunities in advertising or public relations. Though his spirits remained high, he said, he was still in shock over his lack of job options.
"I never thought I'd be saying this," said Mr. Hopley, "but it's a real jungle out here."

The High End Is Flying High

BYLINE: BY CONNIE BRACKEN KNIGHT

 BODY:
THOUGH the recession may have eroded property prices and sales elsewhere, it has had no effect on expensive houses in this ski resort.
In the six weeks ended Jan. 25, for example, the Multiple Listing Service reported five new homes -- three of them built on speculation -- sold for a total of $8.425 million. 
 Now a group of investors headed by Phillip E. Hoversten, former chief financial officer of the Macmillan Publishing Company in New York, is building a speculative 6,000-square-foot house on a half-acre lot that the group bought last June for a record $2.75 million.
The house, which its architect, Craig Snowdon of Snowdon & Hopkins of Vail, described as a rugged Western mountain ski lodge, is priced at $6.5 million, making it Vail's most expensive private home.
Land is expensive here because it is scarce; the village is only about four square miles in area and is surrounded by National Forest Service land.
In May, another home built on speculation by Mr. Hoversten's group sold for $4.35 million.
"We are selling to three-generation families," said Craig Denton, a partner with Mr. Hoversten along with a realtor, Rocky Cristopher, and a contractor, George Shaeffer, who is doing the construction.
Many of the buyer families, he added, already have two or three homes, including vacation homes in the Hamptons on Long Island, and most pay cash.
Developers here also shy away from financing.
Among them is Ron Byrne, a realtor-developer who has sold more than 30 luxury homes since 1985, including about a dozen he developed with wealthy limited partners who put up the money.
"We're fortunate we don't have bank loans and are not under pressure to sell," Mr. Byrne said. "We literally go in for the long haul. It's at least a year to 18 months from the time we break ground until we sell."
The pace of sales has remained unchanged: On average, a luxury home is sold within six months of completion.
Mr. Byrne and his partners currently have three speculative homes on the market, two of them under contract.
The third, called Chateau de Foret, is listed for $5.7 million and has high valuted ceilings, an elevator, a heated flagstone driveway, temperature sensors and $500,000 worth of furnishings, including voluminous velvet draperies, Icelandic sheepskin carpets and Irish linen pillows. Unfurnished, the 7,000-square-foot, three-story house on about half an acre is priced at $5 million. It was designed by Gordon Pierce of Vail.

HEADLINE: As Unemployment Rises, Jobs on L.I. Decline

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
SINCE the 1987 stock-market crash, which signaled a halt to the economic boom on Long Island, the job market has sustained a double-barreled assault.
The number of available jobs on the Island has declined, and the unemployment rate has climbed. 
 The Island saw a net loss of 28,700 jobs in the year beginning December 1989, the first time since 1975 that the Island lost jobs. That contrasts with 1989, when there was an increase of 5,900 jobs. In 1988 the Island gained 13,900 jobs. The peak year was 1984, with an increase of 51,900.
 
'Makes the Figures Look Good'

The unemployment rate for the Island in December, the most recent month with available data from the State Labor Department, was 4.3 percent, compared with 3.8 percent in December 1989, 3.5 percent in December 1988 and 2.7 percent in 1987.
Despite the number of jobs lost, the unemployment rate is lower than in many other regions and on paper is not very high, said Suffolk County Planning Director Arthur Kunz. He added that the numbers did not include the many early retirees or people leaving the Island.
"These two segments of the population don't show up as being laid off," Mr. Kunz said. "And this makes the figures look good. But 1990 was our first year with a net loss of people working."
The numbers may indicate a turning point in the across-the-board decline in the Long Island economy. The dropoff can be seen in lagging home sales, declining sales-tax revenues and increasing foreclosures and bankruptcies. Because more people are retiring as the population ages and others have also stopped looking for work, they are no longer counted as unemployed.
The numbers are solely for jobs on Long Island and do not include residents who work in New York City or elsewhere off the Island. People holding two jobs were counted twice.
The chief economist of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, Dr. Pearl Kamer, said the largest losses were in manufacturing, with 12,700 jobs lost, of which 10,200 were in durable goods, mostly for the military, and 2,500 in nondurable goods like soft materials. The other job losses were in retailing, 12,400; construction, 6,600; government, 2,700, wholesaling, 2,100, and finance, insurance and real estate, 700.
Service jobs increased 6,800, and transportation and utilities were up 1,700.
The president of the Long Island Association, James L. Larocca, said it was useful to keep in mind that the Island's numbers were still below United States figures.
"When western New York hit bottom several years ago, they looked at unemployment figures in double-digit numbers," he said. "We are dealing with numbers that in many parts of the country are seen as at or near full employment. As concerning as these numbers are, they are, relatively speaking, still healthy numbers."
Data from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show a loss of 21,000 jobs on the Island from January 1990 to last January, with the number of employed people on the Island dropping, from 1,110,000 to 1,089,000.
The discrepancy between the figures is attributed to different information data and different periods.
The unemployment rate has remained slightly higher in Suffolk than in Nassau. For last December, the Nassau unemployment rate of 3.6 percent compared with 5 percent in Suffolk. But the rates in both counties were lower than the state's, at 5.4, and the nation's, at 5.9.
The highest recorded December unemployment rate for the Island was in 1976, at 10.4. For Nassau, the worst year was 1975, with a rate of 10.1 percent. Suffolk hit a high of 10.9 in 1976.
 At any rate, for those out of work, the situation appears grim. Despite the hopes of jobless Long Islanders, the end of the Persian Gulf war is unlikely to have an immediate effect on employment, Mr. Kunz said. "We can more realistically hope for a resurgence in consumer confidence that will trigger more spending and boost the economy," he said.
 
Strong Response to Ad

Without the expectation of major military spending, it is likely that Grumman, the Island's largest private employer, will continue to lay off workers unless it obtains new contracts, Mr. Kunz said.
For a company looking for an employee, the choices can be vast. Last month a store-display manufacturer in Hicksville, Econoco, advertised in a newspaper for a switchboard operator. A vice president, Mark Zelniker, said he received 206 responses.
He added that a year ago, when the 100-employee company placed a similar ad, there were fewer than 12 responses, out of which six people appeared for interviews.
People who are out of work are embarrassed, and many are terrified, said Bill Smolinsky, manager of the Hicksville office of the unemployment insurance division of the State Labor Department. Some unemployed people have not even told their spouses that they are out of work, he said.
Being unemployed is depressing and demoralizing, said an electrician who has been out of work since the end of January. Since being laid off with 1,000 workers in his union, the 43-year-old Jericho resident, who insisted on anonymity, has made more than 75 telephone calls and applied for driving jobs at 5 taxicab companies, 10 limousine companies and several bus companies. and he has looked for work at several gasoline stations, movie theaters and cable television operations.
"I can't work as an electrician, because as part of the union, I don't have a license, and that would be 'scabbing,' " he said. "If any employer finds out I'm a member of the union, he wouldn't hire me.
"And there's no job out that will pay the $1,000 a week that I was making. Unemployment insurance pays me $260 a week, and only lasts for six months. "Nobody is looking for help. Some places have taken my name and said they'd get back to me, but I haven't heard from any of them. Every day I look through the papers, but there's nothing out there. During the days I do errands and work on house projects, but the days drag and I hate this."
A single mother of two children from Bellmore who was a showroom manager and was laid off in December when the management changed hands, said her $150 a week from unemployment insurance was not nearly enough to pay her bills.
"I have a teaching degree and have been trying to find jobs as a substitute or teaching assistant, but there are no jobs," she said. "And with the state cutbacks, school districts are talking about more cuts next year.
 "I look in the papers every day and have answered ads for showroom managers and receptionists, but there are no openings. Nobody's hiring. It's an impossible time to get a job, and there's no light at the end of the tunnel."
The immediate prognosis is not encouraging, said Gary Huth, senior economist for the Labor Department and Long Island labor-market analyst.
"We've been in a downturn on Long Island since the end of '89," he said. "And I expect that there will be more job losses through the middle of 1991, with a possible upturn by the end of 1991. Even when the economy improves, the return to stronger job growth will be at a slow rate."
 
Where Is the Bottom?

Through most of the year the Island can expect a flat to declining economy, with continued layoffs in military industries, Dr. Kamer said, and commercial and industrial construction will be flat, as extra space waits to be absorbed.
But, Dr. Kamer added, there will quite likely be a rebound in home sales and construction, which would mean a pickup in the real-estate market and ultimately, more construction jobs.
The problem is determining the bottom, Mr. Larocca said.
"There are indications that the commercial-space market in Nassau County may be bottoming now," he said. "Then there will be readjustments, followed by some resuming of activity."
Residential real estate may also be changing, he said, adding, "If the indications are real, we may begin to see evidence that the readjustment period is beginning."
 
Real Retail Decline of 9.5%

Mr. Larocca said the hardest-hit industries were financial services, banking, brokerage, military and retail.
In retail sales, the first 11 months of last year showed a decline of $22.3 billion, a 3.3 percent decline in dollar terms, Dr. Kamer said. "But if you add in inflation," she added, "the decline in sales was actually 9.5 percent, compared to the first 11 months of 1989."
Retail is consequential and a compounding problem, Mr. Larocca said.
"It is a manifestation of other matters and affected by consumer confidence," the head of the business group said. "Retail remains hit hard, but everybody is looking for hopeful signs. A break in the weather and an end to the war might help overall the psychology of the economy."
 
3 WHO WANT TO WORK AGAIN
 ANTONIO MARRA of Bethpage has been out of work since November. Along with five other workers, he was laid off from the small construction company for which he worked because there was no business in the winter months.
He has been looking for any kind of work to pay the bills, he said, but added, "There are no jobs available, and the few that there are want to pay nothing."
 Mr. Marra enjoys spending time with his 2-year-old son, Antonio Jr., he said, but he desperately needs a job.
"The unemployment check doesn't cover my bills," Mr. Marra said. "I'm just hoping to get back to work by the spring."
 
'Rewarded for Lying'

In the Hicksville Unemployment Insurance Office there is usually a steady stream of people filling out applications, waiting to be reviewed and picking up checks. On a recent morning, most were reluctant to talk about being unemployed.
"It's a Catch-22," said a man who would not give his name. "You can't admit to working off the books, or they'll cut off your unemployment insurance. If you tell them you're trying to work part-time, they cut down on your compensation. So the bottom line is you are rewarded for lying."
It has been almost two years since Pamela Robertson of Levittown, a former bus driver for the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority, has worked. Ms. Robertson drove a Nassau County bus for five years, she said, and was earning $15 an hour. "Now they're making $17," she added.
"I'm waiting for Job Service to find a driving job," she said. "I have my own car, a Class II license, and I'd be willing to work anywhere on the Island. I checked the classified every day and have made phone calls and gone on interviews, but no luck. Nobody's hiring. I looked in waitressing, but they want experienced only.
"I was on welfare for a while and I'm not eligible for unemployment insurance. Now they're threatening to turn off my electric. Last time I was here they asked me if I'm willing to relocate, but I was born and raised on Long Island, and I've been here for 36 years. I'm not going to move."

Utility Builds In the Suburbs

BYLINE: BY HARRIET KING

 BODY:
THE B.C. Hydro and Power Authority, one of this city's largest employers, is planning to build a corporate complex in suburban Burnaby that will be linked by the SkyTrain light rail system to an office tower the public utility corporation is building downtown.
The suburban development is expected to cost about $57 million in United States dollars and the downtown tower about $35 million. 
 David Shipman, property manager for the utility, which now has 3,000 employees downtown, said the suburban project is the most notable outgrowth of the Greater Vancouver Livable Region Plan, developed by officials here and in surrounding communities. The regional plan urges companies to locate offices away from downtown and take advantage of SkyTrain for commuting.
The 14-mile-long SkyTrain runs east from Vancouver through what seems like one continuous residential area, running through Burnaby and then New Westminster before ending in Surrey near the United States border.
The power authority is planning a 1.7-million-square-foot development in Burnaby at the Edmonds Station, 20 minutes from downtown. This was the only SkyTrain station site where B.C. Hydro could assemble 20 acres. The company paid about $26 million for the land. It will build 850,000 square feet of space on part of the site, and sell the remaining land to developers who are expected to erect three more office towers.
In the first phase of its project, which will begin this summer, B.C. Hydro will spend $65 million to build a 250,000-square-foot high-rise, three low-rise buildings with 80,000 square feet each and a 50,000-square-foot warehouse. It will relocate 2,300 of its employees there. Another 250,000-square-foot high-rise and another low-rise complex are being planned.
For operations that must remain downtown, the company is putting up an 18-story, $40 million office building with 292,000 square feet plus four levels of underground parking, near the SkyTrain line. About 700 employees will work there.
The company sold its 33-year-old downtown high-rise, which it had outgrown, for about $49 million.
A bedroom community at the eastern city limits of Vancouver, Burnaby has in the last 15 years experienced rapid commercial growth. Phillip Sanderson, the city's economic development coordinator, said he welcomed the B.C. Hydro project, noting that its objective "is to decentralize Vancouver so that people live and work in their own community."

Caribbean tourism grew by only 3 percent in 1990 because of the recession and the Middle East crisis, the Caribbean Tourism Organization says. In 1989, tourism in the region's 32 countries grew by 5.5 percent, to 10.8 million visitors. The organization said on Friday that the slow growth was a result of difficult economic conditions in the United States, Canada and Britain and a drop in travel since Iraq invaded Kuwait.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Traders Left Confused By Latest Jobless Data

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The credit market this week is expected to focus on the meaning of the Government's employment data and the Federal Reserve's move on interest rates, after an uncommonly volatile session on Friday that erased all of the week's price gains.
What caused long-term Treasury securities to fluctuate wildly was the market's different interpretations of the Government's employment data for February and the subsequent intervention in the credit market by the Federal Reserve. 
 The credit market will try to decide whether the intervention by the Fed on Friday was technical, or whether it was indeed aimed at cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. The market will also try to determine what the rise in joblessness shows about the economy.
 
Unemployment Climbs to 6.5%
 Before the New York markets opened on Friday, the Government reported that the unemployment rate had climbed to a four-year high of 6.5 percent in February, from 6.2 percent the month before. While the figure was well above most economic projections, a sizable number of market participants believed the figure was actually a conservative reading of the situation.
When the Fed moved several hours later to lower the Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for temporary loans, it led many to believe the central bank had moved to ease credit. Normally, this would have bolstered prices of fixed-income debt issues because it would mean lower yields on future bonds offered to investors.
But the Treasury bond market reacted negatively to the Fed's move. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds, which had opened with a yield of 8.19 percent, saw prices erode all day and finally end with the yield at 8.30 percent.
 
Widely Perceived Target
 Why did so many question the purpose of the Fed's intervention? After all, the Fed's infusion of reserves into the banking system did cause this key lending rate to decline from 6.25 percent, to 5.875 percent at the close on Friday. And the 6.25 percent funds rate had been widely perceived as the Fed's target for this bedrock cost of credit.
"Of course the Fed eased interest rates," said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo. "Any time the Fed adds reserves to the banking system it is bound to cause the funds rate to decline, especially on a Friday when demand for these funds shrinks."
What caused much of the confusion, Mr. Braverman continued, were the varying interpretations of the Government's February employment data.
"For example," he noted, "Washington said there was a decline of 184,000 non-farm jobs last month, or some 30,000 above most estimates. But the Government's February data include 552,000 part-time workers. Part-time worker cannot buy houses, cars or other goods that will bring us out of the recession. The fact remains that people simply do not have the means to spend, and no amount of glowing forecasts about the impending end of the recession or rising consumer confidence has changed that basic fact."
 
A More Optimistic Outlook
 But Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank, is far more optimistic. As he said in an interview last Friday:"Many of those who don't believe the Fed has eased believe so because it would probably mean that the Fed's funds target would be 6 percent, which is same as the Fed's discount rate to banks. This group would become believers if the Fed cut its discount rate first. Well, there are often times when the Fed has moved to cut the funds rate before it reduced its discount rate."
As for the employment figures, Mr. Kellner held that they were positive on balance and may indeed be signaling an end to the recession. "If we look at the household employment number for February, we find that only 4,000 jobs were lost," he said. "We must also remember that the gross employment figure used by the Government is based on payroll data. It does not include self-employed people, only those who work for others."
Mr. Kellner said another sign that the recession might be bottoming out was a sudden sharp rise in demand for raw materials, as measured by the Commodity Research Bureau index of futures prices. The index, which uses a 1967 price base of 100, soared to 221.95, from 217.98, in just the past week.
"The stock market is also telling us something," he added. "Despite continued poor corporate earnings, it has advanced 25 percent since last October's lows."
Another view was offered by Maria F. Ramirez, who heads a financial investment management and advisory group bearing her name.
 
'Monetary Policy Is On Hold'
 "We think the Fed's current monetary policy is on hold, despite any particular action it may take on a given day," she said on Friday. "Yes, we are among those who believed the Fed did move to ease credit this morning. But we also think this was the Fed's last such move. The Fed now has little further room to ease."
If, as she and many credit market experts believe, the Fed's new funds target is 6 percent, Mrs. Ramirez said "it won't necessarily follow that the Fed will cut its discount rate from the present 6 percent."
"Past experience tells us," she said, "that the Fed usually cuts its discount rate to bank borrowers after a half-point decline in the funds rate."
The Fed's discount rate has also become far less a significant psychological factor in the marketplace than the prime lending rate offered by banks to favored customers. The reason is that banks now have other sources of funds to tap here and in overseas markets and thus are no longer as dependent on the Fed as they may have been years ago.
Consequently, Mrs. Ramirez believes the market this week will be paying more attention to such basic economic factors as the employment statistics.

HEADLINE: OPEC Cuts: How Much and Whose?

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 10

 BODY:
When OPEC ministers gather on Monday in Geneva for their first meeting since the end of the Persian Gulf war, they are expected to try to rein in overproduction, seeking to prevent a collapse of crude oil prices.
Oil analysts say the ministers will probably reaffirm the organization's prewar target price of $21 a barrel. That is about $3.50 above current levels for crude oil from the gulf. But oil experts say the meeting could grow tense when the ministers debate how much production should be cut, and by whom, to re-establish the $21 price. 
 "There is a tremendous desire among all OPEC countries to prevent an oil-price collapse," said Mehdi Varzi, a London-based oil analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd. "They all recognize they have to cut output collectively for the second quarter. But how they do it? That's where the problems arise."
 
Crippled Export Capacity
 Since the oil-production and export capacities of Kuwait and Iraq are crippled, many analysts say it should not be difficult for the 11 other OPEC members to carve up their production into a new system of quotas, but in the highly charged postwar atmosphere that may not be so easy.
With Saudi Arabia accounting for about 8.3 million of the nearly 23 million barrels a day that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped last month, other OPEC members are expected to put pressure on the Saudis to absorb the bulk of any cuts. But the Saudis say they will fend off such pressure. After incurring some $50 billion in expenses in fighting Baghdad, as well as huge investments to increase output to offset the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, Saudi Arabia does not want to be the only country to cut production.
Oil analysts say the Saudis do not want prices to rise quickly, since a price jump could be seen as a slap in the face to the United States and other Western nations that joined Riyadh in fighting Iraq. What is more, the Saudis recognize that a jump in prices could undermine a recovery of the slumping American economy.
 
Agreement on Price
 "What they will quickly agree on is the price will go to $21," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, based in New York. "The question is whether the price will go up right away."
Some analysts suggest that Washington would not be disappointed if OPEC moved to re-establish a price of $21 a barrel, which is usually about $2 a barrel below the price of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark American grade of crude oil. In February, OPEC's average price was $17.55 a barrel.
"Twenty-one dollars is realistic for everyone, even the U.S.," said Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil journal. He said that level would just reaffirm the July price target, to which Washington did not object. He added that because the dollar has plunged against the Japanese yen and most European currencies, oil, which is priced in dollars, is far cheaper for Japan and Western Europe than it was five years ago.
 
A Glut in the Offing
 Oil experts say that if OPEC continues to produce oil at the February rate of 23 million barrels a day, a glut could develop quickly. Prices would plunge as a result, because daily demand for OPEC oil is expected to be between 21 million and 21.5 million barrels in the second quarter.
Demand for oil historically falls by more than two million barrels a day from the first quarter to the second as spring weather comes to the Northern Hemisphere. Also weighing on the market is some 120 million barrels of oil stored in tankers at sea, far more than the 45 million barrels usually stored that way.
In Geneva on Sunday, the Oil Minister of Indonesa, Ginanjar Kartasasmita, said: "OPEC will take all the necessary steps to stabilize the market. If a cut is necessary, then we will do it."
Saudi Arabia's former oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said that if nothing was done to control the glut, oil prices could drop to $12 a barrel. He said Friday that there was a 50 percent chance that OPEC would agree on new production ceilings at the Geneva meeting.
Sheik Yamani said one possibility that could drive down prices was a resumption of Iraqi exports by June. Some experts said the country's northern oilfields were only partially damaged by allied bombing. But many analysts said it would take much longer for Iraqi oil to enter export markets, because of the continuing embargo against Iraq and the destruction of that country's electric power stations.
OPEC's Market Monitoring Committee, which is not empowered to decide on production quotas, meets on Monday to review the supply and demand situation. Oil analysts say there is a good chance the ministers will turn the committee's talks into a full-scale emergency meeting to decide on quota levels.
Last July, OPEC set a production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day, but those quotas were suspended in September, when the 4 million barrels a day produced by Iraq and Kuwait were embargoed after the invasion of Kuwait.
Many oil analysts predict that OPEC will agree to set a production ceiling of 21 million or 21.5 million barrels a day. "If they cut to 21 million barrels, it won't take long to establish the $21-a-barrel price," said Mr. Varzi of Kleinwort Benson. "If they cut to 21.5 million barrels, it will take longer."
In recent days, OPEC ministers have maneuvered to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, to cut production. In a comment that many construed as a suggestion that Saudi Arabia had become a vassal of Washington, Algeria's Oil Minister, Sadek Boussena, who is also the president of OPEC, said the gulf countries had to "show their capability of pursuing an independent oil policy, despite the new balance of forces in the region."
Some of OPEC's price hawks fear that Saudi Arabia wants to keep its and OPEC's production high to please Washington, since this would help hold down prices. But Saudi officials deny they are doing Washington's bidding, noting that they have long opposed high prices.
Saudi production is some 3 million barrels a day higher than the 5.3 million barrels a day the country produced before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
The key to the meeting, many analysts say, is whether the Saudis can persuade other members to cut production as well.
Analysts expect the Saudis to balk at accepting a quota of less than seven million barrels a day. Indeed, OPEC officials say Kuwait is negotiating with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates so they could produce part of Kuwait's 1.5 million-barrel-a-day quota. This would help pay for Kuwait's reconstruction. Kuwait would, in theory, repay this production when its oilfields are up and running.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
New Kuwait Oil Output
 KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (AP) -- Kuwait hopes to start producing 50,000 barrels of oil a day in the next two months to run its power stations, an executive with the Kuwait Oil Company said today.
Officials have estimated that between 80 and 85 percent of Kuwait's oil production capacity was damaged by fires set by fleeing Iraqi troops, but the executive, Ahmad Murad, said some wells were unscathed.
"We have identified about 30 to 40 wells which are not on fire, but they could have been affected," he said at a news conference. "There are a number of wells that are not even damaged. In fact, I saw 7 by my own eyesight."
Mr. Murad said tentative plans call for American firefighters to start tackling the blazes on Friday after equipment is brought from the United States. He said that once Kuwait starts producing crude for the power stations, the next goal will be to start producing another 50,000 barrels a day to refine into gasoline for the local market.

HEADLINE: Returning Part of Everglades To Nature for $700 Million

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla.

 BODY:
For a century, man has been swallowing the Everglades in a storm of concrete, smoke, and steel. Now state and Federal authorities are trying to make room for nature in South Florida.
Several steps are planned: returning a river north of Lake Okeechobee to its original meandering channel, filling in or redesigning miles of deep canals, building thousands of acres of experimental marshes to cleanse water of agricultural pollution, and adding 107,000 acres to the Everglades National Park's 1.4 million acres. 
 The project, likely to cost more than $700 million and take at least a decade, is intended to reverse years of destructive meddling and recover the natural flow of the waters that have nourished one of the world's largest marshes and its wildlife for thousands of years.
The Everglades once were a shallow river of pure water and unbroken marsh that began in Lake Okeechobee and spilled across the lower Florida peninsula in a sheet 40 to 60 miles wide. So lazy was the current that water leaving the lake in March would not reach Florida Bay, at the tip of the peninsula 100 miles away, until the following February.
 
Hints of What Was
 Alligators and crocodiles filled the Everglades' sloughs. Egrets, herons, spoonbills, wood storks, anhingas and bald eagles fed on schools of fish, and panthers prowled the high ground hummocks of mahogany and palm.
An inkling of the magnificence of this natural setting can still be seen at sunset in the Everglades National Park as crimson mist settles over the sawgrass prairie, osprey alight on the top branches of mangroves and the natural warfare of life diminishes to an eloquent quiet.
But on the horizon, Miami's lights grow closer every year. The wooden skeletons of hundreds of new homes are now separated from the second-largest national park in the lower 48 states by nothing more than a 50-foot-wide canal. From daybreak to sunset, trucks raise trails of dust as they roll north, loaded with half the winter vegetables sold in the United States.
Never before has government set out to restore a natural landscape this large. If the work is successful, the lessons may be invaluable for projects to reverse the destruction of other bodies of water, especially Long Island Sound, the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, the lower Mississippi River and San Francisco Bay.
 
Alarm in Washington
 "The nation's waters have been damaged by the poisonous byproducts of 20th-century society," William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, wrote in the January issue of The E.P.A. Journal. "Whatever their specific designation -- lake, estuary, or aquifer; sound, bight, or gulf; bay, wetland, or river -- our great water ecosystems are increasingly troubled."
The restoration of the Everglades National Park, which makes up more than half of the entire Everglades region, is a test of political skills every bit as daunting as the engineering.
Scientists, public officials and leaders in the National Park Service have known for years that the Everglades are dying. The sense that something had to be done led to a 1988 lawsuit, filed by the United States Justice Department, seeking to compel the state to enforce its environmental laws and prohibit contamination of the water that flows into the Everglades National Park and a national wildlife refuge near West Palm Beach.
Complicating the restoration are two factors, one purely natural, the other economic and political. A four-year drought made the competition for water among farms, cities and the park itself much more fierce. And wealthy sugar and vegetable farmers south of Lake Okeechobee have continued to jealously guard the Federal rules that exempt them from having to decontaminate runoff from their land.
While helping farmers avoid costly systems to treat their waste water, these exemptions under the Federal Clean Water Act are responsible for the largest source of pollution left uncontrolled in the United States.
 
Governor Gets Involved
 The newly elected Governor, Lawton Chiles, inserted himself into the struggle in January. Last month, Mr. Chiles and the Federal Government agreed that the suit filed in 1988 would be stayed for two months, creating time to try to work out a settlement that could be used to solve other issues related to the ecology of the Everglades. The negotiations, now under way, are the first effort by all parties to resolve obstacles to restore the Everglades.
"Floridians have spent most of the 20th century trying to destroy the Everglades, and much of it trying to save the Everglades, often at the same time," Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, said in January. "I hope to see the day, before the end of the 20th century, when we have restored as much of the Everglades as we can, when we have finally learned to live in peace with the Everglades, when we can simply allow it to be."
The Governor's remarks echo the words that appear in "The Everglades: River of Grass," the seminal 1947 book by Marjory Stoneman Douglas, which sounded an early and loud warning that the Everglades were imperiled. "There are no other Everglades in the world," wrote Mrs. Douglas, who is now 100 years old. "They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions of the earth, remote, never wholly known."
Today's farms and cities would not have been possible without the lacework of drainage canals, more than 1,400 miles of them, that were cut through the black muck and porous limestone of the Everglades starting at the turn of the century. But interruption of the natural water flow has severely damaged the park's ecology.
"This is regarded as the most threatened park in the National Park System," said Robert S. Chandler, the Everglades park superintendent. "It is at a stage of biological collapse."
 
Tinkering With Nature
 After World War II the Federal Government began to control the flow of water, but the Everglades have sometimes suffered from that control. Too much water in early spring, for instance, ruins nesting sites for alligators. Not enough water in the dry season destroys feeding grounds for fish on which most of the birds depend.
Moreover, waste water from farms has raised the levels of phosphorous in the water to more than double the natural levels, resulting in extensive stands of cattails that crowd out the sawgrass and upset the region's biology.
Since the park was established in 1947, the number of wading birds has dropped 90 percent, scientists say. Fourteen species of animals in the park are considered endangered, among them the Florida panther. Last year, a panther was killed by mercury poisoning. Rangers trapped raccoons that also had unusually high concentrations of mercury in their blood. The source of the mercury has not been identified.
Plants not native to the Everglades, including the Brazilian pepper, a tough fast-growing tree popular among South Florida landscapers, and melaleuca, a tenacious Australian tree that developers use to drain wet areas, have established themselves.
 
Dismantling the Plumbing
 Reversing the decline of the Everglades means returning to nature a system too tightly controlled by man. The first step involves uncoupling parts of a gigantic plumbing system so the shallow sheet of pure water that used to flow naturally into the park is restored.
Among the more expensive jobs will be reclaiming the Kissimmee River, which feeds Lake Okeechobee, the headwaters of the Everglades. In response to flooding, Congress paid the Army Corps of Engineers to convert the 98-mile-long river into a 300-foot-wide, 30-foot-deep channel.
During construction from 1961 to 1971, thousands of acres of wetlands vanished, replaced by cattle farms. The transformation increased the flow of damaging nutrients, particularly phosphorous, into Lake Okeechobee, threatening its very survival.
 
Beginning Steps Taken
 Moving to address the Federal Government's failure to control agricultural pollution, the State Legislature two years ago required 49 large dairies north of the lake to capture manure and waste water and use the waste water to irrigate their pastures.
At the same time, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, the state agency that oversees the system of canals and supplies water to five million people, have proposed a project costing more than $300 million to restore the Kissimmee River to its natural channel.
Another step is to cleanse the water flowing out of Lake Okeechobee and the farming area south of it of nutrients that damage the Everglades. The water management district has proposed converting 25,300 acres of sugar fields south and east of Belle Glade into marshes planted with cattails and other plants to soak up phosphorous. The $150 million project is designed to cut in half the phosphorous in the water flowing to the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and the Everglades National Park. Farmers have already agreed to spend $40 million on the filtration marshes but may be asked or directed by the state to contribute more.
Environmental groups say the land devoted to the cleansing marshes should be doubled or tripled. "It appears to us that the present scope of the project is insufficient," said James D. Webb, Florida regional director of the Wilderness Society.
Computer models by the water district's experts say 25,000 acres is enough. "We propose taking the steps that can be supported scientifically and economically," said Thomas K. MacVicar, an engineer and the deputy executive director of the water management district.
Finally, the Corps of Engineers has been authorized by Congress to design a system of breeches and gates in a canal that cuts through a large marsh just north of the Everglades National Park, and to elevate parts of U.S. Highway 41, the roadway from Miami to the Gulf Coast. This $74 million project, a year away from start of construction, will take water out of the canal, spread it across the wetland, direct it under the highway and into 107,000 acres of wetlands that are being added to the national park.
The $40 million purchase of 107,000 acres of wetlands that are now privately owned will provide room for the water to sweep across 30 miles of a shallow basin known as Shark River Slough. Scientists hope that the repair will keep the Everglades wet during the winter dry season and more evenly spread water during the wet season.
As Mrs. Douglas wrote in 1947, "Perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Broad Ban on Computers

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
American and Japanese officials will meet in Tokyo on Friday to try to renegotiate a seven-year-old secret accord under which the United States and Japan agreed to limit the sale of supercomputers, United States Government officials said this weekend.
Until now the two countries have effectively blocked the spread of supercomputers to Eastern Europe and the third world. But American officials say they are concerned because four, possibly five, Western European countries are on the brink of producing supercomputers. 
 Unless the United States-Japan agreement is expanded to include Britain, Germany, France and possibly the Netherlands and Italy, American officials believe, machines capable of supercomputer performance could soon be available to countries that have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
"We don't want supercomputer exports to go unencumbered from those countries," said an Administration official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "Secondly we want to make certain that a level playing field is maintained between United States and Japanese manufacturers."
The United States hopes that Japan will join it in inviting the Western European nations to sign a new agreement that would curtail the export of high technology.
All those Western European nations, as well as Japan and the United States, are members of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom, whose members agree to restrict certain exports to Eastern Europe. But current Cocom agreements do not control exports to many countries capable of developing nuclear and other advanced weapons.
 
Nonmilitary Uses Permitted
 Supercomputers are vital tools in the design of nuclear weapons and advanced missiles. The United States has permitted the sale of the systems to some countries, including India and Brazil, but only with stringent safeguards limiting their use to such nonmilitary applications as weather forecasting, scientific research and engineering.
American computer makers have become increasingly concerned that unilateral export controls would put them at a disadvantage against foreign competitors. When the accord was first signed in 1984, only two American companies, Cray Research and the Control Data Corporation, both headquartered in Minneapolis, along with Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan, made computers that reached supercomputing speeds.
But in recent years, a new class of computers, known as parallel computers, have made it possible to reach supercomputer performance ratings without the specialized components used by companies like Cray. Parallel computers chain together conventional microprocessors and then employ software that breaks up problems into portions that can be computed simultaneously to obtain greater speed.
 
Disagreement Over Definition
 American computer industry executives said one potential significant disagreement in the Japanese-American negotiations may be over what level of speed is needed for a computer to be defined as a supercomputer. Japanese manufacturers are said to be in favor of a much higher level for what defines a supercomputer.
A proposal circulated by the Hitachi Corporation argues that the definition of a "true" supercomputer should be set as high as two billion calculations a second. This would restrict the definition of what is a supercomputer to the manufacturers of the five or six fastest computers in the world.
The proposal also specifies a second, lower limit to exclude work stations and general-purpose mainframe computers at 800 million calculations a second. Both definitions are far higher than limits specified last year by the United States Government in a draft definition of a supercomputer that was established as part of an effort to relax regulations on the export of high performance computers. The draft standard had a lower limit of 100 million instructions and an upper limit of 300 million instructions a second.
That draft document has now been finalized but has not yet been made public, several Government officials said. It includes a modest rise in performance from the originally published figures, they said.
Several industry officials said the Japanese would probably accept United States wishes for setting a lower level. But one executive said there was some concern that the Hitachi proposal would be adopted by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
The need to broaden the original United States-Japan agreement has been prompted largely by the widespread availability of inexpensive very-high-speed microprocessors which do not fall under strict export controls. In Britain, for example, the Inmos Corporation is working on a version of a popular microprocessor known as the Transputer. That chip has become the basis of a number of supercomputer projects in both England and France. Additionally, Germany has a number of state and privately financed supercomputer efforts.
 
Computer Scientists Skeptical
 Many computer scientists are skeptical about the United States' ability to control the spread of supercomputers.
"The Government has a real problem," said C. Gordon Bell, a computer designer for a number of computer companies and a former National Science Foundation official. "The knowledge of how to build these things is better and better understood all the time. Anyone can build these things."
The Technion, an Israeli university that was denied an export licence to buy a United States supercomputer, said last year it was considering either buying a supercomputer from a German manufacturer or designing its own parallel computer. The United States has so far refused to sell supercomputers to Israel because of concerns that they could be used in developing nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
What Is Driving Rallies in Europe?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
AS world stock markets rallied last week, many brokers in Europe were buying for their clients with one hand and scratching their heads with the other. They were wondering what fundamental economic factors were causing the surge, which began with the Persian Gulf war and picked up after the cease-fire was declared.
The rallies have carried the stock indexes in some European markets close to levels that analysts had predicted in December would not be reached until the end of this year. 
 In France, the CAC-40 index closed last week at 1,828.14, up 20.4 percent from the end of last year and not far from the UBS Phillips & Drew year-end projection of 2,000. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange Index in London finished at 2,455.0, just below its all-time high close of 2,463.70 and just below UBS's forecast of 2,500 for year-end. In Switzerland, the Swiss Performance Index ended at 1,056.4; the year-end estimate was for 1,150.
One reason for the rally seems quite clear: panic. There are institutions and investors with cash who initially missed the upturn in stocks and now want in. The right risk for a portfolio manager now seems to be equities -- and bonds -- as opposed to the cash so many managers and institutions favored before the Persian Gulf war began. This pyschology has limited all the market dips so far, as eager buyers have piled in fairly quickly.
Another reason is the situation in the United States: The Dow is near new highs and the Standard & Poor's 500 index reached a new high. The rest of the world has followed, drawn by the postwar glow and the growing belief that the recession in the United States is near its end.
In Europe and Japan, the rallies have also been pushed by the hope for lower interest rates there, although only the British have cut rates significantly so far. And in focusing only on what they choose to, the markets are ignoring weak corporate earnings, recessions and slowdowns in Europe and Japan, fixated instead on the American recovery.
At the middle of last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average flirting with closing above 3,000 for the first time, the world rally appeared ready to move even higher. Then came a pause on Thursday, as the Dow fell after failing to close above 3,000 on Wednesday. But on Friday, markets in Asia and Europe rallied again, with the Frankfurt and Tokyo markets reaching 1991 highs. In New York, however, the Dow failed to make another real run at 3,000 and was down 8.17 points on Friday, to 2,955.20.
Marcus Grubb, the European strategist for UBS in London, said the strong rallies have sharply altered the valuations of the markets, making some look a little too expensive when the yields on equities are compared with bonds or when the ratios of prices to earnings are compared with historic levels.
"Valuations are stretched now, and you should take some profits into cash," he said. "Unless we get the interest rate cuts that are expected, we could see a very major correction in the markets."
For Steven H. Nagourney, chief international strategist at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, the key to the future is the performance of Wall Street, the outlook for inflation and the performance of the bond markets.
He said Wall Street would pull Europe and Japan with it, but that that would change soon, especially when it becomes clearer how much the European economy is slowing down. He said that he did not expect a collapse in Europe, but that over all, Europe would underperform the United States.
While he is fairly confident about the American rally, he said bond yields in the United States would have to fall soon to keep it going above 3,000. Otherwise, stocks would begin to look too expensive compared with the yields from bonds.
But he said positive data on inflation that could push bond yields lower will not be available until April, when economic reports for March -- the first full month of activity after the war -- are released.
"Because of that long wait for bonds we could see some consolidation, but no more than 4 to 7 percent," he said. Mr. Grubb sees the same problem with bonds and stocks in Europe. His worry is that the cuts in short-term rates, when they come, will not filter through to longer-term bonds.
In Europe, Mr. Nagourney is most sour on Germany, where he thinks the current level of 1,602.29 on the DAX index of 30 leading issues requires either "a significant decline in interest rates or a significant increase in earnings." He added, "I do not see any one of them happening."
But he and Mr. Grubb still like the markets in France and Spain, partly because they expect interest rate cuts there to fight slowing economies, making equities more attractive than bonds.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: ISRAEL;
4 Israelis Slain on Eve of Baker's Visit

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 10

 BODY:
An Arab assailant who told the police he was sending a message to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d stabbed four Israeli women to death tonight and wounded at least one other woman in the center of West Jerusalem.
A policeman who was passing by shot and wounded the attacker, a 26-year-old Palestinian from the Jabaliya refugee center in the Gaza Strip. He was identified as Mohammed Abu Galla, a nurse who has been working in Jerusalem with a permit issued by the Israeli military. 
 The victims, all from Jerusalem, were identified as Rosa Eliafsur, 32 years old, Mercedes Banitah, 57, and Miriam Biton, 20. All were Jewish, the Israel radio reported. The fourth victim, who died later in the evening, has not been identified. The police said she was in her 50's.
After Mr. Galla was interrogated at a hospital, Jerusalem's police commander, Haim Albaldes, said, "The assault is related to Baker's visit tomorrow."
 
Baker Arrives on Monday
 The Secretary of State is to arrive here on Monday on a visit intended to calm fears and stir confidence among Israelis that they might eventually settle their conflict with the Arab nations and Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. But the slayings are certain to complicate that task.
As Israeli analysts noted tonight, the killings may remind the United States, fresh from a convincing military victory, that diplomatic gains in the Middle East are seldom as easily won as the Persian Gulf war.
At the scene of the attack, a bus stop in a Jerusalem neighborhood heavily populated by Soviet Jewish immigrants, Israelis chanted this afternoon, "Death to Arabs, revenge!" and "Baker go home!" One man cursed Mr. Baker, adding, "You are responsible for the murder of Jews!"
The attack also inflamed passions among Israel's leaders, who had declared earlier today that Israel was willing to show little if any flexibility to make peace with its Arab neighbors.
 
Bush Faulted for Speech
 The Deputy Science Minister, Geula Cohen, a leader of the far-right Tehiya Party, said she had no doubt that the stabbings "were encouraged by the latest declarations from Bush."
In a speech to Congress on Wednesday, President Bush said that any American initiative in the Arab-Israeli conflict would be grounded in "the principle of territory for peace." Israel's leaders said in effect today that they would rather have the land than the peace.
Early this morning, someone set fire to the door of the American Cultural Center at the United States Consulate in Jerusalem. The arsonist painted a message in English: "America, do not interfere in our business."
Moshe Friedman, Jerusalem's deputy police commander, predicted that "extremist elements will try to whip up tempers, and there could be disturbances as a result of the visit."
Later in the morning, Dov Shilansky, the Speaker of Parliament, flew to the Golan Heights to mark the beginning of direct airline flights to and from Tel Aviv. Israel captured the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967 war. The land was later annexed, and thousands of Jews have settled there.
 
Deliberate Signal to Baker
 Visiting one of these settlements, Mr. Shilansky said he would not be unhappy if people assumed that he timed his trip to send a message to Mr. Baker. If the Secretary of State asks, Mr. Shilansky said, the Israeli Government will tell him that Israel considers the Golan Heights to be an integral part of Israel, the same way that "Illinois is a part of the U.S.A."
Syria, which is Israel's most heavily armed adversary now that Iraq has been defeated in the gulf war, has signaled that it might be willing to open talks with Israel if the Golan Heights were returned.
But after a long and sometimes rancorous Cabinet discussion today, Economics Minister David Magen said, "The Golan Heights is not on the discussion table." Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he agreed.
The Cabinet also decided that the Government's peace initiative of May 1989, offering elections and limited autonomy for residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, was still in effect. The debate was fierce at times, with several right-wing ministers expressing anger that Israel would advance the 1989 proposal again. A year ago, Mr. Shamir scuttled the proposal just as an initiative by Mr. Baker seemed to move the plan forward.
 
Israelis Talk of Balking
 Today, Israeli officials said they had received reports that Mr. Baker would come with a promise from several Arab nations to recognize Israel if the country agreed to abide by United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw from occupied territory. In addition to recognition, one of the benefits for Israel would be secure borders.
But to that idea, the Government is evidently prepared to say no.
After the Cabinet meeting, Transport Minister Moshe Katsav, speaking for the Government, said he hoped Mr. Baker did not expect Israel to "pay a price for its restraint in the Gulf war."
Mr. Shamir said flatly that if Mr. Baker asked the Government "to do things that will be too difficult to carry out," Israel would simply refuse.
As the Iraqi military continued to fire Scud missiles toward Israel during the gulf war, officials said Israel was earning political capital by deciding not to respond. Now the Government seems prepared to spend that capital. Mr. Katsav said: "The formula 'territories for peace' will lead to a Palestinian state, and that is why I and my fellow ministers oppose it."
 
Emotional Funerals Expected
 As Mr. Baker seeks concessions from the Israelis in the meetings that begin on Monday, television news coverage will also be focusing on the funerals for the stabbing victims. Such funerals are usually highly emotional events.
Teddy Kollek, the Mayor of Jerusalem, who is known for showing restraint when others' emotions are running high, said: "I am among those who always tried to walk the moderate path. Now our patience is running out."

HEADLINE: New York Lacks Money To Buy Land

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUPPER LAKE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Early last fall, a decade of negotiations produced a deal that was literally and figuratively trailblazing for 22,000 acres along the Raquette River northwest of this Adirondack village.
The arrangement between New York State and the International Paper Company would finally open for public use one of the state's most magnificent stretches of evergreen forest and whitewater river. And because the deal let the company grow and harvest timber on remote parts of the land, it was expected to serve as an important model for other negotiations with timber companies. 
 But for now, that deal is off. So are dozens of other plans that would have protected open space in virtually every region of the state, from the Pine Barrens on Long Island to the Catskill watershed to the Lake Erie waterfront.
New York State, which just a few months ago was sketching one of the most ambitious land-preservation programs in the country, now has none.
 
Environmental Bond Act Defeated
 The reason for the reversal is simple: the state has run out of money to buy land. After the narrow defeat of an environmental bond act in the election last fall, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vowed to oppose any new spending on land programs this year. With the state in fiscal turmoil, the Legislature does not seem inclined to overrule him.
Not everyone regrets that the state cannot continue its heritage of land preservation, which stretches back to the days of Theodore Roosevelt and the creation of "forever wild" forest reserves in the Catskills and the Adirondacks. Some upstate counties, concerned that the bond act would take huge plots of land out of local control, voted it down by margins of 8 to 1.
But without any money for land, the state cannot act on programs that were aimed not only at preserving esthetic treasures, but also at protecting drinking-water supplies, stemming pollution and controlling development.
In the Catskill watershed, which provides much of New York City's water supply and where city officials say land purchases are a critical means of protecting the supply, neither the state nor the city can act right now when property goes on the market. And in Orange County, a private developer has filed plans for a housing subdivision for parts of Sterling Forest, an 18,000-acre parcel that is the largest woodland left in the New York metropolitan area.
Here in the Adirondacks, at least two major parcels of land for which the state was negotiating, one on Lake Champlain and the other on Forked Lake, have been put up for sale. Another parcel, one of the longest undeveloped stretches on Lake George, was bought by the Adirondack Land Trust, a private conservation group that planned to sell it to the state. Now the group is struggling to raise contributions to keep from defaulting on its mortgage payments on the $2.5 million property.
One of the more innovative approaches the state mapped out in recent years involves agreements known as conservation easements, in which a private seller agrees to open land to the public or to forego some uses of it, like development, in return for a payment from the state. Nearly half the 300,000 acres covered by two now-expired bond acts approved by the voters in 1972 and 1986 were preserved that way.
Aside from being a less expensive way to protect land than buying it outright, the arrangement has proved particularly attractive to forest-products companies because it can significantly lower the tax bill on company-owned property. That concept was at the heart of the Raquette River deal near here, as well as several other negotiations with timber companies.
"This is a very critical time, and just as a lot of these companies are deciding to get into the game, it turns out that we can't ante up on our side of the table," said Neil Woodworth, conservation director of the Adirondack Mountain Club, a private group that has lobbied extensively for protecting the Raquette River property.
 
'When All You Have Is a Nickel'
 The broad economic downturn may well discourage some private purchases of land regardless of whether the state can compete for it. Still, many environmentalists contend that the state should move ahead now precisely because the land is cheaper than it will be when the economy rebounds.
"That could well be true," said Governor Cuomo's chief adviser on environmental affairs, Frank Murray. "But when all you have is a nickel, it doesn't matter if land costs 25 cents or if it costs a dollar. You can't afford to buy it."
The state's land program was at the heart of the $1.975 billion environmental bond act that was defeated last fall. If the measure had passed, $800 million from bond sales would have been set aside to buy land or to secure the kind of public access to it envisioned in the International Paper deal.
But now other economic efforts are getting higher priority. Lawmakers, under intense pressure from local governments, are expected to come up with some money for sewage treatment, landfill closings, recycling and other programs that would have been financed by the bond act. And, despite complaints from environmentalists about misdirected priorities, Mr. Cuomo has included about $20 million in his budget for new snow-making equipment at state-owned ski areas, renovations at state golf courses and other recreational programs that were also included in the bond act.
 
Cuomo Prefers to Wait
 But the support for the land programs is more diffuse. Moreover, Governor Cuomo, who pushed hard for land acquisition in last year's campaign, often describing it as "the ultimate selfless act," now cites controversy over it as the chief reason the bond act lost.
And though his own Environmental Conservation Department had already identified dozens of environmentally sensitive parcels in anticipation of using bond act money to buy them, Mr. Cuomo now prefers to wait while new advisory committees work out recommendations on where to buy land.
"In these difficult times involving limited public resources, we must do it intelligently and persuasively," he said last week in explaining why he was turning to the new committees to study land-preservation efforts.
 
No Money From Trust Fund
 While Mr. Cuomo included a provision for land acquisition in his proposal for a state trust fund for environmental purposes, he said there would be no money for it soon.
In the meantime, deals like the one involving the 21-mile Raquette River property near here remain in flux.
Environmental groups met with the Governor recently and said they were encouraged that he had at least included a provision in his environmental fund that would allow land purchases sometime in the future, but many still urge that money be found now.
"Certainly by not having any money available at all for land, we are going to lose out on some critical parcels," said Lee Wasserman, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby, a nonprofit group based in Albany. "And the longer we wait, the riskier it becomes."

HEADLINE: New York State to Sue to Stop Evictions in Rent-Law Fight

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A New York State lawsuit to prevent a Federal agency from evicting hundreds of rent-regulated tenants from co-operative and condominium apartments in New York City will be filed today in Federal court in Manhattan, state officials said yesterday.
The suit, by Attorney General Robert Abrams and Angelo J. Aponte, commissioner of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, seeks to bar the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of the nation's savings and loan bailout, from evicting tenants occupying apartments the agency has acquired from failed thrift institutions. 
 Simmering for months, the dispute, which came to a boil last month with a Federal decision to evict nine rent-regulated tenants from a Manhattan condominium, brings the savings and loan bailout program into direct conflict with strict state laws protecting renters, a hallowed keystone of New York City housing.
"For the Resolution Trust Corporation to abrogate the leases of rent-regulated tenants protected by state law is an unprecedented and outrageous attack on the citizens of New York State," Mr. Aponte said yesterday.
 
A Question of Authority
 In the joint announcement, Mr. Abrams said the court would be asked to enjoin Resolution Trust from evicting any rent-regulated occupant of a co-op or condominium under its control and to issue a declaratory judgment saying, in effect, that the Federal agency had no authority to abrogate statutory tenancies or leases protected by state law.
"This lawsuit seeks to stop a reckless attempt by R.T.C. to go far beyond the authority granted to it by Congress, by trying to place the cost of the S & L bailout on the backs of innocent New Yorkers," he said. "New York will not allow the Federal Government to disregard the fundamental protections enjoyed by tenants during the co-op and condominium conversion process."
Felisa Neuringer, speaking for Resolution Trust, said she could not comment on the suit until its lawyers had studied it. But she contended that the agency was not exceeding its authority. She said the evictions were needed to stem the loss of almost $1 million a year and noted that low- and moderate-income tenants would not be evicted.
Since last September, when Resolution Trust said it planned to evict nine rent-regulated tenants from a luxury condominium at 444 East 57th Street near Sutton Place to sell apartments it acquired when it seized the assets of the Nassau Savings and Loan Company of Brooklyn, the Federal agency and state officials have been at loggerheads over the issue.
 
Protecting Nonbuyers
 The nine tenants did not buy their apartments when the building was converted to a condominium in the mid-1980's, but stayed on under laws intended to protect nonbuyers from eviction. They pay rents of $475 to $1,700 for apartments, each with two or more bedrooms, in one of Manhattan's most expensive areas.
Resolution Trust, after postponing action for five months, announced on Feb. 25 that it would repudiate the nine leases and said it also might move to evict the tenants of more than 900 other rent-controlled and rent-stabilized units it had acquired in 10 other buildings. By the end of this year, it expects to acquire 1,000 more apartments.
The agency also filed a suit naming Mr. Abrams and Mr. Aponte and asking the Federal court to nullify state rent regulations if they are used to prevent evictions or rent increases in buildings that have come under the agency's control. The action is pending.
Resolution Trust officials contend that they have been ordered by Congress to obtain the best financial return from real estate acquired from failed savings and loans. They say Congress gave the agency authority to supercede state laws, withdraw from contracts, evict rent-regulated tenants and sell unprofitable apartments to carry out its mandate.
But state officials argue that Congress granted Resolution Trust no explicit authority to abrogate leases, and that evictions would disrupt the lives of hundreds of tenants and undermine state laws that protect renters and maintain order in the conversion of units to co-ops and condominiums.
"It is unconscionable that the Federal Government has asked New Yorkers to pay once again for the savings and loan debacle," Mr. Abrams said.
And Mr. Aponte added: "The savings and loan crisis requires a national solution. We will not allow the Federal Government to run roughshod over state laws and regulations and trample on the rights of innocent families."

HEADLINE: Credit Card Reviews Stir Dispute

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
As banks are increasing efforts to distinguish between good and bad credit card customers, they are being accused of discrimination by lawmakers who object to more stringent credit standards for customers in economically depressed regions of the country.
Lawmakers from New England are asking whether a unit of the First Chicago Corporation crossed the line between prudent business judgment and discrimination earlier this year when it conducted a special review of credit card accounts in nine Northeastern states. 
 The review, which was criticized by political leaders in the region, resulted in the cancellation of 7,800 cards and reduced credit limits on 1,100 cardholders out of 1.7 million accounts that were reviewed.
First Chicago, which has 6.6 million credit card accounts and is the nation's third-largest card issuer, said in a response to questions from Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, that its review was not discriminatory toward New England.
The banking company noted that it had made special reviews of customers in other parts of the country when economic conditions and cardholder behavior raised red flags.
 
Increased Bankruptcies Cited
 Scott P. Marks Jr., the chairman of FCC National Bank, the First Chicago unit that handles its credit card business, said in the letter that bankruptcies among its New England cardholders in the first nine months of the year were 65 percent higher than in the comparable period last year.
Because of the rise, he said, the company decided to study some accounts before the regular renewal reviews that are held every two years.
Customers in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, were part of the review.
The accounts selected for a closer look were those that had been delinquent within the last 14 months or had an unpaid balance above the credit limit. The First Chicago review was also limited to accounts that had not been renewed in the last six months or were due for regularly scheduled reviews in three months.
Mr. Marks's letter said the credit standards applied in the Northeast were the same as those the bank normally used.
 
Need for New Law Questioned
 Federal law does not prohibit discrimination by geographical region, but some lawmakers are considering whether legislation is needed to prohibit the practice. Existing laws forbid discrimination on the basis of age, race, sex, or national origin.
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, said last week that the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Banking Committee would hold a hearing on March 22 on different credit standards for cardholders in different regions. "When people with the same income and creditworthiness are treated differently because of where they live, then I am concerned," he said.
Representative Kennedy, a member of the Banking Committee, has often criticized banks for discrimination in mortgage lending and for failure to provide low-cost services to the poor.
Aides to Representative Markey said they were studying how to modify existing anti-discrimination rules to include a ban on discrimination by region.
John Y. Coffman, the president of Management Decision Systems Inc., an Atlanta company that helps card issuers compile statistics on customers, said location was not an important consideration. "Some people once used ZIP codes to adjust for the inherent risk in certain areas, but now they don't do that because of political and legal implications," he said.
"It's prudent for card issuers to protect themselves when the economy" is weakening, he said. But too much emphasis on regional difficulties could mean a bank would lose good business when the regional economy improves, he said.

HEADLINE: Once, Welfare Meant Someone Else, But Recession Brings Home Its Sting

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRAMINGHAM, Mass.

 BODY:
Last June, unmarried and six months pregnant, Beth Chiaet, 28 years old, sat stunned as a caseworker told her what it would take to get her application for welfare approved.
She had to produce her birth certificate, a letter from her former employer stating the reasons she lost her job, a Social Security card, a driver's license and certification from her doctor that she was pregnant. 
 "I looked like a cow," she recalled, sitting in the cluttered room she rents in the basement of a house here. "How could I not be pregnant?"
To Ms. Chiaet (pronounced shy-ETT) the question, with its implications of distrust, only underscored how much her life had changed since she left her $18,000-a-year job as a nurse's assistant at a Massachusetts geriatric hospital.
Ms. Chiaet was forced by complications with her pregnancy to request a medical leave, but she said the hospital did not want to hold her job open at a time when the state was reducing its work force. Since beneficiaries of unemployment insurance must be willing and able to work, Ms. Chiaet could not qualify for its benefits. Her only option was welfare.
 
A Word That Didn't Apply
 Experts say more and more middle-class and working-class Americans are going through similar experiences as the recession deepens. Many of these new welfare clients have never received public assistance, and many never dreamed that the word "welfare" would ever apply to them.
There are many such families in this neatly tended Boston suburb, which has been hit particularly hard by the end of the high-technology boom that carried the area through the 1980's. But Framingham is hardly alone.
As the economy worsens, the nation's welfare caseload has exploded. A record 4.21 million families were receiving payments in December under Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the nation's largest welfare program, according to the American Public Welfare Association, a group representing state and local welfare agencies.
And many of the new clients were never on welfare before. There are no nationwide figures, but a survey of welfare offices in Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix, indicated, for example, that 54 percent of new applicants had never received welfare. In Maryland, the Center for Business and Economic Studies of the University of Baltimore has estimated that 36 percent of all new cases in the state were receiving welfare for the first time.
"Many of these new cases are families that had been making it -- not comfortably, to be sure, but families with strong work histories," said Cesar A. Perales, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services. "This recession, as one might expect, has brought new families into our offices in record numbers."
 
Documenting Lives
 Once there, many of these newly impoverished families find themselves feeling lost in a labyrinth of regulations, intended to prevent fraud, that force them to document every aspect of their lives. At the same time, they are torn between their need for financial help and the perceived stain of being on the public dole.
 "I felt like I was begging," said Shahidah Graham, 51, who was laid off from her job as a receptionist last June and who exhausted her unemployment benefits in January. "It was weird. It took me awhile just to get enough motivation to go down and apply."
A young Framingham couple with four children spent six months on welfare after the husband was laid off from his job as a manager with a computer company in November 1989 and exhausted his unemployment insurance. (He has since found a job selling computers, and the family is no longer on welfare.)
When the couple shopped for groceries, they would scout the aisles of the local supermarket to see if any friends or neighbors were inside. If they were, the couple, fearful of being seen using food stamps, would leave without buying anything.
They agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that their names would not be used. For several days, they agonized over that stipulation. On one hand, they said, they wanted to stand up as examples of middle-class people who, through no fault of their own, could end up on welfare. But in the end, they were overcome by the embarrassment such a disclosure would cause them and their families.
 
The Children Don't Know
 A divorced 36-year-old woman from Lexington, Mass., who spoke only on condition that her name not be used, is also concerned about the effect on her family of being identified as a welfare recipient. She has not told her two children that the family has started collecting benefits.
Several of those interviewed complained about what they termed the distrust and paternalism of the welfare regulations.
After her daughter was born, Ms. Chiaet returned with her baby to the welfare office to apply for an increase in her monthly payment. Her case worker told her that she needed to provide documents proving that her daughter had been born.
"We live in a society where you are innocent until proven guilty," said Ms. Chiaet, who has been unable to find work since her daughter, Shaina, was born six months ago. "In the welfare office, they treat you like you are guilty until you prove otherwise."
For families who have long thought of themselves as hard-working, honest citizens, this apparent unwillingness to be taken at their word is jolting. "Why can't they sift through their applicants and figure out who are upstanding citizens who have worked hard and tried to do the right things?" the Lexington woman asked.
 
A Bewildering World
 Running through many of their comments is an undercurrent of having crossed a divide, of having moved from what was familiar and respectable into a bewildering world they had thought of only in myths, misinformation and stereotypes -- when they thought about it at all.
Though his unemployment benefits ran out in July, the 38-year-old former telecommunications projects manager did not apply for welfare until September; he thought that only single women with children could qualify. At the same time, he and his wife were finding it increasingly difficult to buy enough food for their four children. The couple also fell four months behind on their mortgage payments and were $900 in arrears on utility bills.
It was only after a $3,000 hospital bill for their 13-month-old daughter and a friend's suggestion that the couple began to explore the possibility of getting public assistance.
Having made the decision to apply for welfare, all of those interviewed expressed shock at how little money the system provides. Ms. Chiaet, for example, gets $486 a month, plus $137 a month in food stamps, but her rent is $400 a month.
Before the woman in Lexington began receiving public assistance in February, her only income was the $500 she received monthly in child support payments from her former husband. Now, she gets $579 a month in public assistance, plus $190 a month in food stamps and Medicaid.
But the state confiscates her ex-husband's child support checks to offset its payments to her. The rent for her three-bedroom house is $1,100, and the woman says that if she does not find a job before the next rent payment is due she does not know how she will pay it.
Sucking on a pacifier, Shaina Chiaet fell asleep as her mother rocked her back and forth. As she cradled her sleeping child, Ms. Chiaet was asked about the lessons she would take away from being on welfare.
"I don't know," she said, "I really don't. Except, I know it's going to make me think twice about ever asking anyone for help again. I don't like the feeling. It's too degrading."

"It was weird. It took me a while just to get enough motivation to go down and apply." (Photographs by Rick Friedman for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Cuomo Scolds G.O.P. for Assailing Democrats on Gulf War

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 10

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today harshly criticized Republican leaders for political attacks against Congressional Democrats who voted against the war in the Persian Gulf, and said that the allied victory does not necessarily mean that the decision to go to war was the best one.
Mr. Cuomo, who supported the position of some Democratic leaders that sanctions against Iraq should have been given more time, said in a telephone interview that it still was impossible to know whether war was preferable to sanctions. 
 The Governor, like Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has maintained that continued economic pressure against Iraq might have accomplished President Bush's initial goals: forcing the Iraqi Army to leave Kuwait, restoring the Kuwaiti monarchy and gaining the release of hostages held by Iraq.
"Logically, you cannot say that if the President had had his way with that negotiation that it would have been less desirable than all the taking of lives and all the environmental damage and all the expense that followed," Mr. Cuomo said. "Can you say now that if the President had gotten his way with those three conditions that that would have been a failure, that that would have been appeasement? I don't think so."
 
Was War the Best Decision?
 Mr. Cuomo stressed that he was not saying that war was the wrong decision, only that it was impossible to know whether it was the best decision. He said he chose to address the issue, in response to a reporter's questions, because "the debate is leaving it out."
The Governor, who is frequently mentioned as a potential Democratic presidential candidate, gave his responses about the war and its political aftermath against the backdrop of a national euphoria over the end of the war and the return of the first American soldiers. Public opinion polls have shown support for Mr. Bush at record levels, leaving Democratic officials to question whether they can mount a credible challenge to him in 1992.
Republican political leaders have tried to capitalize on the public support for Mr. Bush by saying that Democrats who opposed the war, even as a matter of conscience, can expect to have their positions used against them in coming campaigns. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has called opponents of the war "appeasement-before-country liberals." The New York Conservative Party ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times last week asking, in reference to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's vote against the war, "Where was Pat Moynihan when Americans needed him?"
Mr. Cuomo called the tactics "cheap" and "foolish" and said they stood in stark contrast to this year's high-minded Congressional debate over whether to authorize the war.
"It's a shame that that magnificent debate should be desecrated now by tawdry politics that reveal conservative and radical Republicans at their very worst," he said. "What the conservatives have revealed is that what they're best at is negativism. Their whole philosophy is a sort of Willie Horton campaign technique."
 
'Candles to the God Mars'
 Mr. Cuomo said Republicans had erred by "holding themselves out as the party of war, which is the way it sounds."
"This country doesn't want somebody who burns candles to the god Mars," he continued. "We want somebody who can win a war that is forced upon us and made inevitable and can win the peace just as effectively."
The Governor, who stirred a controversy last fall by suggesting that the White House should try to negotiate with Iraq, said that Mr. Bush had in fact tried to negotiate an end to the conflict, directly through Secretary of State James Baker and "vicariously" through United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
"I don't think we could ever be faulted for not having tried to negotiate," he said.
Mr. Cuomo, who has said that he has no plans to run for President, repeatedly commended Mr. Bush and American troops for handling the war "superbly well." But he said the country's exhilaration would be multiplied if the White House could prove it was equally adept at making peace.
"We've proven that we're very good at war, and you need to be," he said. "Imagine the joy this country would experience if we could prove now we're very good at peace, which we haven't done yet."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN SERBIA DEEPENS DIVISIONS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, March 10

 BODY:
The political turmoil in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia, which continued today with the arrests of important anti-Communist opposition leaders, adds a new impetus to the forces pulling this multi-ethnic nation apart. The trouble comes after recent moves by Slovenia and Croatia toward seceding from the six-republic Yugoslav federation.
Political parties opposing Slobodan Milosevic, the former Communist who won Serbia's presidential election last year, said that at least 15 of their members were in jail in the aftermath of violent clashes on Saturday between police officers and demonstrators. 
 Armored units from the Yugoslav national army, sent to quell unrest after two people were killed and scores injured, rolled down the main streets of Belgrade late Saturday and guarded downtown buildings for nearly 24 hours before withdrawing. Late this evening, the police used tear gas in an effort to break up a crowd of several thousand young people, mostly students, who assembled for a rally near a downtown shopping district. There were no reports of injuries.
 
Serbia's Position Weakened
 Serbia, the country's most powerful and populous republic, has been the leading advocate of maintaining the existing federal system. Other republics, including Slovenia and Croatia, the two most northern regions, want a much looser arrangement and have taken initial legal steps toward secession.
Now Serbia finds its economy near collapse and its government unable to keep order in the streets. The Serbs thus appear less able to set terms in the negotiations among the republics over the future of the country. The talks have been stalled for months.
"These events leave Slovenia and Croatia in a substantially better position in the negotiations," said Slaven Letica, a former adviser to Croatia's president. "We've been expecting Serbia to explode for months."
The street battle on Saturday, in which a teen-ager and a 54-year-old policeman died, was viewed today by opposition leaders as the beginning of a decisive struggle to oust what they regard as a Communist Government by another name -- Socialist.
"We are entering a new era of political life: the slow and painful birth of democracy," Desimir Tosic, vice president of the Democratic Party, one of the opposition groups, said at a news conference today.
 
Western Policies Criticized
 Among those arrested over the weekend were Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Movement for Renewal and the organizer of Saturday's demonstration. Other opposition leaders were reportedly detained today in Belgrade and other cities.
Officials in Slovenia and Croatia said today that they planned to use the crackdown in Serbia in their campaign to persuade Western nations to change their policy toward Yugoslavia.
The two republics argue that the policies of the United States and of European nations in supporting Yugoslav unity have encouraged the national army to believe that it would have a free hand to intervene, if necessary, in opposing the breakup of the country.
Milan Kucin, the President of Slovenia, warned on Friday that "as long as the international community chooses to overlook the Yugoslav reality and prefers an integrated, united Yugoslavia, it contributes to keeping Yugoslavia a focus of instability."
 
Serbian Nationalism
 Slovenia and Croatia often portray their differences with the Serbs as a fight between Westward-looking democracies and "crypto-Communists" or "Bolsheviks."
The pivotal figure in the competing visions of the Yugoslav conflict is Mr. Milosevic. When Serbia's Communist Party dissolved in 1989 and its leaders formed the Socialist Party, they chose Mr. Milosevic, a former banker and leader of the Communists, as their presidential candidate. Emphasizing Serbian nationalism and a cautious attitude toward a market economy, he won an easy victory.
Earlier that year, the elections in Slovenia and Croatia were won by avowedly anti-Communist parties that emphasized nationalism but also pledged to move quickly towards privatization and free-market reforms.
Thus, the stage was set for conflict. As the Yugoslav economy continued to falter, Slovenia and Croatia, the wealthiest of the republics, contended that they were being dragged towards economic ruin by Serbia.
 
Economic Issues
 The giant firms that dominate the Serbian economy are sliding toward bankruptcy; many have not paid salaries in months. In an apparent attempt to shift public attention elsewhere, Mr. Milosevic has repeatedly raised nationalist issues, such as the plight of the Serbian minority in Croatia.
But on Saturday night, many demonstrators in the crowd said such problems were no longer very important to them. They said they had come to protest the economic hard times, particularly the rising unemployment that idles many young people.
Jelko Kacin, the deputy defense minister of Slovenia, said the weekend's violence would speed the pace of Yugoslavia's dissolution because it would restrain Mr. Milosevic from using nationalism in the future as a political weapon. "Now, people in Serbia have realized that the basic problem is not in the other republics -- it's in Serbia," Mr. Kacin said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: DIPLOMACY;
8 ARAB COUNTRIES BACK BUSH'S PLAN ON MIDEAST PEACE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 10

 BODY:
Six Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, along with Egypt and Syria, today endorsed President Bush's broad framework for dealing with the Middle East in the wake of the war with Iraq, including plans for a continuing and enhanced American military presence in the gulf.
American and Arab officials portrayed as a watershed event the fact that the Arab countries -- in particular the traditionally anti-American Syria -- were backing an American plan for stabilizing the Middle East that will include the presence of American naval forces and occasional visits of American ground troops. 
 Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar, alluding to what appears to be a new, powerful, moderate Arab coalition, said after a meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Arab foreign ministers, "You should not minimize the meaning of this."
 
Clear Differences on Israel
 The endorsement of Mr. Bush's plan meant that the Arab countries agreed that the American military presence in the gulf region, now being reduced, would continue to be larger than it was before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
But despite this broad agreement, the first high-level conference between the United States and its Arab allies since the gulf war revealed that the Arab ministers clearly differed with Mr. Baker on one very important detail: how to make peace with Israel.
With the Secretary of State due to visit Israel on Monday, Mr. Baker's mission was further complicated today by what Israeli political leaders said was an Arab terrorist attack in West Jerusalem. An Arab assailant, who said he was sending a message to Mr. Baker, stabbed four Israeli women to death and wounded at least one other woman, the Israeli police said. [Page A8.]
 
Arabs Firm on Israel
 If public statements from the Riyadh meeting are any indication, the gulf war does not yet appear to have in any way reshaped the Arab consensus on how to deal with Israel. The Arab ministers said they shared Mr. Bush's desire to address the Arab-Israeli dispute, but they reaffirmed their traditional stand that they would deal with Israel only through an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations.
Mr. Baker, by contrast, said an international conference would not be appropriate at this time. Privately, American officials describe such a conference as a "total non-starter," since Israel, which insists on direct talks, would never attend.
Mr. Baker emphasized that he spoke with each of the Arab officials about their taking new confidence-building steps to ease tensions with Israel, in return for parallel steps from the Israelis. He argued, after the meeting, that until he had had a chance to speak with the Israeli Government on Monday, to see what it is prepared to do, and then convey that to the Arabs, it would be premature to declare that nothing is new or possible.
 
Breakthrough in Relations
 "It is not surprising," said Mr. Baker, "that you don't have Arab governments coming out and unilaterally making statements about the steps they might be willing to take."
Whatever the Riyadh meeting leads to on the Arab-Israeli front, it will be remembered as something of a breakthrough in Arab-American relations. In their final statement, the Arab ministers endorsed the four-point approach outlined by Mr. Bush in his address to a joint session of Congress last Wednesday. In that speech, Mr. Bush called for an expanded American naval presence in the Persian Gulf, as well as continuing "American participation in joint exercises" with Arab gulf countries "involving both air and ground forces."
In addition, the Bush plan calls for arms control agreements to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction, economic development programs to bridge differences between the Arab haves and have-nots, and a renewed effort to open talks among Israel and the Arab countries and Israel and the Palestinians. The talks would be based on the principle of trading Israeli-occupied Arab lands for peace treaties between the Arab countries and Israel.
After today's two-hour meeting at the Riyadh guest palace, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, issued a statement in the name of the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Egypt.
It said they "expressed their appreciation for the statement delivered by President George Bush before the United States Congress, which dealt positively with the security of this region and the Palestinian question."
 
Baker to Meet Soviet Aide
 The statement added, in a clear allusion to the future American presence in the gulf, that the Arab ministers agreed that the task of establishing peace and security in the Middle East was "for all the peoples of the region and outside parties prepared to play a constructive role."
Considering the role the United States has assured for itself in the future of the gulf, it was no accident that Mr. Baker telephoned the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, immediately after the meeting and asked that the Soviet Ambassador to Egypt meet Mr. Baker at his hotel in Cairo to be briefed on the Riyadh talks.
On the question of arms control, Prince Saud said the Arab group agreed to "endeavor to transform the Middle East into a region free from weapons of mass destruction," which means nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
The Arab ministers made no reference to reducing the flow of conventional arms to the region, something that Mr. Baker once proposed but which the Bush Administration now appears to be abandoning given the demand of its Arab allies for better tanks, planes and artillery to protect themselves.
 
Good Opportunity Seen
 On dealing with the Arab-Israeli dispute, Prince Saud's statement said the Arab countries believed that the phase "following the liberation of Kuwait" provides the best opportunity to encounter the challenges "confronting security and stability in the region and to bring about a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the question of Palestine."
The statement added that the Arab ministers "are of the view that the convening of an international peace conference under the auspices of the U.N. is an appropriate framework to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories and to insure the national rights of the Palestinian people in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions."
Mr. Baker, by contrast, said the American position remains that an international conference, properly structured and at the appropriate time, "might be useful." But he immediately added, "This is not the appropriate time."
The substance of the meeting suggests that where the gulf Arab countries feel their survival is on the line -- in confronting Iraq -- they are prepared to consider all sorts of unprecedented approaches, including a continuing and open military cooperation with the United States. But on secondary issues, such as the Palestinian-Israeli dispute, they still prefer the safety of the Arab lowest common denominator -- at least for now.
 
Parley With Palestinians
 Mr. Baker said today that "some Palestinians" from the occupied territories had expressed an interest in meeting with him when he arrived in Israel on Monday and he would like to do so. The Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis has reportedly approved a list of Palestinians to meet with the Secretary.
When asked if a meeting between Mr. Baker and the Palestinians approved by the P.L.O. would not constitute a tacit resumption of the dialogue between the United States and the P.L.O., a senior Administration official said no. That dialogue was severed by Washington in June 1990 after the P.L.O. refused to condemn a terrorist attack by one of its member groups.
The official said all of the Palestinians being proposed to meet with Mr. Baker are known to the United States and have previously met with either American or Israeli officials. The official added that if the Palestinians "are serious" about a meeting with the Secretary of State, they are not going to send people who are known P.L.O. operatives.
Today's meeting of Arab ministers with Mr. Baker, which followed a meeting in Damascus last week among the same Arab countries, suggests that America's Arab allies in the gulf war intend to try to stick together after this conflict as a new Arab power bloc. Given its combination of wealthy oil lands, and muscular manpower countries, such as Egypt and Syria, this coalition could have extensive influence in setting the Arab agenda -- if it holds together.
As Prince Saud's statement put it, the eight Arab countries "recognize the importance of working together to prevent a recurrence of a similar aggression to that which befell Kuwait."
 
Some of the Ingredients
 The countries, he added, have a "common approach to the questions that greatly impact the future security, political and economic situations in the region."
On the question of a security structure to replace the 500,000 American troops still in Kuwait and Iraq, Mr. Baker said he and the eight ministers agreed it would consist of an Arab peacekeeping force made up of the six Arab gulf states plus troops from Egypt and Syria and an enhanced American naval presence in the Persian Gulf, along with regular joint training exercises between American air and ground forces assigned to the region on a non-permanent rotating basis. It would also include the prepositioning of large amounts of American equipment in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere so that if American troops had to be reintroduced quickly into the region, part of their weapons and supplies would already be in place.
Overlaid on this, Mr. Baker said, would probably be a United Nations observer force to monitor at least the Kuwait-Iraq border, something Washington was expected to push for in the Security Council very shortly.
The Arab ministers in their statement went out of their way to emphasize that this security structure was not aimed at Iran, which has expressed displeasure with the concept, and could end up actively opposing it.
As Prince Saud said, the eight Arab states "are keen to develop cordial relations with Iran." He added: "They reiterate that whatever arrangements they may agree upon shall not be directed against any other party.

HEADLINE: Square D Rejects Schneider Offer

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PALATINE, Ill., March 10

 BODY:
The Square D Company said today that its board had unanimously rejected an unsolicited takeover offer from Groupe Schneider S.A.
Square D had advised its shareholders last week not to tender their shares to Schneider, which is based in Paris. The French manufacturer of fuse boxes had begun a $78-a-share tender offer for Square D last Monday. The action taken today represents a formal rejection of the $1.98 billion offer, a Square D spokeswoman said. 
 "Your board strongly believes that this is not the right time to sell the company," Jerre L. Stead, the chairman of Square D, wrote in a letter to stockholders. He said the board had carefully reviewed the company's businesses, financial condition and future prospects. Square D makes electronic switches and controls.
 
Price Called Inadequate
 Mr. Stead said Goldman, Sachs & Company, the company's financial adviser, considered the $78 offer inadequate. He said the company's outside business consultant, Boston Consulting Group Inc., considered Square D's business potential over the next five years to be substantial.
Square D said that in light of Schneider's offer and pending litigation against the company, it had decided to hold its annual meeting on May 24, rather than in late April.
Schneider has said it will try to elect a new slate of directors at the annual meeting, but the new meeting date appears to give Square D more time to fight the replacement of its directors.
Schneider responded to Square D's statement, saying, "We believe our offer is full and fair, and we are confident that the shareholders of Square D will agree with us."
 
Estimating a Price
 Analysts have said Square D could bring $80 to $90 a share based on recent similar acquisitions. Square D executives have said they are not seeking potential buyers and declined to comment on speculation that a friendly buyer might step forward.
In his letter to stockholders, Mr. Stead said Schneider was trying to take advantage of the recession in the United States and the depressed American dollar.
"We will continue to explore all alternatives consistent with our long-term strategy to serve the interests of our stockholders and other constituencies," Mr. Stead said.
Square D is based in Palatine but is incorporated in Delaware, where state law requires a hostile bidder to receive the votes of 85 percent of the outstanding shares.
The shares of Square D closed on Friday at $80 each, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Lawsuit Is Filed
 Square D has filed a lawsuit in a state court in New York seeking an injunction barring Schneider from disclosing or using confidential information it received from Square D.
Square D said Schneider, which obtained the information in joint-venture talks that failed, illegally used the information to shape the tender offer.
In a separate lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Square D said it would challenge the bid and an expected proxy fight by Schneider on antitrust grounds.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Democrats Don't Need Sacrificial Lamb for '92

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Presidential elections are not canceled because the incumbent President is skyrocketing in the public opinion polls.
As a result, Democrats are putting on their game faces and beginning to confront the hard realities of the 1992 campaign. 
 This is still a pessimistic party as President Bush basks in the afterglow of the Persian Gulf war. But personal ambition and party imperatives are beginning to produce a few signs of life among the Democrats.
"I will admit that today it looks somewhere between unlikely and impossible that a Democrat will win the Presidency," said Robert S. Strauss, chairman of the Democratic National Committee in the Carter Administration. "But six months from now I don't know what it will look like. They haven't called off the election, and as long as it stays set there, the Democrats should field someone who can responsibly make the case on the issues the country must face."
Regardless of the Democrats' chances of recapturing the White House in 1992, the party has a compelling interest in producing a strong nominee. Democratic control of the Senate is at stake next year: The class of 1986, many of whom were elected with the narrowest of margins, will be back on the firing line.
 
Burden on the Party?
 In the House, redistricting and retirement could produce as many as 100 open seats, raising the possibility of major Republican gains there. Many party leaders worry that a weak Presidential nominee could be a heavy burden on Democratic candidates in some of these intensely competitive races.
"We should not be talking about a sacrificial lamb," said Nathan Landow, chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party. "We should be pursuing the strongest possible candidate to help all Democratic elected officials around the country."
The potential candidates, meanwhile, are trying to discern the political landscape beyond the war celebrations. How long will Mr. Bush's remarkable approval ratings hold? How lasting is the postwar optimism? Where is the economy headed?
Many Democratic strategists argue that the top tier of potential candidates still has the luxury of waiting until late spring or summer, when some answers may be more clear, before making their decisions. Their name recognition, established political networks and ability to raise money enables these hopefuls to mount a candidacy quickly. By many accounts, this group would include Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
While this is already a late-starting campaign, in part because of the war, some Democrats argue that there is still wisdom in waiting. "I think the country ought to be allowed some time to reflect on the war, to deal with the fact that we've won," said Bob Shrum, a Democratic consultant. "We don't have to go from a campaign in the Persian Gulf to a campaign in Iowa in a day."
Still, one party strategist said, some Democrats are quietly arguing that one of the big candidates should take the plunge sooner rather than later and try to pre-empt the field.
 
Gore Attracts Attention
 There is a rationale for this approach -- some believe it a good way to wrap up the nomination early -- but it also reflects a longing among some Democrats for a heavyweight to enter the fray. In recent weeks, George McGovern, who led Democrats to a landslide defeat in the 1972 election, has been one of the most visible Democrats testing the waters.
Mr. Gore is sending some of the clearest signals of his interest in a run for the nomination. His star rose among some political handicappers because he was one of the few potential candidates who voted for the resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf. And with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia now considered unlikely to run, Mr. Gore would have a clearer shot at offering himself as the candidate who is strong on national security.
A spokeswoman for the Tennessee Senator said he is "thinking very seriously" about a race.
But both Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Gore have a decision to make: Is 1992 the year to run their second campaign for the Presidency? If they lose, can either run a strong enough campaign to position him well for 1996? Or do they begin to acquire the aroma of perennial candidates?
The strategic considerations are different for the long list of other potential candidates who have never run before, and can use 1992 as a year to make their name and build their credibility for 1996.
 
Risks on Either Course
 The notion of positioning for 1996 is a popular one among some Democratic strategists, who suggest, as one put it, "A lot of these people who think they can bypass '92 and wait for '96 will be very sorry." Either way, there are risks: Not running and being usurped by some hardy warrior who emerges from 1992, or running and being politically destroyed in a doomed crusade.
Some Democrats say the party needs to take the long view and seek a nominee with staying power. "They're looking for somebody who can run a credible race in 1992, take advantage of a negative if it exists, but can run again in '96 and be President of the United States," said Tony Coelho, the former House majority whip.
In the meantime, Democrats continue to look for bright spots. Bob Squier, a Democratic consultant, suggested one last week: Politics is often a game of beating expectations. Right now, that will be easy for Democrats.

The leaders of New York City's municipal unions yesterday set aside their differences with Mayor David N. Dinkins over the removal of his chief labor negotiator and urged the Mayor to take the lead in a team effort to solve the city's worsening budget problems.
The union leaders, echoing concerns raised last week by business groups, urged Mr. Dinkins to convene a panel of union officials, bankers, realty developers and other prominent New Yorkers to negotiate a multi-year plan to close the city's budget deficits through shared sacrifices.
The group, they said, should be modeled after a similar group set up in the mid-1970's to bail out the city, then close to bankruptcy.
 
Name-Calling Last Week
 Yesterday's calm comments by the municipal union leaders were in sharp contrast with their angry name-calling last week, when they complained about "lies" and demanded the resignation of Budget Director Philip R. Michael. At that time union officials were upset by the disclosure of a city plan to defer wage increases won by hundreds of thousands of city workers to help close a city budget gap of more than $2 billion. 
 Instead of dismissing Mr. Michael, Mr. Dinkins accepted the resignation of his labor negotiator, Eric J. Schmertz, whom the union leaders strongly supported. Mr. Schmertz had previously threatened to quit, but the Mayor had persuaded him not to.
Rather than further inflame the union leaders, however, the resignation stilled them, at least for now.
"We are not going to comment on those kids fighting in the park," said Barry Feinstein, president of a teamsters' local that represents city workers. "Who said what to whom is of no moment. We want a forceful Mayor to take control and work together with us. If they don't do this, I don't know how they are going to survive."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Feinstein said the unions considered any wage-deferral proposal out of the question except as part of a long-term plan to solve the city's fiscal problems.
He said he did not want to ask workers to defer wages in one year to solve a short-term budget problem, only to see the workers lose their jobs the next year if the city finances continued to deteriorate.
Norman Steisel, the city's First Deputy Mayor, said on Friday that the administration would support a labor-business forum modeled after the one used during the 1970's fiscal crisis. But he said yesterday that he was not yet sure what form the forum should take or how much authority it should have.
He noted that one group, the Mayor's Management Advisory Task Force, which includes both union leaders and business people, was examining policy alternatives, like an early-retirement plan for city workers.
 
Turmoil 'Has to Stop'
 During the 1970's, when the city was struggling to raise cash to stave off bankruptcy, business and labor leaders worked closely together. After intensive negotiations, union pension funds bought city notes, and major realty developers agreed to prepay taxes to help the city find the cash it needed.
But the close cooperation between union and business groups only occurred after the pressure of an imminent default on the city's notes, and it is not clear whether any group set up now would be able to cooperate as closely without that kind of drastic deadline pressure.
Mr. Feinstein was joined in his call for a new forum to work out the city's problems by Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest of the city's unions.
Mr. Hill, in an interview on WNBC-TV's News Forum, which was broadcast yesterday but recorded on Friday -- before Mr. Schmertz was forced out -- said the administration was "locked into financial turmoil that has to stop."
"We are ready," he said, "to come to the table and work with this administration and the people of the city -- the real-estate community, the banking community and all of the communities that have an interest in seeing us survive -- and do it as partners."
 
'We Lost a Good Man'
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Hill said it would be "counterproductive" to discuss Mr. Dinkins's decision to accept the resignation of his chief labor negotiator.
"I pointed out to the Mayor there is no sense in beating a dead horse," he said, "We lost a good man."
As the union leaders envision it, the new labor-business forum would have a wide mandate. But Mr. Feinstein said it would not work unless Mayor Dinkins personally convened it and attended meetings and union leaders were made "equal partners" with the Mayor and other groups. City officials said it was unlikley that the Mayor would cede his authority to any business-labor groups.
The shift in tone of the union leaders -- from that of street brawlers complaining that the administration was "in the toilet" to that of labor statesmen -- was abrupt, and the reasons for it were not clear.
In the dispute over wage deferrals, the union leaders said Mr. Michael had lied when he sent a confidential memorandum to a bond-rating agency saying that negotiations had begun on the issue. Mr. Schmertz supported the union's view.
Later Mr. Michael provided copies of several memos showing that Mr. Schmertz was aware of the discussion about wage deferrals and had discussed them with several union leaders. One of the memos -- from Mr. Schmertz to Mr. Michael -- also suggested that negotiations were under way.
Asked if they were swayed by the memos that apparently supported Mr. Michael's version of events, the union leaders said they had not changed their view that he had lied to the bond-rating agencies, but they refused to discuss it further.
City officials said that despite the flap over the memorandum, the city was still seeking wage deferrals. Its worsening budget situation might require, they said, more than the 1.5 percent wage deferral called for in the memorandum.
 
Deeper Layoffs Suggested
 If the unions are unwilling to agree to wage deferrals, the city would need other savings, like deeper layoffs, to close its budget gap, they said.
Alan J. Proctor, the executive director of the state's Financial Control Board, which oversees city finances, said the board supported the suggestion by the union leaders that the city work out detailed plans to close its budget gaps over the next several years.
But he wondered whether the unions could be equal partners in the process. "It sounds like the unions want to get into the Mayor's brain, and he has no obligation to do that."
Others in and out of city government said the administration would have to find a permanent replacement for Mr. Schmertz quickly to avoid a prolonged period of labor unrest. Mr. Dinkins has appointed the First Deputy Labor Commissioner, James F. Hanley, as acting Commissioner, and asked Milton Mollen, the Deputy Mayor for Criminal Justice, to assist him.
While the city has settled several large contracts this year, well over a hundred others, including those with police, fire and sanitation workers, have yet to be negotiated. The contracts negotiated to date are all short-term, covering only a year to 15 months. They expire toward the end of 1992.
"The loss of Eric Schmertz is very sad," said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, "because he understood at least the problems of the unions and the union leaders.
"I don't know what will happen now. It seems that there will be tremendous problems in terms of labor relations in the city."

HEADLINE: British Tycoon Tries Proven Tactics To Negotiate a Daily News Takeover

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Robert Maxwell, the 67-year-old British entrepreneur, has a reputation for being as unpredictable as he is hyperactive. Guided by whim and instinct, he buys and sells businesses at a furious pace and runs through subordinates like paper clips. He once even dismissed one of his sons, Ian, for showing up late for a meeting.
But there is a remarkable consistency to the recovery program that Mr. Maxwell wants to carry out at The Daily News; it seems almost a carbon copy of the formula he applied to the London mass-circulation tabloid The Daily Mirror in the mid-1980's. 
 At The News, Mr. Maxwell says he wants to cut costs by more than $70 million a year by slashing roughly 800 jobs, or more than a third of the 2,300-member work force. In 1984, after he bought the Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr. Maxwell moved quickly to cut the payroll by 2,000 workers, or a third of the 6,000-person force.
At the Mirror Group, which includes six newspapers, led by The Daily Mirror and The Sunday Mirror, the Maxwell cost-cutting plan proved a great success. Today, the privately owned Mirror Group is a solid moneymaker and is estimated to be worth roughly $1 billion, or five times what Mr. Maxwell paid for it. Mr. Maxwell said recently that he ranks turning the Mirror Group from "a dead duck into a highly profitable enterprise" as one of his greatest achievements.
 
An Avowed Socialist
 Mr. Maxwell's personal wealth is placed at about $2 billion, making the once-impoverished Czechoslovak Jewish immigrant one of Britain's richest men. He was born Jan Ludwig Hoch on June 10, 1923, one of nine children, the son of unemployed farm workers. At 15, he fled his homeland, eventually joining the French Resistance. When France fell, he served in the British Army, changing his identity several times for security purposes when fighting behind enemy lines. Finally he settled on Ian Robert Maxwell, but he seldom uses his first name.
He is an avowed socialist and a former Labor Party member of Parliament. No matter how severe the cutbacks he has sought from journalists and printers, Mr. Maxwell has always negotiated with their unions.
That has made him very different from another outsider, Australian-born Rupert Murdoch, the British press tycoon, who one night in January 1986 moved his British newspapers to his modern plant outside London and locked the unions out, printing The Sun, The Times and other periodicals from a fortress surrounded by barbed wire and police guards.
Those who have been locked in negotiations with Mr. Maxwell find the experience singular and unforgettable. He is a man for whom 18-hour work days, seven days a week, are the routine, and the pace is accelerated during crucial talks. Round-the-clock sessions are not unusual. "You walk into a building to negotiate with Maxwell and you never know when you'll get out," said Brenda Dean, general secretary of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, which represents 180,000 printers and paper workers in Britain.
 
Fluent in Six Languages
 Ms. Dean, who sat across the table from Mr. Maxwell during the Mirror Group negotiations, recalled his disconcerting habit of attending to the details of his far-flung business empire while in the talks with the unions.
He would effectively be conducting three or four meetings at a time, one in person and the rest by telephone. Often, Mr. Maxwell, who is fluent in six languages, would shift from English to French to German in speaking to different parties. He would use this orchestrated chaos, Ms. Dean said, along with a large measure of brinkmanship, to keep the union negotiators off guard and try to extract additional concessions.
"With Maxwell, you think you've got a deal and you haven't," she said. "It's just bizarre."
In the case of the Mirror Group, the two sides eventually reached agreement. But Mr. Maxwell has not been hesitant to walk away from a deal if the terms do not suit him. Last October, for example, Mr. Maxwell dropped his plans to buy three of the United States' largest supermarket tabloids from Globe International Publishing Inc. of Montreal. Mr. Maxwell announced in May that he would buy the three tabloids -- The Globe, National Examiner and The Sun -- but walked away from the deal when he and Globe International could not agree on a price.
After he bought The Daily Mirror, Mr. Maxwell's imprint and face were all over the paper. Stories of his own exploits were regularly reported. When The Mirror started a circulation-boosting bingo contest, Mr. Maxwell's picture was on every card.
 
Thrives on Publicity
 But after a short while, when it became apparent that that approach was counterproductive, Mr. Maxwell changed and now meddles less in the paper's daily operations. Still, if the globe-trotting publisher meets with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as he does on occasion, the Mirror readers are likely to see a picture of it the next day. Unlike his archrival, Mr. Murdoch, who rarely makes public appearances, Mr. Maxwell seems to thrive on publicity. His French-born wife, Elisabeth, keeps annual scrapbooks for his press clippings, which typically tip the scales at 50 pounds.
"Bob Maxwell is a politician-turned-businessman," explained Joe Haines, a columnist for The Daily Mirror and, at one time, press secretary to former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. "And he behaves like a politician."
Today, The Daily Mirror serves up a blend of short and sometimes sensational news stories, editorials supporting the Labor Party and pictures of scantily clad young women. The Mirror sells more than 3 million copies a day, trailing only The Sun, a Murdoch paper, whose stories tend to be more sensational and whose models wear a bit less than in the Mirror.
The Mirror Group -- a private company owned by Mr. Maxwell, his family and a Lichtenstein trust called the Maxwell Foundation -- would acquire The News if his talks in New York City with the paper's striking unions produce an agreement. But today, the largest part of the Maxwell business empire is the public company, the Maxwell Communication Corporation, in which Mr. Maxwell, his family and the trust hold a two-thirds stake.
In the last few years, Maxwell Communication has become much more an American business, mainly through a pair of big corporate takeovers. In 1988, Maxwell Communication paid $2.6 billion for Macmillan Inc., the New York-based book publisher. The company then bought the Official Airline Guides, which publishes schedule guides and other travel information, for $750 million. At the same time, the company has sold most of its contract printing operations for about $1.4 billion. In the fiscal year ending this month, analysts expect Maxwell Communication to report pre-tax profits of more than $330 million on revenues of $2 billion.
The company has debts of about $3.2 billion, which has worried some investors who note the repayment problems other heavily indebted magnates, including Mr. Murdoch, have recently experienced. But Maxwell Communication has been steadily reducing its debts from a peak of $3.9 billion in 1989 and analysts doubt he is in trouble, since his next large repayment to his bankers is not due until 1992. "He's not facing any imminent cash squeeze," said Angela Bawtree, an analyst for Warburg Securties in London.
Today, Maxwell Communication derives 60 percent of its sales and income from North America. Mr. Maxwell has said he expects that to soon rise to 80 percent. With his growing business interests in the United States, Mr. Maxwell may want a larger public presence as well. That, some say, could be a motivation for his pursuit of The News.
"Robert Maxwell wants to be a household name in America," said Ms. Dean, the union official. "And a large metropolitan newspaper would give him that."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Puckett Isn't Part of Sympathy Lineup

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

 BODY:
DOES Rickey Henderson make you shake with anger with his "Brother, can you spare a million?" cant?
Feel let down when that all-American fellow Ryne Sandberg stepped out of character and threatened to become a free agent after the 1992 season if the Cubs did not acquiesce on his contract demands this spring? 
 Does Barry Bonds's constant "Can I have some more, please?" sniveling make you nauseous?
Well, baseball fans, take heart. As improbable as it may seem, there is still a $3 million-a-year ballplayer you can love: Kirby Puckett of the Minnesota Twins.
Puckett has long represented everything that is good about baseball. A veritable whirling dervish on the field, his signatures are as unique as his bald, shining dome.
Close your eyes and the memories come easily, pleasantly: Kirby Puckett leaping high up on the pliable center-field fence in the Metrodome to steal away home runs. Kirby Puckett, arms pumping to propel his bowling-ball body around the bases. Kirby Puckett, winning smile constantly affixed, his joy infectious.
Those qualities are counted on, not only by Twins fans and the public but by Puckett's peers.
"If two guys ever started whining -- Kirby Puckett and Robin Yount -- that's when I take my cleats off and go home," said Don Baylor, once a teammate of Puckett's and now a coach with Yount's Milwaukee Brewers.
Have no fear, sir. The Younts, the Pucketts don't whine.
Puckett didn't gloat when he became the highest-paid player in the history of the game in November 1989, signing a three-year, $9 million contract. Nor did he pout when all sorts of players, many arguably less-talented, overtook him even before the ink even dried on his contract.
A problem? "I signed a contract; I think I should honor it," Puckett said.
The player, thoughtful and precise in his beliefs, continued.
"Money and everything is great, and we all know that, but I want to have fun at what I do," he said. "I'm fortunate to have a job that, when I was a kid, I dreamed of doing. Every day I come to the ball park I am living a dream."
So even as Henderson stayed out of camp in search of sympathy to his plight as an "underpaid" $3 million-a-year player, Puckett dutifully reported to camp in Fort Myers, Fla.
He brought with him no baseball complaints even though he's being shifted from center field to right to make room for young Shane Mack. As for his place on the money roster, he said, "a lot of people say 'aren't you upset because a lot of guys have passed you?' I'm not upset. It's just their time. Maybe when my contract's up, it will be time for me."
No one group breathes more heartfelt sighs of relief than the Twins.
"When I see a guy like Ryne Sandberg with his almost-perfect image trying to get the Cubs to meet a deadline on a deal that has two years to run, I am grateful," Andy MacPhail, the Twins' general manager, said last week. "When I see the Rickey Henderson situation, I am grateful. Kirby has never uttered the word 'renegotiation.' "
Not that Puckett wouldn't listen if the Twins wanted to extend him. He's respectful of the document, but he's not stupid. And MacPhail acknowledged a desire to do something as long ago as December 1989, after players began to leap-frog over Puckett. Nothing has happened yet.
"Things have moved so fast and are in such a state of flux we're at a loss as to what would be appropriate," MacPhail admitted. "Our payroll is about $15 million, now, and we're concerned about whether or not we can sustain that. But we're in the process of sorting things out. One thing that helps us is Kirby. Even though he's been passed by, Kirby never loses sight of the fact that he is making $3 million a year."
Instead of being driven mad by the long green as well as the green-eyed monster, Puckett is filled with a wonderful perspective. "I grew up in the ghetto in Chicago," he said. "I can feel for how the other side feels."
He talks about the recession, acknowledges that the public, caught in real-world financial dilemmas, is growing intolerant of players' complaints. Though he will not condemn other players for those complaints, Puckett cannot make himself say the same things.
Instead, he just does his job, happily part of a quiet, honorable legion of players who think that's the way to go as they wait patiently for another chance to leap on the salary escalator. Until then, Puckett simply says, "The Twins have been good to me and I don't think I'm doing too badly."
Amen to that.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev The Great

BYLINE: By Stephen F. Cohen; Stephen F. Cohen is director of Russian studies at Princeton University.

 BODY:
Six years after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, on March 11, 1985, many commentators say his reform efforts have failed miserably. Some charge he has betrayed his betrayed his promises or that he has always been an imposter-reformer. They point to growing economic chaos and ethnic unrest, to his unpopularity at home and recent adoption of authoritarian measures. They conclude he is no longer worthy -- or never was worthy -- of our support.
This view is based on false assumptions. The first is that Mr. Gorbachev has had time to carry out his reforms and thus demonstrate his real intentions. In reality, he has undertaken the most ambitious changes in modern history. Their goal is to "dismantle" the state controls Stalin imposed and to achieve an "emancipation of society" through privatization, democratization, and federalization of the 15 republics. Such proposals were bound to face old traditions, social obstacles and political opposition. They could not have unfolded quickly or smoothly. Even if successful, they will need decades to sink roots, with traumatic setbacks along the way. 
 The second assumption is that the persistent economic problems and continuing absence of a market economy prove that Mr. Gorbachev already has failed. Perestroika is in crisis, but its achievements are remarkable. In the equivalent of a U.S. Presidential term, 1985 to 1989, despite stubborn opposition, Mr. Gorbachev legislated most of his radical proposals aimed at virtually replacing the existing system with a democratic and market system. No American President with such a record would be considered a failure.
Even more, Russia has come closer to democracy than ever before. Though democratization remains exceedingly fragile, how can this be dismissed as a failure? Mr. Gorbachev's economic policies have also made gains. Many conservatives have given up dogmatic opposition to market economy. Five million people now work in the cooperative sector. Grassroots struggles to create private enterprises are under way.
The third dubious assumption: Mr. Gorbachev has betrayed his professed goals by not allying himself with "radical democrats" led by Boris Yeltsin on the basis of a 500-day leap to a market economy; instead, he has turned to the military, K.G.B. and party to save himself.
In fact, radical democrats are few in number, weak in power and deeply divided. Moreover, their plan asked Mr. Gorbachev to inflict on tens of millions of citizens extreme anti-welfare and inflationary measures no U.S. politician would advocate.
Rapid privatizing cannot be carried out primarily from above, because the vast bureaucracy controls 90 percent of the economy and opposes it. A market economy must be carried out by millions of citizens who have been empowered to do so by Mr. Gorbachev's legislation and are willing to become risk-taking entrepreneurs. Opinion surveys show relatively few are ready to do this.
Faced with growing destabilization and opposition, Mr. Gorbachev is trying to save perestroika from collapse or overthrow by forming a coalition with new conservatives who have emerged in traditional bastions of power. While resenting the "excesses" of Mr. Gorbachev's political reforms and demanding that he hold the union together, they substantially support a market economy and even some democratization. They are not the despotic "reactionaries" Eduard Shevardnadze warned against when he resigned as Foreign Minister.
We may regret Mr. Gorbachev's new political strategy, but it is frivolous to disregard the circumstances that compelled it, and a larger truth: authentic reform will be gradual and consensual or it will be nonexistent.
The fourth false assumption is that all democratic-minded Soviet citizens oppose Mr. Gorbachev and support Mr. Yeltsin, and so must we. This generalization applies mainly to Moscow-based liberal intellectuals, from whom our media get most of their political perspectives. Many pro-democracy intellectuals in the provinces are far less radical, and large segments of the populace remain allergic to all the reforms.
Nor is it true that all Moscow democrats have fully repudiated Mr. Gorbachev. They have rightly denounced the bloodshed in the Baltics, but some have long urged him to resort to other authoritarian measures to save the reform process. Not a few mistrust Mr. Yeltsin. Do the impatient radicals who have given up on Mr. Gorbachev really understand their own political possibilities? Or are they continuing the intelligentsia's long tradition of maximalism that has undermined reform in Russian history?
None of this means Mr. Gorbachev has been a faultless leader -- only that he has entered history as a great reformer and, if Eastern Europe is included, liberator. If reform is to succeed, another and different kind of leader eventually will be needed. But for now there is no persuasive evidence that one has approached center stage or that his time has come.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Technology Help Needed In Northeast

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
AFTER a period of broad prosperity in the early 1980's, thanks mainly to the high-technology industry centered on Boston, the Northeast finds itself going through a recession more severe than that in most parts of the country.
Now hopes for recovery in the region are riding partly on biomedical and biotechnology companies, according to Dr. Jerome Krasner, professor and department head of electrical/electronic engineering technology at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. "At least these companies will keep our local economy from getting worse," he said last week, adding that some will need more engineers and technologists. 
 "My area is biomedical, not to be confused with biotechnical," Dr. Krasner said. He describes biotech as "wet chemistry," which involves processes that replicate proteins, generate artificial insulin and deal with molecular biology.
In contrast, the biomedical area is concerned with the development and operation of medical equipment, including prosthetic devices often individually tailored, monitoring units for patients in hospitals, and new methods for blood analyses. "There is a continuous demand for new types of medical devices to meet doctors' needs," he said.
"As demographics change," he added, "the focus will be more on geriatric needs of an aging population. Biomed is a multibillion-dollar business in Massachusetts alone, with some 1,500 biomedical companies here."
He called a Hewlett-Packard subsidiary "one of the biggest, having about 46 percent of the patient-monitoring market."
Others in the biomedical field in the Boston area include units of the Kendall Company, C.R. Bard Inc., as well as Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corporation, a joint venture of the big foreign chemical company and the American glass maker to make blood analysis devices.
Currently, Dr. Krasner said, the biomedical companies have to import many engineers and technologists from out of state. For example, Hewlett-Packard tends to hire those with degrees from Stanford University and the California Institute of Technology, as well as from M.I.T., with a background in mechanical or electrical engineering or computers. They learn on the job to relate their expertise to the biomedical field.
He hopes to help remedy the shortage of technology experts in the Northeast by training more people in the biomedical field at Wentworth, where he introduced a course last September called Basic Principles of Biomedical Engineering.
"We have 27 students in it now, including 7 either out of work or considering career changes," Dr. Krasner said. "One has a background in manufacturing, three are electrical engineers, one is a mechanical engineer, one is a computer expert and the seventh is a young lady who works with A.T.& T. in the communications area and who thinks biomedical technology is the wave of the future."
Wentworth is a little different from many engineering schools in that it offers an associate degree in engineering technology after two years, thus producing technologists. If students continue for two more years to take engineering technology and a variety of liberal arts courses they can earn a bachelor of science degree in engineering technology. "About 70 percent continue for this degree," Dr. Krasner said.
Wentworth's competition for producing engineers with technology backgrounds comes mainly from Purdue and Penn State, he said, adding: "We graduate about 1,000 a year with associate or bachelor of science degrees in technology, not necessarily medical technology.
"At Wentworth, we determined industry needs more engineers with hands-on experience, so we have a cooperative program in the biomedical field. And our students work at places like Children's Hospital and the New England Medical Center. I have more cooperative jobs available with hospitals and research companies than co-op students to fill them."
By "co-op students," he meant juniors and seniors who are required to work in jobs related to their studies for two semesters.
Another growing field, Dr. Krasner pointed out, is hospital risk management, in which engineers handle and repair the highly sophisticated equipment. He said the need for such engineers would increase in the fall when a new law becomes effective that requires hospitals to report the failure of equipment. The institutions may face fines if patients are injured.
Salaries for biomedical specialists with associate degrees range from $22,000 to $27,000; with a bachelor of science degree they can receive $30,000 and up. At the supervisory level, pay ranges from $52,000 to $90,000, Dr. Krasner said.

The 'Right' Price For Oil in the U.S.

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE gulf war made one thing clear: Even with Iraq and Kuwait not producing, the Middle East can flood the world with enough oil to push crude oil prices down to $15 a barrel and perhaps lower. The United States, in sum, might find itself back in the old days of cheap oil. Is that good news for the American economy? Or would $10-a-barrel oil, once such a blessing, be a curse today?
The answers vary. Homeowners who use oil heat would applaud; so would car owners who drive a lot. The airline industry might use the savings from lower fuel bills to invest in more planes and, similarly, a United Parcel Service might buy more delivery trucks and hire more drivers. "Low oil prices stimulate investment in energy-intensive industries, and this promotes economic growth," said Michael Keran, chief economist at the Prudential Insurance Company of America. 
 But that is in the short run. Cheap oil also means rising usage and, inevitably, more oil spills that damage the environment and more engine fumes that pollute the air, raising the cost of health care. Outlays for solar energy and other alternatives to high-priced petroleum would probably be canceled or delayed. Cheap foreign oil also cuts into the profits of the American oil industry, whose production costs are so much higher than Saudi Arabia's.
"When I fill up my Toyota, the price of gasoline should reflect all the environmental, social and health costs for American society," said Eric Hirst, an expert in energy efficiency at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
There are more pros and cons. But divisive as they are, through most of them runs the suggestion of a compromise -- a price range apparently acceptable to the various interests. The compromise range is generally $17 to $23 a barrel for crude oil. Albert T. Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, for example, puts the "neutral" figure for the economy at $20 a barrel.
"That balances all of the interests," he said. "It does not waste our oil reserves. It is not so high as to impair consumption. And it contributes to conservation more than a lower price."
Crude oil at over $17 a barrel might be expected to anger consumer advocates. But Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director at Citizen Action, a consumer group, says that consumers seem to accept an unleaded gasoline price of $1.10 a gallon, which comes with $20-a-barrel crude. "That is public reality," he said, adding that Citizen Action also favors conservation and less pollution -- goals achieved partly through higher-priced oil.
Free-marketeers might also be angered at attempts to keep crude oil prices above $17 a barrel, when an oversupply could drive the price well below $15, once Iraq and Kuwait return to production. One rule of thumb cited by economists holds that for every $10 decline in the price of crude oil, Americans save $60 billion a year that can be spent to improve their living standards.
But some free-market advocates also distinguish between the free-market price and the right cost of oil for the American economy. If the free market dictates a $10 price, then Americans should pay only that price to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countires, meeting this week in Geneva. Within the United States, however, an extra $10 could be raised through a tax on imported oil or some other method that channels funds into pollution control, the development of alternative fuels and the like.
The price, in effect, would be $20 a barrel, but for imported oil, half the outlay would stay at home.
The gulf war has helped to convert some economists to this view, among them Prof. Alan Blinder of Princeton University. Once an opponent of an oil surcharge, he would use a surcharge now to guarantee access to Middle Eastern oil. "My rationale is that it is a national defense surcharge, to pay for the periodic wars and other outlays that might be necessary to assure a supply of oil," he said.
There are exceptions, of course, to the view that oil should be valued within the United States at $17 to $23 a barrel. Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, notes that at nearly $20 a barrel today, 1,000 drilling rigs are exploring for domestic oil, while in 1981, with the price at $30 a barrel, 4,600 rigs were in action. From a different viewpoint, petrochemical companies might object to an import tax, arguing that their cost of crude, from which plastics are made, would be higher than that of overseas competitors, paying the free-market price.
But such opposition appears to be outside the mainstream view. As Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, put it: "I would guess that if you poll people who think of these things, they would say a range between $17 and $23 a barrel would be the healthiest for the United States economy."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Egypt;
Baker Tells Cairo He'll Put in a Good Word With the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 11

 BODY:
Declaring that the United States is encouraged by Egypt's progress in reforming its economy, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that he hoped to press Cairo's case for further help from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
"The U.S. is frankly very encouraged by and appreciative of the efforts the Government of Egypt is making in the reform of its economy," said Mr. Baker, who met with President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid on his Middle East tour. "We would like to assist. to the extent that we can, with the I.M.F. and with the World Bank." 
 Because Egypt is expected to play an important role in the postwar era in the region, Egyptian officials have been hoping the United States can use its influence to help break a three-year-long deadlock with the I.M.F. The international lending agency has demanded a tough package of economic reforms from Cairo in return for a new loan and, more important, its imprimatur on new credits.
 
Wide-Ranging Talks
 The talks between American and Egyptian officials here today ranged widely over several areas, including the Arab-Israeli dispute and regional security in the wake of the war with Iraq. Although Mr. Baker said the discussions did not involve specific questions of aid to Egypt, he did say they covered "overall economic cooperation" in the Middle East.
Among other things, he said, there was a discussion about whether the World Bank should play a larger role in the development of the Middle East as a whole, including the possiblity of creating a regional development bank.
In response to demands from the I.M.F., which functions as a sort of clearing house to approve the creditworthiness and financial soundness of developing nations, Cairo has reduced subsidies on some consumer goods and abolished fixed interest rates on loans and desposits. Last month, Egypt also took steps to introduce a fully convertible pound, the value of which is tied to international currency markets.
But the I.M.F. has insisted that Cairo also take other steps as part of a complete package of economic reforms, including reducing Government subsidies on sales of gasoline to consumers.
 
Next Move Is Egypt's
 An official close to the I.M.F. in Washington said that the two sides were close to agreement, but that Egypt still had to come up with a final plan.
Although the United States has one-fifth of the votes on the I.M.F.'s executive board, it is not clear just what Washington can do on Egypt's behalf. "The U.S. has as much interest as the I.M.F. in making sure that the Egyptian economic program is sound and worthwhile," the official said.
Cairo has recently asked several Western governments to press the I.M.F. to ease its terms.
At the core of Cairo's economic difficulties is an external debt that was estimated at more than $50 billion before the beginning of the war with Iraq. Egypt's revenues have been further damaged as a result of the Gulf war, even thought the United States and the Arab Gulf nations helped ease Egypt's debt burden recently by forgiving some $13 billion worth of debts.
In addition to the loss of millions of dollars in income from Egyptian workers forced to flee the Gulf, Egypt has seen a decline in transit fees through the Suez Canal as a result of a decrease in shipping, and a sharp drop in tourism. Government officials estimate that Egypt has lost more than $2 billion in tourist revenues during the winter season, because visitors were afraid to travel to the region during the war.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Declines in New York; Silver Prices Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of precious metals futures fell yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York as the market reacted to the dollar's strength and a decline in crude oil prices.
Gold settled $5 to $5.20 lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell $5 an ounce to settle at $364.70. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid for gold of $365.00, off $4.50. 
 Silver prices fell sharply in what traders called a technical correction. Since the end of the Persian Gulf war, prices had advanced about 70 cents from an 18-year low.
 
Correction Was Expected
 Silver had advanced in recent weeks, based partly on speculation that the end of the war would speed an economic recovery in the United States and bolster demand from industrial users.
Analysts said a correction in silver prices was expected after recent gains.
Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York, said gold futures fell as the dollar strengthened and crude oil prices eased.
Copper futures declined sharply on the Comex, reflecting what brokers called internal market influences. Copper was 1 to 2.35 cents lower, with the March contract at $1.0990 a pound.
 
Grain and Soybeans Off
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as weekend rains in Brazil and lagging export business weighed on the market.
Soybean futures were under pressure as a result of widespread rain in southern Brazil during the weekend. Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago, said it was unclear how the unexpectedly heavy late-season rainfall affected that nation's crop. But it is likely that areas of Brazil that planted late will benefit.
Corn and wheat futures were pushed lower by spillover selling, with wheat also under pressure by forecasts of rain at midweek in the Plains States.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Moderately Higher Despite Central Bank Moves

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar made moderate gains yesterday against foreign currencies despite two concerted efforts by central banks to rein in the postwar advance.
Central banks in Europe, apparently with the exception of France's bank, aggressively sold dollars to try to drive down the value of the American currency and curb a flurry of buying by overseas investors, traders said. 
 The Federal Reserve later joined a second round of interventions when exchanges in the United States opened to another burst of buying.
The unified selloffs helped knock the dollar off its highs for the day. The dollar, which traders said peaked at 1.5870 German marks earlier in the Unitied States session, ended at 1.5815 marks.
But traders said the interventions failed for the most part to curb the market's widespread belief that postwar euphoria has primed the United States for an economic recovery.
The advance came despite two factors on Friday -- a negative unemployment report and declining interest rates -- that would ordinarily drive down the dollar.
"The underlying bullish sentiment is definitely prevailing," said Marc Cohen, a vice president in foreign exchange at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York.
Continued skittishness about unrest in the Soviet Union also supported the dollar's advance by pushing down the German mark. Traders said they were worried about the possibility of losses on German loans to the Soviet Union and about the chances that Germany's economy could suffer from unrest in neighboring countries by forcing it to absorb refugees.
Weekend demonstrations were held throughout the Soviet Union attacking President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and calling for his resignation.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8505, from $1.8720 late Friday. The pound also slipped in New York, where 1 fetched $1.8515, less expensive than $1.8645 late friday.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.07 yen, up 1.77 yen from the Friday close of 136.30 yen. Monday's close was the highest since the dollar bought 138.30 yen on Sept. 12. Later, in London, the yen was quoted at 138.05.
In New York, the dollar settled at 138.20 yen, up from 136.82 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Friday rates, included: 1.3705 Swiss francs, up from 1.3692; 5.3845 French francs, up from 5.3515; 1,180.00 Italian lire, up from 1,174.00, and 1.1558 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1614.
Other late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.5800 German marks, up from 1.5625; 1.3710 Swiss francs, up from 1.3640; 5.3795 French francs, up from 5.3210; 1.7810 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7610; 1,179.75 Italian lire, up from 1,167.50, and 1.1555 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1618.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Israel;
Israelis Kill 6 Armed Arabs Entering From Jordan

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 11

 BODY:
Israeli troops shot and killed six heavily armed Arab gunmen who had crossed the border from Jordan this morning, hours before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived for talks intended to foster Arab-Israeli peace, officials said.
The army said the guerrillas were the largest and best-armed group to attempt entry from Jordan in memory. They carried automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and dynamite. Three Israeli soldiers suffered slight or moderate wounds in the two-hour gun battle near kibbutz Tirat Zvi, just south of the Sea of Galilee. 
 Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of the area, said the army believed the guerrillas, like the Palestinian who stabbed and killed four Israeli women Sunday evening, intended "to perpetrate a grandiose attack before the American Secretary of State."
The killings bring to 10 the number of deaths during the last 24 hours in violence related to Mr. Baker's visit.
The number could actually be 12 if an incident in the Gaza Strip this evening proves to have been deliberate, not accidental. A Gaza resident ran down an army patrol just outside Gaza City, killing two soldiers and wounding two, the army said. The driver fled.
"We don't know what happened yet," an army officer said. "We still don't know if it was an accident."
 
Visit to Old City Canceled
 While still in Cairo, State Department officials announced that Mr. Baker had canceled his tour of Jerusalem's Old City, which had been scheduled for this afternoon, because they believed the situation here was too tense. The army had already closed off Jerusalem to all Palestinians.
Despite the growing violence, the office of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated today that the Government had no plans to show any new flexibility to Mr. Baker.
 
Soviet Emigre Among Dead
 If, through Mr. Baker, "the Arabs come and tell us that territory is the primary objective of negotiations," said Yossi Ben Aharon, the Prime Minister's chief of staff, "it is a sign that they are not really aiming for peace."
Mr. Ben Aharon said the deaths had only hardened Israel's view, while Israelis of the political left said the killings showed that Israel must compromise with the Arabs and make peace to end the violence.
The deaths "show the need of Israel to be strong and to be capable of dealing with these threats to the safety and the security of these people," he said.
As he spoke, funerals were under way for the four Israeli women stabbed and killed Sunday by an Arab assailant from Gaza. Among them was Bela Levitsky, 60 years old, who had immigrated from the Soviet Union two months ago.
"We had heard about the intifada" before the move, Mrs. Levitsky's daughter-in-law Jana, said through tears at the funeral. "But we had never imagined it would reach us. She had really wanted to immigrate to Israel and be with her children here."
 
Sharon Sheds Immigration Role
 Israeli officials and Soviet immigration specialists have been openly worrying that the tense security situation, and deep cuts in economic benefits for immigrants, might dissuade thousands of Soviet Jews from moving to Israel.
In the last two days, the Israeli press has been filled with vivid pictures showing hundreds of recent Soviet immigrants rooting through the garbage at an outdoor market, looking for food.
As a result of these and many other problems, Housing Minister Ariel Sharon announced that he was resigning as the nation's "immigration czar" because of what he called the Government's "total failure" to provide jobs, housing or adequate benefits for the immigrants. He will remain as Housing Minister but will no longer be in charge of coordinating the overall immigration strategy.
Mr. Sharon complained that the Government was unsupportive and inattentive to the immigrants' plight.
 
'Baker, Go Home!'
 During demonstrations this afternoon at the site of the knife attack, protesters debated Mr. Baker's visit.
"Baker, go home!" one man shouted. "You want to give them a country?"
Sooner or later, Israelis expect the United States to ask them to give up territory in exchange for peace. An opinion survey published in Yedioth Aharonoth today shows the public evenly divided on whether Israel should trade land for peace; 49 percent favor the idea and 49 percent oppose it.
Another demonstrator this afternoon belonged to the other camp.
Zvi Ginsburg, who carried a placard advocating capital punishment for the killer, said Mr. Baker's trip was positive. "He should try to convince the Likud and the other people who make the decisions right now that to negotiate we must give up territories. Otherwise we and our children and our grandchildren will have to live in war. We must come to an understanding with the Arabs."

HEADLINE: Virgin Atlantic Cutting Fares

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, March 11

 BODY:
Virgin Atlantic Airways said today that it was cutting its trans-Atlantic fares by 15 percent and offering other promotional fares. Certain New York flights are being offered for as little as $184 one way.
The 15 percent cuts are in celebration of the Government's decision to open access to Heathrow Airport to new airlines, the carrier said. 
 The cuts apply immediately to full economy and advance- purchase fares on flights out of Gatwick Airport to New York, Miami and Los Angeles through the summer. A one- way full-economy flight to New York on a weekend would be cut cut to $558 from $657.
Virgin Atlantic said it hoped to start service from Heathrow to New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo in June.
On its special promotions, Virgin Atlantic is cutting its New York fare to $184 each way until April 1. From April 1 to June 30, its round-trip promotional fares will be cut to $556 from $692 for New York; to $649 from $817 for Miami, and to $742 from $939 for Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Low Oil Prices Are Bad, Some U.S. Experts Say

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
American oil experts are closely watching a fractious OPEC as it meets in its first session since the Persian Gulf war, with many hoping for the same things that some OPEC members want: a new agreement that will hold down production, so prices will stabilize or rise.
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other members abandoned all production restraints during the war to stop prices from getting out of control. Now that the war is over, they are arguing over who should cut back and by how much. 
 Government officials have said at various times that the United States does not have a target oil price, and that this country favors prices in the range of $18 to $20 a barrel. Before the war in the gulf, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set a target price of $21 a barrel, which would mean prices in this country of closer to $23, but OPEC was well shy of that price when the target was set, and exceeded it last year only because of the war.
 
Paying for the War
 Theodore Eck, the chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, said: "The signal has been, we understand that OPEC exporting countries have to pay for the war, the cleanup and all this kind of stuff, and they're going to need some money."
In fact, regardless of any signaling by this country, many of the oil companies are hoping for a price in the OPEC target range to bolster domestic drilling. So are people in businesses linked economically to oil companies and to the economies of oil-producing regions in this country.
But the organization, by its own calculation, is producing substantially more oil than the world demands, raising the prospect that prices will fall. While the Bush Administration has not publicly articulated the point, many analysts contend that this is bad for the United States.
"Prices may fall to the mid-teens, and this is a disaster for the United States," said Charles Ebinger, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington. "What we're likely to see at those kind of prices is a further erosion of domestic oil-producing capacity, and rising imports, precisely from the region where we just saw this conflict," he said. "We are setting ourselves up for a situation where in 5 to 10 years imports will be 60 to 70 percent of our consumption."
 
Encouragement to Consume
 Wilfrid L. Kohl, the director of the international energy program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that the impact of a price decline on this country "depends on where you sit," with consumers benefiting and producers suffering. But if the price stays down, he said, "it encourages consumption again, which we certainly don't want to do." And with no agreement now, he said, it will be harder still when Kuwait and Iraq eventually repair the damage to their oil industries and resume exports.
Not everyone agrees that a new OPEC accord is desirable for this country, or even of much importance. Philip K. Verleger Jr., a fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said stocks were too low and companies would not build inventories until the price of oil on the spot market was sharply lower than the price offered on the futures market for delivery one year hence. That price has lately been around $18.50, and re-stocking would occur if the price for immediate delivery hit $15.50, he said.
Mr. Eck of Amoco said that to him, world demand and world supply seemed pretty much in balance. "The end of the war was a non-event," he said, speaking of the effect on oil supplies. Spring usually brings a global decline in demand of about 2 million barrels a day, he said, but this year, maintenance work in the North Sea, which is outside OPEC's control, will push down production there.
In previous years, he added, a spring price decline occurs because the Soviet Union increases exports in that season. But noting that country's economic decline, he added, "this year, who knows?"

HEADLINE: Weicker, Citing Union Delay, Says More Staff May Be Cut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 11

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that unions representing state workers had failed to give any "positive response" in negotiations over givebacks to reduce Connecticut's budget deficit and that he would re-examine his budget plan for further cuts in personnel.
A spokeswoman for the Governor added that everything would be considered for the fiscal year beginning July 1, including layoffs above the 1,100 he estimated in his budget address last month. 
 Mr. Weicker has asked the unions to accept a pay freeze and other benefit reductions, totaling about $400 million. Today's announcement came as his plan for an income tax on wages was also about to face its first major tests in the General Assembly.
Two alternative budget plans, one proposed by Republicans, the other by Democrats, are moving through the Assembly, and neither includes an income tax.
Mr. Weicker, an independent governor with no members of his own party in the Legislature, has argued that the wage tax, however unpopular it may be, is the only way to fill a $2.4 billion shortfall in state revenues and still allow cuts in business taxes that he says are necessary to stimulate the state's economy.
His budget plan , announced last month, also counted on cutting about $700 million from the spending plans made formulated last year by state agencies, and also on $400 million in pay and benefit reductions from the state's 50,000 employees.
 
Unions Urge Long Talks
 Discussions with the unions have produced no agreements, and Mr. Weicker's abrupt announcement today came after union officials proposed a long-term schedule of discussions that would extend into April.
"Unfortunately, the budget crisis does not permit for protracted dialogue on the size or shape of the table," he Mr. Weicker said. "As of 3:30 P.M. today, I am going back into the budget to address personnel matters."
A spokesman for the union coalition, Robert J. Krzys, said state employees were not trying to delay the talks, process, but rather trying to "crystallize them discussions and move them forward." He said an extended timetable was necessary because so many union contracts were already signed and would have to be re opened. "We're not going to get anywhere by not talking," he said.
Mr. Weicker's budget would cut the 8 percent sales tax, now the highest statewide rate in the nation, almost in half, to 4.25 percent, but greatly expand the goods and services subject to it.
The plan would also reduce the corporate profits tax to 11.5 percent from 13.8 percent. The state's 7 percent tax on capital gains and the tax on interest and dividend income, which peaks at 14 percent for income over $100,000, would be eliminated.
Instead, all income, including capital gains and dividends and interest, would be treated alike, taxed at a 6 percent flat rate on all income over $25,000 for a family or $12,500 for an individual.
The Democrats' alternative plan, being formed this week by the leaders of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, would leave Mr. Weicker's spending cuts mostly in place, including the $400 million in employee reductions. Instead of an income tax, the sales tax would be greatly expanded to include many items not now taxed.
 
Taxing Gasoline and Utilities
 The final list has not been agreed on, but the preliminary list includes an 8 percent tax on everything from gasoline and to all household utility bills, including heating oil and electricity.
Extending the sales tax to cover brokerage commissions on for sales of real estate and stock, and also rent for commercial buildings, is also being considered. Another proposal in the committee would raise the dividends and interest tax to a peak of 15 percent.
The Republicans' plan will not be completed until April, after the formal public comment is over, but they say that it will include some constitutional cap on spending growth and some unspecified tax increases.

HEADLINE: A State's Fight to Save Babies Enters Round 2

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANOLA, Miss.

 BODY:
Mississippi has turned infant mortality statistics that were once the nation's worst into those that many states envy. But now comes the hard part.
Much of the progress has come from an unusually generous expansion of medical insurance for poor women, allowing them to get regular prenatal care and be hospitalized when their children are born. But while medical insurance addresses one cause of infant death, lack of access to health care, it does not address others. 
 Mothers who eat poorly, smoke or drink during pregnancy risk having babies who are sick or who die. So do mothers who become pregnant at too young an age, or who do not allow adequate time between their pregnancies. So do those whose children return to rundown homes, where the risk of disease is high. And many women are caught in webs of poverty and chaos that keep them from seeking out care, even when it is available.
 
A Second Set of Programs
 To address these problems, Mississippi is starting a second, and in some ways more uncertain, set of initiatives, based not in hospitals but in homes. One experimental program sends teams of nurses, nutritionists and social workers into the homes of high-risk mothers to promote healthy behavior. Other programs organize women as peer counselors and try to establish health networks among community leaders.
"We've largely fixed the part about providing access to care," said Dr. Alfio Rausa, the regional health officer, who has worked in the Mississippi Delta since 1966. "We're getting into areas of basic living: having a good roof over your head, a stove to cook on, getting the food to cook, and cooking it. It's fundamental."
To encourage such efforts, the Bush Administration has said it will award $171 million next year, up from $57.4 million this year, to communities with great need and promising approaches. Critics have called that a paltry sum and have denounced the Administration for proposing to take much of the money from other maternal health programs. Officials in Mississippi fear that their Federal financing may be cut to help pay for the Administration's proposal.
The politics of infant mortality caused the White House embarrassment last year after the disclosure that it had ignored the recommendations of an internal study group that called for $500 million in additional spending.
The short life of C. L. Briggs helps illustrate the forces these community programs must confront. Medicaid, the insurance plan that Mississippi has expanded, paid for the hospitalization that brought him through a premature birth. But a hard home life caused by decades of poverty contributed to his early death.
His mother, Betty Briggs, is a farm laborer's daughter with a sixth-grade education who grew up in a succession of wooden shacks where 5 of her 12 siblings died in infancy. Now 34 years old, she is single, unemployed and raising her four other children on a welfare grant of $168 a month.
She said C. L.'s problems began during her pregnancy, when her father shot at her during an argument, causing her to flee and fall. She thinks this contributed to C. L's birth a month premature at 5.5 pounds.
Medicaid paid for his hospital care, perhaps saving his life. But C. L.'s problems continued when he returned to a home where adult nutrition runs low -- meals of neck bone and Kool-Aid are common -- and the risk of disease is high. He caught pneumonia from Ms. Briggs's mother and died in January, one day short of a half-year old.
Ms. Briggs has preserved his memory in five dim Polaroids of his cradle-sized coffin.
"I feel like dying myself," said Ms. Briggs, who keeps the pictures hidden inside a stereo receiver so she will not be tempted to look at them. "It entered my mind that God might want to punish me for something I didn't do right. Every time I look at the pictures, I cry."
And for Ms. Briggs, the threat of infant death is not yet over. She is pregnant again and unable to stop smoking a daily pack of hand-rolled King Albert cigarettes.
 
A Drop, but Not Enough
 The rate of infant death in the United States has dropped every year for decades, in part because of new medical technologies. But the rate has not dropped fast enough to meet the goals of the Public Health Service. And the fact that 19 other countries have better rates remains what many have called a mark of national shame.
One reason that infants die in such numbers is that many women still lack access to care. While Mississippi's expanded Medicaid program has left only 6 percent of the state's pregnant women with no insurance, most other states have not been as generous. And even women with Medicaid can have difficulties getting care because some doctors refuse to accept the insurance, saying the pay is too low and the risk of problem deliveries and malpractice lawsuits too high.
As recently as 1965, when Congress created Medicaid, black babies in Mississippi died at a rate of 54.4 for every 1,000 births, by far the nation's worst. By 1988, the last year for which figures are available, the state's black infant mortality rate of 16.1 was better than the national average. Any death before a child's first birthday is included.
The death rate for white babies in Mississippi has also improved considerably, from 24.5, close to the nation's worst, to 8.7, just slightly worse than the national average of 8.5. The fact that the state ranks worse than average as a whole simply reflects its large black population.
 
Advice Not Followed
 But as Mississippi turns its attention beyond its proliferation of orange-striped Medicaid cards, it is fighting problems that may be even harder to fix. Health care workers here say it is often difficult to get poor women to follow their advice, either because they fail to understand its importance or they lack the resources to comply.
In Rosedale, Miss., they point to the case of Shonta Fitzgerald, who has six children, no husband and a 10th-grade education. She developed problems during her fourth pregnancy, when she was 19, and doctors told her she should remain in bed.
But Ms. Fitzgerald said she felt bored and uncomfortable in bed and ignored the advice. Her daughter, Shaneka, was born two months prematurely, weighing 3 pounds, with kidney problems that contributed to her death at age 2. "I hate that I didn't lay in bed with her when I was pregnant," Ms. Fitzgerald said.
To monitor situations like Ms. Fitzgerald's, the state has started the Perinatal High-Risk Management Program, putting high-risk mothers under the watch of a nutritionist, a social worker and a nurse. "The idea is to chaperone people through their pregnancy," said Dr. Rausa, the regional health officer.
Few people here speak more highly of the program than Rosie Scott, a 38-year-old school librarian who lives in a hamlet called Gunnison.
Her previous four pregnancies had ended in two miscarriages, one still-born birth and one ambulance dash to Memphis, where she delivered a 2-pound son saved by 70 days in intensive care. The unpaid hospitalization bill exceeded $100,000.
Ms. Scott's husband works for the county but does not receive health insurance for his family. So, she faced all the pregnancies without health insurance because as recently as 1985 women here had to be single and earn less than 39 percent of the poverty income standard to qualify for Medicaid. Now the state provides insurance to single and married women, and allows their families to earn up to 185 percent of the poverty line, or $1,408 a month for a family of four.
During her most recent pregnancy, which was covered by Medicaid, Ms. Scott said she saw her doctor much more often than when she had to pay $40 in cash for each visit. She also saw a parade of health care workers in her home, as her case managers made about 10 visits.
 
First Healthy Delivery
 Under their instruction, Ms. Scott, who suffers from high blood pressure, began soaking her cold cuts to rid of them of salt, began avoiding margarine and began taking special vitamins. At their urging, she quit her job and remained in bed during the most dangerous stage of her pregnancy.
It ended with an 8-pound-10.5-ounce portrait of health named Jokomis, in her first healthy delivery in 18 years. Would it have happened without the program? "I doubt it," she said. "I don't think they've started something better yet."
Other approaches are also being tested here, including ones that use laymen rather than trained professionals. The Freedom From Hunger Foundation, based in Davis, Calif., is testing two such models.
One, called the Community Health Advisory Network, tries to identify people in low-income neighborhoods, from preachers to homemakers, to train in basic health and nutrition. The idea is to turn social relationships into networks that might help solve health problems -- by making referrals to state agencies, offering transportation and urging good eating habits.
A second project sends paraprofessionals, often single young mothers themselves, directly into poor women's homes as a sort of all-purpose pregnancy counselor.
 
'It Made a Difference'
 The program includes a lesson plan that is not immune to recitation. On several recent visits, counselors read from textbooks while young mothers followed along, appearing more dutiful than engaged.
"When you say 'No, no,' always be firm," explained Ida Potlow to her client, Alice Banks, 23. During 30 minutes of such instruction, Ms. Banks nodded often and said little.
Asked later to name the benefits of the program, Ms. Banks quickly named several. For one, she said she ate better. Then she tried to explain something about the importance of simply having someone to talk to during a difficult time that was marked by feuding with her mother.
But this story broke off, interrupted by tears and protests that the recollection was too painful.
Then she added this about Ms. Potlow, pointing to what may be the program's biggest benefit: "You have someone who's been through what you are going through. It made a difference."

HEADLINE: A Standoff As OPEC Talks Open

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 11

 BODY:
OPEC ministers, after jousting with one another today over cutting oil production quotas, failed to reach an accord and scheduled another meeting for Tuesday morning.
Officials of Saudi Arabia, which spent some $50 billion in the war against Iraq and invested huge sums to expand oil production, said at the tense session that they did not want to be pressured into cutting output. 
 Several other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, notably Iran, asserted that an oil glut was developing and that prices would collapse unless members, particularly Saudi Arabia, made substantial cuts. Saudi Arabia is by far OPEC's leading exporter.
 
First Postwar Meeting
 The meeting in Switzerland that began today was the first OPEC gathering since the end of the Persian Gulf war and was called to discuss postwar production and pricing.
Iraq did not send an oil official to today's meeting, leaving Iran as the group's most powerful price hawk. In the view of some experts here, the meeting could boil down to a test of wills between Teheran and Riyadh.
The "atmosphere is not very easy," said the Iranian oil minister, Gholam Rezah Aghazadeh.
Despite the standoff, several officials said the meeting might conclude with an informal accord to cut output to help keep oil prices from collapsing, even if a formal accord could not be reached. Saudi officials asserted that a production-cutting pact would be premature since there was no formal cease-fire in the Persian Gulf and the region remained in flux.
 
Price Slides 32 Cents
 After remarks here Sunday by the Saudi oil minister, Hisham Nazer, that his nation was reluctant to cut production, oil prices slid today in trading in London and New York. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April delivery closed 32 cents lower, at $18.99 a barrel.
Many OPEC members have expressed eagerness to reaffirm the $21-a-barrel target price set last July and have said that substantial cuts will be needed to achieve that price.
The organization's secretariat predicted today that demand for OPEC oil would be 21.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, down from 23.1 million barrels in the first quarter. Oil experts estimate that OPEC's 13 members pumped 23 million barrels a day in February.
Saudi officials, however, estimate that demand for OPEC oil will be a generous 22.5 million barrels a day in the second quarter, as the United States rebounds from recession and Soviet oilfield troubles and miners' strikes cut into Soviet oil exports.
Nonetheless, several OPEC officials and oil analysts here suggested that the meeting might conclude with a loose agreement in which Saudi Arabia agreed to scale back production along with the other countries that have substantially increased output since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
 
Saudis' Tougher Stand
 But even an informal pact could get tripped up, oil analysts here said, because Saudi Arabia, newly emboldened by the victory over Baghdad, does not want to absorb the bulk of the production cuts.
The United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Iran lifted their output by slightly more than a million barrels a day to compensate for the loss of 4 million barrels day of oil resulting from the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Saudi Arabia has raised its output by 3 million barrels a day, to about 8.3 milliion barrels.
The Nigerian oil minister, Jibril Aminu, called for a production ceiling of 21 million barrels a day. Several officials said that would help push prices back to OPEC's target price of $21 a barrel.
The pivotal issue, many oil experts here say, is how much Saudi Arabia produces. Some ministers would like Saudi production to drop to 7 million barrels a day or even lower, from 8.3 million barrels at present, but Saudi officials say they are reluctant to go below 7.6 million barrels a day and will rein in production only if others join in.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Vows Broader Role In Fiscal Issues

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, facing criticism that his administration's fiscal policy was adrift, vowed yesterday to take a "much further personal involvement" in "all areas" of managing the city's fiscal affairs.
Mr. Dinkins's comments, made to reporters at City Hall, were an effort to regroup after a tumultuous week of staff disputes, labor unrest and fiscal confusion that ended with the forced resignation of his Labor Relations Commissioner. 
 "What I'm suggesting is that I will spend more time, not with minutiae, not so as to bog down or slow down the process, but to get information more quickly, because I'm at the table more often," the Mayor said.
Mr. Dinkins's remarks suggested a shift in a management style that critics said amounted to presiding over, rather than controlling, his administration. But, when asked if he felt compelled to double-check his staff's discussions or to rein in staff members, the Mayor said, "I just think that my presence can be useful."
 
Need to Take Control
 Mr. Dinkins made his remarks after a weekend of news coverage that stressed the need for him to take control, or as a front-page headline in New York Newsday put it yesterday, "Stand Up and Act Like a Mayor." The headline paraphrased the complaints of municipal union leaders that Mr. Dinkins had not taken a forceful enough role in working with them and others on a comprehensive fiscal plan.
The Mayor's chief political aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, said the efforts would range from meeting more often with his commissioners -- something Mr. Dinkins has long said he intends to do but has largely not done -- to talking with outside advisers. In recent days, the Mayor's senior aides have said he intended to work more closely with outside fiscal and management advisers, including business, labor and civic leaders, whom he already relies on to help devise cooperative solutions to the city's problems.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said: "We have not yet concluded what's the best way to do that. Clearly, there is a need. We're thinking of a number of ways."
Mr. Dinkins, when asked if his comments meant that he would take back authority he had delegated to aides, said: "No, no. It's not possible to run a corporation with a budget of $29 billion and a quarter-million people and on and on without some delegation, obviously."
"Now it is not useful for the Mayor to be there all the time, even if the Mayor had nothing whatever else to do," he said. If the Mayor is involved in every negotiation or dispute, he said, "you've got no place to buck it, you've got no court of appeal."
Mr. Dinkins said his Council of Economic Advisers, a group that includes primarily local business executives, and his Management Advisory Task Force, which includes executives, former government officials and union leaders, would be involved in his stepped up efforts.
But even as he vowed to take a stronger hand in seeking cooperation on the city's fiscal problems, one union leader warned him not to expect an easy time.
Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers and an important early backer of the Mayor, wrote in her column in the union's current newsletter that despite its agreement last fall on a 5.5 percent pay raise for teachers, the administration should not assume the union would be content when that contract expires in September.
"As far as I'm concerned," Ms. Feldman wrote, "5.5 percent was not good enough, not enough to attract and retain the best and brightest educators for the kids of this city. So fiscal crisis or not, we will, at the appropriate time, go out there and wage a bitter battle for a better contract.
 
'A Multiyear Solution'
 Ms. Feldman said the union, which agreed to defer some of the recent raise to save the city $40 million in the short term, said it would not grant another deferral.
But in a telephone interview she did say the union would be willing to negotiate ways to help the city confront its fiscal problems.
"If there were the possibility of sitting down to a multiyear solution and plan, there are lot of things that we could do, though I'm not going to get specific here. We could be very creative in a multiyear situation.
"A multiyear plan," she said, "is absolutely essential. Otherwise you have a constant crisis, from budget to budget."

HEADLINE: High-Tech Stocks Lead Market Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
High-tech stocks tumbled yesterday in heavy trading, and the broader market weakened as well despite clear signs that the Federal Reserve eased monetary policy over the weekend.
Analysts forecast that because of the slow economy the Fed might have further declines in interest rates in the works. . 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slid 15.84, to 2,939.36, with declines leading advances, 3 to 2.
New York Stock Exchange volume dipped to 161.6 million shares, from 206.9 million Friday. Birinyi Associates said program selling knocked only 8 points off the Dow.
Still, money seems to be pouring steadily into the market.
Indata, an investment service in Stamford, Conn., said cash held by 54 stock funds it tracks dropped in the week ended March 8 to 9.9 percent of $22.4 billion in investments from 10.1 percent two weeks earlier. On that basis $448 million in new mutual fund money came into stocks over that period, for an average of almost $45 million a day for the 10 trading days.
Forty-four stocks rose to new highs, including Morrison-Knudsen, which tacked on 2 1/8, to 59 5/8, after a new high of 60 3/4. It said on Friday that it had joined with a Kuwaiti company to help rebuild the country.
Over-the-counter stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, sank 1.7 percent, or nearly 50 Dow points, because of a big selloff in computer and other high-tech stocks.
The Pacific Stock Exchange index that measures the performance of high-tech stocks slid 2.3 percent.
A big part of the high-tech decline was attributed to Thomas Kurlak and Daniel Mandresh, Merrill Lynch analysts.
Mr. Kurlak, who for three years has recommended Intel, the semiconductor producer, downgraded the stock to "neutral." Mr. Mandresh downgraded I.B.M. from "strong buy" to "above average." Traders reasoned that what held for these two market leaders also held for other high-flying technology stocks.
I.B.M. slipped 2 1/8, to 129 1/8, on 1.8 million shares while Intel topped the Nasdaq list of the 10-most-active over-the-counter stocks, sinking 5 3/4, or 11 percent, to 45 3/4, with 8.8 million shares changing hands.
Microsoft, No. 2 on the Nasdaq active list, slumped 3 1/4, to 99 1/4, on 2.3 million shares. Traders attributed the drop to the Merrill Lynch downgrades, although a Federal court ruled on Friday that parts of displays used by Apple Computer were not licensed to Microsoft or Hewlett-Packard.
Apple lost 1 1/2, to 63 1/2, while Hewlett rose 3/8, to 49 1/4.

Tokyo Stocks Advance
 TOKYO, Tuesday, March 12 (Reuters) -- Stocks in Tokyo closed higher today. At the end of trading, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 58.05 points, or 0.22 percent, to 26,727.42.

HEADLINE: Facing Cuts, Arts Lobbyists Plan to Alter Their Approach in Albany

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
"Nuts to cuts!" say the placards and banners being carried by some 200 lobbyists to Albany for Arts Day today.
"If we don't cut the arts, then what do we cut?" Anne Crowley, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's press secretary, said yesterday. "There's a $6 billion deficit. Every area of the budget has to be reduced. What's the alternative? Cutting more from assistance to crippled children, the school budget?" 
 What has stirred both sides is Governor Cuomo's proposed 56 percent cut in support for the New York State Council on the Arts, coupled with the 17.5 percent reduction in the city culture budget recommended by Mayor David N. Dinkins. The proposed cuts are the largest faced by arts institutions since the creation of the New York State Council on the Arts in 1960.
For their part, the lobbyists plan to drop their familiar sentimental "the arts tell us who we are" pitches of the past in favor of what they consider to be more politically sophisticated arguments about economic impact, education and equal treatment.
"What we're fighting for," State Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, said at a rally last week, "is not simply the enduring contributions which the arts make to mankind, but for the arts as a giant magnet which attracts to New York City and State the people who go to our hotels and restaurants, who build our sales-tax base."
But not everyone accepts the economic-impact argument. "It kind of begs the question this year," said William Stevens, a spokesman for Senator Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Long Island who is the majority leader. "The question this year is what the state can afford to do."
Arts advocates have also been quick to point out that cultural institutions are being more roughly handled in the Governor's proposed budget than other comparable areas of state service. For example, the State University is reduced by only 2.5 percent, and parks and recreation by 19.5 percent.
"The one thing legislators understand," said Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center and a former deputy mayor, "is that somebody is being picked on. We're distributing leaflets not saying 'Don't cut' but 'Cut us in proportion.' "
 
Cows or Lambs?
 Senator William J. Larkin Jr., Republican of New Windsor and another member of the budget subcommittee, agreed. "The Governor said we don't want any sacred cows," he said, "and that's true, but we also don't want any sacrificial lambs."
Mindy Duitz, director of the Brooklyn Children's Museum and an active member of the Cultural Institutions Group, an umbrella organization of 32 arts groups, said recently, "When we visit public officials, we always make a point of the fact that four million schoolchildren a year are served by C.I.G. groups in special, formal programs."
"Arts institutions aren't just icing on the cake," said Senator David A. Paterson, Democrat of Harlem. "They keep youth off the streets where they get a different kind of education."
It is possible for a state or city legislator to concede all these arguments and still support a reduction in the culture budget. The deficits, after all, have to be made up from somewhere. Consequently, the question, many city and state elected officials privately concede, is not whether, but how much. The outcome, they say, will depend largely on the intensity and effectiveness of the campaign now being waged by the arts lobby.
Governor Cuomo's provisional budget, announced in late January, calls for reducing the outlay for the state arts council by nearly $25 million from its present level of $46.7 million, bringing it down to $21.9 million.

HEADLINE: Auction Houses Are Being Drawn To Unified Germany

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 11

 BODY:
The man who will represent Sotheby's in Berlin spends a lot of time conferring with builders these days. The newest outpost of the London auction house is a soaring neo-classical palace, just off the boulevard Unter den Linden, that bears the burden of Prussian history on its walls. Built by a merchant in the 18th century, it was bequeathed to Frederick the Great when business failed. Transformed into the Prussian Finance Ministry in the 19th century, it became the seat of the Soviet-German Friendship Society when the Red Army marched into Berlin and planted Communist rulers in the eastern portion of the city.
But now, with Germany reunited, Barclays Bank and Salomon Brothers have moved in, and when the carpenters, masons and painters are done, so too will Sotheby's. For if the recession is hurting auction business in England and America, Germany's economy booms, and with it trade in art and collectibles. With the Berlin wall gone, Sotheby's and its rival, Christie's, which has set up shop in western Berlin, are poised to acquire art treasures hidden for decades during Communist rule. 
 "With the breach of the wall it was urgently necessary that we come here," said H. Josef Konig, director of Sotheby's new Berlin office, "since you have the large area of East Germany, and Berlin is no longer an isolated city. Naturally, the turn from Communism was the spark for all of this."
 
Contrasting Sites
 Both Sotheby's and Christie's have been in Germany since the 1970's. If their move to Berlin signals the city'srevival as a major art center, after London and Paris, their new addresses also say something about lingering divisions in this outwardly reunited metropolis. Christie's chose a safe setting just off the fashionable Kurfurstendamm, alongside established dealers like Westphal and fashionable shops like Fendi and Cartier. By contrast, Sotheby's plunge into the East mirrors beliefs by Mr. Konig, not a Berliner at all but from Munich, that the former old center of the city will live. Clearly, both houses are convinced that the flow of art from the impoverished East to the wealthy West will accelerate.
Sotheby's has opened an office in Budapest and plans an office in Prague. While Christie's has no plans for other new offices, Jorg-Michael Bertz, Christie's director in Germany, said that Berlin's eastern location makes it the ideal staging area for the entire region.
"Geographically, you are already there," Mr. Bertz said. "Distancesare negligible, and it's nothing to fly from here to Prague or elsewhere."
The galleries themselves will offer a sampling of what the auction houses do. Sotheby's began its activities last fall with a showing of modern masters like Matisse, Kandinsky and Modigliani at the brilliant Charlottenburg Palace. Christie's gallery currently offers a sampling, in poster form, of the types of German art the house has auctioned in recent years, items ranging from medieval crossbows to a magnificent wooden sculpture by the Expressionist artist Ernst Barlach, with prices appended.
 
More Junk Than Art
 "Time was you discovered Ming vases being used as umbrella stands in England," said Mr. Konig of Sotheby's. "Well, you're going to have that occasionally in Berlin, in Dresden, and other places as well."
But for the time being, he concedes, it is more junk than the genuine article. "Every day people come with old books, piles of them," he said, "ceramic pieces, oil prints, 19th-century copies turned out by the hundreds that hung over Grandma's couch, usually totally worthless."
But with time and education, he believes, the jewels will emerge. "People in East Germany have to be brought back to art markets," Mr. Konig said. "For more than 40 years there was no art market there. People don't know what an art market is, how it works."
Mr. Bertz of Christie's agreed, saying: "It's fascinating what people have in their apartments, expensive items. We just have to wait."
Indeed, in the fall Sotheby's acquired a portrait by the Expressionist Emil Nolde from a retired worker in Dresden who had squirreled it away in 1945 and bided his time.
"Expressionism has a tradition in this part of the world," Mr. Konig said. "Ernst Ludwig Kirchner lived in Berlin, the Brucke people lived here. There must be a number of works from this period to be discovered here."
There is no way of knowing how much high-quality art will turn up, but Christie's has hired Peter Bet thausen, the director of the National Gallery in the eastern part of the city and an authority on 19th- and 20th-century art, to try to find out. Christie's is also making space for specialists who will assess other objects, like silver and jewelry.
 
Art's Long Winter
 All of this is not without significance in Berlin, which was a major center of the art trade before 1933. With the rise of Hitler, all forms of art but those realistically glorifying Nazi ideals were discouraged, and Jewish artists and art dealers were forced to abandon their businesses.
After the war, Communist governments throughout the East prevented the sale of art except through officially sanctioned channels or in shady deals arranged by party functionaries for personal enrichment. Loopholes existed in places like Berlin, where Russian emigres did business in icons and silver, though often illegally. Lingering restrictions in the formerly Communist countries still hamper the art business.
After a brief attempt in the early 1970's, Christie's abandoned the idea of holding auctions in Germany, preferring to focus on London and New York. But Sotheby's will begin twice-annual auctions in May, commencing with a sale of 20th-century works that will include a still life by Max Beckmann, a watercolor by Oskar Schlemmer and a gouache by Paul Klee.
Mr. Bertz said that although the talk in the United States and England was of bank closures and recession and both houses had cut personnel and had had reduced sales, the art market in Germany is booming along with the economy.
"The economy is going through a fantastic period," he said. "It used to take 10 minutes to get here from the airport. Now it's a half-hour. You cannot get lamps or telephones, because everyone wants to be here in Berlin, so there are material shortages that are extraordinary for the economy."
"We're not thinking of cutting personnel at all," he said.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Ballet Calls a Halt

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON

 BODY:
The trustees of the Pennsylvania Ballet announced yesterday that the troupe would have to suspend operations immediately because of insufficient funds.
After that announcement, at a news conference at the company's headquarters in downtown Philadelphia, Christopher d'Amboise, the artistic director, said the group's dancers, musicians, technicians and staff members would donate their time and services for an engagement by the troupe to open as scheduled on Thursday night at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia. 
 Edwin E. Tuttle, the chairman of the company, said it needed to raise $2.5 million. He attributed the organization's financial crisis to reductions in government financing and to recession-related cuts in private and corporate donations.
Mr. d'Amboise said yesterday that if the company could raise $1 million it would be able to continue. Commenting on the willingness of the dancers and staff to waive payment, he said: "I was astonished and delighted by their decision. I'm so happy this is happening." All donations to the company, he said, are to go directly to a Save the Ballet escrow fund.
 
'We Believe in Ourselves'
 "We can't and won't allow ballet to die in Philadelphia," Mr. d'Amboise said. "The dancers are taking to the stage while staff members are taking to the streets. We believe in ourselves, each other and the excellence of this company."
On the program for its performances at the Shubert, which are to continue through March 24, is a triple bill of Antony Tudor's "Jardin aux Lilas" and George Balanchine's "Four Temperaments" and "Who Cares?" Program inserts and speeches are expected to encourage audiences to make contributions, Mr. d'Amboise said. "If we're not successful, everyone who contributed donations will be entitled to a refund," he said.
The Pennsylvania Ballet was founded by Barbara Weisberger, with the support of Balanchine and the aid of a Ford Foundation grant made in 1963 to ballet companies across the United States. It began offering regular seasons in 1964 and frequently appeared in New York City during the 1960's and 70's. Mrs. Weisberger shared the company's directorial duties with Benjamin Harkarvy from 1972 to 1982.
 
Ties and Unity
 The company has always maintained ties with the New York City Ballet. Mrs. Weisberger was a student at the School of American Ballet, now the City Ballet's affiliated school, when it was founded in 1934. In 1982, Robert Weiss, a former principal dancer of the New York City Ballet, was named the director of the Pennsylvania Ballet.
Under Mr. Weiss's direction, the Pennsylvania Ballet became involved in an elaborate arrangement to join forces with the Milwaukee Ballet and to create a company with two homes. This began in 1987, but proved unwieldy, and the groups separated in 1989.
Mr. d'Amboise, who succeeded Mr. Weiss as the director last year, is a former member of the New York City Ballet and the son of Jacques d'Amboise, a dancer, choreographer and teacher who was a principal dancer of the City Ballet for many years.

Suicide in Alaska

 BODY:
The suicide rate for young male Alaska natives is more than twice the rate for young white men in the nation as a whole, two Pennsylvania scientists have reported.
While white men over the age of 55 have the highest suicide rate in the United States as a whole, however, suicide after 55 is virtually nonexistent among Alaska natives, the scientists said. They studied suicides from 1979 to 1984 and reported their findings in the February issue of the journal Psychiatry. 
 Dr. Paul Kettl, a Pennsylvania State University psychiatrist, one of the suicide researchers, said the patterns appeared to reflect dramatic social change in Alaska native society.
Oil discoveries in Alaska in the mid-1960's, followed by economic growth and an influx of television in the 1970's, forced a cascade of change on Alaska natives, he said. They had to make choices between traditional values and new values.
Young men were particularly affected because economic growth and a cultural assault corroded their traditional roles, he said. Hunting, fishing and whaling became more difficult to pursue. The ensuing dislocation, along with high rates of alcoholism and a high frequency of gun ownership in rural Alaska, appear to have contributed to the suicide rates, Dr. Kettl said.
From 1979 to 1984, Alaska native men aged 15 to 24 committed suicide at a rate of 84.3 per 100,000, four times the rate of 21.2 per 100,000 for white men of the same age in the United States in 1982. Alaska native men aged 25 to 34 committed suicide at a rate almost double that for white men of the same age.
At the same time, native Alaskan elders lost little of their status in their communities as repositories of culture, Dr. Kettle said, and there were no reported suicides for Alaska native men over the age of 55 from 1979 to 1984.
Suicide rates for Alaska native women were slightly higher than rates for women in the nation as a whole. But the differences in the rates were not as dramatic, Dr. Kettl said, in part because women were able to retain traditional roles of childbearing and homemaking.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
How to Lose the Peace

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Only yesterday, the United States showed how swiftly it could win a war in the Middle East. Now the United States is showing how swiftly it might lose a peace in the Middle East.
Our defeated enemy remains in power, still slaughtering his countrymen. Our Arab allies refuse to take the one simple essential step toward Mideast peace. 
 How did we manage to get to this point? There's an answer, but first consider three cases.
 l. Saddam Hussein. The United States, surely to his astonishment, allows him to use his remaining weapons to destroy his enemies in Iraq. He is permitted to move helicopters and tanks around the country to shell down the rebellion.
 While there's time, Washington should issue standstill orders for all Saddam Hussein's helicopters and tanks, under pain of aerial destruction. That would at least give the fragmented opposition a chance to survive.
 As long as the man who brought about war is still in power, the peace will not be secure. President Bush knows this. But officially the White House sticks to the nonsense that Iraq's internal affairs are not our business. It was precisely Iraq's most intimate internal affair -- the character of its Government -- that forced us into war.
After Saddam may come a government as bad. Maybe not, if we help the non-fanatics among the opposition. But, in decency, he must not be allowed to linger in power, distributing death. Would the world have permitted Hitler to carry on in Berlin because of the chance of a period of German chaos without him?
 2. Syria. While hoping one Mideast dictator disappears, the U.S. abets the buildup of another.
Find the difference between Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, try. In the torture, murder and gassing of their own citizens, in aggression against smaller neighbors, the stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological weapons, in dreams of empire, and terrorism against the West -- just try.
For lending his mouth and a few thousand troops to the war against his own Arab enemy, the Syrian receives billions from other Arabs, Europe and Japan. He spends it as fast as he can on more weapons.
 One day an American President, maybe Mr. Bush himself, will stare at this man and ask himself, in a sudden flash of clarifying horror, What have I wrought?
3. Allies. News story: Arab rulers agree to part of the Bush-Baker "peace plan." Turns out that it is the part that permits the U.S. to keep enough force in the Persian Gulf to save their necks, again.
Thanks. But peace-producing parts of the plan, an end by the Arabs of their 43-year state of war with Israel and direct Arab-Israeli talks, these get the same old three-word answer: No, no, no.
 How could all this happen? Answer: For decades the U.S. and other Western powers have misunderstood or ignored the nature of the Arab governments -- deliberately.
In almost every way -- in foreign aggression, domestic terrorism, persecution of minorities and women, control of the economy, the spread of religious bigotry, elimination of personal, political or intellectual freedom -- Arab governments rule under a self-perpetuating system of tyranny that can best be described as Arab fascism.
If such governments reigned in Europe, they would be exposed and detested. But in the Mideast, the West accepted and strengthened these governments, first out of lust for their land, then for their oil. Out of this grew the self-justifying Western accepted wisdom that freedom, democracy, political choice are outside Arab comprehension or ability.
Western Arabist diplomats prattle about Arab traditions of clan and sheik. But this simply prettifies their belief that alone among people, Arabs cannot achieve democracy, a belief essentially contemptuous and contemptible.
 So the U.S. finds itself with allies it strengthened, but which by their essence hate what it should stand for -- political and economic freedom.
The refusal to understand or openly discuss the reality of the Arab governments led the West to appeasement of Saddam Hussein and then to war, appeasement's child. It now leads the West to support his brothers in tyranny, and call them brother.
 Perhaps one day the President strong enough to finally see the truth about Saddam Hussein will be brave enough to see the truth about the rest of the Middle East and speak it. That would be his great gift to the chances of peace, and to the Arab people.

HEADLINE: Poison Gas: Only Part of the Problem

 BODY:
Reflecting his Persian Gulf war experience, President Bush last week issued a highly welcome pronouncement: The U.S. is tightening controls over exports of chemicals and equipment for arms-making. That's a hopeful, if small, sign that Mr. Bush intends to try stopping the spread of sophisticated arms at the source. But why stop at that?
The President can do much more, like getting others to curb sales of materials and equipment essential to make chemical, biological and nuclear arms. He can also reduce buying pressure by spurring talks on a new treaty to ban the manufacture, possession and use of chemical weapons. He can support legislation to punish countries that produce, acquire or use such weapons. 
 And there is no reason to confine arms control efforts to these weapons and exclude sophisticated new conventional arms. After all, what made Iraq so menacing to its neighbors were the modern tanks and aircraft it had already acquired from abroad.
 Until now, U.S. companies have needed no license to export most chemicals to countries suspected of wanting them for weapons manufacture. The regulations issued last week extend controls to 50 chemicals and, for the first time, to equipment used to make arms. But these restraints will work only if America's gulf war allies follow. Germany, shamed by its indiscriminate sales, has begun to do so. Others across Europe need to as well.
A bill passed by the Senate and now before the House could induce them to do just that. It would not only impose sanctions on states that develop or use chemical or biological arms. It would also bar any foreign companies that sell materials or equipment to make such arms from selling in the U.S. -- unless their governments punish them. Mr. Bush vetoed similar legislation last year but has pledged not to do so again.
He has committed himself to ridding the world of chemical weapons. But he has insisted on retaining 2 percent of U.S. chemical stocks until all countries capable of making chemical weapons accept a ban. That insistence is holding up a treaty to ban these weapons in 40-nation talks in Geneva. So is U.S. backtracking on on-site verification. Mr. Bush could give new impetus to the talks by shifting his stance on both issues.
The President has been strangely silent on the need to curb conventional arms sales to the Mideast. Instead, his Administration proposes to sell some $33 billion in new weapons this year, two-thirds in this volatile region and much of that to Saudi Arabia and Israel. It has just notified Congress it intends to sell $1.6 billion in new weapons to Egypt, including 46 F-16 fighter planes. Just how much reassurance do the Saudis, Israelis and Egyptians need now that the U.S. is planning a larger permanent presence and more exercises?
The U.S. would be better off restraining arms sales to the Middle East and getting other states to do the same. As Iraq's aggression shows, the world can ill afford business as usual on arms of all sorts.

HEADLINE: Louisiana's Governor Shifts To G.O.P. in Career Gamble

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., March 11

 BODY:
In a gamble to save his career and stave off a challenge from a former Ku Klux Klan leader, Gov. Buddy Roemer announced today that he had abandoned the Democratic Party to become a Republican.
The Governor asked his new party to give him unified support in his re-election campaign this fall, when he faces a tough challenge from a popular former Democratic Governor, Edwin W. Edwards, who has already announced his candidacy. Although Mr. Roemer acknowledged that he had received no formal assurance of Republican backing, he said he had thoroughly discussed his plans with top state and national Republican Party officials, including President Bush. 
 Mr. Roemer now emerges as the Republicans' best hope to stifle the gubernatorial candidacy of State Representative David Duke, the former Klan leader who has amassed a following for his white supremacist views and whose past candidacies have embarrassed party leaders. Mr. Duke, who campaigns as a Republican even though local party leaders have disavowed him, has said that he will enter the race for governor later this week.
Ending months of speculation about his future, Mr. Roemer stood on the steps of the Governor's Mansion, which had been decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting for the occasion, and asserted: "Independence, though admirable, is not enough. My choice is Republican."
For the Governor, who has frequently antagonized the Democratic Party with his independent ways, winning Republican support appears to be his best chance to avoid political disaster in the fall election.
Speaking of his switch in parties, he said: "Will this affect the governor's race? Probably, but no one in this audience knows exactly how. I don't either. Therefore, I thought: Tell it like it is. Be what you are. Fight for it. Explain it, and let's see what happens."
In an interview today, Mr. Edwards, who lost to Mr. Roemer four years ago, said: "This is nothing but a crass political deal in which the Republicans get a sitting Governor and in exchange no Republican will run against him. The people of Louisiana regurgitate on such political deal-making."
But Mr. Roemer, repeatedly playing down the importance of his decision, cited the widely accepted notion that Louisiana politics were dominated by personalities rather than party organizations.
"To most Louisianians, party is unimportant and gets in the way," he said.
 
'We Never Had Him'
 Kathleen Vick, vice chairman of the state Democratic committee, said: "We can't lose him because we never had him. Buddy Roemer has never been a party player in any way shape or form. He may be proud of his independence, but the fact is he only hs one political party and that is Buddy Roemer."
Mr. Roemer did not directly criticize his former Democratic colleagues, and he admitted there is a "short but important list" of issues on which he differs with most Republicans, including his support for some affirmative action programs. He called for Republicans to be more open to women and minorities.
"Not perfect this party," he said, "but in prime position to open up from a strong base of shared beliefs of family values, of economic opportunity and of unshakeable national security and of law-and-order commitment."
While in Congress from 1980 to 1987, Mr. Roemer was one of the Boll Weevil Democrats who rebelled at their party's liberal agenda and supported much of the Reagan Administration's legislative platform. Several members of that group previously switched parties with a mixed record of political success.
 
Others Who Have Switched
 Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, for example, has become one of the most powerful politicians in Washington since his switch to the Republican Party. But last year two former Democratic Congressmen who changed parties, Kent Hance of Texas and Tommy Robinson of Arkansas, were defeated in Republican gubernatorial primaries.
As Governor, Mr. Roemer has consistently portrayed himself as an outsider trying to reform the Democratic establishment that dominates state politics. As a result, he has few friends among Democratic leaders and he faced an extremely hazardous re-election battle as a Democrat.
Mr. Roemer's switch was welcomed almost unanimously by Republican officials here. Billy Nungesser, the state chairman, said, "Throughout his career, Buddy has been closer to us than to the Democrats, and so this was a natural step for both sides."
And in a statement issued by the White House today, President Bush welcomed Mr. Roemer's announcement.
But some of Mr. Roemer's newfound Republican supporters still have doubts about his chances.
"We are real happy to have him," said Earl Wilson, a Republican district chairman in the New Orleans suburbs, "and I think now he can be assured 45 percent of the vote, but it is that other 5 percent that is pretty hard to figure."
Under Louisiana's open primary system all candidates will be on the same ballot for a first round vote on Oct. 19, and if no one wins a majority, the top two candidates face each other in a runoff.
Several prominent Republicans had indicated their intention to run against Mr. Roemer, but it appears that his party switch has pre-empted further challenge from that quarter, especially considering the apparent blessing Mr. Roemer has received from President Bush.
Mr. Roemer acknowledged today that he might fail to make a runoff if he split the votes of white moderates with one or more other mainstream Republicans, allowing Mr. Duke to gain a spot in a runoff with his strong conservative following.
Describing the President as "an old friend" Mr. Roemer said he had discussed his political plans with him as recently as Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Albania to Restore Full Links

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The United States will resume full diplomatic relations with Albania on Friday, ending 52 years of nonrecognition, American and Albanian officials announced today.
Administration officials said Foreign Minister Muhamet I. Kapllani was flying to Washington to take part in the formal act of diplomatic recognition with Assistant Secretary of State Raymond G. H. Seitz. 
 Months will pass before a United States ambassador to Tirana is named and still more time before an American embassy begins functioning in the Albanian capital, an Administration official said.
But the Bush Administration has concluded that it is desirable to act now because "we want to get engaged in the democratic process in Albania," the official said and because the Communist Government of President Ramiz Alia "is at least attempting reform."
 
'Greater Engagement' Urged
 On March 31, Albania is to hold its first multiparty elections since the Communists seized power in late 1944.
The Administration official said the State Department would send a small group of American diplomats to Tirana to become acquainted with the situation before the elections. Since early December, Albania, a country of 3.5 million, has been swept by waves of unrest marked by popular demonstrations againt the Communist system.
Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said the turmoil called for "greater engagement, not less" by the United States. He also cited humanitarian concerns. There is currently a food shortage in Albania.
The United States and Albania had close ties before World War II. Americans of Albanian origin returned to the Balkans in 1912 to help establish the first Albanian Government. President Wilson was credited with having been the most powerful defender of Albania's territorial integrity in international councils immediately after World War I, when Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece vied to seize chunks of the country. There was also an American teachers college in Albania.
 
U.S. Reviled as Evil
 Diplomatic ties between Washington and Tirana were severed in June 1939 after Italy's invasion of Albania. An informal American observer mission was sent to Tirana in 1945 to explore resumption of relations. The Communist Government refused to honor prewar treaties and harassed the members of the mission so much that they were withdrawn in November 1946.
 The Albanian Government resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union last year, after a break of 29 years. Albania and China have also agreed to increase trade and economic cooperation as part of Albania's effort to improve its international ties, and Albania has obtained observer status at the Helsinki talks in Europe, which emphasize human rights.
Until a little more than a year ago, the Communist Government regularly reviled the United States as an evil superpower bent on subjugating small countries like Albania. In fact, in the early 1950's, the United States was actively engaged in a plot to overthrow the Albanian Communists with paramilitary forces.
Talks on renewing ties were begun last summer and were virtually concluded in September. But senior State Department officials objected to moving ahead on the ground that human-rights abuses were continuing in Albania, causing the project to be delayed.

Political Prisoners Pardoned
 VIENNA, March 12 (Reuters) -- The Albanian Government said today that it had pardoned all the country's remaining political prisoners.
"Following this pardon, there are no more political prisoners in re-education centers and prisons in Albania," the said Albanian radio, monitored by the BBC.
The report did not say how many people were affected by the pardon. The International Helsinki Federation, a human rights monitoring group, estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in Albania's jails.

HEADLINE: Administration to Address Fears Raised by Mexico Pact

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Worried that it may lose authority to negotiate new trade agreements, the Bush Administration told Congress today that it would offer a plan by May 1 on ways to alleviate the impact of a Mexican free trade pact on health, environmental and labor standards.
Many lawmakers fear a trade agreement with Mexico will reduce health standards, lead to environmental damage, depress employment and open up the United States to more smuggled cocaine. 
 Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Democrat from Illinois who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrat from Texas who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, warned in a letter to President Bush last Thursday that a Congressional extension of negotiating authority was in danger if these concerns were not met.
 
Disparity Between Countries
 They called for an Administration plan to address "the disparity between the two countries in the adequacy and enforcement of environmental standards, health and safety standards and worker rights."
The negotiating authority -- so-called fast track authority to negotiate non-amendable agreements subject only to a final yes or no vote on the entire package -- would cover both the contemplated accord with Mexico and a broader 107-nation trade-opening arrangement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee today, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, asserted that the Administration shared the concerns and would address them.
She said the plan would be designed in consultation with Congressional leaders and probably be forthcoming before May 1. The existing fast-track authority expires May 31. The Administration is requesting a two-year extension, which can be denied by a majority vote in either house.
 
Addressing Social Issues
 The Rostenkowski-Bentsen letter said the social issues needed to be addressed "either within the agreement itself or through some appropriate alternative context within the same time frame as the negotiations."
There has been talk of concluding an environmental treaty with Mexico later this year, while the trade negotiations are in progress.
The opposition is led by organized labor. During a time of rising unemployment in this country, labor groups fear further plant and job losses to Mexico and a diminution of wages and union strength.
Mrs. Hills pointed to Government studies showing that freer trade with Mexico would actually increase jobs.
"We don't think there will be a tumbling of jobs south," she said. "There has been no impediment to date to having jobs go south. Where jobs have gone south is where they are under rather considerable global pressure, and we would rather have jobs go to Mexico than just move offshore altogether, for example to East Asia."

HEADLINE: Support for Restoration of Full I.R.A. Deduction

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
More than 70 percent of the Senate lined up today behind a bill to restore fully deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all workers, but the Bush Administration immediately rebuffed the proposal.
"It makes good sense for our economic future," the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said in announcing that he and 71 other senators from both parties -- enough to override a veto -- were introducing the bill. 
 It would allow all workers, regardless of income and whether they have a company pension plan, to make a tax-deductible I.R.A. contribution of up to $2,000 a year. Or, they could choose a new type of I.R.A. that, instead of an immediate deduction, would generate tax-exempt interest if held for five years or longer, or a third option that would split $2,000 between these types of accounts.
In addition, the bill would permit penalty-free withdrawals from an I.R.A. to make the down payment on a first home, pay catastrophic medical expenses or finance a college education.
Asked if the Administration would support the bill, the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said, "We are not in favor of that at this point."
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is also opposed. "He doesn't think we should be spending money on tax breaks, least of all not for tax breaks for affluent people," an aide said.
Deductible I.R.A.'s were made available to all workers in 1981. Four years later, 16.2 million taxpayers claimed I.R.A. deductions totaling $38.2 billion. About 36 percent of the tax saving went to people with incomes over $50,000.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 restricted fully deductible I.R.A.'s to people not covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan or, for those who are covered, to people whose incomes did not exceed certain limits -- $25,000 for single people and $40,000 for married couples. Deductions are phased out on the next $10,000 of income. On tax returns filed in 1989, the deduction was claimed by 6.4 million taxpayers, for a total of $12 billion.
Under present law, a person who is not allowed a tax-deductible I.R.A. may still deposit up to $2,000 a year in such an account and the interest will be tax-deferred until withdrawn. There is a 10 percent penalty on money withdrawn from an I.R.A. before the owner reaches the age of 59 1/2.

HEADLINE: U.S. Inquiry Sought in Police Beating

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Outraged over the videotaped beating of a suspect by the Los Angeles police last week, members of the Congressional Black Caucus asked the Justice Department today to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into police brutality in the city.
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, a senior member of the caucus, said after a meeting with William S. Sessions, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that Mr. Sessions was noncommittal about widening the bureau's inquiry into the incident. A spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the Attorney General would also meet with caucus members to discuss the case. 
 There were these other developments today that grew out of the beating:
*Representative Don Edwards, a California Democrat who heads Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil Rights announced hearings next week on police brutality nationwide.
*The Chief of Police in Los Angeles, Daryl F. Gates, was urged to resign in a full-page advertisement placed by the American Civil Liberties Union in The Los Angeles Times. The ad included a photograph of an officer wielding a nightstick, with the headline, "Who do you call when the gang wears blue uniforms?" The Chief has said he will not resign.
*In Federal District Court in Los Angeles, a man charged that he was hogtied and beaten by Los Angeles officers when he was arrested on April 30, 1989. He is suing the city under Federal civil rights statutes, charging false arrest and excessive force.
In promising hearings by his panel on police brutality, Representative Edwards, called brutality "an epidemic."
Representative John Lewis, a Democrat of Georgia, said the behavior of the police in Los Angeles was "symbolic of what is happening around the country." Although neither Mr. Lewis nor Mr. Edwards provided details, police departments in cities like Miami and Dallas and smaller cities have faced charges of brutality.
 
'Absolutely Horrified'
 Mr. Sessions declined to be interviewed about the meeting with the black caucus or the F.B.I. investigation. The bureau is seeking to learn whether the Los Angeles police officers involved in the beating on March 3 violated the suspect's civil rights, thus warranting Federal charges.
Mr. Conyers, a Democrat, said he was "absolutely horrified" by the episode, which he said differed from other incidents of police misconduct in Los Angeles and elsewhere only in that it happened to be videotaped by an amateur photographer who lived nearby. The videotape was seen on national television over the Cable News Network and other networks.
The lawmaker said Mr. Sessions told the group that the F.B.I. was investigating the beating as an isolated incident. But, Mr. Conyers said, "We want a systematic investigation of the history of violence by the Los Angeles Police Department."
The videotape shows more than a dozen uniformed officers crowding over a prone man, later identified as Rodney Glen King, an unemployed construction worker, who the police said had led them on a car chase. The tape showed some officers repeatedly hitting him with their nightsticks and kicking him in the head while others stood by. Mr. King suffered a broken leg and facial injuries.
 
Inquiries in Department and Out
 Chief Gates said after the incident that he would seek felony charges against the officers involved and that all 15 officers who took part will face departmental disciplinary charges. The grand jury convened in the case is looking at the conduct of all 15, and it held a second day of closed hearings today.
The Chief can be removed from office only for cause by the five-member commission that appointed him.
 
'Not an Aberration'
 After the beating, Chief Gates called it an "aberration" in an otherwise well-disciplined department. But today everal members of Congress from the Los Angeles area disputed that.
"It certainly is not an aberration," said Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat. "This is the order of the day in Los Angeles."
Mr. King is black, but Chief Gates has insisted that race was not a factor in the beating. Mr. King's lawyers have said they do not intend to make race an issue.
But several lawmakers said today that the incident had crystallized the perception that the Police Department of 8,300 officers often uses excessive force against blacks. They said a broad Federal investigation was necessary because the local authorities had been unable to halt what they referrred to as a "pattern of abuse" by the police.

HEADLINE: Deal Set on OPEC Cut, But Not All Are Happy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 12

 BODY:
OPEC decided today to cut oil production by 5 percent, or about a million barrels a day, which several officials of the group said should push prices higher.
But underscoring the tension in two days of talks here, Algeria and Iran expressed reservations about the plan in the final communique, and officials from those countries complained that the output cuts were too small to lift oil prices to OPEC's target of $21 a barrel. OPEC oil has fallen to $17.74 a barrel on average, in part because of the allies' quick success in the war against Iraq. 
 OPEC's Secretary General, Subroto, announced the group's decision at 7 P.M. here, and afterward crude oil for delivery in April rose 69 cents a barrel to settle at $19.68 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. When OPEC oil is trading at $21 a barrel, higher-quality West Texas oil costs $23. [Page D17].
 
More Power for Saudis
 OPEC officials and oil analysts here said today's decision reflected the Saudis' increased power within the group after the defeat of Iraq by Riyadh and its allies. How the agreement will affect oil prices was unclear, with oil experts and even OPEC ministers disagreeing among themselves about whether the cuts were large enough to raise prices.
After today's meeting, production of the 13-member group, currently estimated at 23.4 million barrels a day, would fall to 22.3 million barrels if members adhered to the agreement.
Saudi Arabia, by far the largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stubbornly resisted some other members' pleas for the group to cut production by 2 million barrels a day, with the Saudis absorbing 1.3 million barrels in cuts. Those members contended that the larger cuts were needed to bring prices back to $21 for a "basket" of seven OPEC crudes.
Under today's agreement, Saudi Arabia is expected to produce 8 million barrels a day, down from the 8.45 million barrels that Riyadh says it has produced in recent days, but far more than the 5.4 million barrels it produced under the old OPEC quota, before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
Oil experts said the reservations that Iran and Algeria expressed about the plan reflected their belief that OPEC, including Saudi Arabia, should accept far greater production cuts. It also reflected their unhappiness with the way the Saudis were exercising their muscle.
 
'A Price-Increasing Effect'
 "All ministers agree that one million barrels per day less than present production will have a price-increasing effect," Dr. Subroto said at a news conference. He said he did not know whether the price would increase "directly to $21," but said, "I'm sure it will go in that direction."
One Iranian official, speaking privately, expressed skepticism that the 5 percent cut in production would firm up oil prices. "It's not a serious number like the market is expecting," he said.
This morning, before the agreement was announced, Iran's oil minister, Gholam Rezah Aghazadeh, predicted that cutting production to a range of 21 million to 21.5 million barrels a day would raise prices to a range of $18 to $21 a barrel. But he said reducing output to 22 million barrels a day would keep prices between $15 and $18.
Dr. Subroto said today's agreement called for OPEC members to make "voluntary" proportional production cuts of 5 percent. But Algeria's oil minister, Sadek Boussena, who is also OPEC's president, said Algeria would ignore the agreement and would not cut production.
Some oil experts said the soft nature of today's agreement might lead to overproduction, because OPEC members might not adhere to the 5 percent cuts.
 
'Prices Will Drop'
 "I think in the coming weeks prices will drop because people will start to see a glut in the market," said Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil journal.
OPEC officials said they could not specify the exact levels of new production because of the voluntary nature of the agreement and because OPEC had asked members to report within seven days their exact production levels. Oil experts estimated that under the new agreement Saudi Arabia would pump 8 million barrels a day, followed by Iran with 3.2 million barrels, the United Arab Emirates, with 2.3 million, and Venezuela with 2.2 million.
Oil analysts said one reason it was not hard to persuade members to agree to 5 percent cuts was that even with the reductions many members would be producing well above the quotas set last July. Those quotas were suspended after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the United Nations ordered an embargo on oil from those two countries, which had been producing 4 million barrels a day. OPEC members were encouraged to produce as much as they could to make up for that loss.
Today's agreement excludes Iraq and Kuwait because OPEC officials expect neither nation to export oil in the second quarter. OPEC will meet again in June to set production levels for the third quarter.
When the current meeting began on Monday, OPEC's secretariat said demand for OPEC oil would be 21.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, some 2 million barrels below current production levels. But Saudi officials forecast that demand for OPEC oil would be 22.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter. They said increases in oil companies' stocks, a decline in Soviet oil exports and a rebound in the American economy would raise demand for OPEC oil.
 
Saudi Demand Is Met
 Oil officials here said one index of Saudi Arabia's new power was the closeness of the new production level to the estimate for demand by the Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer.. Showing new assertiveness, Saudi officials said they would refuse to produce fewer than 8 million barrels a day, and they persuaded other ministers to agree to that.
The Saudis also got their way in insisting that this week's gathering, a meeting of OPEC's market monitoring committee, not be turned into an emergency full-scale ministers meeting. Saudi officials worried that such a meeting might erupt into a political fight in which a heated debate would develop over future quotas for Iraq and Kuwait. There was also concern that OPEC members would attack one another over their stands in the gulf war.
One factor that helped Saudi Arabia dominate the meeting was the humbling of Iraq and the absence of Iraqi officials, who had been the intimidating price hawks at previous meetings.
Saudi officials rejected criticism that they were doing Washington's bidding by pushing for higher production levels and thus lower prices than some members wanted. Saudi officials noted that they had long opposed steep price increases because of their desire for steady growth in worldwide oil demand.

HEADLINE: Exxon to Pay $100 Million Fine And Plead Guilty in Valdez Spill

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge arising from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and pay a $100 million fine, officials of the Environmental Protection Agency said tonight.
The $100 million would be part of payments by Exxon that could total as much as $1.1 billion over the next 10 years to settle civil and criminal cases arising from North America's largest oil spill. Alaskan and Federal authorities said today that all obstacles to the settlement appeared to have been cleared. 
 Final arrangements for the guilty plea, including a review of the agreement by the E.P.A. Administrator, William K. Reilly, are being worked out tonight, the E.P.A. officials said.
 
Protecting the Villagers
 It was not clear this evening what charge Exxon would plead to. The company had faced two felony charges and several misdemeanor counts stemming from the March 24, 1989, accident and could have been fined up to $600 million if convicted on all counts, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said after the company was indicted just over a year ago.
As for the overall $1.1 billion settlement, Federal and state officials have agreed to the arrangement. Although a Federal District Court judge at first seemed to raise another hurdle today when he said he would review it to insure that the rights of 5,000 Alaskan villagers were protected, a state official said early this evening that the final barriers appeared to have been overcome.
Economists said Exxon would be able to claim tax deductions for every payment except for the $100 million criminal penalty, to be paid immediately.The $100 million would be one of the largest, if not the largest, criminal fine ever paid for pollution. A trial on the charges had been scheduled for April 10 in District Court in Alaska.
 
Effects Would be Studied
 The villagers had filed suit last week, asserting that they had been locked out of negotiations between Exxon, the State of Alaska and the Federal Government. The villagers said they feared that a settlement would prevent them from recovering financial damages caused by the March 24, 1989, spill.
The settlement, which has been under negotiations for months, would not end Exxon's legal troubles in Alaska. At last count, 330 separate suits by fishermen, environmentalists and others are pending against the company. But the settlement would end the major suits, brought by the State of Alaska and the United States.
In addition, the company would pay $90 million this year into a fund administered by three Federal agencies and three state agencies. The money would be used for scientific studies of the Prince William Sound region, which suffered great damage, and for projects to continue scrubbing the shoreline of oil left when nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the hull of the Exxon Valdez after the tanker ran aground in the sound.
The skipper, Capt. Joseph J. Hazelwood, was convicted on March 22, 1990, of the relatively minor charge of negligently discharging oil but acquitted of piloting the vessel while drunk and other serious charges. He was sentenced to spend 1,000 hours in the cleanup operation and was ordered to make $50,000 restitution.
Exxon said in April 1990 that it had spent $2 billion on the cleanup and had paid an additional $200 million to settle claims.
The agreement made final today called for payments into the fund of $150 million in September 1992, $100 million in September 1993, and $70 million annually from 1994 until 2001. The settlement calls for Exxon to contribute $100 million more to the fund, bringing the total payments to $1.1 billion, if additional damage from the oil spill is discovered.
The proposed settlement was applauded by Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska but strongly criticized by environmental groups and some state officials who said, essentially, that Exxon would be paying too cheap a price.
 
Bottom of the Pockets?
 "It seems like a good deal for Exxon," said Eric Jorgenson, a lawyer for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in Juneau, which has sued the company.
But Governor Hickel said: "I am very happy with the settlement. It allows us to get to the bottom of Exxon's pockets."
Lance Lamberton, a spokesman for Exxon in Irving, Tex., declined today to say whether Exxon would sign the agreement and said the company would make no comment about the situation for the time being.
"If and when things break and we have come together for a proposal to be signed, there will be extensive notification," said Mr. Lamberton.
The settlement contains provisions to make public the scientific studies conducted after the spill by the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies. But studies sponsored by the State of Alaska and the United States Coast Guard are to remain private pending the outcome of court cases brought against the state and the Coast Guard.
"Keeping the data secret is a major problem," said Mr. Jorgenson. "All of the data available from the spill should be released. The public paid for it."
 
Public Comment Allowed
 Although the terms would make the settlement the most expensive ever for damages caused by an environmental disaster, the pact is certain to raise a stir in Alaska and in Washington. The negotiators will open the pact to public comment for 30 days after it is signed.
Economists who have studied the spill for the state and Federal governments said today that the $1.1 billion settlement represents only a portion of the actual value of the damage to fisheries, water, wildlife and land. The economists said the Exxon Valdez disaster will have caused $2.5 billion to $5 billion in damages from the time of the spill before midnight on March 24, 1989, through 1994.
On April 9, 1990, Exxon and its subsidiary, the Exxon Shipping Company, pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court in Anchorage to two felony violations and several misdemeanor violations of five Federal statutes. The agreement resolves those charges.
The most serious violations were under Federal maritime law and accused Exxon Shipping of operating the Exxon Valdez with a "physically and mentally" incapable crew. The company also faced a misdemeanor count for violations of the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act for killing thousands of birds, and two misdemeanors for spilling oil under the Clean Water Act and the Refuse Act. Other charges were pending under the Ports and Waterways Act and the Dangerous Cargo Act.
The Government and Exxon had tried to settle the case through plea bargaining but Alaska's former Attorney General, Doug Baily, resisted the settlement and accused the Justice Department of selling out to the oil company.
Several state officials who asked not to be identified today said they had hoped that Exxon would be required to pay $1 billion in a one-time payment that could generate permanent income through annual interest payments. These officials said the payments spread out over 10 years would be much less valuable.
Senator Frank Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said today that Alaska was fortunate to have gained a settlement. The alternative was years of litigation that would have cost Alaska millions of dollars in legal fees without any assurances of success.
 
'A Bird in the Hand'
 "I think this agreement, if it is resolved, is going to have to stand the light of day by the Legislature, the Governor and Exxon shareholders," said Senator Murkowski. "The alternative is litigation. I certainly am inclined to think a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The cost of litigation would be very substantial."
The settlement also calls for an advisory group made up of members of the public to help oversee how money from the settlement is spent. The Department of Justice scheduled a news conference for Wednesday to explain provisions in the settlement.
The last obstacles were crossed this afternoon when Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin lifted an order here that prevented the pact from being signed, and a District Judge from Alaska, H. Russel Holland, approved the agreement. Judge Holland was to have presided over the criminal trial.
Last week, Judge Sporkin blocked the settlement from being signed until the state and Federal Government assured more than 5,000 Alaskan native villagers that their right to gain financial damages from Exxon would not be harmed by the pact. Today, Judge Sporkin said he was satisfied and lifted his injunction. But in an order he signed this afternoon, Judge Sporkin said he would review the settlement after it is signed.
"The court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter to insure that the defendants' representations are carried out so the plaintiffs' rights are protected," Judge Sporkin wrote in the order.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: TURKEY;
Turks Claim Benefits of Allied Victory

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 9

 BODY:
All in all, Turks say, it turned out to be not a bad little war for them.
Totaling the pluses and minuses, Government officials are convinced that Turkey has emerged from the Persian Gulf crisis diplomatically sturdier, militarily richer and economically hopeful of making up the billions of dollars that were lost after Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
 And it was all accomplished, they add happily, while the country managed not to fire a single shot or suffer a scratch, despite early fears that Iraq might lob in Scud missiles at any moment. The main concern now is that civil unrest in Iraq could fragment that country and leave the Turks with an unstable neighbor.
Turkey's claim to some of the victors' spoils lies in its early and steady support for the United States-led alliance, a decision engineered and followed through almost single-handedly by President Turgut Ozal. If public opinion, the political opposition and the military and foreign-policy establishments all had their way, Turkey would have ridden out the entire crisis pretty much on the sidelines.
 
Unpopular One-Man Show
 "For the first time in 200 years, Turkey has allied itself with the winners of a war," the President said the other day. "Siding with the winners is always advantageous."
Mr. Ozal saw to it that Turkey quickly shut an important pipeline carrying Iraqi oil, that Turkish troops were massed at the southeastern border to tie down Iraqi troops there and that American pilots were allowed to use Incirlik Air Base for bombing runs against Iraq.
Although the Turks' military role was not central to the allied victory -- only five percent of the United States air sorties are said to have originated from Incirlik -- diplomats assert that the Turkish involvement was enough to force President Saddam Hussein to "look both ways," north as well as south, for possible attacks.
For all his success, the Turkish leader's tendency to be a one-man show makes him unpopular at home. But in Washington and Europe, his stock could not be much higher, and officials here argue that that translates into a victory for Turkey by reminding the West of the country's importance as NATO's point man in the Middle East.
 
'The Turkish Formula'
 The Turks are not fooling themselves on that score. Being on the winning side does not solve their many problems, they acknowledge. Turkey is no closer to its goal of membership in the European Community, and the West is not likely to stop protesting human-rights violations here or the continued Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.
Nevertheless, Government officials emphasize the "stabilizing role" they can play in the region, and Mr. Ozal insists that no Middle East peace conference can be successful without Turkish participation. If nothing else, some here say, Turkey has underscored its importance as an Islamic model.
"The West," said Kamran Inan, a Cabinet minister, "has discovered that the best formula for a Muslim nation is the Turkish formula -- Muslim, yes, but secular and democratically ruled."
How Turkey can be a stabilizing force, in practical terms, is less than clear. Turkish participation in new long-term security networks in the region is unlikely. NATO, officials here say, may not approve of one of its members joining such an arrangement and, perhaps more to the point, Arab states say that regional security must be an Arabs-only proposition.
[In an attempt to address the question of civil unrest in Iraq, Turkey announced on Monday that Turkish officials had met with leaders of Iraqi Kurdish organizations. In the past, Turkey had sought to block Iraqi Kurds' separatist drives, fearing that they would lend strength to similar moves by Turkey's Kurds.]
 
Stronger Turkish Military
 On balance, Turkey has ended up with a stronger military thanks to wartime Western assistance.
Several NATO countries moved in troops and equipment to serve as a trip-wire force against a possible Iraqi attack, and when the European soldiers return home they will leave behind up-to-date tanks and artillery to replace museum pieces from the 1950's that the Turkish Army still uses.
As for help from the United States, the Turks hope to double the size of their fleet of F-16 fighters, to 320, and to break free from an American formula that gives rival Greece $7 for every $10 in military aid that goes here. Washington has already given the Turks an emergency package of $82 million and the Bush Administration wants to increase Ankara's regular military assistance, from $515 million last year to $700 million in 1992.
But the main concern for Turkey is to bounce back from the economic blows inflicted by the gulf crisis. Estimates vary, but the country puts its losses at up to $9 billion in forfeited trade, tourism, construction projects and oil-pipeline fees. Less than a third of that has been offset by foreign aid.
But Mr. Ozal, ever optimistic, said Turkey's prospects were bright -- especially because despite the crisis, the Turkish economy grew by nearly 13 percent in 1990. There is also hopeful talk here of winning contracts in the rebuilding of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Agreement Reached to Save Daily News

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Robert Maxwell, the British publisher, and the unions of The Daily News reached tentative agreements yesterday on new labor contracts, clearing a major obstacle to the purchase of what was once the largest daily newspaper in the country.
Mr. Maxwell will now try to complete the purchase of The News from its owner, the Tribune Company of Chicago. He indicated yesterday that he might ask the Tribune Company for more money in negotiations today and tomorrow than the $60 million the company had already promised. But he also suggested in countless ways that he expected to be the owner and publisher of The News within a few days. 
 Mr. Maxwell said he thought the sale could be completed by tomorrow, the deadline set by the Tribune Company. If the sale is not completed, The News, which has been crippled by a strike that began on Oct. 25, will cease publication on Friday, the paper's executives have said.
 
Threatened to Leave U.S.
 The settlement with the unions was achieved after deadlines set by Mr. Maxwell came and went over two days. Negotiations went on practically around the clock, as exhausted labor officials, anxious union members and thousands of interested New Yorkers wondered whether a 71-year-old landmark of the city's public life would survive the week. At 2 P.M. yesterday, Mr. Maxwell set a final deadline of 3 P.M., after which, he said, he would leave the country. The final union, the drivers', settled more than an hour after that deadline.
The labor settlements, which must be acted on by the rank and file, were reached after six days of talks that Mr. Maxwell described as "extraordinarily intensive." To save the paper, the unions had to agree to the elimination of 800 jobs, or almost one-third of the unionized work force of nearly 2,600 -- concessions worth more than $70 million a year.
 
Circulation Is Slashed
 News of the agreement, announced shortly before 4:30 P.M., circulated quickly among members of the nine unions that have been on strike for 139 days. The bitter strike has caused The News's circulation of more than 1.1 million to be slashed in half and has virtually eliminated its advertising base.
Many union members said they were thrilled at the paper's apparent survival and felt vindicated against the Tribune Company, which many have accused of trying to break the unions. But many also said they felt extremely sad about the jobs to be lost.
Eddie Borges, a reporter, said: "For a second there, I was on the verge of crying. We broke the company that tried to break the union."
But Mr. Borges, 27 years old, who began working at The News in February 1990, said he did not know whether he had enough seniority to avoid being laid off.
At two news conferences yesterday afternoon in the jammed lobby of the Macmillan building, at Third Avenue and 53d Street, which Mr. Maxwell owns and where the talks had been held since Thursday, he exulted in the labor agreements, which had represented perhaps the most difficult hurdle in his effort to buy The News.
"Common sense prevailed and we have a deal," Mr. Maxwell said.
He said he and the labor leaders had succeeded "in saving the vast majority of the jobs, preventing The News from being closed by the Tribune Company and giving the newspaper back to the people of New York."
 
'We Will Make a Profit'
 "It means, regrettably, the loss of jobs," he added, "but I am willing to go on record here that we will make a profit, barring any unforeseen circumstances, in the first year of operation. That is an indication to you of the kind of reality and realism of this bargaining."
Mr. Maxwell reached a tentative agreement with the Tribune Company last week to buy The News, contingent on his working out new labor contracts.
The Tribune Company has agreed to pay Mr. Maxwell $60 million to take over the paper and to assume most of its long-term liabilities, including severance pay in the event of a shutdown and lifetime job guarantees to more than 200 union members.
Mr. Maxwell was asked if he would seek to renegotiate the terms of the agreement, perhaps by requesting more than $60 million. "I may indeed well ask," he responded. "Whether I get it is another matter."
 
'Try to Write Editorials'
 He also offered some details about his plans for the tabloid, which was the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily before the strike. The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times are the two largest metropolitan dailies.
Mr. Maxwell said he would serve as publisher for the first 6 to 12 months. He said he would "try to write editorials," and he said helping to restore the city's economic stability would be a major concern of the paper.
"It would be one of my major jobs to support and sustain the public officials and private industries in making New York a viable town," he said.
Mr. Maxwell said he had no intention of importing editors from Britain. When asked who would be editor of The News, Mr. Maxwell said, "There is a very good editor at present at The News." He was referring to James P. Willse.
In an interview late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Maxwell said he wanted his Daily News to be "first and foremost, a paper that will be the voice of New York for the ordinary man."
He also said he hoped that the paper could become a voice of America for Europeans. "I would hope that The News could become an important voice internationally, in terms of telling the world how America feels," he said.
He also said he would try to lure back Jimmy Breslin, the celebrated columnist who moved from The News to New York Newsday several years ago.
 
$10 Million Investment
 Mr. Maxwell also said that a great many management positions would have to be eliminated, but he did not specify how many.
He said he expected to invest at least $10 million in the first six to eight weeks, in an attempt to rebuild the paper's circulation and advertising. The Tribune Company estimated that it would cost about $50 million to resurrect the paper.
He also said he expected to start using color within two or three years.
Mr. Maxwell had sought huge concessions from the unions to make the paper profitable, and that is precisely what he got.
He wanted to reduce labor costs by more than $70 million a year, primarily by eliminating about 800 jobs. The contracts that were completed Monday night and yesterday will do that, said Theodore W. Kheel, a labor lawyer who is the unions' chief adviser.
The largest unions at The News were among the hardest hit. The Newspaper Guild, which represents 759 newsroom, advertising and circulation employees, agreed to the elimination of 238 jobs, said Barry F. Lipton, president of the union. About 300 of the 700 drivers' positions will be cut, union officials said.
John P. Kennedy, head of the pressmen's union, declined to say how many jobs his union had agreed to drop. Mr. Maxwell was believed to be seeking to cut half of the 400 pressmen's jobs.
 
Buyouts First, Then Layoffs
 Cash inducements of $40,000 will be offered to employees willing to leave the paper or retire early. If the inducements, called buyouts, do not produce enough volunteers willing to leave the paper, there will then be layoffs, union leaders said.
Inducements to the printers, who have guaranteed lifetime contracts, will be $50,000. These are considerably smaller than similar buyouts that have been offered to other union members at New York's newspapers.
If Mr. Maxwell succeeds in restoring the paper's circulation and advertising, some of those laid off may be called back to work, union officials said. But the contracts do not contain precise formulas for such rehiring, Mr. Lipton said.
Mr. Maxwell achieved his goals for several reasons. Unlike the Tribune Company, he was willing to negotiate the staff reductions through collective bargaining. The current owner of The News had sought to make such decisions unilaterally. The Tribune Company wanted to regain total control of workplace issues like staffing levels and guaranteed overtime, issues that traditionally had been negotiated with the unions.
 
Partners, Not Enemies
 "What we're doing," Mr. Maxwell said yesterday, "is working with a work force in partnership rather than treating them as though they were the enemy within and without."
The unions also knew that Mr. Maxwell represented the last hope of keeping The News alive, which no doubt made it easier to accept the loss of 800 jobs in order to save 1,800 others.
Mr. Kheel said Mr. Maxwell's personality and salesmanship had also counted heavily. "It was a performance to end all performances," Mr. Kheel said.
"He was in everything," Mr. Kheel said. "He dominated. He cajoled. He met with the full committees and he met with the small committees. He got involved in the minutia."
Mr. Maxwell picked up all the costs of the negotiations, from the use of two floors in his building to takeout food and carfare. He provided food prepared by his corporate chefs to the union officials, and he offered them secretaries for typing and other tasks, Mr. Kheel said. Labor and management usually share the cost of negotiations.
 
The Only Hope
 Mr. Maxwell, whose many holdings include The Daily Mirror, Britain's second-largest daily paper, and the Macmillan publishing house, was invited by The News on Feb. 27 to begin talks about a possible sale.
The following day, negotiations between The News and the nine striking unions were abandoned. The unions and management had met for eight long days over a span of more than two weeks under the guidance of a private mediator, Bill Usery Jr. But the talks never progressed, and they were halted by Mr. Usery, who said he wanted to allow enough time for a possible sale of the paper. By that point, a sale was the only hope for keeping The News alive.
Mr. Maxwell and the Tribune Company reached a tentative sale agreement in five days, contingent on a resolution of the labor dispute.
The British publisher said yesterday that he was confident The News could be resurrected. "The News is rightly positioned in the marketplace," he said. "All we want to do is to get back to business as quickly as we can. I hope that we will have the enthusiastic support of every single member of the 10 trade unions involved in what has been a rather long and terrible dispute."

HEADLINE: They're Wearing the Green Amid the Great Reds

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BORDEAUX, France, March 12

 BODY:
It is often said that Ireland's most important export has been its youth. In the 19th century, famine and despair drove well over a million of the Irish to the United States alone.
The enormity of that sad exodus, still vivid to many, tends to blur the memory of earlier waves of Irish emigrants, including the famous Wild Geese, who came to France in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. 
 Many of the Irish immigrant families went into the wine business, where their descendants are often still to be found. Almost forgotten is the fact that Ireland in the 18th and early 19th centuries imported more fine Bordeaux wine than did England.
"Someone came up with the name 'Wine Geese,' " said Anthony Barton, the urbane doyen of Chateau Langoa-Barton and Leoville-Barton in St. Julien. "Of course, it's just a pun. There's no society or club or any such thing," he added, plainly appalled at the idea.
This weekend, French descendants of those immigrants, joined by Ireland's Ambassador to France, Tadgh O'Sullivan, will pay homage to their forebears at a round of St. Patrick's Day celebrations here and in the nearby wine country.
According to legend, the first Irish immigrants to France were soldiers defeated in battle, unbowed Catholic warriors fleeing English tyranny at home to follow the Stuarts into exile and carry on the fight with their old foe. And some were just that.
But not all left to join the French Army's independent Irish Brigades. Many were merchants, some even Protestants, who came to prosperous France to seek their fortunes.
Mr. Barton, is a descendant of one of those men, Thomas (French Tom) Barton, who left Fermanagh in 1722. First at Marseille and then Montpellier, he established himself as a trader. He arrived in Bordeaux in 1725 and amassed a fortune trading French brandy and Cognac for Irish wool. Although the Bartons always kept close ties with Ireland -- Anthony Barton was born there -- since French Tom's arrival, there have been nine generations of Bartons here, an unbroken line. The Bartons were one of the first of the prominent Irish merchant clans of Bordeaux, but by no means the only one. Indeed, the Irish presence here in the 18th century was formidable. Renagh Holohan, in her book "The Irish Chateaux" (Lilliput Press, Dublin, 1989), says there were some 60 Irish names among the city's merchants in the mid-1800's.
Most of the old Irish families have disappeared. Some moved away, some simply died out. Others had daughters who married into the French aristocracy. Even so, many of their names live on in the great wine chateaus they once owned: Langoa-Barton, Leoville-Barton, Lynch-Bages, Lynch-Moussas, Kirwan, Phelan Segur, Dillon, Clarke and MacCarthy, among them.
Some Irish families bought chateaus and kept the ancient names. The Johnstons, for example, owned the Chateaux Dauzac and Lascombes in Margaux, Ducru-Beaucaillou in St.-Julien and had shares, with the Bartons, in Latour, in Pauillac. Chateau La Houringue, whose vineyards are part of Chateau Giscours's vineyard now, was owned by John O'Byrne, a merchant and shipper who was known as the Chevalier O'Byrne.
Hugh Barton, who headed the Barton family business at the time of the Terror, in 1793, was imprisoned in a Carmelite Convent, along with clerical students from Bordeaux's Irish College. He was released and fled to Ireland, leaving his business in the hands of his partner, Daniel Guestier. Barton & Guestier, their firm, survived independently until 1956 when it was absorbed into the Seagram wine and spirits empire.
In 1940 another Barton, Ronald, escaped to England ahead of the advancing Germans, again leaving the business to a Daniel Guestier. He persuaded the Germans that Langoa-Barton was owned by an Irish neutral; the Germans did not harm it.
Almost as venerable an Irish clan here are the Lawtons. Abraham Lawton came to Bordeaux in 1836 from Cork, where he had been Mayor. The shipping company he founded here, Tastet & Lawton, survives. Hugues Lawton is a negociant, or wholesaler and shipper, and his brother Daniel is a broker, or middleman, between the chateaus and the negociants.
In spite of their prominence in the Bordeaux wine trade, neither brother owns a chateau. Their grandfather, Edouard, owned Leoville-Poyferre and Edouard's cousin, Jean, owned Chateau Cantenac-Brown for many years. Their mother, Simone deLuze Lawton, is an example of how the Irish families became integrated here. The deLuzes are an old and distinguished negociant family.
The Phelans -- the accent didn't come until later -- arrived in Bordeaux around 1796 from Tipperary. Bernard Phelan bought Chateau de Segur, in St.-Estephe in 1810. His son, Frank, took over after his father's death in 1841. Frank was Mayor of St.-Estephe for a time and his portrait now graces Phelan Segur's second wine, which is called Frank Phelan. He also married a Guestier.
The chateau passed out of the Phelan family in 1918 and is now owned by Xavier Gardinier, from the Champagne region, who made much of his fortune mining phosphates in Florida.
Chateau Clarke, in Listrac, is a magnificent building but it has little relation to the Clarkes. Tobie Clarke was a gun merchant from County Down who came to Nantes after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, then settled in Bordeaux. His son Luc-Tobie, a criminal court judge, gave the estate its name. The house was demolished in 1955. Baron Edmond de Rothschild bought it in 1979 and erected the present structure.
One of the best-known Irish names in Bordeaux is Lynch. In the hands of Jean-Michel Cazes and his father, Andre, who bought the property in 1934, Chateau Lynch-Bages, in Pauillac, has become one of the most sought-after of all Bordeaux wines.
The first Lynch in France was Col. John Lynch, an authentic member of les Oies Sauvages, the Wild Geese. He came to France after the Irish lost the battle of Aughrim to the British in 1691, turned to commerce and did well.
The best-known Lynch was Jean-Baptiste, who was born at Chateau Dauzac in the Medoc, in 1749. He was variously a staunch parliamentarian, a royalist, and then, when it seemed propitious, a Bonapartist. When Napoleon fell, he quickly became a royalist again. When Napoleon returned from Elba, Jean-Baptiste, who had been Mayor of Bordeaux for a time, fled to England. He returned after Waterloo and died at Dauzac in 1835.
Another descendant of Jean-Baptiste Lynch, Alain Miailhe, owned Chateau Dauzac for a time in the 1970's. He decided to rename it Lynch-Dauzac, but was sued by the Cazes and the owners of Lynch-Moussas, the Casteja family. They won and he had to drop Lynch from the property's name. He sold it soon thereafter.
Mr. Miailhe (pronounced mee-EYE), the owner of Chateau Siran in Margaux, and his sister May de Lencquesaing, who owns Chateau Pichon Lalande in Pauillac, are also decended from the Burkes, a Galway family that made a fortune in the Philippines and one of whose daughters married a Frenchman who brought her to Bordeaux.
Asked to name a few Bordeaux chateaus with Irish connections, many people automatically mention Chateau Haut-Brion, in Pessac, one of the five first growths of Bordeaux. They believe Haut-Brion to be a French derivative of O'Brien. It is not. The name comes from language spoken in the region hundreds of years ago and refers to the slight rise in the ground on which the property, once far larger, is situated.
Nor are the American owners, the Dillons, of Irish descent. Clarence Dillon, one of the founders of the Wall Street firm Dillon-Read, who bought Haut-Brion in the mid-1930's, was of Polish origin and had changed his name as a young man. After his death, the chateau passed to his son, Douglas, who was the United States Ambassador to France and Secretary of the Treasury in the 1960's. His daughter, Joan, the Duchesse de Mouchy, directs its operation.
Thus, the Dillons of Haut-Brion have no connection with the Dillons who were, with the MacCarthys, among the most prominent of all the Irish families in France in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Irish Dillons' fame came originally from their connection with the Irish Brigades. The Brigades were first organized in the mid-17th century when Charles II, exiled from Cromwell's England, formed an army in exile in France. One of these was headed by James Dillon of Roscommon.
Generations of Dillons served in these private armies. Some returned to Ireland but most of those not killed in battle eventually moved into French society. One history of the family lists seven separate Dillon families with French connections.
The MacCarthys, once said to be the richest of all Bordeaux wine merchants, on a par economically with the Hennessys in Cognac, are now known only by Chateau MacCarthy, a minor property in the Medoc, and by the Hotel MacCarthy, a magnificent town house in the center of Bordeaux.
One wine that will not be drunk this weekend is Chateau St. Patrick. Maurice Healey, the 19th-century Irish wine writer, claims to have found such a wine in Boston during his travels. Anthony Barton said he had never heard of it, but added, "It is a lovely thought, though."

HEADLINE: Latest Tokyo Craze: Tiramisu in a Bottle

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 10

 BODY:
For trendier Japanese, European flair is in these days, while Americana has lost in luster. But few of the recent Euro-fads have swept Tokyo as thoroughly as tiramisu, which has been transformed from a chic dessert to a marketing phenomenon packaged as candy and even dispensed from vending machines.
This is a society closed to many things, as trade negotiators often assert, but open to trends more than most outsiders realize. In the last few years, as the traditionally penurious Japanese have been urged by their Government to spend some of the vast wealth that trade surpluses and a booming economy are depositing here, luxury goods with a foreign air have been snapped up with ferocious energy. 
 Now, tiramisu, the dessert of espresso-soaked cake slathered with mascarpone cheese, with a dusting of cocoa powder and Italian cachet, is demonstrating anew how a foreign product can breach Japan's forbidding cultural ramparts and take the country by storm -- once tastemakers and marketers decide to put their promotion machines into action.
Last week Asahi Breweries, which has a line of non-alcoholic beverages, unveiled its Tira soft drink. It is a canned concoction of coffee, chocolate, cream, sugar and, of course, mascarpone cheese. The development follows the widely advertised introduction of a tiramisu chocolate bar by a Japanese confectioner.
Last month Kentucky Fried Chicken rushed to unveil a frozen tiramisu dessert at its 415 outlets in the Tokyo region. (It tastes suspiciously like ice cream with chocolate powder on top.) Wendy's, the American fast-food chain, and two Japanese chains, Mos Burger and First Kitchen, have brought out their own versions.
Jun Orihara, an executive at the Nosawa Company, one of the major importers of mascarpone cheese from Italy, said his sales of the commodity have gone from less than 3 tons in 1989, before the fad took hold, to about 140 tons last year.
"Tiramisu is the only reason for this tremendous growth," he said.
Silvano Borroni, the Italian proprietor of Il Boccalone, a popular trattoria in Tokyo, explained the popularity this way: "They really like booms here. I tell them there are other very beautiful Italian desserts. But they feel whatever is a boom is good."
Trend, fad, craze -- none of those familiar words quite grasp the sometimes peculiar enthusiasm with which Japanese embrace "in" things, ranging in recent years from Louis Vuitton and then Chanel handbags to fresh French bread, pasta, pizza and foreign travel.
It can, however, seem a bit mechanical. Japan's corporate establishment seizes on these sales opportunities and pushes them with the vigor of a research team chasing the latest breakthrough in computer chip technology.
In fact, these spasms of buying are a sign of the times. A few years ago the Government decided to reduce the economy's reliance on exports, a sore point with trading partners, particularly the United States, and place more emphasis on domestic consumption as an engine of growth. One result: the mass passions that fill magazines and television talk shows and, ultimately, cash registers.
The current phenomenon was captured best by a description in a popular magazine, which labeled it the "tiramisu syndrome."
The craze began with an editorial meeting a year ago at the offices of Hanako, an influential two-year-old magazine whose 350,000 readers are largely women in their 20's seeking help in navigating the treacherous waters of trendiness. The subject of the meeting was desserts for affluent, fashion-minded, urban women.
Cheesecake (lighter here than the classic New York version) dominated the dessert scene for several years. But it seemed out of touch with the recent popularity of things European. That's when it happened.
"I'd been feeling we were ready for another big cake hit," said Yamato Shiine, Hanako's editor in chief. "But I didn't know what. While we were talking, someone mentioned tiramisu, and it just clicked. It sounded like a pop to me. I knew that was it."
Not least, it coincided with another boom, Italian food. There are now more than 100 Italian restaurants in Tokyo, compared to a handful a few years ago. And it did not hurt that tiramisu had already swept New York several years earlier, giving Manhattan's respected imprimatur to the dessert.
Last April Hanako touted tiramisu in its cover article and included eight pages listing restaurants and cafes that carried the dessert. The main headline read: "Emergency Information on Tiramisu, the New Queen of Italian Desserts."
"Delicious tiramisu is proof," the magazine said, "of a classy restaurant." Eating tiramisu, Hanako enthused, "will make you feel like an Italian all day."
The article hit Tokyo like the starting gun at a track meet.
Mr. Borroni of Il Boccalone said he had to eject a few customers who came in merely to have tiramisu and cappuccino.
Tetsuro Yanai, head of planning at Fuji Oil, a vegetable oil processor that had been trying without much success to market a synthetic mascarpone, said his company was soon overwhelmed with orders.
"After that article, the boom spread like a fire," Mr. Yanai said, adding that he felt Fuji Oil had helped create the groundwork for the fad by selling the virtues of cheesy desserts to bakers for several years. "Demand was much larger than what we could supply."
Sales of the mascarpone substitute, which is about half the price of the imported cheese and lasts longer without spoiling, more than doubled in each succeeding month.
"Tiramisu might be a little past peak now, but I think it is here to stay," Mr. Yanai said.
Ichiro Takatsuki, a spokesman for Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan Ltd., said that as the trend fades in Tokyo, his company plans to introduce tiramisu in other cities, like Osaka and Nagoya, where it takes about a year for Tokyo fashions to grab hold.
Some trendsetters feel the tiramisu fad is stale, but say they have not hit on a fitting replacement yet. Hanako tried in a recent issue to push creme brulee, the custardy French dessert with a burnt sugar crust, but failed to incite much enthusiasm.
"The problem," he said, "is that it's too hard for a Japanese to pronounce. We have to find something with a better name. We're still looking."

HEADLINE: Chip Index Up Sharply

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 12

 BODY:
The semiconductor industry's key indicator of business prospects jumped in February, a sign that the industry slump might be drawing to an end.
Propelled by orders for computer chips, the book-to-bill ratio rose to 1.09 for the three months that ended with February from 0.96 for the three months that ended with January, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the trade group that compiles the statistics. The jump was the largest monthly increase in the index since March 1983. 
 A ratio of 1.09 means that for every $100 in products shipped, or billings, semiconductor companies received $109 in new orders, or bookings, from customers in the United States, a sign that business is getting stronger.
Orders rose 14.9 percent for the three months through February over the three months that ended in January. Shipments, or billings, rose only 1.1 percent comparing three-month periods, but shipments in February alone were 9 percent higher than in Janaury.
Michael Stark, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company in San Francisco, said the ratio was higher than expected and was "definitely a good sign." He said, however, that the 1.1 percent increase in shipments for the three-month period indicates that the upturn in business might not be especially strong.
With some exceptions, semiconductor companies have been experiencing soft business, the result of the recession and a slowdown in the growth of the personal computer industry. In November, the ratio had been at 0.93, one of the lowest levels in years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Pushed Down Again By Central Banks' Sales

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A second day of central bank interventions pushed the dollar lower yesterday, but analysts said unflagging confidence in the postwar economy helped stem the currency's decline.
Gold was mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose 10 cents an ounce to settle at $364.80. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $364.60, off 40 cents from Monday's late bid. 
 The dollar opened lower after some limited selling by overseas central banks. But it began to recover as belief in the economy's ability to rebound replaced nervousness caused by interventions.
"Traders are still cautiously friendly to the dollar," said Pete Grant, managing currency analyst for MMS International in Chicago.
Yesterday's central bank intervention was smaller in scope than Monday's selloff, in which European central banks and the Federal Reserve joined in an effort to deflate the currency's surging postwar momentum.
The only central banks involved in yesterday's intervention were the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan, traders said.
"Yesterday they did it for the initial shock and today it is just to show a presence," said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at Bank of Boston. "They don't want to overkill the market and overly hurt people."
In Tokyo, the dollar settled at 136.05 Japanese yen, down from 138.07 at Monday's close. Later in London, it fell to 136.25 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 135.84 yen from late Monday's 138.20 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8585, from $1.8505 late Monday. In New York sterling also rose, fetching $1.8625 by the end of the day, more than late Monday's $1.8515.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.5703 marks from 1.5815.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.3605 Swiss francs, down from 1.3705; 5.3495 French francs, down from 5.3845; 1,172.00 Italian lire, down from 1,180.00, and 1.1538 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1558.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Makes Strong Advance After Agreement by OPEC

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices rallied yesterday after OPEC agreed to cut crude oil production by a million barrels a day.
The surge erased losses that had come as traders speculated that the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva would produce no cuts or only token cuts. 
 Crude oil for delivery in April settled at $19.68 a barrel, up 69 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
In early trading, oil had fallen on perceptions that OPEC would fail to reach an agreement on pumping less crude oil. OPEC had lifted its previous production quotas after the United Nations boycotted crude oil from Iraq and Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion.
 
A Strong Finish
 "We started falling off rather dramatically as people started expecting OPEC to only cut about 300,000 barrels a day," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "That was the rumor when they were in session."
After the oil ministers announced the reductions, which will cut production to an estimated 22.3 million barrels a day, oil fell for a while but then reversed for a strong finish.
"While it is not a particularly strong agreement, the fact that they did get something together was enough to be supportive," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Beutel said OPEC would still be pumping too much crude, but the cuts would bring the market "closer to alignment."
Some analysts say OPEC must cut about two million barrels a day to push prices much higher.
Refined petroleum products also finished higher yesterday.
Unleaded gasoline for delivery in April settled at 71.67 cents a gallon, up 0.26 cent. Home heating oil for delivery in April settled at 55.80 cents a gallon, up 1.37 cents.
In London, North Sea Brent blend crude oil for delivery in April settled at $19.03 a barrel, up 66 cents, at the International Petroleum Exchange.
 
Stockpiles Are Down
 After the oil markets closed, the American Petroleum Institute reported that the United States supply of crude oil, home heating oil and gasoline had fallen last week, as had refinery utilization.
Crude oil stocks were at 330.2 million barrels for the week ended March 8, down from 336.1 million a week earlier and 350.8 million a year earlier, the institute said.
Stocks of distillates, which include home heating oil, were at 101.5 million barrels, down from 103.3 million a week earlier and 110.1 million a year earlier. Gasoline stocks were at 220.1 million barrels, compared with 222.6 million a week earlier and 243.7 million a year earlier.
American refineries were running at 84.3 percent of capacity, compared with 85.3 percent a week earlier and 83.7 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Delinquency

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The number of Americans behind in paying credit card bills rose sharply in the fourth quarter but the combined delinquency rate for seven other kinds of consumer loans was stable, a trade group said today.
The percentage of credit card holders 30 or more days late on their payments was a seasonally adjusted 2.86 at the end of the year compared with 2.56 at the end of September and 2.24 a year earlier, the American Bankers Association said. 
 Despite the deepening recession, however, the seasonally adjusted average for seven types of closed-end installment loans was 2.57 percent at the end of the year compared with 2.56 percent at the end of September and 2.64 percent at the end of 1989.
"Consumers are reorienting their finances," said Robert H. Dugger, an economist for the banker's group. "They're reducing savings, paying up their mortgage obligations, holding their own with ordinary consumer debt and falling behind in credit-card debt."
The delinquency rate for home equity lines of credit, as measured by the American Bankers Association, edged up to 0.85 percent at the end of 1990 from 0.80 percent.
Delinquency rates often do not rise significantly until well into a recession.
The banking group surveyed 800 commercial banks, tracking loans in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.
The seven loan types surveyed for the closed-end installment rate include personal, two types of auto loans, mobile home, recreational vehicle, property improvement and second mortgages.

Using Bacteria to Control Pollution

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Bacteria may be better than chemicals or absorbent materials at controlling emissions of volatile solvents that contribute to low-level smog and at eliminating the odors of sewage treatment plants and composting operations, experts in the field say.
Although the use of bacteria to clean up pollution on land and in water is still in the experimental stage, at least two dozen biological filters are in use in this country, scrubbing out odors and breaking foul organic compounds into more benign carbon dioxide and water. 
 Biofilters or soil bioreactors, as they are called, take advantage of bacteria's ability to adapt themselves to feed on whatever material is available, from tree leaves to propane.
The filters are decidedly low tech and appear from the outside to be little more than a mound of dirt. But they can control air emission problems without consuming the chemicals used in scrubber systems or without the regeneration systems needed with activated carbon treatment.
S. C. Johnson & Son Inc. uses a biofilter to treat emissions of pentane and butane that escape from its aerosol can filling operations in Racine, Wis. "We lose from 30 to 100 tons from the aerosol filling line a year," said Timothy Lafond, the environmental manager at Johnson's Waxdale manufacturing plant. "On average we get 90 percent-plus control efficiency" from the biofilter, he said. The bacteria present in the soil break the relatively simple hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water, which are vented into the atmosphere.
Since volatile organic compounds like pentane and butane contribute to low-altitude smog, emissions are being progressively restricted by Federal and state regulations. The Johnson filter has been in continuous operation since December 1988 with little maintenance other than watering in dry periods.
 
Key Ingredient Is Dirt
 Like most biofilters, the principal ingredient is dirt. Air from around the aerosol filling is collected and blown into a grid of perforated pipes laid in a bed of gravel. The gravel diffuses the air-solvent mix, which rises into the three-foot-deep dirt filter.
In it, the hydrocarbon molecules are adsorbed on droplets of water and then broken down by microbes that obtain energy and elements necessary for their survival and growth in the process. The oxygen-rich atmosphere insures that the offensive compounds will be converted chemically to oxides before leaving the filter.
The Johnson filter occupies an acre between two factory buildings. It is covered with grass and looks like an open field. The performance of the filter fluctuates with the seasons because it is based on living organisms. Mr. Lafond says that 99 percent of the hydrocarbons are destroyed in warm weather, but that the breakdown rate drops to 65 percent in severe cold as the bacteria become less active.
Mr. Lafond said it was not necessary to develop special strains of bacteria to make a soil filter work. "The bugs are already there," he added. But he said there was a "learning curve" when it was first used, as the bacteria adapted to feed on the hydrocarbons. "We started at 30 to 40 percent efficiency and gradually took that up to over 90 percent," Mr. Lafond said, as the solvent-eating bacteria increased in number.
 
Looking for Green Grass
 Since moisture in an important part of the treatment process, the water content of the filter is monitored. "If the grass is green, then we assume the water is O.K.," Mr. Lafond said. "If it starts to turn brown, then we get concerned." Lawn sprinklers are used until the grass is green and lush again.
Since the bacteria feed on the wastes they are treating, the filters can be operated for years with little attention. Maintenance is sometimes limited to cutting the grass. The one exception is in cases where the chemical products of the breakdown process tend to acidify. Many of the bacteria that best remove odor-causing compounds are sensitive to acidity of the soil. Once again, though, the solution is simple.
For example, in Gainesville, Fla., a soil filter is used to remove hydrogen sulfide -- a toxic gas with a rotten-egg smell -- from a sewage treatment plant. Although the filter removes more than 99 percent of the offensive gas, according to Eric R. Allen, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Florida, the sulfur oxides produced by the breakup of hydrogen sulfide tend to combine with the moisture in the earth to form sulfuric acid.
"We have to add lime to offset the acidity," Professor Allen said.
 
'Very, Very Cheap'
 He said the low-tech nature of biofilters had made it difficult to convince engineers accustomed to chemical treatment systems of their value. But he said economics might increase their attractiveness. "They are very, very cheap to operate," he said.
A report produced by Geoffrey A. Kuter of International Process Systems, which uses biofilters to control odors from composting operations, indicated that the annual operating cost would be 44 percent less than a chemical scrubbing system and 75 percent less than activated carbon -- which is highly adsorbent because of its large surface area.
One drawback is the amount of land required for a biofilter. Not every industrial site has an acre or more to set aside to treat emissions. "If you have a lot of area, then you can use a biofilter," said Sam Cha, a chemist with TRC Environmental Engineering in East Hartford, Conn. "But if you do not, they you would probably want a carbon system, because they are very compact."
There are a variety of formulas for the composition of biofilters, depending on the compounds to be treated. Ordinary soil, compost and peat provide the microorganisms, and other materials, like volcanic ash, sand and bark, are used to make the pile porous. Mr. Kuter said the ideal filter had 40 to 60 percent empty space to allow air to circulate.
He said biofilters were merely an engineered version of a technique practiced for centuries: covering foul-smelling materials with soil to control odor. Some examples are the soil covers typically found over septic systems and garbage landfills.
But he said the effectiveness of this approach had been limited by the amount of oxygen present in the soil. By controlling the amount of air being mixed with the substance to be treated, biofilter operators can insure an abundant supply of oxygen.
Biofilters have been widely used in Europe and Japan, and are gradually attracting more interest in this country. "We did our project before it became popular," Mr. Lafond said. "Now a lot of people are very interested in biological systems."

Diagrams: "Clearing the Air Over Treatment Plants"
 The microbes live off the odorous compounds in the molecules of waste gas, producing largely carbon dioxide and water.
 Biofilters regenerate themselves and require very little maintenance to continue operating for years.

HEADLINE: Diamond Sales Hurt by War

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, March 12

 BODY:
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's largest diamond producer, said today that the Persian Gulf crisis had hurt diamond sales last year, but that the recent jump in world stock markets should lead to an improvement.
Sales fell slightly last year in North America and Japan but rose slightly in Europe.
But diamond activity in Israel, a leading cutting center, fell 30 percent to 40 percent during the crisis. Buyers of polished diamonds were unwilling to travel during the crisis. Economic uncertainty and consumer caution in the United States, the biggest retail jewelry market, also had an effect.
But the company's chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, said he was encouraged by the gains in recent weeks on stock exchanges around the world. "That is often a pointer to how our business may go, down the road," he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Pink Slips, Budget Blues

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FORECASTERS who have been counting on the recession to melt away with the sunny news from the Persian Gulf got a rude surprise from the Labor Department on Friday. Unemployment reached 6.5 percent in February, the highest rate in four years and a sobering three-tenths of a percentage point higher than a month earlier.
The prospect of a slow recovery is likely to focus attention on a subject that almost everyone in Washington would like to ignore: unemployment benefits. For while there is wide agreement that the safety net for jobless workers has been weakened in the last decade, a fix would cost money. 
 States bear the primary responsibility for unemployment insurance, setting eligibility rules and compensation levels and then taxing employers to finance the first six months of each worker's jobless pay. Last year the states spent $17 billion on some eight million claimants, with the average beneficiary taking home $154 a week for 13 weeks.
Once workers run through 26 weeks of ordinary benefits they become eligible for 13 weeks of extended benefits partly paid for by Washington, provided the insured jobless rate in their state exceeds 5 percent. In truly hard times, Congress usually stretches eligibility for many more months. From 1982 through 1985, workers in the hardest-hit states received benefits for 55 weeks at a cumulative cost to Uncle Sam of $12 billion.
Six months of benefits . . . three months of extended benefits in high-unemployment states . . . an extra three or four months beyond that if job prospects turn extra grim. . . . Where's the problem?
Wayne Vroman, an economist at the Urban Institute in Washington, points out that the proportion of unemployed workers who collect benefits has fallen sharply since the 1970's. In part this reflects tougher state eligibility requirements, in part a shift in unemployment patterns toward states that discourage claims. But whatever the cause, the fact that roughly three unemployed workers in five slip through the net is disquieting.
Then there is the issue of the extended benefits. With a majority of unemployed workers ineligible for ordinary benefits or unwilling to claim them, it takes very high unemployment among those who do make claims to get Federal financing to kick in. Last year only two states, Alaska and Rhode Island, along with Puerto Rico reached the threshold. Mr. Vroman estimates that unemployment would have to exceed 15 percent in some states before extended benefits kicked in.
Broadening basic coverage for workers who have lost their jobs in this recession would require state action. And with most states facing severe budget problems, the prospect of expensive reforms requiring higher taxes on employers seems remote. But the Congressional Budget Office does offer a menu of choices for stretching the jobless pay of the long-term unemployed.
Congress might lower the threshold for extended benefits, or use the more relevant total unemployment rate rather than the insured employment rate to determine eligibility. It might extend coverage for everyone who exhausts state-financed benefits as long as the national unemployment rate remains high. Alternatively, it might stretch jobless benefits for those who are poor -- a fundamental departure for a program that has never had a means test. Or it might extend benefits solely for those who had held the same job for many years.
The catch, of course, is the cost. The simplest reform, 13 weeks of extended benefits for everyone receiving regular benefits, would add $5 billion to the Federal budget next year. Changing state eligibility thresholds to 8 percent total unemployment from 5 percent insured unemployment would cost just $500 million a year -- but would help only an extra 300,000 unemployed people.
Washington is deeply reluctant to make an end run around the budget accord by declaring a temporary economic emergency. And it is hard to imagine Congress financing jobless pay at the expense of entrenched interests.
Perhaps the least painful alternative is the one suggested by Isaac Shapiro and Robert Greenstein, analysts at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. They point out that the Federal unemployment insurance tax on employers now applies only to a worker's first $7,000 in income, a small fraction of the $53,400 Social Security tax base. If the unemployment insurance base were simply made equal to the Social Security base, the current tax rate (a not insignificant eight-tenths of 1 percent) could be cut sharply, even as billions in revenue were raised to finance extended benefits.
None of this seems likely in the current political climate. But for every jobless worker there must be five who worry about pink slips and foreclosed mortgages. And it is a fair guess that the political climate will change if the recession lingers.

HEADLINE: Bush Digs In on Arctic Drilling Plan

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
President Bush will veto any national energy strategy that does not include his proposal allowing drilling in part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, the Secretary of Energy told a Senate hearing today.
Both the White House energy plan and a Senate version propose opening a 1.5-million-acre coastal plain in the wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling, a provision that environmentalists and some lawmakers oppose. 
 Testifying today before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, said that any strategy that does not include drilling in part of the wildlife refuge "is a veto-able issue with the President."
Mr. Watkins also told the panel that if no new large oilfields were developed on Alaska's North Slope, where the refuge is situated, declining production would probably force the Trans-Alaska Pipeline to shut down within 18 years.
The two largest oilfields in North America are on the North Slope. One is the Prudhoe Bay field, the most prolific in the nation, and the other is the Kuparuck River field. These two fields and five smaller ones nearby produce from 1.8 million to 2 million barrels of crude oil a day, about 25 percent of American domestic production.
 
Decline in Oil Output Seen
 But Mr. Watkins said today that there was already evidence of a decline in the oil flow from the North Slope. And an Energy Department study whose results were issued today predicted that by the year 2009, the use of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which carries oil from the North Slope down the 800-mile length of the state to ports on Alaska's southern coast, might no longer be technically or economically feasible if North Slope production drops, as expected, to less than 300,000 barrels a day.
Estimates of the amount of oil to be found on the Arctic coastal plain range from zero to between 500,000 and 2 million barrels a day. "It could be a small Middle East," Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska, an enthusiastic advocate of the drilling provision, said at the hearing today.
Among the critics of the proposal is Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who is an Energy Committee member and favors a national energy strategy that places greater emphasis on conservation and less on production.
Mr. Bradley has proposed raising the price that Americans pay for their oil through higher taxes. Today he said the United States could either raise taxes or adopt a policy of "In Fahd We Trust" in which the nation would continue to be dependent on the Saudi king and the leaders of other major oil-producing nations.
Environmentalists today also reiterated their opposition to the Arctic refuge drilling. Brooks Yeager, vice president of the National Audubon Society, said the drilling would "destroy one of the earth's last great dynamic ecosystems."
But Mr. Hickel disagreed.
"We are tired of those who distort the arguments about A.N.W.R.'s coastal plain," he said. "It is a barren, marshy wilderness in the summer, infested with uncountable mosquitoes, and locked in temperatures of 60 and 70 degrees below zero for up to nine months of the year."

HEADLINE: In Rare Move, Governor Intervenes in Denver School Contract

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
In a highly unusual effort to improve schools, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado has seized control of bitter contract talks in the Denver school system to prevent a strike and is personally writing a contract intended to overhaul the school system.
Several education analysts and a spokeswoman for the National Governors' Association says it is the first time a governor intent on bringing about change in his state's public schools has taken such a direct role in local teacher contract talks. The Governor is trying to use collective bargaining talks to force change on resistant school administrators and teachers in the state's second-largest school district with 59,000 students. 
 "I did it for two reasons," said Governor Romer, who invoked an obscure state law allowing him to intercede after Denver's 4,000 teachers voted to strike in January. "I saw a strike about to occur and the wounds would be too severe for too long. And I saw the negotiations were not leading to the kind of reform that ought to occur."
Education analysts praised the Governor, saying his effort shows that change can occur despite hurdles like resistance from the educational bureaucracy. Although no other state is believed to allow intervention by a governor in local labor talks, the analysts said Governor Romer's attempt to meld a labor contract with school reform measures could give the approach greater stature. As a result, they said the tactic might become more commonplace.
 
Posssible Trend Seen
 "Governor Romer is a pretty unusual fellow," said David Hornbeck, a school-reform consultant who helped Kentucky overhaul its public school system. "What he is doing in phenomenal. One is not going to see that kind of leadership and commitment to education from everyone. But I think you're going to begin to see collective bargaining agreements used more often as a vehicle to sustain widespread change."
School board officials and the teacher's union in Denver initially opposed the Governor's intervention. But after months of unsuccessful negotiations, in which Mayor Federico Pena unsuccessfully tried to bring the two sides together, school officials and teachers alike said they welcomed the Governor's involvement.
"If nothing else, it gave people a chance to cool down," said Evie Dennis, the Superintendent of Schools in Denver.
To date, collective bargaining has been used as a tool for systemic school reform in just a handful of school systems, with mixed success. Los Angeles teachers, for example, went on strike for nine days in 1988 over some proposed changes, including giving the schools management powers, before finally approving a contract. Teachers in Rochester, N.Y., have yet to approve a new contract, in large part because of ts performance-for-pay clause instead of a seniority-based pay scale.
"Everybody is going to be running into this when they begin collective bargaining," said Rexford G. Brown, a senior policy analyst at the Education Commission of the States, a Denver research group that studies education policy. Indeed, about 5,000 of the 11,000 local teacher unions represented by the National Education Association, the largest teachers union in the country, are up for contract talks this year and next. Many experts, including Mr. Brown, expect the Denver experience to be repeated.
 
Major Issues in Talks
 At issue in Denver are proposals that would greatly alter the way schools are managed. One would create school committees made up of school officials, teachers, parents and business leaders to manage individual schools. Teachers want such committees to have final veto power, but the school board wants the principal to retain that authority.
In another disagreement, the school board wants salaries to be based on merit, but teachers want salaries based on seniority, as is the current custom. Also in dispute are school transfers: The board wants school committees to decide on teacher transfers, but teachers want those decisions based on seniority.
Teachers also want criteria for performance reviews written into the contract, a point opposed by the school board, which wants greater flexibility in managing teachers.
"It has been a real chore and not a very pleasant one," said Ms. Dennis, the superintendent. So quarrelsome have the negotiations been that they have overshadowed the arguments over a salary package. Rae Garrett, president of the Denver Classroom Teachers Union, added, "We're ready to be through with this."
In personally tackling the Denver impasse, the Governor has chosen a tougher route, bypassing the usual path of addressing public school improvements through state legislation, as Arkansas, Mississippi and Kentucky have done in recent years.
"This is not the easiest way," he said. "It may not even be the most desirable way, but I did it because I saw a school district in crisis."
The Governor, who has held nine days of public hearings and who is getting help from state labor officials in writing the new contract, has not indicated which way he is leaning on the major issues. Whatever he produces will have to be approved by the school board and the union.
"To be frank, they're both going to be irritated at me when I'm done," said Governor Romer.
 
Bid to Recall School Board
 Whatever the outcome, Denver residents are already irritated at the state of the school system. Some parents began a petition drive last November to recall the board, but succeeded in collecting only 11,000 of the 15,000 signatures needed for a recall election.
Other residents have dispatched angry letters to the city's two daily newspapers, taking school administrators, teachers and the Governor to task for the messy state of Denver school affairs.
Undaunted, Governor Romer is expected to present his contract to both sides and the public by month's end, with analysts already giving it a good chance of succeeding -- not because administrators or teachers will be happy, but because it will be unpopular for either side to reject it, given their months of negotiations with no progress.
"We're both going to get a lot of pressure from influential people in town to accept it," Ms. Garrett, the union president, said of the teachers and the school board.

HEADLINE: Mother of Ill Child Wins Jobless Pay

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that a woman who lost her job last year because she had frequently stayed home to care for her sick baby was entitled to unemployment benefits.
The 32-year-old woman, Diane McCourtney, was dismissed from her job as an account clerk at Seagate Technology, a computer company in Minnetonka, Minn., because she missed work almost half the time from January to May 1990 as her infant son had a series of illnesses, including pneumonia, influenza and pinkeye. 
 Ms. McCourtney did not question the dismissal but went to court to challenge the state's denial of unemployment benefits, contending that she had been unable to find alternative child care for her son when he was ill and should not be penalized for a situation that had been beyond her control.
She said that her husand had been unable to care for the boy and that all their nearby relatives worked. In addition, she said, most local day care providers did not accept sick infants, and the cost of a nurse or a baby sitter who would have come to theMcCourtneys' home on an emergency basis far exceeded their means.
Seagate and the State Commissioner of Jobs and Training said she was not eligible for unemployment benefits because she had chosen to stay home with her son and had voluntarily put family interests ahead of her employer's interest. That amounted to misconduct, they said, and made Ms. McCourtney ineligible for unemployment benfitis, which are available only to those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.
But yesterday, in overturning the denial of benefits, the appeals court ruled in a 2-to-1 decision that Ms. McCourtney's absenteeism did not amount to misconduct under the law.
"Each of McCourtney's absences was excused and was due to circumstances beyond her control," the court said. "McCourtney made substantial efforts to find care for her child so she could work."
In light of those efforts, the court said, her inability to find care for her child was not misconduct. "McCourtney's actions were motivated by a willful regard for her child's interests and not a wanton disregard of her employer's interest or lack of concern for her job," the court said.
The court noted that Ms. McCourtney had been an excellent employee for more than 10 years and had had no attendance problem until she returned to work 10 weeks after her son was born in September 1989.
The majority opinion was written by Judge Thomas Kalitowski, who was joined by Judge Marianne Short. The dissenter was Peter Popovich, a retired Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, who said, "Under the majority's analysis, an employer becomes the victim of an employee's personal problems with obtaining child care."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Note and Bond Selloff Lifts Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Pessimism returned to the credit markets yesterday, as a rise in the price of oil and other commodities and worries about coming economic indicators prompted traders to sell Treasury notes and bonds, pushing up interest rates.
After falling on Monday, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of spot prices for 21 leading commodities rose by nearly a point yesterday. 
 Included in that increase was a rise in oil prices, which moved higher after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced it had agreed to cut output in the second quarter by about a million barrels from current levels, to 22.3 million barrels a day. Oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 69 cents, to $19.68 a barrel.
In the past, OPEC agreements have often proven easier to arrive at than to enforce. Some analysts suggested yesterday that the most recent agreement might fall into that category.
"We find the OPEC agreement highly suspect, and suggest the market reaction to it has been overdone," analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company, said in their daily market commentary.
 
Sellers Act on Rumors
 In addition, sellers acted on rumors that a report expected today on vehicle sales during the first 10 days of March would show surprising strength.
"Car sales are seen by the market as the first piece of information in the postwar period about whether the economy will improve," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets.
Mr. McCarthy said vehicle sales of 7 million or more at an annual rate "would not be viewed in a favorable light" by credit market participants. Lately vehicle sales have been running at an annual rate of around 6 million units.
In addition, traders said the weekly money supply numbers, expected from the Federal Reserve Board tomorrow, are also expected to be fairly strong.
"The numbers have the potential to be disappointing," one government bond trader said. "But basically the story is that the market has run out of things to look forward to, and will find reasons to move lower. A lot of customers have placed their bets, and we aren't seeing any new buyers."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the bulk of the selling was in longer-term maturities.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 95 23/32, down 1/2 point, to yield 8.26 percent. Late Monday, the issue was offered at a price to yield 8.21 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 23/ 32, down 9/32, to yield 8.08 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 15/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.04 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged.
 
Three- and Six-Month Bills
 Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 5.84 percent, unchanged from Monday. Six-month bill rates were also unchanged at a late offered rate of 5.88 percent.
Attention in the investment-grade corporate bond market was mostly focused on a total of $1.3 billion worth of asset-backed securities offered by units of the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation. But a number of other issues were also priced.
Among them was a $200 million offering of 30-year debentures by Borden Inc.
The 9.20 percent securities, which mature March 15, 2021, were priced at $99.694, to yield 9.23 percent, 97 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The First Bostoni Corporation acted as lead manager for the transaction.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the State of Connecticut held a negotiated offering of $200 million worth of general obligation bonds.
The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2011. Yields range from 4.10 percent in 1992 to a maximum of 6.90 percent in 2011.
Dillon, Read & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction. The securities are rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, traders said prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Friendlier Skies?

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Airline passengers have not had much good news lately, so they have reason to welcome -- for now, at least -- a British-American agreement that will keep Pan American and Trans World Airlines in business a while longer.
The trend has been the other way, exemplified by the recent demise of Eastern Airlines, a pioneer in air travel. Since deregulation began, and partly for that reason, the number of carriers and the number of cities served -- except by smaller commuter planes -- both have decreased. 
You don't have to be an economist or a genius to know what a trend like that ultimately will mean to travelers. Fewer airlines, less competition, curtailed service, higher fares -- that's the American Way.
The complicated British-American arrangement means, however, that Pan Am and T.W.A. will get immediate cash infusions. Both have been suffering big losses; Pan Am was on the verge of shutting down and T.W.A. was in little better shape.
Now they will be allowed to sell their valuable trans-Atlantic routes into London to United Airlines and American Airlines, two of the strongest American carriers. That became possible when the British, in return for various U.S. concessions, granted United and American landing rights at Heathrow, the primary London airport.
Pan Am will get $290 million from United, a substantial part of which will go immediately in lease payments on its aircraft, which were in danger of being grounded by creditors. T.W.A. is to receive $440 million from American, which will help make up for substantial recent operating losses.
These transactions, of course, do not guarantee the survival of either carrier. The sale of assets -- particularly assets as valuable as the right to fly the Atlantic and land at Heathrow -- is not necessarily the best way for a company to save itself. That these weathered veterans of years of airline competition finally were forced to such expedients -- they seem to have had no attractive alternative -- is not encouraging. Pan Am, in fact, was founded and flourished for decades as an international airline, which makes its withdrawal from Atlantic service particularly ironic.
Nevertheless, the reprieve is welcome, particularly since the British-American agreement does not mean that fewer American carriers will be flying to London. United and American will simply replace Pan Am and T.W.A. -- a substitution that angered British Airways officials, since it means two stronger carriers competing on their primary routes.
For trans-Atlantic passengers, in fact, more competition -- that is, more flights -- lies ahead. The deal allows Virgin Atlantic, another British carrier, to begin flights out of Heathrow to the United States. British Airways, moreover, won the eventual rights to schedule more flights from the U.S. to Britain and continental destinations, to receive better representation on U.S. carriers' computerized reservation systems, and to continue London-U.S. flights on to Latin America, Canada and Asia. After this year, United and American, too, will be allowed to schedule more flights into Heathrow.
Most U.S. travelers, however, never fly to London or elsewhere in Europe. Their major concerns are frequency of flights within the U.S., fares for those flights, and communities served. Apart from the immediate rescue of Pan Am and the needed aid to T.W.A., in the long term the British-American agreement may not be all that good for these concerns. It probably means the strengthening of United and American, which already are relatively strong, but not necessarily the survival of Pan Am or T.W.A.Thus, the deal has not removed but may someday add to pressures resulting in less domestic competition.
As a regular airline passenger, I already have felt the effects of the curtailed availability of flights (presumably caused by Eastern's going out of business) from Raleigh-Durham and Florida to New York. And I recently had to fly a commuter airline into and out of Springfield, the capital of Illinois, a city that once had jet service and still deserves it.
Two or three giant carriers dividing the U.S. market may make for healthy airline profit sheets. But if such a quasi-monopoly comes about, which seems more likely all the time, there's no reason to believe that most air travelers will be able to fly to more places at lower fares in greater comfort or safety. Quite the opposite.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Benefits From War

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
As a result of the war in the Persian Gulf and its aftermath, the United States is likely to borrow far less from abroad this year than last. Many forecasters expect the deficit in the current account -- the broadest gauge of the nation's imports and exports of goods and services -- to shrink sharply in 1991.
"We'll see a remarkable improvement," said David Rolley, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm.
According to a report released by the Department of Commerce yesterday, the United States' current account deficit amounted to $99.3 billion in 1990, down from $110 billion in 1989. The $99.3 billion figure is the smallest gap since 1984. 
 Here is how the gulf war could narrow the gap even more: For starters, the invasion of Kuwait helped touch off the recession, cooling the nation's appetite for imports. Then, the allied victory caused crude prices to plunge, slashing the bill for imported oil.
 
$51 Billion for the War Kitty
 In addition, America's allies are contributing about $51 billion to the United States' war kitty, money that otherwise would have had to have been borrowed from private investors overseas.
Finally, postwar rebuilding in the Middle East will increase business for American construction companies and equipment producers. United States arms makers are also expected to benefit as countries restock their arsenals.
In fact, if the allies anted up the bulk of their share of war costs right away, analysts said, the United States could become a net foreign lender, at least for a month or two, for the first time in a decade.
Borrowing less abroad, even temporarily, helps the United States because a smaller current account deficit relieves downward pressure on the dollar and upward pressure on interest rates. That could be important at a time when United States assets are losing some of their allure because investors can now harvest higher returns in, say, Europe.
"Any reduction in the current account deficit is positive in a financial context," says Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "It will help to limit the buildup of U.S. assets in foreign hands and therefore helps stabilize the dollar and interest rates."
The dollar's recent recovery, for example, has handed the Federal Reserve Board more leeway to fight the recession by reducing the threat of inflation. "The current account collapse gives the Federal Reserve a lot more wiggle room," said Robert Gay, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
The effects of the war on the nation's foreign borrowing are certainly not permanent, and DRI and other forecasters expect the current account to swell again in a year or two.
The nation's current account gap has been narrowing since 1987 when it peaked at $162 billion or 2.6 percent of the gross national product -- the nation's total output of goods and services. The report released yesterday by the Department of Commerce shows a steady pattern of improvement through 1990, in large part, because United States exports of goods and services have been rising while imports continue to slow. And, even before Saddam Hussein's tanks rolled into Kuwait, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris was predicting major gains that are supposed to bring the current account gap below 1 percent of G.N.P. by the end of 1992.
Mr. Giordano of Goldman, Sachs said even a temporary reduction in United States borrowing would buy time for more permanent trends to have an impact. For example, the dollar's slide last year should give United States exports a lift in 1993.
By the same token, the dent made by last fall's budget-cutting deal on the Federal deficit will show through a few years from now. "With fewer demands on resources by the U.S. Government, the United States wouldn't have to import as many resources from abroad," said William Cline, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.
 
Compelling Arithmetic
 While long-term trends are highly uncertain, the arithmetic for this year seems compelling. Total allied pledges amount to more than $51 billion, just $4.3 billion of which had arrived by the end of the year. Federal officials seem reasonably confident, at this point, that the payments will in fact be made.
According to yesterday's Commerce Department report, last fall's allied contributions were more than offset by $7.1 billion in American asssistance to Egypt and Israel.
"What matters is that six or seven months ago, everyone thought the war was purely a U.S. burden," said Maria Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants. "U.S. rates went up, the dollar was sliding and the stock market fell apart. Now it's the other way around."
Lower prices and smaller volumes could trim the 1991 oil import bill. In the last two years, by contrast, more expensive oil increased the current account deficit by $10 billion a year. "The moderation in oil prices is likely to last," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs. "The U.S. is in effect the 14th member of OPEC now."

HEADLINE: The Battles to Come;
A Revival of The News Will Prompt Fierce Fighting for Readers and Ads

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The likely salvation of The Daily News by Robert Maxwell will raise the curtain on a fierce newspaper war as the paper tries to win back its lost circulation and advertising.
"It's how much comes back how soon," said John S. Reidy, a newspaper investment analyst for Smith Barney, who estimated that it would be clear in about four months whether The News can make a successful comeback. 
 Newspaper analysts and executives at New York City's papers generally agree that the survival of The News will be damaging to The New York Post and New York Newsday and good news for The New York Times.
Neither The Times, Newsday nor The Post would discuss specific plans for waging a fight for circulation and advertising in the coming months. But a number of news executives gave their analysis of the situation on the condition of anonymity.
A regenerated, leaner News could threaten the very existence of The Post, whose owner almost closed the paper last fall because of its chronic losses. During the News strike, which began on Oct. 25, The Post enjoyed new profitability because of increased circulation and advertising.
The news executives and analysts say survival of The News is also a blow to New York Newsday and its larger sister paper, Newsday on Long Island, which have been particularly successful in capturing the advertising that had appeared in the Sunday edition of The News. The Post has no Sunday paper.
Had The Daily News been closed, Newsday was poised to scoop up much of its remaining circulation, which would have made it even more attractive to advertisers.
And with The News gone, the logical target for New York Newsday would have been the largely affluent readership and upscale advertisers of The New York Times. But now, instead of attacking The New York Times, New York Newsday will be forced to fight a defensive battle with The News.
 
Newsday's Emergence
 John Morton, a newspaper analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, said the survival of The News would delay New York Newsday's emergence as the city's second most powerful newspaper, next to The New York Times. "But I don't think it will stop it," Mr. Morton said.
Indeed, business executives at The Times who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that the main reason The News's survival would help The Times was that it would give The Times breathing room to prepare for a probable battle with Newsday.
For The News, the key to long-term survival will be to win back readers, who in turn would make The News attractive once again to advertisers.
A month before the strike, The News reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which tracks readership, that its average weekday circulation in the New York area during the six months ending Sept. 30 was 1,047,000.
For the same period, in the New York area, The Post reported circulation of 460,000 and The Times reported 719,000. Total circulation for The Times was considerably higher because of its distribution beyond New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
A spokesman for Newsday said Long Island Newsday's pre-strike circulation was 492,000 and New York Newsday's was 222,000.
During the strike, The News's circulation dropped sharply. The paper claims to be selling 600,000 copies a day, but analysts say the actual number may be considerably lower.
A spokesman at Newsday said that Long Island Newsday's weekday circulation grew by 33,000 and that New York Newsday's weekday sales were up 118,000 since the strike began. Peter Kalikow, owner of The Post, said his paper's circulation was up about 190,000 in the city, and a spokesman at The New York Times said the paper's daily circulation in the city and suburbs was 56,000 more than the average reported in September.
 
Big Sunday Jump
 But the biggest swing in circulation -- and in advertising -- has been in the Sunday papers, which typically have the largest circulation of the week and may have almost as much advertising as the rest of the week combined.
A Newsday spokesman said that on Sunday, March 3, New York Newsday's circulation was 435,000, compared with 151,000 before the strike. Long Island Newsday was up by about 23,000, to 586,000. The total for the two Newdays was over one million.
A spokesman for The Times said Sunday sales in the New York area at the end of February were about 1.1 million, which meant that the two Newsdays were within striking distance of overtaking The Times had The News ceased publication.
At a time of economic doldrums in the city, when advertising is scarce, New York Newsday has used its Sunday surge to attract advertising that had been in The News. For the fourth quarter of 1990, Long Island Newsday and New York Newsday together increased advertising, measured in inches of space, by 86 percent compared with the same quarter in 1989, according to Media Records, an organization that measures advertising.
For the same period, The Post was up by 55 percent. But because The Post has no Sunday paper, the Newsdays had six times the total advertising of The Post in the fourth quarter.
 
Now Comes the Test
 The quantity of advertising in The New York Times increased by 20 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, but the total was still 16 percent short of the total amount of advertising in the two Newsdays.
The test now becomes whether New York Newsday and The Post can retain their gains, and especially how the reappearance of The News on city newsstands on Sunday will affect Newsday's Sunday behemoth. "That's the bread and butter, and that's going to be a big part of the battlefield," said Mr. Reidy, the newspaper analyst.
A spokesman for Newsday and New York Newsday said that their plan of slow, steady growth would not change, regardless of The News's fate.
Mr. Kalikow, the owner of The Post, said that if The News survived, he expected The Post's circulation to drop. But he said the paper could still make a profit as long as The News's circulation did not dwarf it, as it did before the strike.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the impact of The Daily News settlement on New York City's three other major daily newspapers misstated the change in advertising lineage from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. Lineage in The New York Times declined 19 percent in that period, and it declined 8 percent in The New York Post. Lineage in Newsday rose 4 percent.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: DIPLOMACY;
Baker Sees Israeli and Palestinians But Fails to Narrow Differences

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 12

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d concluded talks today with Israeli and Palestinian leaders without either side indicating fundamental change in long-held positions.
Mr. Baker appealed to Palestinian leaders from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip to discard the Palestine Liberation Organization and negotiate directly with the Israelis. 
 At the same time, Mr. Baker appealed to Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, to consider taking steps to open the way for negotiations with the Arab countries and with the Palestinians.
This range of options, Israeli and American officials said, included a halt to Israeli settlement-building in the territories, stopping the deportation of Palestinian militants, ending arrests of Palestinians without trial and, most important, declaring that Israel would not rule out an exchange of land for peace with the Arabs someday.
 
Adamant on P.L.O. Status
 The Palestinian leaders told Mr. Baker that the P.L.O. was their sole representative and that they had no intention of replacing it. And while Mr. Shamir did not reject Mr. Baker's overture, other senior Israeli officials indicated privately and publicly that the idea that this Israeli Government would even suggest trading land for peace one day was out of the question.
[As Mr. Baker pressed his effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, King Hussein of Jordan said his nation would never agree to be a substitute for the P.L.O. in talks with Israel. But he said that if the Palestinian leadership asked Jordan to join such talks, he would be willing to under certain conditions. Page A12.]
The sense conveyed by the Israeli and Palestinian responses to Mr. Baker's remarks was that, at least for now, the gulf war had not brought much new thinking .
In fact, if anything, the war appears to have provided more of a timeout in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict than a catalyst for its solution. More Israeli civilians and soldiers have been stabbed to death by Palestinians in the two weeks since the gulf war ended and Israeli lifted its curfew in the West Bank and Gaza than were killed in six weeks of Iraqi Scud missile attacks.
Yet both sides seem more interested in being positive with Mr. Baker -- to avoid blame for what they regard as the inevitable failure of this new round of American diplomacy, rather than sincerely considering bold new steps.
American officials traveling with the Secretary of State insist, though, that it is early in the postwar diplomatic process. Further, they say, while no breakthroughs are near, both Israelis and Palestinians are encouraging Mr. Baker to keep working because they recognize that the status quo is becoming increasingly intolerable.
Mr. Baker began his second day in Israel by meeting alone with Mr. Shamir for an hour and 20 minutes. A senior Administration official said Mr. Baker laid out his plans for seeking peace, in which he would try to promote Palestinian-Israeli negotiation simultaneously with peacemaking between Israel and the Arab nations.
Mr. Baker asked Mr. Shamir to "consider a range of different steps" that Israel might take in order to get diplomacy started, and he outlined what he had heard from Arab nations last weekend.
The steps Mr. Baker mentioned, the the senior official said, included reiterating that Israel was committed to an interpretation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 that would not rule out exchanging land for peace.
This last point is crucial for the Americans because only if Israel accepts this principle might Arab nations be willing to make positive gestures -- like ending their state of belligerency with Israel and abandoning an economic boycott. Also, only after such an Israeli commitment might Palestinians be prepared to accept self-rule in the West Bank, under continuing Israeli occupation, as a transitional phase before a final settlement.
Resolution 242 calls on Israel to return territories occupied in the 1967 war in exchange for recognition from the Arab nations and secure borders. Mr. Shamir has consistently argued that the resolution does not mention "all the territories" and that since Israel has already returned the Sinai to Egypt, it has fulfilled the land-for-peace requirements of the resolution.
Yossi Ben Aharon, director general of Mr. Shamir's office, told Israel radio today that the Government would not make such a commitment at the start of negotiations begin without conditions.
"To focus only the U.N. resolutions can lead only to failure," Mr. Ben Aharon said. "It is natural we all must be ready for negotiations without preconditions, and then we will confront the territorial issue."
American officials said Mr. Shamir promised to consider Mr. Baker's suggestions and to come back with some of his own. The Israeli Prime Minister did not rule anything in or out, and Mr. Baker did not ask for any definitive answers now, the American official said.
A few hours after meeting with Mr. Shamir, Mr. Baker went to the residence of the American Consul General in Jerusalem, Philip Wilcox, and held talks with 10 leading Palestinian figures from the West Bank and Gaza. He laid out his approach and asked them to consider what steps they could take to get some peace talks started.
One prominent point Mr. Baker made, said Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian professor, was to try "to convince the Palestinians that we should move on our own, without the P.L.O., but we told him that is not on."
Mr. Baker, the Palestinian said, tried to argue that they had a great deal at stake now and should not squander the opportunity by continuing to rely on the P.L.O. leadership, which supported President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Mr. Baker said that all eight Arab foreign ministers he spoke with in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, over the weekend told him that they were "sick" of Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, an American official said.
The Palestinians asked Mr. Baker what Mr. Arafat would have to do to persuade Washington to resume its dialogue with the P.L.O., which was broken off in June 1990 when Mr. Arafat refused to condemn a terrorist attack by a P.L.O. faction. The official said Mr. Baker responded that in light of Mr. Arafat's support for Iraq in the gulf war, he was not quite sure now what, if anything, would be sufficient, but that he would think about it.
 It was understood before today's meeting by both sides that no official member of the P.L.O. could attend; otherwise, the Americans would have canceled. Both Palestinians and Americans described the talks today as an animated give-and-take, with the Americans offering to keep the channel open for future contacts.
Faisal al-Husseini, a prominent Palestinian, said after the talks that the Americans "are determined to do something, to go forward, to push."
Before leaving, Mr. Husseini presented Mr. Baker with an 11-point document, apparently cleared by the P.L.O., stating the Palestinians' bottom line. It called for a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state existing "next to the state of Israel," and at another point declared that any peace process must be "structured within a comprehensive, interconnected and coherent plan with a specified time frame for implementation and leading to Palestinian statehood."
In between diplomacy, Mr. Baker took time out for two important side trips. He went to the cemetery where the four Israeli women killed by a Palestinian on Sunday were buried.
In an earlier trip today, Mr. Baker took a helicopter tour to allow the Israelis to show him how narrow the country was within its pre-1967 boundaries -- 10 miles wide and five minutes by helicopter. He also got to see the Golan Heights from the air, as well as Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

HEADLINE: Rushing From Yacht to Jet, Maxwell Relishes New Role

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
His first, jaunty words as he stepped off his yacht into a waiting Cadillac to complete negotiations with the unions at The Daily News were "I love New York," but the bold lettering on his white baseball cap spoke of another favorite cause: "Maxwell."
Yesterday, Robert Maxwell was able to serve both. His flamboyant last-minute effort to rescue New York City's largest tabloid newspaper did not merely provide the British publisher with yet another newspaper. Mr. Maxwell has also acquired a heady celebrity status in New York that had mostly eluded him in previous visits. And that pleased him. 
 "Somehow this has captured the imagination of the city," said the 67-year-old Mr. Maxwell as he sipped iced tea on his private jet on his way to Massachusetts after a crowded news conference announcing the conclusion of the negotiations. He confided gleefully that an associate had assured him that "even a president or prime minister wouldn't get that big an audience."
Until recently, Mr. Maxwell had remained virtually unknown to the man on the street in New York. But yesterday he began making the city his own in a swirl of activity that took him from his yacht to the news conference at the Macmillan building and then a helicopter to his private jet.
"I am notorious in many parts of the world," he said in his booming English baritone, "but in New York I could always go out for coffee and not be recognized."
 
Private Satisfaction
 Formally, but with a broad smile of private satisfaction, he added, "I recognize that luxury will be gone at the end of this week."
Mr. Maxwell, the self-made British press lord and a socialist leader of a far-flung corporate empire, clearly relished the prospect of owning The Daily News. If he had any last-minute doubts that the deal would collapse, he kept them well hidden. Instead he brought a dash of British pomp and even a twist of Broadway showmanship to the 11th-hour proceedings.
Striding shortly before 10 A.M. into the lobby of the Macmillan building, where the negotiations were held, Mr. Maxwell beamed at waiting reporters and instructed his butler to fetch a giant bouquet of pink roses that had been sent to him by an anonymous, and admiring, Daily News editor out on strike. He read aloud all 12 stanzas from the accompanying poem, including this:
 
We promise you ends,
Just cough up the means.
You've got Princess Di,
But we'll give you Queens.
Sounding very much the publisher, albeit prematurely, Mr Maxwell said of the author, "Clearly, we will make her poetry editor."
Earlier in the morning, refreshed and buoyant after only a few hours' sleep, Mr. Maxwell chuckled over some of the semantic problems that at times had stalled communication between the Englishman and his American interlocutors. "Holidays, vacations," he said with amusement. "I was surprised at how often we were misunderstood, but we sorted it all out."
Almost all of it. Mr. Maxwell, who grew up in Czechoslovakia and who fought with the Free French in World War II, is fluent in six languages, but he is still learning American lore, as evidenced by a fractured reference to Yogi Berra. At one tense juncture in the negotiations, he informed impatient reporters, "As Yogi Bear once said, a thing is not done until it is done."
Mr. Maxwell said he was "terribly sorry" for all the employees at The News who would lose their jobs as a condition of the sale, calling the prospect a "terrible tragedy."
 
'Tough as Boots'
 But he was full of good cheer about his complex dealings with officials of the nine striking unions, some of whom he described as "Runyonesque -- straight out of 'West Side Story.' " He added: "They have a great sense of humor -- I had not realized how the Irish dominate the crafts here. I hold them in high regard. They have good spirits and are as tough as boots."
Though Mr. Maxwell became a prominent figure in Manhattan media circles after he bought the New York-based Macmillan publishing company in 1988, his was not a household name.
Perhaps to correct that imbalance, his entry in Who's Who doubled in length the year after Mr. Maxwell acquired the company that publishes it, Marquis. (The accomplishments of Rupert Murdoch, a rival international press entrepreneur who once stormed the city and bought The New York Post, are mentioned in Who's Who at a far more economical length.)
Mr. Maxwell said he expected to live in New York for the first six months of the newspaper's revitalization.
Yesterday he did not immediately retreat to his yacht on the East River for a public party or a private celebratory moment. Instead he flew to Bedford, Mass., for a meeting to discuss giving money to Harvard for AIDS research.
He planned to end the night in the city where he started the day.
"I never celebrate," he said. "This is a sobering additional responsibility to take on 1,800 people's jobs and the survival of a monument."
Asked if he would add one staple of British tabloids, the seminude models known as Page 3 girls, he replied, "Certainly not."

HEADLINE: DE GUSTIBUS;
A Baker Who Builds And Rebuilds Bakeries

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
WHEN Alou Niangadou left West Africa for Paris in 1979, clutching degrees in mathematics and physics, it was not to start a career in baking. He left, he said, "seeking a better life" than he had in Mali. An apprenticeship at a bakery was the first job he could find, and he loved it. He has never looked back.
 Eager to improve his lot once again, Mr. Niangadou made his way to the United States in 1982, bringing with him all the secrets of the Alsatian bakery in Paris where he worked. By 1986 he had met Eli Zabar and gone to work at E.A.T., the Upper East Side emporium of fancy foods. 
 In his three years there, he enlarged the shop's bread repertory of plain and onion ficelles, the loaves that look like broom handles, and he added raisin-nut bread (which became wildly popular) and health breads as well as a country white and country rye that he brought with him from France. The country bread, he said, is similar to the sourdough bread of the French baker Lionel Poilane that has been shipped to the United States from Paris for 10 years. Not a few Americans willingly paid at least $25 a loaf.
Imagine spending $25 for a loaf of two- or three-day-old bread! In those days it was thought that even New York, with all its wonderful bakeries, could not compete with Paris. New Yorkers know better now.
By the time Mr. Niangadou left E.A.T. in 1989, he had helped to increase its bread business more than tenfold. He is now plying his trade at Burke & Burke, a fancy-food deli owned by Joseph Burke, an Irish immigrant who came to New York with a high-school diploma and a knack for making money.
 Mr. Niangadou hitched his rising star (pun intended) to the company, which seems to be defying the recession.The first Burke & Burke opened in 1982; now there are 16 branches in Manhattan and another is to open on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills next month.
Mr. Burke, who had been buying bread from other suppliers, said he hired Mr. Niangadou because he wanted to "trade up." Mr. Niangadou now oversees a crew of seven people, speaking French to one, Spanish to another, his native Bambara to a third and English to an a Polish assistant and to the manager of the bakery on West 13th Street. Three of his assistant bakers came with him from E.A.T.
 Mr. Niangadou also brought his recipes. All the specialty breads he bakes begin with a sourdough starter. Some use no yeast; in winter, others require a small amount.
The 34-year-old baker gets excited when he talks about his two-year-old sourdough starter, or "mother," as bakers call the mixture of flour, water and yeast. One of the first things Mr. Niangadou did before opening the Burke & Burke bakery was to create his own starter. Like the best red wines, the older the starter, the better, which is why he says he is "dying to go to San Francisco," to sample a starter there. "There's no sourdough on earth that is older," he said. He may be right. One San Francisco bakery has a sourdough starter that is at least 75 years old.
 It is the starter that gives the distinctive taste to the best sourdough breads. It is not a taste universally admired. When E.A.T.'s raisin-nut bread was compared with the Burke & Burke raisin-nut bread, the tasters were divided: some preferred the former with wall-to-wall raisins and almost no sour taste; some chose the latter, with fewer raisins and the strong singular sourdough flavor.
Baking with sourdough is a long process that requires patience. Sourdough starters are notoriously temperamental, affected by the wind and rain and snow and sleet. "It's very hard work," Mr. Niangadou said. "You need more than your head to come up with very good bread."
He distinguishes between commercial breads, which turn from flour into loaves in two hours, and sourdoughs, which take eight. "Anyone can make commercial breads," he said. "The breads I'm making, you have to feel it. Without feeling, you can't make them."
 Mr. Niangadou's favorite part of the baking process is the end: the atonal crackling of two dozen loaves of bread just out of the oven. "It's the sound I like best," he said.
 In an informal tasting, the breads Mr. Niangadou is baking at Burke & Burke did as well as or better than the breads he left behind at E.A.T., with more character and more interesting textures and flavors. They are also handsome, particularly the country breads, whose decoratively cut crusts evoke African motifs.
 "The quality of my breads will continue to get better because the older the mother grows, the better the bread," he said. "I'm not afraid of great volume. It's easy compared to developing the sourdough."
 Watching him rest his huge heat-proof fingers on the heated stone of an oven, precisely dividing and shaping the dough, making the slashes on the tops of the baguettes with a razor -- it seems as though he has been baking all his life.
That doesn't mean he is fond of bread. He can barely stand the stuff.
"I've been in the business 10 or 11 years now," he said. "I've seen too much bread, working with it every day, every day. But it makes me feel proud that everyone likes my bread, even if I don't eat it. "
He does take it home to his wife, Rakia, and daughter, Fanta, who will be 3 in June. "Both of them like the bread better than I do."
A few years in America and Mr. Niangadou has latched on to the local dream: a place of his own. When? "As soon as possible," he said. "Somewhere in the U.S." Certainly within five years. "In five years," he said, "my breads will be much much better than they are now, because the mother will be better."

HEADLINE: Ex-Gov. LeRoy Collins Dies at 82; Floridian Led Way in 'New South'

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
LeRoy Collins, who was Governor of Florida from 1955 to 1961 and an early "New South" politician who sought to promote racial justice in the region, died in his sleep at his home in Tallahassee yesterday, two days after his 82d birthday.
Mr. Collins had surgery for colon cancer in 1986 and three years later was found to be suffering from lung cancer. He had been undergoing chemotherapy since then. 
 A lawyer and member of the Florida Legislature for two decades, beginning in 1934, Mr. Collins emerged from a conservative "Old South" background at a critical time to play a part in helping to transform the region politically, economically and socially.
 
Took Unpopular Stances
 At the height of the civil rights movement, Mr. Collins took widely unpopular positions, urging Floridians to accept integration of the state's public institutions and promoting equal treatment of blacks by commercial and other interests. "I realized that we had to change," he said later.
In 1965, he represented President Lyndon B. Johnson during the civil rights march by followers of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma, Ala., to the state capital.
During the years when Mr. Collins held public office and continuing through the 1960's, he was derided by opponents as "Liberal LeRoy" and he was defeated in a 1968 campaign for a seat in the United States Senate by a Republican, Ed Gurney. After the campaign, Mr. Collins decided he would not seek elective office again.
Aside from his activities in promoting racial harmony, he was known for the changes he helped bring about in education and health care in Florida and for his efforts to bring high-technology industries to the state.
Mr. Collins was born in Tallahassee, the son of the owner of a small general store. He later studied at the Eastman Business School in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and received a degree from the Cumberland Law School in Lebanon, Tenn.
In 1934, at the age of 25, he won his first election for political office, to represent Leon County in the Florida House. After three terms, he won election to the Florida Senate in 1940. He resigned during his second term in the Senate to serve in the Navy in World War II. After the war he was re-elected to the Senate, in 1946 and 1950.
 
Pushed Education Measures
 While in the Senate, he pushed educational measures, including a law that equalized financing among poor rural counties and wealthy urban ones.
In 1954 he ran for the unexpired two-year term of Gov. Dan McCarthy, who died while in office. Mr. Collins won a runoff, defeating Charley E. Johns, the Senate President and acting Governor.
Two years after he became Governor, Florida's public schools and higher education was racially segregated, and a Gallup Poll indicated that four of five white Floridians opposed the United States Supreme Court's 1954 school-desegregation ruling.
Although he had endorsed segregation in his 1954 and 1956 campaigns for Governor, Mr. Collins said his objectives were "to preserve order, obey the courts and keep the schools open."
 
Denounced Store Owners
 As the civil rights movement spread, with sit-ins at lunch-counters in several Florida cities, Mr. Collins went on radio and television in March 1960 to denounce white owners of stores who encouraged blacks to patronize parts of their establishments but denied service to them in others.
He later explained his views on race relations, saying that he had accepted segregation "because I considered that this was the way it was supposed to be," but that he later realized segregation had to end "because it denied fairness and equal opportunity and equal advantage for a large part of our population."
He is a former chairman of the Southern Governors' Conference and the National Governors' Conference, and he was chairman of the 1960 Democratic National Convention that nominated John F. Kennedy for President.
In early 1961, after leaving the Florida Statehouse, Mr. Collins moved to Washington, where he served as president of the National Association of Broadcasters until 1964.
He served as director of the Federal Community Relations Service in 1964 and 1965, after organizing the agency to try to keep the peace at the request of President Johnson after passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It was in that capacity that he represented the Johnson Administration in Alabama, helping to mediate between Dr. King's followers and the police.
Mr. Collins was Under Secretary of Commerce in 1965 and 1966. In 1970, he joined the Tallahassee law firm Evans, Varn, Jacobs & Odom.
He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Call Darby; a son, Thomas Jr. of Tampa; three daughters, Jane Aurell and Mary Proctor of Tallahassee and Darby Begeman of Miami, and several grandchildren.

HEADLINE: India Disbands Parliament; Vote in May Seen

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 13

 BODY:
The President of India dissolved Parliament today, a week after the resignation of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, paving the way for the country's 10th national election. It is expected to be held in May, on a date to be set by the Election Commission.
The vote will be a critical one for India's besieged democracy, and even more so for the Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which has tried to avoid an election by a variety of ploys since the fall of the V. P. Singh Government in November. Mr. Gandhi's political stock has never been lower. 
 On Tuesday, L. K. Advani, leader of the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition to the Shekhar Government, called the Congress Party a threat to democracy.
For four months, the Congress Party supported an administration with no electoral mandate and barely a 10th of the seats in the lower house of Parliament. But it soon became clear that Mr. Shekhar, a professed socialist, intended to act in an independent and pragmatic manner, accepting help from the International Monetary Fund -- unacceptable to many Indian nationalists -- and agreeing to allow American military transport planes to refuel in India during the Persian Gulf war. The refueling was an issue on which Mr. Gandhi, taking a line sympathetic to Iraq, had confronted Mr. Shekhar.
When Congress legislators made a major issue of the stationing of two state policemen from neighboring Haryana outside Mr. Gandhi's house in addition to the usual huge complement of national security officials, Mr. Shekhar quit in annoyance, calling Mr. Gandhi "childish."
Since its defeat in 1989 the Congress Party has suffered in-fighting and charges from state branches and leaders that too much power was in the hands of Mr. Gandhi and a few advisers without political experience.
Before adjourning this week, both houses of Parliament passed continuing resolutions allowing for the federal budget to operate for three months after the end of the fiscal year on March 31. Under electoral law, a new Parliament must assemble by June 5.
International investment ratings for India are plummeting, as the country's budget deficit and balance of payments widen and debt ratios increase.
Economists warn that the perception that the country is without a government -- and is not likely to elect another with any degree of stability whenever voting takes place -- will be very damaging to India among international lending organizations and companies in industrialized nations.

HEADLINE: Manhasset Journal;
Trafficking in Parking For a Fast-Track Crowd

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANHASSET, L.I., March 13

 BODY:
Every morning, like piranhas converging on a tasty ankle, thousands of out-of-town commuters descend on this little hamlet on the North Shore of Long Island, hunting for a place to park.
And every morning the illegal underground economy in this outwardly law-abiding community helps the commuters out. In Manhasset, $125 to $200 can get you a monthly parking place at a gas station, behind a hardware store or even in a driveway. 
 "That's how this place makes its money," said Murray Rousso, who was striding cheerily to the train station on a recent morning, having come from the next-door village of Rosyln to park his car several blocks away behind someone's house.
Manhasset's cottage industry began about 10 years ago, when local officials, annoyed that so many non-residents were taking the train to Manhattan from Manhasset, began to limit parking near the station.
The nonresidents, some from as far as Suffolk County, could go to their own stations on their own lines if they chose. But the trains on Manhasset's line, the Port Washington branch, are prized because they are electric instead of diesel and therefore faster and newer, and because they are almost the only trains on the Long Island Rail Road that do not have to stop at Jamaica.
This convenience of avoiding having to change trains at the Queens junction comes at a considerable price. To get the shorter train ride from Manhasset, many of these commuters must drive much farther, pay much more and walk quite a distance through whatever kind of weather is out there that day.
"Manhasset is quite a desirable place to commute from; it only takes about 28 minutes at rush hour," said Mary Jane Davies, zoning chairman of the Manhasset Council of Civic Associations. "We call these people the out-of-town parkers, and they will go to any limit to get a space."
Because their train line is so coveted, all the communities along the Port Washington branch have problems. In Port Washington itself there is commerce in stolen and counterfeit resident stickers, which permit parking at the station.
In Plandome, parking is so scarce that people have been known to join the Plandome Country Club, right next to the station, just so they can get a parking spot. That means paying a club initiation fee of $2,500 to $15,000 and annual dues of $2,500 to $5,000. Around the station, parking is so bad that village officials recently dusted off an old law against waiting there in a car.
"You're allowed to pick up and discharge there, but not stand and wait," said J. Tim Rice, the village clerk. "If the train that these people are waiting for is not the train that comes, the people in the parking lot can't get out of their spots."
But nowhere is the situation more miserable than in Manhasset, the train stop most convenient to Northern Boulevard, a busy east-west thoroughfare. More than 2,100 commuters, many from out of town, get on the train here each day, turning a sleepy village by night into a busy parking lot by day.
About 10 years ago, when the Manhasset Park District, which regulates parking for the 4,500 families within its borders, began to restrict parking on most nearby streets to 90 minutes, the laws of supply and demand kicked in. Residents began advertising parking space in driveways and even in backyards; commuters began going door to door.
"They call all the time," said a resident of a nearby street who rents four places in his driveway and who asked not to be identified because his little business is illegal. "I don't know how they get my number, but they find it somehow."
Steve Adamides, who owns a gas station several blocks from the station, said he takes in more than $1,000 a month renting parking spaces. "People are always looking for parking," he said. "They always come up and ask. But I only have room for 10 people."
Though renting out space for parking is against the law ("It would mean you were using residential property for business purposes, and you can't do that," Mrs. Davies said), village officials say they can't do much about it.
"If this was one or two cases, it wouldn't be a problem," Mrs. Davies said. "But we'll win a court case in a gas station and knock it out as a parking lot, and within six months it's back to being a parking lot." She has heard that churches rent out spots, too.
Even if the authorities could do something about the illegal parking trade, they're not sure they would want to.
"If we were to close all these lots down tomorrow, where would these people go?" asked Michael C. Adams, chairman of the Manhasset Park District. "They won't go away."
Though some Manhasset residents complain that they have lost their hamlet to the out-of-town parkers, Mr. Adams takes a more sanguine view. "We have no problems with outsiders," he said. "I only hope a few of them would stop and buy something at the local stores on the way out."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: United Nations;
Destruction of Iraqi Chemical Arms Urged in U.N.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 13

 BODY:
Britain is pressing the Security Council to demand that President Saddam Hussein destroy all his chemical and biological weapon stocks under international inspection and publicly renounce terrorism before a formal cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war is put into place, diplomats said today.
The British argument is that the council is now in a position to impose such further conditions on President Hussein as part of an obligation under previous resolutions to restore "international peace and security in the area." 
 The British and other diplomats said Britain believed that Iraq was likely to go along with such a demand because it had already shown itself eager to see the Council's economic sanctions lifted by agreeing in principle to other conditions for a cease-fire. Baghdad has agreed in principle, for example, to pay damages to Kuwait and return abducted people and property, even if though it might be slow to carry these out in practice.
So far, the United States and the other countries with forces in the gulf say they have not captured any Iraqi chemical or biological weapons, suggesting that the Iraqi Government has somehow managed to preserve its known stocks intact.
 
Weapons Believed to Be Hidden
 In the war, American military officials reported that Iraq's ability to produce such weapons had been destroyed in allied bombing. But they cautioned that munitions alreadly produced were probably not all destroyed, since the Iraqi Army was believed to have hidden them in many undetermined locations.
The Bush Administration has apparently come to the conclusion that Iraq still has ample stocks of chemical or biological weapons, since Washington has threatened to resume air strikes against Iraq if such weapons are used against rebel groups now trying to overthrow President Hussein.
Other members of the Security Council, however, want to refrain from imposing further conditions on Baghdad, moving instead to enact a formal end to hostilities and lift economic sanctions so Iraq can start earning some of the money it will need to compensate Kuwait for losses suffered during its occupation.
The Bush Administration is not expected to decide where it stands on the British proposal until Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. returns from the Middle East over the weekend.
 
Comment From Kuwaiti
 Today the Kuwaiti United Nations representative, Mohammad A. Abulhassan, who has just returned from Kuwait, told a news conference that Iraq was still showing no readiness to comply with the Security Council's existing terms for a cease-fire in practical ways, even though it claims it has accepted them in principle.
He said Iraq's National Assembly has still not specifically rescinded the law it passed formally annexing Kuwait and officially published that decision, although the Revolutionary Command Council, the country's supreme decision making body, invalidated all laws concerning Kuwait.
Iraq has also only promised to return unspecified " quantities " of gold and currency stolen from Kuwaiti banks and has said nothing about some $2 billion to $3 billion worth of stolen military equipment as well as art treasures and books looted from museums and libraries, he said.
Mr. Abulhassan stressed the point that Iraq had freed only about 1,200 of the estimated 33,000 Kuwaiti civilians he claims were abducted and has failed even to provide the names of the prisoners of war it is holding, while refusing to take back any of its own P.O.W.'s when the Red Cross tried to send them home.
 
Iraq's Liability Described
 "They don't want them back to tell the story of their defeat and join the rebels," he said.
Finally, Mr. Abulhassan said Iraq should show its readiness to pay compensation for damage caused in Kuwait by agreeing to accept the adjudication of the World Court or some other international tribunal and by creating a fund it would pay money into when sanctions are lifted and it can start selling oil again.
He said Iraq's total liability for such damage could reach $100 billion.
Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council authorized the largest emergency food shipment to war-torn Iraq today-20,000 tons of wheat flour sent by Yemen, which sided with Baghdad in the gulf crisis.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher On Report of Big Japan Deal

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher against leading foreign currencies yesterday as traders reacted to a large overseas purchase, the possibility of further interventions by central banks and uneven economic news.
Gold was higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.10 an ounce, to $366.90. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $366.60, up $2 from late Tuesday's bid. 
 The dollar drifted higher in New York after reports that a large Japanese foreign exchange house bought several billion dollars, driving up the value of the dollar in Tokyo.
But the currency's upward move was stemmed when the Bank of Japan stepped in to counteract the purchase by selling dollars, said Mike Casey, international economist for Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc. in New York.
Economic news later in the day helped push the dollar back down.
In testimony before Congress, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank would be willing to ease interest rates again if necessary to promote an economic recovery.
Lower interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive and thus decrease the value of the dollar.
The Fed, in its first national survey since the end of the Persian Gulf war, said it had found the economy still weak but with hints of a pickup in sectors like housing and car sales.
Traders also viewed with skepticism a report from the Commerce Department that retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in February, their first gain in four months.
"In absolute terms, while retail sales might have been up a little, they are still abysmal," said Lenny Dendunnen, the assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzlerand's New York office.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose by 0.50 yen, to a closing 136.55 yen. In London, it fell to 136.35 yen. In New York, the dollar slipped to 135.66 yen, from 135.84 yen late on Tuesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.8570, from $1.8585 late on Tuesday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.8615 by the end of the day, less than $1.8625 late on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.5730 German marks, up from 1.5703; 1.3645 Swiss francs, up from 1.3605; 5.3605 French francs, up from 5.3495; 1,173.75 Italian lire, up from 1,172.00, and 1.1538 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
In London, gold rose to a late bid of $366.75 an ounce, up from $364.75 late on Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal's closing bid was $366.30 an ounce, up from $364.75 late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 52 cents an ounce, closing at $366.09.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Funds Show Only Slight Change in Yields

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report showed mixed changes for the week ended yesterday for the second consecutive week.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's noted that the Fed's apparent lowering of the Federal funds rate late last week might be a harbinger of another round of interest rate cuts. Weaker-than-expected employment figures and yesterday's slightly stronger retail sales report for February sent mixed signals for lowering interest rates. 
 In response, the markets are now holding, with yields changing only slightly.
 
Starting Lower
 Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said there was a sense that the recession was bottoming but was not over yet. The only difference between the last week and the previous week, he said, is that rates are starting lower as a result of the easing by the Fed.
In tax-exempt money funds, the average number of days that securities were held in portfolios was up 3 days, to 51. Assets declined a modest $277 million, to a total of $91.5 billion.
The average seven-day compounded yield for the week was unchanged, at 4.14 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield fell 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.15 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt yield is 5.75 percent in the 28 percent tax bracket and 6.17 percent in the 33 percent bracket.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund produced the best return on investment with a yield of 5.22 percent. The fund is managed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management of Milwaukee.
Assets on taxable funds rose by $1.7 billion, for a record total of $458.3 billion. Almost the entire cash inflow was in consumer funds, as assets rose by $1.7 billion, to a total of $347.3 billion; institutional fund assets rose by $67 million, to a total of $111 billion. Of the cash flow that went to consumer funds, $418 million went toward Treasuries and $740 million toward Government agency securities.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 4 basis points, to 6.34 percent, and the 30-day yield fell 8 basis points, to 6.46 percent. The fund with the best return on investment this week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market, with a yield of 7.21 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds and are included in The Bank Rate Monitor's national index, showed an average rate of return that was down 3 basis points, to 5.59 percent.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Hints at Cut In Rates

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
As the Federal Reserve reported the first tentative signs that the recession might be easing, Alan Greenspan hinted that the reduced threat of inflation might make it possible for the central bank to give the economy an additional boost by cutting interest rates further.
But Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the Government's most influential economic policy maker, urged Congress not to try to stimulate the economy with lower taxes or increased spending. 
 Asked during testimony before the Joint Economic Committee whether room existed for the Federal Reserve to drive down interest rates more, Mr. Greenspan said, "I think there's certainly more now than there was a few months ago."
He went on to say, however, that he remained cautious about reducing short-term rates at a time when long-term bond rates have been rising slightly.
 
Markets Strengthen
 Some traders said Mr. Greenspan's comments encouraged the financial markets. The prices of Treasury securities rose, and the Dow Jones industrial average, representing blue-chip stocks, was up 32.68 points. [Pages D10 and D20.]
When a questioner asked at the hearing what Congress should do to try to shorten the recession, the Fed chairman replied, "I would be inclined at this stage essentially to stand pat."
Since last fall, the Fed has reduced the Federal funds rate, the interest rate banks pay each other for overnight loans, by two percentage points, to 6 percent from 8 percent. The most recent quarter-point reduction came last Friday, shortly after the Government released employment statistics showing that the nation was still feeling the full force of recession in February.
In theory, lower interest rates should lead to increased borrowing and spending and thus stimulate economic growth, but they tend to take six months or longer to work their way through the economy. If the economy is strong when the effects of the lower rates take hold, the result could be worse inflation.
The prevailing view on Wall Street is that the Fed will soon cut the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges for direct loans to banks. The discount rate is now at 6 percent, the same as the Federal funds rate. Mr. Greenspan prefers the discount rate to be lower than the Federal funds rate because that gives the central bank somewhat more control over the economy.
 
An Added Sentence
 The statement Mr. Greenspan read to the committee today was almost identical to one he presented to the House Ways and Means Committee last week. But he added this sentence to the second paragraph: "The economic data of the past few weeks also included further indications of reduced cost pressures on prices and provided scope for a further easing of monetary policy last Friday."
In financial circles, Mr. Greenspan's words are scrutinized with the kind of intensity that Talmudic scholars apply to the ancient Jewish laws. The additional sentence in the written testimony was interpreted by some analysts today to serve two purposes: to assure the markets, where some confusion existed about the Fed's intentions, that monetary policy had actually been relaxed last Friday and to suggest that the lessened risk of inflation could lead to further easing of interest rate policy.
But no one on the committee asked Mr. Greenspan about that sentence, so his reason for adding it could not be known for sure.
 
'Decline May Be Slowing'
 While the chairman was on Capitol Hill, the Fed released its periodic survey of economic conditions in the various regions of the country. "Economic activity remained soft in much of the nation, but there were indications that the decline may be slowing," the survey concluded.
The survey, called the "beige book," was taken to help the Fed prepare for its March 26 meeting, where monetary policy will be set for the spring. The evidence that the recession might be tapering off was anecdotal rather than statistical.
Among the positive signs were these: Retail inventories, except for automobile stocks, seemed to be at satisfactory levels. A slight improvement or an easing of the downward trend in manufacturing was noted in several regions. Realtors and home builders reported an increase in buyer interest and, in some areas, a rise in home purchases.
The information for the survey was collected before March 4 and was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Retail sales in most regions were still sluggish, according to the survey. But the Commerce Department reported today that retail sales nationwide increased by eight-tenths of a percent in February, the first gain in four months. The sales level was still half a percentage point below what it was in February 1990. And auto makers reported today that their sales in early March were down 14.7 percent.
Mr. Greenspan said his advice to Congress not to lower taxes or increase spending to stimulate the economy was grounded in his belief that the recession would end and the economy begin to rebound soon. If that appraisal proved to be wrong in the next few months, the Fed chairman said, additional fiscal stimulus might be wise.
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee, suggested that Congress might want to improve unemployment benefits or step up spending on public works projects to create jobs. Mr. Greenspan said such steps might be "counterproductive" because the economy could be "accelerating" by the time they went into effect.
Mr. Greenspan said he remained concerned about the reluctance of some banks to make loans to creditworthy customers and about the failure of the Fed's policies thus far to make much of a dent in the credit problem. "We're going to continue to push until we find the unraveling of the credit crunch evident," he said.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Begins Round Of Discounts to Encourage Travel

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier and the airline that is considered a leader in determining fares, initiated a broad range of price cuts yesterday in the hope of attracting travelers put off by the gulf war and the recession. But it also raised some fares in an attempt to compensate for revenue lost through the many reductions.
American introduced a number of short-term promotions like a $318 round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles or San Francisco, and the other four biggest airlines -- United, Delta, Northwest and Continental -- said they would match most of them. 
 But American went beyond these special offers, altering its pricing structure and hoping the industry will follow. The airline, which along with its competitors had spent two years trying to simplify the fare structure and eliminate many discount rates, is now seeking to reverse that trend. It has brought back the 30-day advanced-purchase fare, which until it was phased out two years ago had been the lowest fare available to travelers. It also added new discount fares aimed at the business traveler. And it is substantially cutting the price of some international tickets.
 
14-Day Fares to Rise
 But while American revived the 30-day discount fare, it will significantly raise its 14-day advance purchase fares, which have been particularly popular with leisure travelers. The carrier also announced that more of its lowest discount fares will now require travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday, the days when the most seats are available industrywide. The goal is to try to prevent discount passengers from taking away too many seats from higher-fare passengers. American also said it would limit the number of lowest-fare seats that it makes available.
To these changes, the other major carriers reacted cautiously, saying they needed to study them.
American will revive the 30-day advance-purchase fare on April 9, after its short-term promotions end. The 30-day fares will for the most part be somewhat lower than the best fares now available except for the short-term offers. For example, a round trip between New York and Los Angeles on weekdays will cost $468 if bought 30 days in advance and on weekends, $518.
The current 14-day rate on weekdays is $504 and on weekends, $554. But the 14-day fare between these cities will rise to $558 on weekdays, and to $608 on weekends.
Michael W. Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at American, said the 30-day advance-purchase fare would be the lowest discount fare in the market -- about 8 to 10 percent below the current 14-day fares and from $60 to $90 a round trip below the new, lower 14-day fares.
 
Low Prices Until April 8
 The savings on the short-term offer are more substantial. For example, the round-trip fare from New York to San Francisco, which was $504 on weekdays on a ticket bought at least 14 days before traveling, will fall to $318 for travel during the spring and to $398 for travel during the summer, as long as the ticket is bought by April 8. The new fare must be purchased seven days in advance, is not refundable and requires a Saturday-night stay.
American is also trying to respond to the growing resistance of business travelers to pay full coach fares, which have risen substantially in recent years.
For the short term, it matched Delta's offer of 20 percent off regular coach fare if the trip is booked three days in advance.
For tickets bought after April 9. American has proposed a seven-day advance purchase fare aimed at business travelers that would have a 25 percent cancellation penalty.
 
Discounts to Europe
 American is also offering lower fares to Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Travel from New York to various European destinations, for example, would be $598 round trip during the peak travel period after June 1, which is 29 to 32 percent lower than the current Eurosaver fare, the main discount fare in the market.
Some analysts would not characterize American's moves as the beginning of a fare war, because they were not aimed at gaining share in a particular market or against another carrier. Instead, they said, the strategy was broadly aimed at stimulating weak traffic.
Mr. Gunn said the fare restructuring was intended to encourage people to make their summer reservations early.
 
Profits Are Expected
 Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley, said the fares would not cut too deeply into the industry's revenues because fares have been driven upward by about 15 percent by a series of fuel surchages since last August. He added that there had also been significant fare increases before then.
Mr. Murphy said that because of the increases the industry had room to cut and still keep fares high enough to make a profit.
The industry has been helped recently by a drop in fuel prices to about 70 cents a gallon, from well over $1 last fall. Traffic has also showed signs of recovering now that the Persian Gulf crisis has been resolved although it is still far below normal.
On the other hand, the carriers have been taking delivery of a large number of new planes and need to bring in more passengers to fill up the new capacity.
American is preparing to take over the London routes of Trans World Airlines, pending approval from government agencies, and is trying to restore the confidence of travelers.

HEADLINE: $60 Million in Cash Backs New Credit-Card Securities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
To allay investor concerns that rising consumer defaults on credit-card loans could cause losses for holders of securities backed by those loans, J. P. Morgan Securities and the MBNA America Bank announced a new variety of credit-card security yesterday.
The new $500 million issue is backed by $60 million held in a special cash collateral account, rather than by a letter of credit from a bank. The cash account will be available to investors if needed to avoid a default on the securities. 
 Like other credit-card securities, the primary backing for the new issue is the interest and principal payments from a pool of credit-card loans. Because the interest rate on those loans is 22.2 percent, analysts expect that in normal times the interest payments would be more than enough to cover loan losses. Last year, the default rate was 3.4 percent for the pool of credit cards backing the new securities.
 
Relying on Banks' Letters
 In the past, issuers of credit-card securities have relied heavily on letters issued by triple-A rated banks that promised to make payments if needed to avoid default on the securities. But if the banks' credit rating is cut, the rating on the credit-card securities would also decline, and that has raised concern among investors.
Analysts at Moody's Investors Service Inc. noted in a January report that "a future recession could result in significantly higher losses on credit-card debt" than the peak default rate in the previous recession of 2.7 percent set in 1980.
At MBNA, for example, recent rating cuts on Barclays Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan resulted in lower ratings on some of its outstanding credit-card securities. Although a ratings decline does not result in any loss of interest or principal payments, investors are hurt because it reduces slightly the value of their investment.
Peter Atwater, an investment banker at J. P. Morgan, noted that MBNA sought new ideas because the loans backing the securities were from cards issued by the First American Bank of Tennessee and the Equitable Bank of Delaware, and would be the first offering by the company since it became independent earlier this year.
MBNA, which recently bought the credit-card businesses of the banks, had been owned by the MBNA Corporation in Baltimore, the holding company of the Maryland National Bank.
Although the default rate on the cards backing the securities differs little from the national rate, some investors were concerned because the cards' issuers were relatively small.
 
Role of Swiss Bank
 The source of the cash in the MBNA deal was not disclosed yesterday, but investment bankers said the Swiss Bank Corporation provided money in exchange for an annual fee and use of the interest earned by investing the funds in top-rated commercial paper. Swiss Bank declined to confirm or deny its participation.
The $500 million issue pays an interest rate of 8.25 percent and was offered at a price of about 99.86, to yield 8.325 percent over the estimated average life of 3.1 years.

HEADLINE: Growth Cited by Prudential

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Prudential Insurance Company, North America's largest insurer, said yesterday that its total capital grew by $100 million, to $8 billion, last year, despite large losses in investments and its home real estate and securities divisions.
The privately held insurance giant said total capital, a key measurement it uses to report overall financial growth, expanded despite "the most difficult conditions that financial services companies have faced in a decade." 
 The company's individual insurance, group insurance and asset management businesses reported strong earnings in 1990, Prudential's chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Winters, said.
But those gains were trimmed by a $259 million annual net loss from Prudential Securities, the company's securities brokerage subsidiary.
Prudential Securities last year turned in one of the worst financial performances in Wall Street history and scrapped an ambitious plan to expand into the lucrative investment banking field.
Prudential's residential brokerage network, Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, suffered losses "somewhat greater than planned" because of a slowing economy and poor real estate market.
Prudential, a mutual insurance company owned by its policyholders, did not release net income figures for the last year.

HEADLINE: To Sell Tax, Weicker Takes It on the Chin

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, Conn., March 13

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. rubbed his eyes, took another swallow of Perrier and prepared himself for one more anonymous assault from a listener of the Brad Davis Breakfast Club.
It was not yet 8 A.M., and already callers to the radio talk show had accused Mr. Weicker of misleading voters, padding state finances to fix up the Executive Residence and devising an income tax that a Bloomfield woman said could force her to lose her home. It was just another morning, in other words, in Mr. Weicker's one-man campaign as a lightning rod for his plan to overhaul Connecticut's tax system. 
 "I've put myself in the position where I can be shot at, because that's the way I'm going to sell the budget," Mr. Weicker said as he emerged after nearly 90 minutes of conciliatory salesmanship -- and occasional flashes of impatience -- in Mr. Davis's cramped sound booth at WDRC-AM. "I don't blame anybody for their frustration. It's the same frustration I had when I devised the damn plan."
One month after Mr. Weicker announced that the state's fiscal crisis and recession had rendered Connecticut's budget system unworkable and obsolete, and that a long-avoided personal income tax on wages was the necessary cure, frustration seems to reign on all sides. To a certain extent, Mr. Weicker says, that is a good thing. As long as everyone is angry, his budget will be perceived as fair, he argues, while letting anyone off the hook would doom any chance of passage.
 
'It's Hard but It's Fair'
 By that measure, to judge by the tone of most Breakfast Club callers today, Mr. Weicker's plan would seem to be in pretty good shape, with little danger of anyone being truly happy anytime soon.
The balance of pain was threatened for the first time this week, the Governor said, when union leaders representing 50,000 state workers said they would not accept $400 million in wage and benefit cuts without extending negotiations.
The Governor immediately ordered his commissioners to begin preparing for layoffs as early as April 1. "I think the message is very consistent -- very tough, it's hard but it's fair -- and that is the reason why I can't allow somebody to go ahead and stiff us," he said of the unions. "The minute someone escapes, in terms of the price to be paid, believe me, the whole matter will collapse."
 
Cuts and Layoffs
 Mr. Weicker, who took office as an independent less than three months ago, has proposed a 6 percent tax on all income earned in the state above $25,000 for a family and $12,500 for an individual. Other taxes would lowered to stimulate the economy: The 8 percent sales tax would be reduced to 4.25 percent, but broadened to include previously untaxed items like gasoline; the 13.8 percent corporate profits tax, by far the highest in the nation, would be lowered to 11.5 percent.
State education aid to wealthy towns would be sharply reduced. More than $700 million would be cut from the preliminary budget requests submitted by state agencies, resulting in at least 1,100 layoffs beginning on July 1. And he is counting on $400 million in contract givebacks by state employees.
In what has become almost a stump speech repeated on radio and television call-in shows and in speeches, Mr. Weicker makes the same points in favor of the plan, often in response to the same questions or the same insults.
When a caller says that he or she can't bear to pay a single dollar more in state taxes, the Governor asks how much they earn, then in most cases tells them they will pay less.
The state's poorest families, he says, now pay 5.5 percent of their income in taxes, primarily because of the relatively high sales tax, and would pay only 3.6 percent under his plan.
 
'Not Now or Ever'
 Families who earn $30,000 or less would pay less in taxes than they do now, while those earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year would pay about $150 more, he says. (He generally does not mention that people who do not itemize deductions on their Federal tax returns will pay more, since they will not be able to deduct the cost of their state income tax payments.)
Mr. Weicker, who has no members of his independent Connecticut Party in the General Assembly, also says he will veto any alternative that does not allow cuts in business taxes, or that includes "gimmicks" or excessive borrowing, though he would not require another plan to include an income tax.
On this morning's call-in show, Mr. Weicker faced more complaints than questions. "Connecticut voters will not now or ever allow a state income tax," vowed one of the many anti-tax callers.
Mr. Weicker began, "The fact is that you haven't paid your bills . . ." When the man interrupted, Mr. Weicker snapped, "Let me finish,' and explained how the tax system had depended on gimmicks that had worsened the region's recession.
The next caller was a supporter of Mr. Weicker's -- the only caller to so identify herself -- who said a friend was so infuriated with Mr. Weicker that the two no longer spoke. She hoped that his fiscal solutions would be no more severe than they had to be; Mr. Weicker used that softball to say he had hoped to minimize layoffs, but that the unions were making it difficult.
 
'Unsure What to Do'
 But the public at large is more clearly confused, pollsters say. "Weicker confronts a public unhappy about the fiscal situation but unsure of what to do about it," said G. Donald Ferree Jr., the associate director of the Institute for Social Inquiry, which conducts opinion polls for the University of Connecticut.
Mr. Ferree said that 500 people were questioned between Feb. 26 and March 5 in a poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent. Asked to choose between an income tax and raising existing taxes, 29 percent selected the income tax and 30 percent favored raising other taxes. But 40 percent said they disliked all the alternatives.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: The Pacific Northwest - A special report.;
Northwest's Fortunes, Once Grim, Thrive Despite National Recession

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 13

 BODY:
Ten years ago, during the nation's last recession, the Pacific Northwest was an economic disaster zone, with unemployment rates exceeding 15 percent in some areas and people leaving in droves. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the destruction it wrought seemed an apt symbol of the region's fractured economy.
Now, as the nation struggles through another downturn, Washington, Oregon and Idaho are thriving, adding jobs and people while most areas are fighting just to hold on. And economists predict the Northwest's economy will continue to outperform the rest of the United States well into the 1990's. 
 Although the Northwest has only 10 million people, it exports more manufactured goods than much more populous regions of North America. It sells airplanes to the Japanese, computer software to the Europeans and sneakers to the world.
 
A Bountiful Economy
 From the region's forests and river valleys come apples, wood, wheat and wine, most of which are also sold overseas. Its abundant water is used to grow potatoes and peaches in the region's desert interior and to provide cheap hydropower to the big cities on the coast. It has been adding jobs at nearly three times the national rate.
"Economic growth in the Pacific Northwest has been unmatched by any part of the country," said Paul Sommers, research director at the University of Washington's Northwest Policy Center and co-author of a recent report on the regional economy. "At the same time that the manufacturing sector in the rest of the United States was falling apart, this region took off."
Yet, as with all booms, the ride up is fraught with risks. Washington, one of the fastest growing and most prosperous states in the nation, is still heavily dependent on one company -- Boeing -- and that company's fortunes depend on the health of the airline industry worldwide.
The explosive growth of recent years, fueled in large part by migration from California, has produced choked traffic in Seattle and Portland, driven real estate prices well beyond the reach of many and forced a number of new responsibilities on local governments used to a slower pace.
"If you've been here for awhile, you like the economic good times, but you hate what has happened to the area," said John Prumatico, who works at Microsoft, the world's leading software manufacturer, based in the Seattle suburb Redmond. "But people who just came here from Los Angeles laugh at all the headlines over traffic. It's nothing to them."
And as Governor Booth Gardner of Washington and Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle emphasize, the region, while doing well now, could still be hurt by recession and the social ills associated with rapid growth. In fact, Mayor Rice spends more time sounding notes of caution than working to attract new industry.
"Seattle is not immune to the recession," he said in a recent budget message.
 
Fortune, Nature and Planning
 What happened to turn things around is, in part, a result of luck -- the good fortune of having picked industries that grew beyond expectations in the 1980's. But nature, the abundance of raw materials with which the area is blessed, played a large role. And the rest of the impetus can be attributed to the deliberate attempts by the region's governments to expand the economy.
One of the big catalysts for change was the depression in the timber industry of the early 1980's, when the combination of high interest rates, low demand for lumber and automation put thousands of people out of work. The slump forced those areas most dependent on timber or any other single industry to change their economic focus, or die.
Washington, with less than 2 percent of its jobs tied to the wood-products industry, led the way, sprouting a high-technology community that added Microsoft to the resurgent Boeing, which makes more than half of the world's commercial airplanes.
Spokane, in eastern Washington, known primarily as a logging, mining and farming hub, also began to rebuild its economy. Nearly one worker in eight was unemployed in the inland Northwest in the early 1980's. But then the city's leaders made a conscious effort to change its economy and eventually attracted two big new companies, Seafirst Bank and Boeing.
Washington, like the rest of the Northwestern states, has tied its economic fate to trade with Pacific nations. So, while the rest of the United States went into a slump last year, this state with the highest ratio of jobs tied to international trade, at one job in five, continued to expand. Even in the last quarter of 1990, when Boeing stopped hiring workers and severe floods knocked out bridges and inundated housing developments, Washington added 22,000 jobs, giving it a job growth rate that was nearly four times the national average.
 
Boom in Idaho
 Similarly, Idaho's economy rose out of a crushing slump, with silver and wood prices in the cellar, to a mini-boom as food-processing plants and high-tech companies doubled their overseas sales and their work forces at home. The northern part of the state has been utterly transformed from an area of bleak and polluted towns into an international tourist destination with small manufacturing companies and rich in natural resources.
One town, Kellogg, has replaced its smelter with a ski resort, while another, Coeur d'Alene, a mountain retreat and convention center, last year was named by the readers of Conde Nast's Traveler magazine as the best resort in the country. A company that makes bathing suits opened in Sandpoint, an old logging town.
Oregon, with 80,000 forest products workers in 1979, was the slowest to recover. But in the last decade, as the nation's No. 1 timber state has shed some of its dependence on cutting down trees, it has added 230,000 jobs, almost all of them in areas other than resource extraction, while it has lost nearly 15,000 timber jobs. The state boasts a glamor company in Nike, the athletic shoe manufacturer, a robust trade and financial center in Portland and a high-tech corridor in the fast-growing suburbs west of the city.
So, while the Northwest remains an area where most workers still make something tangible -- airplanes, computer programs, plywood, french fries, clothing -- what they make has changed considerably. For example, shipbuilding, once a mainstay of the region's economy, has virtually disappeared, fled to overseas shipbuilders who have lower manufacturing costs. Timber is still important, but the new emphasis is on selling finished products, like custom-cut wood instead of raw logs, and experts see more of that in the region's future.
 
The Recovery
Years of Pain With a Payoff
The transition to a new economy has not been without pain. Wet coastal timber hamlets -- places like Forks, Wash., or Sweet Home, Ore., -- are a step away from being ghost towns as lumber mill jobs have gone overseas or fallen victim to automation or to cutbacks in logging.
Last year, as the Government debated environmental restrictions to protect the forest home of the endangered spotted owl, state officials predicted that the proposed logging limits would kill thousands of jobs. Restrictions were imposed, but only a small number of jobs have been cut. Instead, an old nemesis -- a recession that hits new home construction particularly hard -- has caused lumber prices to tumble. As a result, 43 mills closed in the three-state area last year.
"It's bad and it's just going to get worse," said Lawrence Gaydeski, a former logger and now a Clallam County official, who lives in Forks, on the Washington coast. "They keep telling us to retrain, retrain, retrain," he said. "I keep saying, for what, for what, for what?"
 
One Worker's Solution
 But Jim Bolton, who lost his job last year when the sawmill that employed him near Eugene, Ore., closed, has found an answer for the dislocated worker. Like many other former forest workers, he has decided to stay in the Northwest and retrain himself for the new economy rather than pull up stakes and leave, as many people did ten years ago during the last downturn.
Mr. Bolton enrolled in a vocational program to learn how to repair recreational vehicles. "I wanted to get into something that isn't dependent on nature," he said.
But he says he expects that initially he will earn less than the $12 an hour he was paid at the mill.
Tourism is a huge growth industry in the Northwest. And while others have disparaged the idea that tourism can generate good jobs, Mr. Bolton sees a good future and better wages in the long run.
 
The Mainstays
Jet Airplanes And High-Tech
The Northwest economy has long been two-tiered, divided between boom-and-bust areas with natural resources like timber, fish and mining, and the fast-growing cities with large labor pools and the ability to provide various services to industries.
The Seattle metropolitan area, with more than two million people, is the region's powerhouse. In 1989, it led the nation in job growth. And a recent nationwide poll of 400 business leaders conducted by Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate company, listed Seattle as the top city in the country for business. Portland was ranked third.
The largest contributor to the boom, of course, is Boeing. Spurred by the decade-long expansion in air travel, Boeing added nearly 50,000 workers in the last six years at pay levels that are among the highest in American manufacturing. Before hiring leveled off at Boeing last fall, the company's work force reached about 105,000 people statewide. Economists at the University of Washington say that each additional Boeing worker brought 2.8 new jobs, usually in retail.
 
Profit's Ascent
 Last year, the company's annual profit reached $1 billion for the first time on sales of $27.6 billion of airplanes. The company's annual sales figure is a big contributor to the Federal Government's balance of trade with foreign countries. The only money-loser was its military business, which drained more than $400 million from the company's revenue last year, with its concentration on Cold War-era weapons that are playing a reduced role in the national military strategy.
Despite the severe slump among airline carriers -- the industry lost $2 billion last year -- Boeing remains confident it will not repeat its collapse of 20 years ago, in which the company was forced to lay off two-thirds of its work force. Company officials say they have a backlog of airplane orders to take it into the next century. Even if airlines continue to fold, Boeing officials argue, the surviving companies will still need to update their fleets with new equipment. If the orders materialize, as analysts predict, for Boeing's next generation of airplanes, the 777, the company might hire another 10,000 workers.
But the Boeing blessing is also a curse, some economists say. During the disastrous drop in business at Boeing two decades ago, Seattle led the nation in unemployment with a level of around 13 percent. At the time of the downturn, 18 percent of all jobs in the Puget Sound region were tied to Boeing. Now, 21 percent of jobs are tied to the company, and Seattle has virtually no unemployment.
"What happened was, the area diversified away from Boeing, and then the company came back like gangbusters, well beyond what anyone ever expected," said Mr. Sommers of the University of Washington, putting the area close to a level considered full employment.
But, experts point out, if the airline industry goes into a prolonged, worldwide recession -- and even before the Persian Gulf war cut air travel the industry was in trouble -- the future of the largest employer in the Northwest may not be so rosy.
 
A $4 Billion Milestone
 It is the jobs outside of Boeing that have been so encouraging to many economists. Microsoft, co-founded by William Gates 3d, who was reared in the area and later dropped out of Harvard to start the company, now has 4,000 people on its Seattle-area payroll. On paper, the personal wealth of Mr. Gates just passed $4 billion. And through a generous employee stock ownership plan, Microsoft has made many of its workers wealthy.
Like Boeing, much of Microsoft's market is overseas. The company is currently creating software programs in Arabic, Chinese and other languages.
Even entry-level jobs in the service industry have benefited from the overall boom. "There is hardly anyone working minimum wage in Seattle, because those jobs would go begging if they tried to pay that low," said Byron Angel, an economist with the State of Washington.
Growth has made construction the leading creator of new jobs in the Northwest. But the surge of new residents, who are entering the Northwest at a rate of more than 100,000 a year, has increased traffic and crime and has led to a shortage in affordable housing.
"Now, we're going to have to start paying the bills for all those newcomers," Mr. Angel said. The rapid job growth, however, is helping the region avoid the high unemployment rates of the last recession. The rate in the three states now closely tracks the national rate.
 
The Challenge
Nature Vs. Growth
The challenge for the Northwest, as its fattening urban areas swallow up much of the spectacular scenery, is to stay prosperous without ruining its garden setting.
"An attractive environment is money in the bank, and that's what the Northwest has in great abundance now," said Ed Whitelaw, a University of Oregon economics professor who is advising the state's new Governor, Barbara Roberts. "If you throw it away during a quick binge, as California did, you are in for a long, long hangover. We have not yet spent our inheritance."
But economists also warn that the Northwest must find a way to use the dividends paid by its new economy, in aerospace, high technology and world trade, to develop the old one, including the dying logging, mining and fishing industries.
 
Fish's Fortunes
 Perhaps no situation is more emblematic of the fight between an environment that draws people to the Northwest and a growing economy that threatens to harm it, than the looming problem over the loss of once-bountiful salmon runs in the Columbia River. This clash between resources and growth could dwarf the spotted owl and forest problem.
If, as expected, certain species of salmon are declared endangered this spring, more water will have to be released from the dams of the Columbia to assist the natural cycle of the fish. That water would normally go to people who farm more than 6 million acres of irrigated land and the utilities that run dozens of hydro-electric power dams.
The fight over the preservation of the salmon runs is an argument that is intricately linked to the concern among many in the Northwest about the quality of life, a phrase frequently mentioned by new businesses. While per capita income in Oregon and Idaho is still below the national average, residents speak of receiving a dividend that has nothing to do with money.
Mr. Bolton, the former sawmill worker who came to Oregon from Ohio 20 years ago, said one of the reasons he could not go back to the Midwest is that he could never give up steelhead fishing.
Mr. Whitelaw, the economist, coined a phrase for this phenomenon -- the "two-paycheck" theory -- now heard throughout the Northwest. "Every worker here gets two paychecks," he said. "One in dollars, the other in clean air, clear streams and scenic vistas."

HEADLINE: Chairman Calls Exxon Strong After Valdez Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Lawrence G. Rawl, the chairman of the Exxon Corporation, said today that the $1.1 billion settlement reached Tuesday night with Alaska and the Federal Government in the Exxon Valdez oil spill would not have any effect on Exxon's finances or its plans.
In a news conference at the company's headquarters in Irving, Tex., that was also shown on closed-circuit television at the National Press Club here, Mr. Rawl said he did not believe the settlement would affect the company's image, which he described as good. 
 Combative at times and not at all chastened, Mr. Rawl nevertheless said the spill, the bad publicity that followed, the expense of cleaning up Prince William Sound in Alaska after the nation's largest oil spill and the civil and criminal cases brought by the Government against Exxon had been an ordeal.
"I feel this a heck of a lot," said Mr. Rawl. "I've been disappointed and angry since March 24, 1989. It's been a burden to us."
 
58 Days of Negotiations
 He insisted, however, that the settlement would not have "a significant effect on our earnings." Indeed, investors saw it as good news: Exxon stock closed at 57 1/4, up $1, on the New York Stock Exchange today.
The settlement, reached late Tuesday after 58 days of negotiation in Juneau and Washington, resolved civil and criminal cases against the world's largest oil company.
As a part of the agreement, Exxon and its shipping subsidiary pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor violations under three Federal environmental laws and agreed to pay a penalty of $100 million, the largest ever for a criminal violation of environmental statutes.
As part of the agreement, two felony charges under the Federal Maritime Law were dropped.
More than 300 civil suits filed against Exxon by private parties are not affected by the accord.
At a news conference in Washington today, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh hailed the agreement as the "strongest message" ever sent by the Government that pollution violations would be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.
 
Environmentalists Happy
 Several national environmental groups applauded the agreement and said it set new standards for penalizing polluters, among them the principle that full payment would be required to cover environmental damage.
But the chairman of Exxon, the nation's third-largest industrial corporation, today seemed exasperated at times and testy at other moments. It was clear that his intention was to assure shareholders that the settlement would not alter the company's day-to-day operations.
"The settlement encompasses issues we were prepared to contest," Mr. Rawl said. "However, we have agreed to the settlements because they are in the best interests of Exxon shareholders and all other parties involved."
He said Exxon had been preparing for more than a year for the criminal trial that had been scheduled for April 10 in Alaska. "We felt pretty good about our chances." Mr. Rawl said.
But he said he had agreed to fly to Washington, where he signed the settlement just before midnight Tuesday, because "looking forward to years of litigation, maybe decades, wasn't in anybody's interest."
Asked whether he or Exxon had learned anything from the accident and the cleanup, whose cost the company puts at more than $2 billion, Mr. Rawl said: "We learned a lot. Actually, all of us knew some of these things before. We learned a lot about cleanup."
Near the end of his remarks today, Mr. Rawl indicated that the Exxon Valdez disaster had heightened awareness within Exxon about the environment.
"You can't let your guard down," he said. "We all have to be more diligent, I guess. In the future, we have to be a lot more sensitive."
Moments later, he concluded with these remarks: "The day it happened, we said it was our oil, our ship, and we would clean it up. It has distracted us. When you spill oil like that, a disaster like that, you change your priorities pretty quick."
The settlement was reached after negotiation by Mr. Rawl, Gov. Walter J. Hickel, Charles Cole, the Alaska Attorney General, and lawyers from five Federal agencies. The talks started in Juneau on Jan. 15, when Mr. Rawl flew to the state capital to meet with Mr. Hickel and Mr. Cole.
 
A Tough Issue
 One of the toughest issues, participants said today, was gaining Exxon's agreement to plead guilty and pay a $100 million penalty for misdemeanor violations of the Clean Water Act, the Refuse Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
A year ago, Doug Baily, then Alaska's Attorney General, was unable to obtain the conviction of the captain of the Exxon Valdez, Joseph J. Hazelwood, on charges of piloting the tanker while under the influence of alcohol. Mr. Hazelwood was convicted of a relatively minor charge, negligently discharging oil, but he was acquitted of charges of criminal mischief, operating a vessel while intoxicated and reckless endangerment.
The Federal Government had already initiated talks with Exxon before the verdict in one of the most widely followed trials in state history. In the talks, the Government was seeking $150 million in criminal penalties and guilty pleas to felony violations of environmental laws. But the negotiations fell apart in 1990.
Along with the $100 million criminal penalty, Exxon will pay $90 million this year into a fund overseen by officials from three Federal and three state agencies. In September 1992, the company will pay $150 million more to the fund, followed by a $100 million payment in September 1993, and $70 million annual payments from 1994 through the year 2001.
The agreement could require Exxon to pay as much as $100 million more after 2001 if more environmental damage is found.
 
Only Penalty Isn't Deductible
 Except for the criminal penalty, all payments by Exxon will be tax-deductible. One economist who studied the effects of the spill estimated that Exxon's ability to write off most of the settlement could cost the taxpayers $300 million in lost revenues.
The agreement also calls for the state and the Federal Government to be reimbursed for many expenses incurred in determining the environmental damage from the spill.
Alaska spent more than $72 million and the Federal Government $62 million. These reimbursements are to be among the earliest payments from Exxon.
"The size of the settlement and the criminal pleas represent a clear and unmistakable signal that those involved in environmental crimes will not go unnoticed and unpenalized," Mr. Thornburgh said.
In Alaska, the settlement was greeted with widespread approval.
"I think it's great there is money to protect Prince William Sound," said Tom Masolini, a 34-year-old fisherman from Cordova, a prosperous fishing village near the mouth of the sound.
"You know, along with the oil, one of our concerns here is that there is too much clear-cutting of the forests around the sound. Maybe they can use some of this money to buy up timber rights and preserve forests here."
National environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Audubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation, also applauded the agreement.
 
 
 
Spill Was Bigger Than Thought
 GRAND RAPIDS, Minn., March 13 (AP) -- The crude oil that spilled from a ruptured pipeline outside this northern Minnesota city last week totaled 1.7 million gallons, nearly three times as much as the company that owns the pipeline initially estimated.
The new estimate, which was issued Tuesday by the company, Lakehead Pipe Line, makes the spill the largest from a pipeline ever recorded in the state and about one-sixth the size of the Exxon Valdez spill.
Lakehead had previously estimated the spill from the 34-inch pipeline, which carries crude oil from Canada into the United States, at 630,000 gallons.
Most of the spill was contained on land. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said harm to fish and wildlife had been minimal.
Officials said the cause of the rupture would probably take months to determine.

HEADLINE: Breaking Up Is Becoming Harder to Do

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
THESE days there is so much emphasis on the family that divorce seems to be going out of style. Therapists say many couples struggle harder and longer to stay together than they might have a few years ago. Poll takers find a greater value being placed on the idea of commitment and a happy marriage. And researchers churn out studies suggesting that both children and adults suffer physical and emotional harm from divorce. Indeed, with the advent of books like "Adult Children of Divorce Speak Out" (Simon & Schuster, 1991), the day may be coming when divorce will be considered a pathology.
"I think there is definitely a turning away from the acceptability of divorce and from minimizing the impact of divorce," said Bickley Townsend, a vice president for the Roper Organization in New York, which polls people on social attitudes. 
 When Roper asked 2,000 people last year to define the most important aspect of success, the top choice was "being a good wife and mother, or husband and father." Four years earlier, the top choice was "being true to yourself."
Today, there are 4.7 divorces annually per 1,000 people in the population, down from a peak of 5.3 in 1979. Although the aging of the population may be a major cause of this decline, divorce is also less attractive these days for reasons like the fear of AIDS and the cost of setting up two households in an uncertain economy.
Furthermore, the glorification of the traditional family is evident on television, in movies and especially in books. There has been a proliferation of titles like "Rebuilding the Nest," "The Case Against Divorce," "Family Matters" and "Back to the Family." In the 70's and early 80's, the climate was different. Movies like "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" were popular then and popular fiction celebrated divorce as a means of gaining liberation and a new life.
A woman who divorced in the 70's said so many of her friends were also breaking up that it seemed like an easy thing to go through. Like others who were interviewed, she did not want her name used. Another woman, who is divorcing for the second time, agreed that social realities are different this time around. There is a feeling, she said, that people should try harder. Before breaking up she and her husband spent several years seeing therapists individually, going to joint counseling and even attending marriage workshops and seminars. With her first husband, she said, she sought counseling only briefly before deciding to divorce.
Increasingly, marriage is supposed to be worked on, like a car or a roof, often with expert help. In the last 10 years membership in the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy has doubled, to 17,500. Although the therapist has been supposed to be neutral as to outcomes, a growing number believe their colleagues ought to try harder to keep marriages together.
Prominently arguing that point of view is Michele Weiner-Davis, a therapist in Woodstock, Ill., whose speech, "Divorce Busters," attracted intense interest at the association's meeting last fall. In her practice, she said in a telephone interview, she has seen many people discover that divorce does not solve their problems.
"In the 60's and 70's," she said, "people really thought that the cause of their unhappiness was their spouse, and if they could get rid of that person, they'd be happy." Instead, said Ms. Weiner-Davis, whose parents were divorced, "divorce creates wounds that never go away."
That message is painful for those who have decided to end their marriages. Painful messages or not, divorce has been made easier by its prevalence and many couples are still willing to divorce. The rate has not fallen as far as some demographers expected it to as the population moved past the teens and twenties, when divorce is most common.
"Just based on the population structure, fewer people are in high-risk groups," said Sally Cuningham, a statistician with the National Center for Health Statistics. The divorce rate has fallen by 11 percent from its peak in 1979, but little of that change has come in the last four years.
"In lots of ways, we have a gap between yearning and behavior," said Barbara Caplan, a vice president at Yankelovich Clancy Shulman in Westport, Conn., which does research in social trends. "There is a recognition that the family is a very workable unit of emotional and economic support. But to bring that about is not the easiest thing in the world."
The long-term consequences of divorce are a topic of great debate among researchers and therapists. Just as some therapists worry about the effects of divorce, others are concerned that bad marriages also create wounds that never go away. "High-conflict or icy-cold marriages often stay together for life, and these are very detrimental to children," said Constance Ahrons, a professor of sociology at the University of Southern California and the author of "Divorced Families" (Norton, 1989).
Adolescent girls are just as distressed by conflicts between their parents at home as they are by the eventual divorce, said William J. Doherty, director of the marriage and family therapy program at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and a psychotherapist in private practice. He is the author of a study on the effects of divorce to be published next month in The Journal of Child Development.
Researchers' conclusions on the consequences of divorce affect the way people feel. Particularly influential was a study several years ago by Judith Wallerstein suggesting that 50 percent of children in divorced households suffered long-term negative effects, like depression and anger.
Dr. Doherty said his clients took to heart the message of her book, "Second Chances," written with Sandra Blakeslee (Ticknor & Fields, 1989). "I see people who are in distressed marriages and have kids and read Wallerstein's book, and they are scared for their kids," he said. "They may try harder to try to make it work."
Although most researchers agree that divorce causes problems for children, they disagree as to how long those problems last. Many of them discount the Wallerstein findings because there was no control group.
Research by E. Mavis Hetherington at the University of Virginia, which did have a control group, suggests that children can be "survivors, losers or winners" in divorce, depending on such variables as their character, age and resources.
Dr. Ahrons questions society's willingness to blame divorce for an array of problems, and believes the concept of failure should be removed. Given the increase in longevity and the greater economic independence of women, divorce will always be a reasonable choice, she maintains, and couples should be helped to achieve successful marital dissolutions.
 To some extent the feeling that divorce is an unpleasant alternative is a result of 20 years of experience as divorce became more common. In addition, a population that is growing older tends to have a different perspective on relationships.
Judith Langer, a market researcher in New York who interviews about 2,000 people a year in focus groups, said the single life has lost so much of its allure that some people seem to be sticking with marriages despite significant dissatisfaction. "What I'm seeing now, with AIDS, is a lot of fear," she said.
A woman who lives in the Washington area and has been married for 13 years, said she now understands that problems would exist in any relationship. Her marriage may not be what she dreamed of when she was young, she said, but she finds the cost of dismantling it to be too high.
Susan Dangerfield, 39, who lives in Crystal Lake, Ill., was in counseling briefly with her husband and considered divorce at one point, but backed off. "I started looking around at other men I knew, both married and single, and I saw a lot of jerks out there," she said. "It made me realize what a wonderful guy I had."

HEADLINE: The Joke's On Whittle For Losing Best Seller

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Whittle Communications roiled book publishing more than a year ago when it introduced a line of advertiser-sponsored books. Now, the book industry's worries have turned to derision. Whittle let a best seller slip from its grasp.
"The Next Century," a look at the future of the world's economy by David Halberstam that now sits on several best-seller lists, was originally solicited by and written for Whittle. But Mr. Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of several previous best sellers, said he withdrew the book when Whittle executives objected to the book's tone, content and length. 
 Mr. Halberstam took the book to William Morrow & Company, which published the book with what he and editors there described as minor revisions, three weeks ago. "The Next Century," which has 140,000 copies in print, is No. 4 on The New York Times Book Review best-seller list for March 17.
"David Halberstam is one of the most distinguished figures in American journalism, and it is amazing to me that Whittle Communications or the editor of this book would say that in some way his work doesn't meet their standards," said Peter Osnos, an associate publisher of Random House. "But these things happen."
 
Brings Advertising to Schools
 Whittle, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn., specializes in the development of media that bring advertising into unconventional venues like schools, doctors' offices and health clubs. Several of its projects, notably "Channel One," a sponsored television news program for high school classrooms, have become controversial among educators and communications professionals who believe that such forums should be free from advertising.
In late 1989, Whittle upset many in the publishing industry by announcing the creation of a book division and the publication of a series of short nonfiction works by well-known authors that would carry advertising from the Federal Express Corporation . Many in publishing worried that advertiser sponsorship opened the way for marketers to manipulate the content of books.
Among the writers signed by Whittle in addition to Mr. Halberstam were William Greider, the political editor of Rolling Stone, George Gilder, a conservative economic theorist, and Michael Lewis, the author of "Liar's Poker," a best-selling chronicle of Wall Street in the 1980's.
At the time the project, called the Larger Agenda Series, was announced, Whittle said the authors would be paid about $60,000 each for books of about 20,000 words. One author, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said that some writers received more than $100,000. The books are distributed free by Federal Express to a list of about 150,000 people prominent in business and Government, but have also been available for purchase in a few Waldenbooks stores around the country.
One Whittle author, James Atlas, an editor at The New York Times Magazine, praised the Tennessee company's handling of his book. "I got the kind of great, professional editing and meticulous line editing you rarely get with trade editors these days," said Mr. Atlas, whose work "The Book Wars," explored the current academic debate over what books should be taught in university curriculums. He said his only disappointment was in the lack of bookstore distribution and the paucity of reviews.
 
No Influence From Sponsor
 Both Mr. Halberstam and Whittle officials said that Federal Express did not influence the media company's desire for changes in "The Next Century" or Mr. Halberstam's decision to withdraw the book.
"My sense is that they didn't know what they wanted," said Mr. Halberstam, whose earlier best sellers have included "The Best and the Brightest," a history of the Vietnam War, and more recently, "The Reckoning," a book about the development of the Japanese and American automobile industries. "I had a sense of almost amorphous objections." He said his Whittle editors told him that the book needed more reporting, and that it was about 5,000 words too long. Mr. Halberstam said he was paid "a small kill fee" for his efforts, but declined to specify the amount.
Tony Kiser, the executive editor of Whittle Books, said: "You shouldn't think of this as an outright rejection. It wasn't. The book had tremendous potential. We felt some revisions were in order and he did not want to do them. It was just not ready for publication by our standards."
Mr. Kiser said he could not recall the exact objections to Mr. Halberstam's manuscript, but said the book did not contain enough reporting to satisfy Whittle. Another Whittle executive, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said the company also did not like the work's "preachiness."
After withdrawing the book from Whittle, Mr. Halberstam said he hesitated to take it to Morrow, his regular publisher, fearing that there was no commercial market for such a short essay. But Douglas A. Stumpf, his editor at Morrow, said he considered the book exciting and marketable, requiring only some expansion. "I thought there should be more personal anecdotes based on his experience as a reporter," he said. The final version is about 35,000 words.
 
Expanded Publishing Division
 The revelation that Whittle passed on a work of such popularity comes at an embarrasing time for the company. It recently announced an expansion of its publishing division, and named Hamilton Jordan, the White House chief of staff in the Carter Administration, as its president and chief operating officer. Today, the company is expected to announce the introduction of a new series of sponsored books in the field of health.
But several publishing professionals said that Whittle may have performed a service to their industry, by showing, however inadvertently, that there is a market for serious, non-fiction books substantially shorter than the 60,000-to-100,000-word trade hard cover.
"This could prove that there is a market for what we used to call broadsides," said Thomas McCormack, the chairman of St. Martin's Press, who said he was considering publishing a line of short paperbacks on current issues. "When I first heard the Whittle notion two years ago, I was too slow-witted to infer from it this lesson."
Despite their differences, Mr. Halberstam also praised Whittle. "The idea is a very good one," he said. "I feel badly that there must be something between a 5,000-word magazine article and a book of 60,000 words or more."

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Europe in 1996

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Fate's croupier, long accustomed to a loser at my position at his table, has murmured amazement at my recent war and market luck and shoved two piles of winnings my way.
But Saddam Hussein has made a compulsive gambler out of me. I'll risk all on a bet about the future of Europe -- and try to be the first to break the bank at Pundit's Roulette. 
 The 1996 Euro-Union Monetary and Defense Summit will take place in Brussels (only a 12-hour drive through the new Chunnel traffic jam from London) in June, just after the British elections.
The Brits will have just tossed out Neil Kinnock and Paddy Ashdown, the Labor-Liberal coalition that upset Conservative damps behind John Major in the fall of 1991. The new right-wing Prime Minister, Chris Patten, who swept to victory with the slogan "Maggie Thatcher Was Too Soft," has promised to end the disastrous monetary experiment with the Deutschpound that put British workers in thrall to German bankers.
From Berlin comes Volker Ruhe, the Christian Democrat who brought Kohl to Newcastle -- that is, who wrested party leadership from Helmut Kohl in 1993, after it became apparent that Mikhail Gorbachev, in giving up East Germany, had handed West Germany a ravenous pig in a poke. Mr. Kohl's lust for unification shifted a capital-gulping burden from the Soviets to the Germans, generating Hirschflation, stagnancy accompanied by rising prices.
The only Socialist at the '96 summit talks is France's Laurent Fabius, who slipped past Michel Rocard to succeed President Mitterrand. (Jacques Chirac would not step aside for the popular Lyons Mayor, Michel Noir, to carry the right's banner.) "Socialist" now means protectionist; its regional police is the Delors Corps, an all-European deployment lentement regiment replacing NATO.
Most Europeans did not intend the Delors Corps to replace NATO. But the Germans insisted that U.S. troops replace their nukes with nightsticks on German soil, the French demanded a French NATO commander, the Italians preferred a C.S.C.E. framework. The Americans said here's CNN's number, call it if your Sarajevo Process leads to war.
Yes, Topic A at the Euro-Union Mon-Def-Sum will be trouble in the Balkans. The blank Czechs will have split into the Bohemian and Slovak republics, squabbling with the handful of states that used to be Yugoslavia, while overlapping Romanians and Hungarians will be exhorted to cut out the border clashes annoying Western Ukraine.
And what to do about the former Soviet republics, with their newly productive market systems? From Yeltsin in Russia to Shevardnadze in Georgia, a curtain of grain will fall from the separated parts of the old Kremlin empire. Although capitalist Poland is reviving nicely, fresh competition from the former Soviet republics is now causing Central European unemployment.
The French blame the insular Germans for letting that happen; both France and Germany blame Britain for letting Japan produce automobiles in the U.K. that outsell Mercedes and Peugeot on the Continent. Italy says if the Delors Corps, dominated by French and German officers, doesn't station its Italian platoon on Capri, Rome will form a "third defense pillar" with the Turks.
At this point, the assembled world press will declare the Euro-Union Mon-Def-Sum to be in disarray. Patten of Britain will delightedly concur, but Chancellor Ruhe and President Fabius will plead with the American Observer at the '96 Summit to say something to reunify Europe.
Vice President Quayle, sent by retiring President Bush to assume a statesmanlike role rather than take on Republican Elder Statesman Jack Kemp in the '96 California primary, will finesse the Democratic candidates Norm Schwarzkopf and Al Gore by calling for burden-sharing in gulf-style war on global warming.
Such arrant American triumphalism will infuriate the summiteers and reunify Europe against Anglo American domination, at least enough for a Joint Communique and a decent group picture.
My pile of chips is on the table. I could lose all: if disparate nationalities amalgamate into Europeans, with a common currency and no farm subsidies and with a projectable defense; and if this united Europe persuades America to keep over 100,000 troops in NATO -- then Fate's croupier will rake in my whole bundle.
If not, I break the bank.

HEADLINE: Fighting Crime With Ceremonies

 BODY:
"America is a can-do nation, and today, at home, we must seize the day. The kind of moral force and national will that freed Kuwait City from abuse can free America's cities from crime."
That was a big applause line for President Bush when he addressed a convention of law enforcement officials recently. But the crime bill he has just sent to Congress -- a centerpiece of his "hundred days" challenge to the lawmakers -- consists of little more than misguided measures that are unlikely to improve public safety. 
 Nearly the only innovative thing about the bill was its perverse presentation. Mr. Bush made a ceremony out of signing the order transmitting the bill to Congress. Usually, ceremonies occur after bills are enacted. Perhaps the President suspects this is his crime proposal's high-water mark.
 A main element of the package is a weaker "exclusionary rule" barring use of improperly seized evidence to prosecute criminals. Mr. Bush says he considers the exclusionary rule an inappropriate burden on police. But the millions who last week saw the videotape of Los Angeles police savagely beating a helpless suspect have new reason to understand the need for protection against police abuse.
The bill also would authorize greater use of the death penalty for certain dramatic Federal crimes and limit habeas corpus petitions that delay executions. Such measures stir the blood of law and order zealots. But most street crimes that outrage the public are subject to state, not Federal, law and aren't punishable by death.
Meanwhile, the President ignores steps that would truly make a more effective Federal anti-crime program. One is gun control designed to disarm drug gangsters and street thugs. Federal laws are essential to curb gun trafficking between states with lax laws and those with strict ones. Specifically, there is urgent need for a national waiting period between purchase and delivery of guns, and a ban on selling domestic military assault weapons to civilians. Yet the Administration, bowing to the gun lobby, resists such measures.
Another obvious task for Washington is to provide more money for innovations in local law enforcement. City police and state courts and prisons handle the vast majority of crime, and that is properly their responsibility. But big states now are overwhelmed by crime problems linked to demographic and economic factors beyond their control.
There is no lack of good ideas: community policing to secure neighborhoods and prevent crime; "boot camp" prisons for first offenders who now go free; closer monitoring of convicts released under court supervision; drug treatment mandated by the court.
Senator Joseph Biden released his version of a crime bill yesterday and while it contains many of the Bush bill's provisions, it would provide $1 billion in criminal justice aid to the states. The bill also includes the laudable plan for a police corps -- college scholarship grants for students willing to serve four years with a police department after graduation. President Bush's budget, by contrast, would reduce law enforcement aid to localities by $100 million.
Mr. Bush rightly cites crime as an urgent domestic problem. But it won't be solved with ceremonial grandstanding in the White House.

HEADLINE: Early March Vehicle Sales Down 14.7%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 13

 BODY:
Sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell 14.7 percent in early March, deflating auto makers' hopes that euphoria over the quick allied success in the Persian Gulf war would lift vehicle sales out of the current slump.
"These numbers are truly a disappointment, because dealer expectations for the period were so high," said Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va. 
 Automotive analysts cited fundamental weakness in the economy, despite recent reductions in interest rates and gasoline prices. Prospective car buyers apparently have been stalled by slowing income growth and increasing unemployment, analysts and automotive executives said, causing many to postpone new vehicle purchases.
The 10 manufacturers with American plants sold 130,640 cars during the March 1-10 period, down 11.9 percent from the comparable period last year. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.9 million, consistent with the sluggish pace of industry sales since the beginning of January, but well below the pace of 6.5 million cars set during the 1990 period.
 
Light-Truck Sales Slide
 Sales of United States-made light trucks slid 19.1 percent, to 74,021 pickups, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles.
There were eight selling days in the period this year, and nine selling days last year.
The Big Three domestic auto makers posted a collective decline of 14.1 percent in car sales, compared with a 4.4 percent rise in overall sales by the seven Japanese companies with car assembly plants in this country.
The General Motors Corporation reported a 15.2 percent decline in car sales, to 57,768 cars. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 19.9 percent, to 30,953 vehicles. G.M.'s Chevrolet division was hit especially hard, with sales down 34.3 percent from a year earlier. Among the big losers were several Chevy models that are popular with daily rental fleets, including the Lumina, Corsica and Caprice models.
Ford Motor's car sales fell 12.6 percent, to 38,630 cars. Sales of Ford's compact Escort remained weak, and the company has reduced first-quarter production of Escort by about 25 percent. Ford's light-truck sales dropped 26.4 percent, to 23,202 vehicles. While the four-wheel-drive Explorer continued to sell well, sales of Ford's F-series pickup truck were nearly halved during early March.
According to estimates provided by Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, the Chrysler Corporation sold approximately 15,500 cars in early March, down about 14 percent from a year earlier. Chrysler's light-truck sales were off about 6 percent, to 17,200 vehicles. In January, Chrysler stopped reporting its sales every 10 days, saying the practice gave rise to unfavorable comparisons with Japanese auto makers.
The Honda Motor Company reported an increase of 17.9 percent in car sales, to 9,344 cars during the period, reversing three months of sales declines for the Japanese auto maker. In February, Honda began offering $300 in dealer incentives on the Accord, the best-selling car in the United States for the last two years, and the incentive was increased to $500 on March 5.
Even so, sales of imported Hondas fell 6.5 percent in early March. Honda manufactures Accords in both the United States and Japan.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of American-made cars dropped 21 percent, to 4,774 cars. The Nissan Motor Company fared better, with sales of its domestically produced cars down 2.7 percent, to 1,699. The Mazda Motor Corporation posted an increase of 1.2 percent in car sales, to 1,197.
One bright spot for auto makers was a general reduction in their stocks of unsold cars, accomplished through widespread plant shutdowns and layoffs. Ford dealers had a 60-day supply of unsold cars at the end of February, according to Ward's Automotive Reports. G.M. dealers' supply dropped to 77 days, and Chrysler dealers had an 84-day supply of cars.
Honda continued to have abnormally high stocks of unsold cars, with Honda dealers showing an 85-day supply of American-built cars at the end of February, virtually unchanged from 88 days a month before. At the end of February last year, Honda dealers had 39 days' supply.
A 60-to-70-day supply is considered normal for this time of year.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 20, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about auto sales in early March misstated the size of the Ford Motor Company's Escort automobile and the extent of a cut in its first- quarter production. The Escort is a subcompact, not a compact; production of the car at Ford's two North American plants was reduced by 15 percent, not 25. The article also referred incorrectly to the Escort's recent sales. They fell 21 percent in early March, but were up in February after having declined in January.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Defeated Republican Will Be S.B.A. Director

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
Patricia Saiki, a Republican who lost a close race to Senator Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii in the fall, has been nominated as the director of the Small Business Administration.
The position was left vacant by the resignation of Susan S. Engeleiter, a Republican who got the post after losing a close race to Senator Herbert H. Kohl of Wisconsin in 1988. 
 Ms. Saiki, 60, served in Congress for 4 years and spent 14 years in the Hawaii Legislature. She had been mentioned as a candidate for Secretary of Education when Lauro F. Cavazos resigned in December, but that post went to Lamar Alexander, former Tennessee Governor.
Also mentioned for the education post was former Representative Lynn Martin of Illinois, another Bush loyalist who lost an election. The 50-year-old Ms. Martin, who lost to Senator Paul Simon, went on to become Labor Secretary.
The S.B.A. has often been in hot water and the subject of complaints by minorities. In 1988, Congress revised some of the agency's rules to curb abuses by "front" companies, like the Wedtech Corporation, that resorted to illegalities to keep their status as minority companies eligible for no-bid contracts.
Ms. Saiki, whose nomination is subject to Senate approval, said in a statement that her selection was an honor. "Small business is the backbone of the American economy," she said, "creating two out of every three new jobs and producing 40 percent of the gross national product.
She added that "in my home state of Hawaii over 90 percent of the businesses are small businesses."
Ms. Saiki has also had experience in Hawaiian big business. She served on the board of Hawaiian Airlines for 13 years and on the board of Amfac Inc., Hawaii's largest private landowner, for 14 years.
During her Congressional terms, from 1986 to 1990, Ms. Saiki was a member of the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. She was listed as the committee member who received the most money from finance-related political action committees during the months before the 1990 elecions. From January 1989 through November 1990, she received $194,692 from finance-related political action committees, or 20 percent of the total she received from such committees in that period.
Ms. Saiki, a Hilo native, taught in junior and senior high schools for 12 years before entering politics. She now lives in Alexandria, Va. She is married and has five children.

HEADLINE: As Collor Completes First Year, Brazilians Write Off Their Highest Hopes

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, March 7

 BODY:
One year ago, Brazilians watched with expectation as Fernando Collor de Mello donned the presidential sash here and vowed to bring Latin America's largest nation into the first world, following a road of low inflation and free-market economics.
As the anniversary of the inauguration passes on March 15, the 41-year-old President's first-year report card in the Brazilian press speaks of a year of disappointment. 
 "Lost Illusions," Veja, the nation's largest selling newsweekly, headlined its one-year review.
"A Lot of Noise and Little Action," Jornal do Brasil, an independent Rio de Janeiro daily, said in a headline, referring to a year of watching the President drive a tank, fly a jet, camp out in the Amazon and give a speech in Antarctica.
 
Inflation Persists
 Public opinion polls have tracked a growing disenchantment with the Government's performance. In a survey of 2,581 households completed early in March for Veja, 58 percent of respondents gave a "negative" evaluation to the Collor Government and 35 percent gave a "positive" evaluation.
Critics say the Government has plunged the nation into the sharpest recession in memory and has little to show for it.
In 1990, Brazil's economy shrank by 4.6 percent, the largest drop since the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics started measuring the economy in 1947.
While at least one million people lost their jobs, the recession cooled, but did not kill, inflation. In Mr. Collor's first year in office, prices rose by about 400 percent. In February alone, prices rose by 21 percent, despite a monthlong wage and price freeze.
Mr. Collor had singled out inflation as his No. 1 enemy. Today, he is condemned for failing to meet the targets he set.
"Collor put the military in its place, he made progress on the environment, he opened the economy, he broke up monopolies -- but all this is obscured by the image of the man who couldn't beat inflation," Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a centrist opposition Senator from Sao Paulo, said in an interview here.
 
Modernizing the Economy
 Indeed, often overshadowed by the economic crisis, Brazil's President did move decisively to modernize the nation's economy and to clear away several points of friction with the United States.
In the Amazon, the elimination of tax credits to ranchers helped reduce burning of the rain forest. Responding to international concern over the Amazon's Indians, the President dedicated scarce resources to destroying dozens of illegal landing strips used by gold miners to enter lands of the Yanomami Indians.
Confronting Brazil's industries, among the most protected and inefficient in the world, the President announced a four-year schedule of gradually opening the economy to imports. Also to further free trade and international competitiveness, he cut in half -- to four years -- a timetable for the creation of a regional common market with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Mr. Collor also disclosed, and repudiated, a project by Brazil's military to build an atom bomb. He opened the military's secret nuclear sites to inspection and started negotiations with neighboring Argentina toward internationally acceptable nuclear safeguards program.
 
Visit to Washington Planned
 In June, Mr. Collor is to visit Washington, where President Bush will undoubtedly express appreciation for progress in these areas.
Less pleasing to the United States has been slow progress on renegotiating payment terms for Brazil's $60 billion foreign commercial debt. Foreign private investors and the International Monetary Fund have largely postponed committing new money to Brazil until progress is made.
Also unsettling to some American officials, Brazil declined to take part in the allied campaign in the Persian Gulf war. But next week a Brazilian trade and construction mission is to arrive in Kuwait, seeking contracts.
"In the short term, Brazil's sitting on the fence during the war will be very negative to some people here," Riordan Roett, an expert on Brazil at Johns Hopkins University, said in a telephone interview from Washington. "But more important in the long term is the impression here that there is no social pact, that the political community is up in arms, and that privatizations haven't even started yet."
 
An Autocratic Style
 Critics here say Mr. Collor's first year revealed an autocratic style of governing. Without a firm majority in the 19-party congress, Mr. Collor ruled largely through "provisional measures," or decrees. Although the use of decrees was intended only for emergencies, he issued an average of 12 a month in his first year.
While Congress now struggles to strip the President of this power, political analysts say their widespread use reflects a President uncomfortable with consulting and seeking a consensus with other political groups.
In 1989, Mr. Collor, the Governor of a small state, Alagoas, won 35 million votes to become the first President popularly elected in Brazil without the support of any major party.
"Collor managed to antagonize a lot of people in a very short time," Alexandre de Barros, a political risk consultant, said here. "Unions, the middle class, civil servants, the military -- he treated businessmen like bandits."
Most traumatic for the middle class was the freezing of virtually all bank accounts over $1,500. The money is to be released in monthly installments, starting next September.
"In 24 hours, the Collor Government destroyed confidence in savings accounts that took 20 years to build up," said David Fleischer, a political scientist here.
 
Privatization Plan Delayed
 The confiscation, essentially an 18-month moratorium on paying the internal debt, may well be for naught.
Although as many as 200,000 federal workers were dismissed or laid off, the country is far from living within its means. A long-delayed plan for the privatization of state-owned companies is to start next month, Marcos Coimbra, General Secretary of the Presidency, said in an interview here.
To meet the budget gap, and to cover unchecked spending by state governors, the Central Bank increased the nation's money supply by 2,035 percent lastt year, according to a study by Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, a University of Sao Paulo economist. Inflation has continued at such a steady whirl that people in Rio de Janeiro used two denominations of cruzeiro bills for two months without realizing that they were no longer valid.
"It is like an old hose where water sprays out of the holes," Ozires Silva, Minister of Infrastructure, said here of the Government's continuing attempts to control the money supply.
When the Government recently imposed wage and price controls, for the fifth time in five years, many Brazilian economists openly wondered what happened to Mr. Collor's free-market nostrums of one year ago.
 
New Plan Prepared
 "Each shock attacks the institutional tripod of a free-market economy -- inviolability of property rights, respect for legal contracts, and stability of the rules of the game," Mario Henrique Simonsen, a former Planning Minister, wrote last month in an essay widely quoted here. "With these successive attacks, Brazil operates neither like a market economy, nor like a socialist economy. It works as a laboratory for university economics departments."
Apprently taking some of his critics to heart, Mr. Collor has vowed to present a plan for national reconstruction to Congress for debate on March 15. The plan has been drawn up to win majority approval by Congress, presidential aides say.
"We need to mobilize the nation, not through decrees, but through an agreement among the political forces," Senator Cardoso said. "We don't need any more magic solutions."

HEADLINE: Fate of Police Chief in Los Angeles Is Vigorously Debated After Beating

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 13

 BODY:
From the Mayor's office to breakfast tables in Watts and the San Fernando Valley, the main question in Los Angeles today is: Should Daryl F. Gates leave his job as Chief of Police?
The Police Commission, which appoints the Chief, is scheduled to hold a public meeting with him on Thursday to discuss the March 3 beating of an unarmed, unresisting black motorist by white officers. The beating was videotaped by a witness and has been broadcast over and over, shaking television audiences nationwide. 
 The meeting will come two days after the Congressional Black Caucus asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate allegations of police brutality here and elsewhere and after Mayor Tom Bradley proposed amending the City Charter to allow him to dismiss police chiefs and other department heads who are now protected by civil service.
To all this, the stern, dapper and often cocky Chief has responded as he has to numerous other storms in his nearly 13 years as department head: with charm, defiance, blaming of others, tempered apologies and mustering of his political support.
Having developed a national stature as an implacable foe of crime and defender of the police, Chief Gates will not be easily moved by cries for his resignation. "He has succeeded in developing a constituency of his own, unique among department heads, like an elected official in his own right," said Councilman Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood.
 
Adapting to a Changed City
 The 64-year-old Chief began his career with the Los Angeles Police Department 42 years ago. In those "Dragnet" days, Los Angeles was a much smaller place and the line between good and evil seemed clear. It has since become the nation's second-largest city, an international polyglot where police work is as much sociology as criminology.
Critics say Chief Gates has adapted to the changes only slowly and grudgingly. They concede that he was as appalled as they at the recent beating, but say that his longtime attitudes have fostered an insensitivity to minority members throughout the 8,300-member force, which is 61 percent white. Over the years, the Chief's outspoken comments have disparaged black and Hispanic residents as well as women, homosexuals and others.
"The tone of leadership that has created the climate for this has to be altered," said Melanie Lomax, a civil rights lawyer who was recently appointed to the Police Commission by Mayor Bradley. "The intemperate and inflammatory statements regularly made by our chief of police tend to inflame Gestapo-type tactics by officers who are marginal. I do not believe that he condones it, but he has blinders on."
The view is entirely different in the police stations. "We and the officers view him as one who understands their job, supports them, speaks them," said Lieut. George Aliano, president of the police union, the Los Angeles Protective League.
Bill Rathburn, the former commander of Los Angeles's South Bureau who became chief of police in Dallas eight days ago, called Chief Gates a "very sensitive, very compassionate, very private man" who takes any failure by his people or insult to the department very personally.
He said the Chief had been maligned in the press and was a "strict disciplinarian with no tolerance for police misconduct of any type."
 
A Stubborn, Proud Man
 Few people seem to know the Chief well. Acquaintances call him something of a loner, a stubborn and proud man dedicated to law and order. He maintains a stern personal regimen, running regularly and eschewing alcohol. Chief Gates, who is said to be an excellent cook, and his wife, Sima, live in a condominium near downtown, and have a beach place in San Clemente.
In 1982, Chief Gates said he had disowned his only son, Lowell, because of drug use. In 1985 Lowell Gates was arrested on charges of robbing a Huntington Beach drugstore of $5,000 worth of narcotics and was sentenced to a year in jail. "He will get no assistance from me," the Chief said at the time of the arrest.
He runs the department with the same discipline, meting out harsh punishment for theft or dishonesty. But critics say he has been less vigilant about the use of excessive force and possible racism in the ranks, allowing a cowboy attitude to flourish. They point, for example, to a case in 1985 in which the Chief overruled a department tribunal that had ordered the dismissal of an officer who lied about an incident in which his partner killed a Cuban immigrant with a shot in the back; the Chief reduced the penalty to six months' suspension.
A politically conservative Republican, the Chief has sometimes been mentioned as a possible candidate for Mayor or Governor, and he has not discouraged such speculation.
 
Warning to Officers
 Chief Gates's press office did not respond to repeated requests for an interview with him. At press conferences and television appearances since the beating of Rodney G. King, the Chief has called the incident an "aberration" in an otherwise "model department" and has rejected suggestions that he resign.
He was in typical form today when he addressed the Los Angeles County Peace Officers Association. "We have brought shame and dishonor upon the police profession," he said, but later he lashed out at critics like the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which has been running newspaper advertisements calling for his resignation.
Indeed, many political leaders say Chief Gates just might win out. Los Angeles is perhaps unique among major American cities in placing the chief of police and all other department heads under civil service protection to insulate them from political corruption. Chief Gates cannot be removed by the Mayor or the commission, which is appointed by the Mayor, without "cause," generally meaning malfeasance or moral terpitude.
Even then, his ouster could be delayed for years by appeals. No Chief has been ousted since the revised City Charter was approved in the 1930's.
 
'A Praetorian Guard' of Whites
 Such insulation has had its negative aspects, critics say, making the police unaccountable. "Sun Belt cities have prided themselves insulating police from political pressure," said Henry W. McGee Jr., who teaches criminal justice and urban planning at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law. "But it has insulated them from any minority influence.
"So the L.A. police turn out to be a praetorian guard of blue-collar whites who are blatantly and openly hostile to non-white minorities. While they are incorruptible, they also turn out to be deeply racist in ways more affluent Americans do not indulge themselves."
Politicians here say Chief Gates would be difficult to oust. He has a substantial following among the largely white residents of the San Fernando Valley and other areas, including some minority ones, that are increasingly fearful of crime.
"The Chief is not removable without a tremendous knock-down, drag-out fight," said a former Police Commission member who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "It would polarize the community in a very undesirable way."
Three times in the past 10 years voters have rejected Mayor Bradley's request for power to dismiss police chiefs and other department heads.
 
Nibbling at Authority
 While the Mayor, a former police officer who has long been at odds with Chief Gates, has currently refrained from calling for his ouster, close associates say Mr. Bradley would be pleased to see the Chief go.
For months the Mayor has been trying to gain more control over the Police Department indirectly through appointments to the commission. He recently appointed two political allies, Dan Garcia and Ms. Lomax, and, after two recent vacancies are filled, his allies will hold four of the commission's five seats.
While the commission cannot dismiss Chief Gates, it can make life uncomfortable for him by changing policies on training, use of force and weapons. Mr. Garcia said the panel would be asking tough questions and would urge quick work on an detailed study of instances of brutality in recent years.
Over the years Chief Gates has made accommodations with minority members and women, but slowly. He fought black and Hispanic leaders when they complained that a police deployment formula based in part on the value of stolen property tended to favor rich areas, but in the end he agreed to increase patrols in poorer parts of the city and to expand the police force.
For nearly a decade, the department has been under a Federal court order to hire more minority members and women, and it has made considerable progress. As of Jan. 27, according to figures supplied by the department, 22 percent of the 8,423 sworn officers were Hispanic, 14 percent black and 13 percent female.
Recent Census Bureau figures show non-Hispanic whites make up 37 percent of the Los Angeles population, non-Hispanic blacks 13 percent, Hispanics of all races 40 percent and all other races 10 percent.
The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing recently filed suits against the department, charging that it has systematically denied promotions to Hispanic and black officers. Only 10 percent of detectives in the highest grade are Hispanic and 7 percent black. Chief Gates has disputed the charges.
 
'He Is Not Stupid'
 Even critics say that the Chief has mellowed in recent years and become more sensitive to the concerns of minorities, and that he has come to recognize that the problems of the police in poor communities are rooted in social and economic conditions.
But, Ms. Lomax said, "He is too involved in technology and trying to bring law-enforcement techniques to a new state of art," Ms. Lomax continued. "Anybody can blow things up. The question is whether we've got the people orientation not to let things get out of hand."

HEADLINE: Housing in the Catskills;
A New Project at Windham Ski Resort

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINDHAM, N.Y.

 BODY:
The shift is away from town houses and toward semiattached houses for one developer of residential lots in this ski resort town who is seeking to find the best market for the 90's.
The builder is Bernard J. Brabazon, one of the most active developers in what has become a large resort center in the northern Catskills. The housing development was set off by the opening of Ski Windham, a family-oriented resort, in 1981. The resort is on the north side of the 3,035-foot-high Cave Mountain, 140 miles northwest of New York City. 
 Mr. Brabazon is a one-time Queens real estate broker who moved to Windham in 1974. He found a sleepy hamlet at the foot of a mountain where "there was no place to play tennis and you swam in the creek." He built Windham's first town-house complex, the 30-unit Elm Ridge Bath and Tennis Club, which has a swimming pool and tennis courts, completing it in 1982.
Now he is involved in the third phase of Windham Ridge Club, on a 320-acre former dairy farm off Mill Street across the valley from Cave Mountain. The property was purchased in 1982 for $2 million and has been approved for the construction of 329 housing units. A third of the units have been built. The contemporary styles are the design of Frost & McConnell of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and, more recently, of Minor L. Bishop of Manhattan.
The third phase consists of fourteen 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom houses that are semiattached with one-car garages. They are priced at $250,000. The switch to semiattached houses was made because of the slow market for smaller town houses.
In the first two phases, the development offered attached one-, two- and three-bedroom town houses. A total of 109 such units were built and 107 have been sold.
Last year it was necessary to turn to an auction to sell 23 of the one-bedroom units, which failed to sell partly because of their small size -- 700 square feet -- and partly because of the downturn in the vacation market that started in 1989, Mr. Brabazon said. The November auction brought prices of $65,000 to $70,000 a unit, well below the $125,000 original asking prices.
In general, town-house development has accounted for most of the new construction in the 44.9-square-mile Windham in recent years. Since 1981, 367 units in five projects have been completed, and another 190 units in four projects are before the planning board, said the town building inspector, Robert M. Bosworth.
Since the softening of the vacation-house market in 1989, three proposals were canceled and the construction of 42 approved units was put on hold, he said. An auction is scheduled on Sunday for the 20 unsold units in a 103-unit project called Windham Mountain Village.
Land prices, on the other hand, are holding up. A price of $200,000 for a half-acre lot adjoining the ski slopes is not unusual, said Judith A. Higgins, a Windham broker. "The buyer who has to be on the ocean in the Hamptons has to be on the trail of a ski slope," she said. "It's the same thing, only a different season."
The town supervisor, Thomas Meehan, estimated that the town's year-round population of 1,600 swells to 6,000 on a winter weekend and that 40 percent of the local economy is related to the resort business.
At Mr. Brabazon's development, lots are already on sale for a fourth section of single-family houses. The land parcels range in size from one-fifth of an acre to three-quarters of an acre and are priced from $75,000 to $125,000. All four sections are part of a homeowners association, which maintains roads and common areas.
Work has begun on an 18-hole golf course. Future construction plans include an additional 44 units of semiattached houses and a 120-room inn with condominium units that could earn rental income when not used by their owners. The inn still needs site plan approvals from the town.
Recreational amenities at Windham Ridge Club are available to homeowners on a membership basis. The initial fee is $3,500 and annual dues are $800. The amenities include an indoor pool, seven outdoor and three indoor tennis courts and a health club. Golf membership will cost $7,500 initially and $1,200 a year.
The future of development in Windham may depend less on a slowdown of demand and more on hearings being conducted by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. The agency is proposing stringent new regulations for city watershed areas, which include Greene County, in which Windham is situated. Watershed areas contain the reservoirs for the New York City water supply. Passage of the proposals would kill development in the town, Mr. Meehan said.

Israeli Blessings And Burdens

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE effort to achieve peace in the Middle East, which President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d are now trying to push, is complicated by the huge influx of Soviet Jews to Israel, the scarcity of land and other resources and the uncertain ability of the Israeli economy to absorb the number of immigrants expected to arrive.
Last year 200,000 Soviet Jews entered Israel -- five times as many as the Israeli Government was expecting. The collapsing Soviet economy and the outbreak of ethnic conflict and anti-Semitism created the new exodus. 
 This year 300,000 to 400,000 more Soviet Jews are expected. By 1993 or 1994, according to a study by four Israeli economists at Tel Aviv University, the influx of Soviet Jews will reach 1 million, and by the year 2000, 2 million. The study estimates that as a result of total immigration from all countries and natural increase the Jewish population of Israel could climb to 7 million in this decade, double the 3.5 million of 1990.
The Arab population of Israel is 650,000, according to official Israeli sources, and 800,000, according to Palestinian sources. In addition, 1.7 million Palestinians live in the occupied territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
All told, 300 million people live in 20 countries of the Middle East. Assuming present growth rates, the population of the region will double in 24 years; specific growth rates from natural increase range from 1.6 percent in Israel to 3.9 percent in Iraq.
About 40 percent of the Arab world is under 15; as the Population Research Center in Washington notes, longstanding political instability in the Persian Gulf region has made population a politicized and sensitive issue. With its heavy losses in the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq sought to spur even faster population growth. For Palestinians and Israelis, population size is taken to spell political power and security.
That is why Israel sees the influx of Soviet Jews as a blessing. But it is a burden, too, as the sluggish Israeli economy struggles to create housing and jobs. If the influx continues to grow as rapidly as anticipated, it will strain other resources as well, with fresh water in particularly short supply.
Israel will need huge infusions of capital to take care of its new immigrants. At a conference in New York this week on the Soviet influx into Israel, Haim Ben-Shahar, an economist and former president of Tel Aviv University, stressed the difficulty of finding the needed capital abroad. Global capital markets, he said, are "extremely cautious, and no doubt will prefer to focus on other regions, such as Eastern Europe."
The Arab boycott of Israel and of foreign companies that deal with Israel further reduces the inflow of capital to Israel. Asked whether he saw any reasons for hope that the Arab states would drop their boycott of Israel, Dr. Ben-Shahar said, "No -- unless it is part of an overall peace process."
Asked whether the United States, with its influence enhanced by the victory over Iraq, had enough leverage to get the Arab states to drop the boycott, Dr. Ben-Shahar said he couldn't judge, but added that he would still prefer an overall deal through which, in a carefully staged peace process, "the boycott will be lifted and Israel will receive financial support to absorb the Soviet Jews." He added, "In return, Israel will be ready to compromise on territories, provided that military and security arrangements are installed." The Israeli Government, however, has been resistant to the idea of trading land for peace.
At the New York conference, several economists argued that Israel now needed to overhaul its economy, shifting resources from military to civilian production and reducing the heavy hand of Government. Howard Pack, director of the program in international development at the University of Pennsylvania, said Israel was in danger of re-enacting the Argentine "miracle" of underdevelopment, transforming its "enormous economic potential into continuing slow growth that increases its relative military burden, encourages emigration, depresses Western immigration and weakens it politically."
A high-level team of American economists -- Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs; Herbert Stein, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Stanley Fischer, former chief economist of the World Bank -- has been working in Israel , under official auspices, on a study of the structure of the Israeli economy.
This could provide the basis for cooperation between the Israeli and American Governments -- and between private businesses and educators in both countries -- for the revival of Israeli economic growth, which could, at the same time, facilitate the peace process.
As Professor Pack put it: "The growth in living standards would reduce many of the current frictions that beset Israeli society and might even lead neighboring states to calculate the potential benefits of closer economic relations. There are many more routes to normalization of relations than were envisioned by the Camp David accords."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Sharply in U.S. After Mixed Day Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply in domestic dealings yesterday after putting in a mixed performance abroad.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $365.30 an ounce, off $1.60. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1.95, settling at a late bid of $364.65. 
 The dollar's advance came despite continued negative economic news. The Commerce Department reported that business sales slackened 1.2 percent in January, helping to swell inventories by four-tenths of 1 percent.
 
'Testing the Upside'
 But the dollar advanced as investors continued to "suspect the economy will turn around shortly, and nobody wants to miss the boat," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, a New York consulting firm.
The absence of central bank intervention also gave traders reason to test the dollar's upper limits. "The dollar bulls have a reason to continue to buy because they don't think the Federal Reserve is serious about stopping the dollar's climb," he added.
The dollar also rose despite rumors that the Fed was about to cut the discount rate, the interest member banks are charged on loans from the central bank.
"Despite all the rumors and without intervention," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank, the market "was coaxed back into testing the upside."
The dollar appeared strongest against the European currencies, while its gains were spotty against the Japanese yen.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.9 yen, closing at 135.65 yen. Later in London, it fell to 135.95 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 135.87 yen, up from 135.66 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.8560, from $1.8570 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.8520 to buy a pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.8615.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.5825 marks, from 1.5730 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.3715 Swiss francs, up from 1.3645; 5.3910 French francs, up from 5.3605; 1,181.00 Italian lire, up from 1,173.75, and 1.1538 Canadian dollars, unchanged.

HEADLINE: Inventories Rose 0.4% In January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Business sales slackened 1.2 percent in January, helping to increase inventories by four-tenths of a percent, the Government said today. That resulted in an inventory-to-sales ratio of 1.56, the widest in six and a half years, but analysts said the figure was still not dangerously high.
The Commerce Department said sales in January fell to $523.6 billion after declining by a revised 2.4 percent in December and 1.5 percent in November. It was the first time that sales dropped for three consecutive months since July, August and September 1984. 
 The revised December drop was slightly worse than the 2.3 percent fall first reported last month. It was the steepest decline since sales plunged 3.1 percent in January 1987.
Inventories advanced to $814.4 billion after dropping six-tenths of a percent in December. They had edged up two-tenths of a percent in November.
The new data produced the 1.56 inventory-to-sales ratio, meaning it would take 1.56 months for businesses to clear their shelves and backlots at the January sales pace.
In past recessions, large backlogs have caused serious production cutbacks and job layoffs as businesses tried to sell off their inventories. The ratio had risen as high as 1.75 during the severe recession of 1974-75 and to 1.74 during the 1981-82 downturn. The ratio averaged 1.49 last year.
"It's still under control," Kris Bledowski of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., said of the ratio. "With sales weak across the board, we have to expect inventories to rise as well, but the ratio is manageable."
Many economists expect sales to pick up this spring, fueling a mild turnaround in the economy.
Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said sales would remain sluggish in February but pick up in subsequent months.
"January and February may well be the low point of these numbers," he said. "We'll see a little more optimism in March and going into the spring."
In fact, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that reail sales started to pick up in February, posting an eight-tenths of a percent gain for their first advance in four months. Analysts viewed that report as evidence the recession might have bottomed out.
But in January, retail sales slumped 1.4 percent following a 1.8 percent decline the previous month. Sales on the wholesale level dropped 2.8 percent after sliding seven-tenths of a percent in December. Manufacturing sales were unchanged after a 3.9 percent drop a month earlier.
Inventories on the retail level rose seven-tenths of a percent, nearly wiping out an eight-tenths of a percent decline in December. Wholesale backlogs, which were unchanged in December, gained nine-tenths of a percent. Factory inventories held steady after dropping eight-tenths of a percent a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Loan Troubles Grow for Banks and S.& L.'s

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Real estate problems for banks and savings institutions worsened sharply in 1990 and shifted from the Southwest to Northeast and Middle Atlantic States, the Government said today.
The Office of Thrift Supervision said the 2,342 savings institutions still outside Government control lost $965 million in the final three months of 1990 and $2.41 billion for the entire year. 
 A 25 percent increase in losses from the third to fourth quarters occurred despite the transfer of 39 insolvent savings institutions in the period to the the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency overseeing the bailout.
Also, the institutions' bad loans as a percentage of all loans have risen steadily throughout the year, again despite the removal of the worst savings associations. The percentage was 2.34 at the end of the year compared with 2.03 at the end of the first quarter.
 
Unwilling to Predict
 The director of the thrift office, T. Timothy Ryan Jr., said lower interest rates should help the savings industry this year, but he was unwilling to predict improvement.
"We are uncertain at this time what to expect in the first quarter of 1991, especially in view of the economic slowdown and weak real estate market," he said.
Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Wednesday that profits at the nation's 12,338 commercial banks rose 6.5 percent, to $16.6 billion in 1990 from $15.6 billion in 1989.
But that masked rising problems caused by the recession and plummeting real estate prices.
Delinquent real estate loans jumped to $36 billion at the end of 1990 from $22.5 billion a year earlier. Repossessed real estate rose to $19.8 billion, from $12.5 billion in 1989.
For the fourth quarter, commercial bank profits fell 31 percent, to $1.39 billion.
 
Trouble in the East
 Although the number of weak banks actually declined from 1,109 at the end of 1989 to 1,046, the fact that larger Eastern institutions are now in trouble means a much higher proportion of the industry's assets are owned by ailing institutions.
Assets held by problem banks soared by 74 percent from $235 billion in 1989, or 7 percent of the industry, to $409 billion, or 11 percent.
"In effect, what has happened is the problem has moved," said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va. "Texas has been through it and now it's in New England. But in all candor, things are worse than they were in 1987. We're in a national recession and we have broader concerns about the rest of the country."
 
Top Money-Losing States
 The banking industry in nine states and the District of Columbia lost money, with the worst red ink, $1 billion, coming in Massachusetts. The other money-losing states were Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Rhode Island.
A year ago, the five states with the highest percentage of bad real estate loans in commercial banks were, in order, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Massachusetts.
The F.D.I.C. issued a separate report for the country's 473 savings banks, which are primarily in the Northeast and invest more heavily in real estate than do commercial banks. They lost $2.4 billion in 1990, more than three times the $773 million loss in 1989. The fourth-quarter loss was $1.2 billion, with 48 percent of the institutions losing money.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ford Tightens Terms On Rental Fleet Sales

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 14

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company today revised the terms under which it sells cars to car-rental companies, reflecting a growing concern that new-car sales are being damaged by growing inventories of slightly used cars.
Ford stipulated that rental fleets must keep cars in service for at least six months or 15,000 miles before they can be sold to Ford dealers, who then sell them to the public. Rental fleets must now keep cars for only four months, and many of them land on dealer lots with only a few thousand miles on them. 
The policy change was announced to rental car companies today and will affect cars and trucks built after April 30.
For consumers, slightly used cars often have proved to be a bargain. Some slightly used late models may sell for thousands of dollars less than new models. For example, Potamkin Chevrolet in Miami now sells a new 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier for $9,680, which includes a $400 customer rebate. For about $1,600 less, a consumer can buy the same model with 8,000 miles on it and the remainder of the warranty.
The General Motors Corporation said it planned to extend the four-month minimum period rental fleets keep their cars in service beginning in the 1992 model year. The Chrysler Corporation said it would watch what Ford has done, but the company now had no plan to change its four-month minimum holding period.
Since the mid-1980's, Big Three auto makers have been providing financial incentives for rental companies to buy cars and resell them more frequently. While sales to rental fleets provide auto makers with less profit than sales to dealers, they represent additional production.
Automotive analysts say about a million cars annually come out of American rental fleets and compete with new cars.
As the number of slightly used cars has increased, however, concern has grown among dealers and manufacturers that too many potential customers are buying cars coming out of the rental fleets rather than new cars. Last year, Ford agreed to sell its slightly used cars through Ford dealers exclusively.
Ford's biggest rental customers are Hertz and Budget Rent-A-Car, but Robert L. Rewey, Ford vice president for sales operations, declined to say how many cars Ford sells annually to the fleets. Ford owns 49 percent of the Hertz Corporation.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: DIPLOMACY;
Baker and Syrian Chief Call Time Ripe for Peace Effort

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, March 14

 BODY:
After seven hours of talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that he and Mr. Assad agreed that they must take advantage of the "window of opportunity" that exists after the Persian Gulf war to produce a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
But when Mr. Baker was pressed as to whether he heard any "new thinking" about Israel from Mr. Assad -- as he said he had heard from Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia -- he could not point to anything other than a Syrian commitment to be active now in the pursuit of peace. 
 Before leaving Damascus, Mr. Baker also said at a news conference with the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, that the Syrians recently received a shipment of advanced Scud missiles. Israeli officials had previously reported the shipment, saying the missiles, sent here by North Korea, were about two dozen Scud-C's. More accurate versions of the missiles Iraq used against Israel, the Scud-C's can hit targets up to 300 miles away.
 
'State of War With Israel'
 "Syria is still in a state of war with Israel," Mr. Sharaa when reporters asked him for his reaction. "Israel has so many missiles and so many different types of mass destruction weapons. A just and comprehensive peace would solve all of these problems."
The thrust of Mr. Baker's remarks, as well as those of a senior American official in his party, was that they were pleased with their talks because the Syrians were agreeing that now was the time for a major push to resolve the Arab-Israel conflict and because they were generally supportive of Mr. Baker's approach. His plan involves trying to get the Arab nations and Israel to make gestures to begin reconciling their differences, while promoting the same process between Israelis and Palestinians.
It was difficult to tell, though, if Mr. Baker was truly pleased by these Syrian commitments, which appear rather predictable and routine, or whether he was simply highlighting them because he had nothing else and wanted to maintain at least an appearance of momentum.
 
Baker Sees Opportunity
 "With respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict," Mr. Baker said, "I think that the minister would agree with me that we find ourselves agreeing that we share a commitment to seek a comprehensive settlement based on U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338.
"We find ourselves in agreement with respect to the fact that there is, we think, an opportunity now in the aftermath of the gulf crisis that should be seized -- a window of opportunity that could make it possible for us to make significant progress in the Arab-Israeli conflict."
He added: "I sensed a very serious intent on the part of the Syrian Government to pursue an active peace process and to continue to work toward that end with the coalition countries that worked together to reverse Saddam Hussein's aggression."
When a Baker aide was asked later what Mr. Assad or Mr. Sharaa said to Mr. Baker to make this seeming repetition of long-standing Syrian positions significant, the aide said one of the Syrian leaders -- apparently Mr. Sharaa -- told Mr. Baker that this time the Syrians were ready not simply to end the state of war with Israel but to construct a genuine peace based on real reconciliation.
 
An 'Intractable Problem'
 The official said the Syrians indicated that "there had been a change of their position" and that now "they are committed to a genuine peace."
Asked if the Syrians defined "genuine peace," the official said no, but added: "In the past, the Syrian position was that peace is the absence of war. When they start talking about genuine peace they are talking about something other than the absence of war."
Having met with leaders from nine different Arab nations and Israel, Mr. Baker went out of his way today before leaving the Middle East for Moscow to lower expectations for an immediate breakthrough.
"We are dealing with the most intractable problem I think there is, and we ought not to let expectations get out of control," Mr. Baker said. "This is very early in the process of trying to address this problem in the aftermath of the war.
"You have to crawl before you walk, and you have to walk before you run, and we've been at it maybe five or six days. It is a little bit premature to be suggesting that somehow there is no opportunity here because we have not had instant peace. Maybe the wheels will come off tomorrow, but let's give it a chance."
 
On Trading Land for Security
 Mr. Sharaa made no reference to real reconciliation with Israel. He simply said at the news confrence that his Government and the Bush Administration were in full agreement that peace should be based on United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338, which call on Israel to trade land for security and recognition from its Arab neighbors.
Syria also believes that negotiations should be conducted through some type of international conference, in which Mr. Assad would present Syria's demands for a return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and for a Palestinian state.
The entire basis of legitimacy of Mr. Assad's Government -- and the reason it gets economic support from wealthy Arab oil states -- rests on its claim to be the vangaurd not only of Syrian interests but of Palestinian and Arab rights as well. That is something it would be unlikely to squander for the sake of a separate peace with Israel over just the Golan.
The talks with Mr. Baker, Mr. Sharaa said, "will help all of us to work actively for a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question."
"We are optimistic that this opportunity will be utilized in the proper manner," he said. "That's why we will keep contacts and there was agreement on keeping in touch and keeping these contacts in order to give a momentum to the peace process for the months to come."

Baker Arrives in Moscow
 MOSCOW, March 14 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived here today intent on Middle Eastern affairs but no less wary of the minefield of domestic Soviet politics.
Beyond Mr. Baker's meeting Friday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, politicians are watching to see if he meets in any prominent fashion with the Soviet leader's domestic rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, who has called for Mr. Gorbachev's resignation.
More explicit is Mr. Baker's decision to meet separately Saturday with representatives of the three Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. He will also meet with the former Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who resigned from the Government last year.
"We are going to concentrate on the gulf," Foregn Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh said of Mr. Baker's two days of talks here. Disarmament and Soviet economic needs also are expected to be discussed.

Prices on U.S. Securities Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday.
An urge to take profits and a drop in weekly unemployment claims helped to push bond prices down somewhat. But shorter-term notes were stable to up slightly because of the lingering effect of comments on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the central bank might decide to move short-term interest rates lower. 
"People are trying to assess how panicked the Fed really is," one government securities trader said.
Participants said trading was light because some potential accounts were reluctant to establish positions before the release this morning of February producer price data.
 
Fixed-Income Markets
Most Wall Street economists are expecting the figures to be favorable for the fixed-income markets. Largely because of a big drop in energy prices, the consensus forecast is that the producer price index fell by three-tenths of a percentage point last month. The index fell by one-tenth of a percentage point in January.
"One of the things that is supposed to help the marke is the notion that inflation is coming down even if the economy regains some momentum," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a money management firm. "If the data reinforce that sense, the market will be fine. If they don't, that will create problems, especially for bonds."
A report from the Labor Department yesterday showing that initial unemployment claims fell by 34,000 in the week ended March 2, to 474,000, helped to push bond prices down early in the session. As the day progressed, they never really recovered.
 
Treasury's 30-Year Bonds
 Late yesterday, the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 14/32, down 6/32, to yield 8.19 percent, compared with 8.18 percent late Wednesday.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 6/32, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.01 percent. But the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32, to a late price of 99 22/32, to yield 6.92 percent.
Meanwhile, rates on short-term Treasury bills eased slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.76 percent, down two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.77 percent.
Among the new debt issues priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market was a $100 million offering of four-year senior notes by Salomon Inc.
The 9 percent notes, which mature July 1, 1995, were priced at 100, or par, 1.55 percentage points over the prevailing yield on Treaury securities of comparable maturity. The securities are non-callable for life.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues dipped by 1/4 of a point to3/8 of a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bond market, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about 1/8 of a point in quiet trading.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended March 4.
The report had little impact on prices in the credit markets, largely because the $5.8 billion increase in M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was smaller than most analysts had anticipated.

U S. Ruling A Setback For T.W.A.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In a move that could plunge another airline into financial crisis, the Transportation Department gave tentative approval yesterday for the sale of only three of Trans World Airlines' London routes to American Airlines. It turned down the sale of three others.
Carl C. Icahn, T.W.A.'s chairman, promptly denounced the decision, which the Transportation Department said was intended to promote competition in service to London. American Airlines said it was puzzled by the ruling, but declined to comment on what effect it might have on the $515 million price tag American had agreed to pay for routes from six cities in the United States to London. 
 "I believe that the order could well become a disaster for T.W.A.," Mr. Icahn said in a statement. "It is unclear whether the sale to American will be able to be completed, and if the sale is not completed, our financial condition, which is already precarious, will worsen substantially."
T.W.A. had previously said it might seek protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code if the route sale did not go through.
The Transportation Department approved the sale of T.W.A.'s routes to London from New York, Los Angeles and Boston, which it said accounted for a very large percentage of the value of the sale.
The department disapproved the sale of three others, however, saying that it needed to hold new proceedings to select new United States carriers for the London routes from Philadelphia and Baltimore. That move would prevent T.W.A. from realizing any gain from the transfer of those routes.
 
Decision on Sixth Route
 On the sixth route, from St. Louis, the department tentatively concluded that T.W.A. should retain its right to serve the route and be able to sell it to a carrier other than American.
Samuel K. Skinner, the Transportation Secretary, and the staff of the Transportation and State Departments reached an agreement with the British Government on Monday under which United Airlines will take over Pan American World Airways' right to serve London from Heathrow Airport and American will take over T.W.A.'s rights, also operating out of Heathrow. Pan Am is already in Chapter 11, as is Continenal Airlines, another major United States carrier.
Donald J. Carty, an executive vice president of American, said he was pleased that the department had approved the three routes but expressed concern that the department had blocked some of American's planned routes while allowing United to proceed with its purchase of Pan Am's. He emphasized that the Transportation order was preliminary.
 
United's Heathrow Debut Set
 Separately, United announced that it would begin service to Heathrow on April 3 from Kennedy International Airport in New York, Dulles International Airport near Washington and San Francisco International Airport. It said it would fly daily from New York and Washington and five times a week from San Francisco.
United, which paid $290 million for Pan Am's routes, said it would start service to Heathrow from Seattle and several European cities on April 21, from Los Angeles on May 7 and from Newark on May 18.
The share price of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, fell $1.375 yesterday, to $55.875, in New York Stock Exchange trading, while that of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, rose 25 cents, to $146. After the close of trading, underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company priced an offering of 1.5 million UAL shares at $146 each. Pan Am's share price fell 12.5 cents, to $1.125. T.W.A. is privately owned by Mr. Icahn and an employee stock plan.
 
Carrier's Incentive a Concern
 The Transportation Department said that since American would have East Coast gateways from New York, Boston and Miami, it would have little incentive to develop gateways in Philadelphia and Baltimore. The department also said that since American already had service to London from Chicago and Dallas, service from St. Louis "could put it in the position of competing against its Midwest gateway cities."
Mark A. Buckstein, the general counsel of T.W.A., protested that "the disparate treatment to T.W.A., when compared to the favorable treatment afforded to Pan Am, is, to say the least, arbitrary and capricious."
Mr. Buckstein said he was surprised that the department did not intend to allow T.W.A. to keep the Philadelphia and Baltimore routes. Both he and Mr. Carty of American noted that the Philadelphia route now serves Heathrow, but it would presumably be transferred to London's second airport, Gatwick, if a carrier other than American or United were to operate it. British rules allow only two United States carriers to serve Heathrow.

HEADLINE: Critics of New Denver Airport Say Bad Times Demand Halt to Project

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, March 14

 BODY:
Even as workers are preparing to pour the foundations for a new airport here, the first big airfield in the nation in nearly 20 years, bad times have emboldened critics seeking to halt the project.
New projections of reduced air travel around the country, the coming change in the mayor's office and the bankruptcy of Continental Airlines, one of the leading carriers in Denver, all make the financing of the airport much riskier, a bond-rating company said on Wendesday. 
 The company, Standard & Poor's, lowered its rating on the bonds to BBB-, which is the lowest investment-grade rating, just above the high-risk "junk" category. Denver has already sold about $900 million in bonds. In the past month the price of Denver airport bonds has been falling. That means the city will have to pay higher interest rates to investors buying the bonds.
Worried about the added expense, at least one mayoral candidate has called for a two-year moratorium on construction, saying that economic conditions would improve and enable the project to regain a higher bond rating.
 
$470 Million in Contracts
 "Let's step back and take a look at this thing," said the candidate, Don Bain, a Republican seeking to succeed Mayor Federico Pena, who is not seeking re-election.
But city and state officials have already scaled back plans for the airport in an attempt to reassure investors that the project is financially feasible. The officials said they were pleased that the rating had not dipped below an investment level and said that the $2 billion project would not be detered. Contracts totaling more than $470 million have already been awarded at the airport and the figure is expected to reach about $900 million this summer.
"I think the bond rating is good news," said Gov. Roy Romer. "These are investment grades. It could have gone below BBB-."
He said shelving the project now would be a bit like stopping to look at traffic while crossing the street. "You've got to keep going," he said, "or something's going to hit you."
But the Governor added that he would not oppose a short delay in construction, "certainly less than six months," if a savings could be demonstrated.
 
Changing Conditions
 Mayor Pena said the problems that led to the lower rating, like recession and war, would soon change.
"You don't stop an airport project because of events which are short-lived," said Mr. Pena. "You build a new airport because it's important to the future of the city and the state."
Proponents of a new airport note that the city's current airport, Stapleton International, which is the nation's seventh busiest, does not have adequate space to accommodate all its carriers in bad weather.
"Delays at Stapleton cause delays all over," said Carol Luther, manager of marketing for the new airport. "We're gunking up the works for everybody else."
 
Many Suits at Stapleton
 The new airport site, about 10 miles northeast of Stapleton, is on 34,000 acres of wheat fields. Stapleton, which is flanked by residential neighborhoods and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, sits on about 4,700 acres. It has been the target of numerous lawsuits over noise and pollution.
Norm Early, a Democrat who is considered to be the front-runner in the campaign for mayor, has been a steadfest supporter of a new airport.
"Stapleton has become an embarrassment," he said. "Moreover, the new airport site would be away from residential neighborhoods."
Workers have already dug the tunnel for rail service between the terminal and three concourses at the airport. And concrete for the foundation is scheduled to be poured soon.
Airline industry analysts, who noted that the Denver project has suffered from the war, recession and reduced air travel, nonetheless said they did not expect the project to be delayed.
"The new Denver airport was planned and designed when Stapleton was a very constrained airport," said Hans Plickert, an investment banker with the Transportation Group Limited in New York. "Both United and Continental have reduced the number of flights in and out of Denver. So the situation is not quite as tight as it was. That does not change the fact that Denver probably needs a new airport."
 
Closings for Weather
 Bad weather has forced the closing of Stapleton only three times in 60 years. But the airport routinely experiences delays in bad weather because of its limited space. Federal regulations require that planes be spaced more widely in bad weather.
More space for runways at the new airport would mean far fewer delays caused by poor weather, airport officials say.
But supporters of the new airport concede that there have been setbacks.
"We need to be dead honest" said Governor Romer. "Some things have changed that we didn't anticipate," he said, referring to the Continental bankruptcy and the Persian Gulf war. "But you don't back off from what you're doing, you're just more wise about how you proceed."

HEADLINE: Administration Yields on Speeding Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Under pressure from Congress, the Bush Administration has increased the amount of money that it is willing to spend to shore up the management of the nation's unemployment benefit system and has agreed to exclude that money from caps that Federal budget law imposes on discretionary Government spending.
The effect of the Administration's move, which was made public today in a letter from the White House budget director to Congressional leaders, should be to speed passage of legislation intended to shorten delays in the states' processing of benefits to unemployed workers.
 
House Voted $200 Million
 Those delays have steadily increased in recent months as the unemployment rate climbed to its current level of 6.5 percent. State unemployment offices have beeen overwhelmed by a lack of adequate staff, with the result that some laid-off workers have waited as long as six weeks for their first benefit checks. 
 Although the benefits paid to the unemployed come from state funds, the administrative costs of the nation's unemployment system, including staff salaries, are a Federal responsibility. Last week the House of Representatives voted to supplement by $200 million the $1.98 billion that was initially budgeted to cover that responsibility in the current fiscal year.
The new amount, which would pay for additional staff members and other benefit-processing improvements, equaled what the Senate was expected to approve before adjourning for an Easter recess at the end of the month. But it was twice the amount that the Administration had proposed, and the difference was one factor that threatened to stall the legislation.
But in his letter today, Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, moved closer to Congress's figure, saying the Administration now supported spending $150 million instead of the $100 million it had earlier proposed.
He also said the Administration was prepared to designate these funds as "emergency" money, thus removing another disagreement with Congress and another stumbling block to passage.
Under the Federal budget law passed last fall, any increase in discretionary Government spending must be offset by an equal amount in spending cuts or in tax increases unless the President certifies that the new spending is necessary to meet an emergency. Congressional leaders have refused to raise taxes or cut other spending to pay for the unemployment benefits bill, and until today the Administration had refused to designate the shortage of staff at unemployment offices as an emergency.

HEADLINE: In Coal Country, a Home-Grown Clinic

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRETHEL, Ky.

 BODY:
Near the Appalachian village of Harold, Mud Creek divides into Little Mud and Big Mud. From there, Big Mud runs along Route 979, a twisting, shoulderless two-lane road that carries 22-wheel Mack trucks with tarpaulins stretched over immense cargoes of coal. Every square foot of Big Mud's damp banks seems cluttered with trash, like the lungs of many patients at Eula Hall's Mud Creek Clinic, about seven miles along Big Mud.
Mrs. Hall is the founder and de facto boss of the Mud Creek Clinic in the dingy hamlet of Grethel, although her title is simply "social director." A slow-talking, soft-talking woman, she is an example of how a person with modest credentials, modest means and a home-grown vision keeps a distressed community afloat. 
 This is black lung country. And in this remote coal-mining community of junked terrain, junked jobs and junked bodies, Mrs. Hall is a local legend who cuts red tape and badgers bureaucrats. She is social worker, jobs counselor and benefits coordinator for men in their 40's and 50's, many illiterate, who sleep with breathing machines and have heart ailments from straining to breathe and who bring their privation and ailing bodies to the single-story brick command post of one woman's lifelong war on poverty and disease.
Mrs. Hall, 63 years old, is of this soil. She stopped school after completing the eighth grade. Her first husband. whom she divorced and who has since died, was a miner, and her second husband has retired from mining with various ailments. Three of her four sons cannot work because of illnesses and accidents incurred in the mines. She earns $22,000 a year and lives in a cabin that a now-defunct coal company built for miners.
"I was raised poor," Mrs. Hall said, "and I've never gotten above my raisin'."
With the help of charitable contributions and an $800,000 subsidy from the United States Public Health Service, the clinic treats the physical and emotional complaints of about 8,000 patients, handling 50 to 75 a day. The clinic charges patients in line with their incomes. The 53 percent who do not qualify for Medicare or who have incomes below the poverty level but still do not meet Kentucky's standards for Medicaid pay just $5 for a doctor's visit and $4 for a prescription.
The Federal health service supports about 1,500 such clinics for the poor, 60 percent of them in rural areas.
From one room of a trailer behind the clinic, Mrs. Hall also runs the Mud Creek Water District, which she helped organize two decades ago. It pipes potable water to 800 homes, 90 percent of which had contaminated wells when the district was organized in the 1960's. From another room she distributes free food at the end of the month, when people's food stamps run down. From a third room she gives away clothes collected by churches.
Mrs. Hall works from 8 in the morning until 7 or 8 at night, takes no vacations and pays for the gas she uses on her rounds in her four-wheel-drive Chevrolet Suburban, a gift of the Kentucky Department of Human Resources. She ferries medicine, food, clothing and counsel to the housebound and brings them to the clinic, to the hospital and to government offices to apply for health and welfare benefits.
If people reproach her, it is for selflessness in the extreme. "She's a heroic figure," said Dr. Ellen Joyce, who came to Grethel from Watertown, Mass., to spend a decade as the clinic's principal doctor, leaving three years ago when her husband entered law school in Louisville.
 
'Works Till She's Sick'
 "But it's hard to work with a saint sometimes," Dr. Joyce said. "She works till she's sick, which she is, with heart disease and arthritis."
Jim Stewart, executive director of the Big Sandy Health Care Corporation, a nonprofit organization that processes grants for the clinic and manages its accounts and pays its workers, said the staff, however dedicated, drew a line at working Mrs. Hall's hours. "But because of that drive," he said, "people have that clinic. The clinic would not be there if not for her."
Mrs. Hall got the clinic off the ground in 1973 with a private donation of $1,400 and a commitment from two doctors from a nearby hospital to work two days a week. The clinic now has two doctors on the staff of about 10.
Like similar outposts in rural communities and urban ghettos, the Mud Creek clinic lends credence to pressures in Congress to check soaring health care costs and overhaul a national health care system that leaves 30 million to 40 million people uninsured. Mr. Stewart said the clinic's cost has been climbing about 8 percent annually while the Federal subsidy this year is up just 1.5 percent. "Right now our pharmacy is running out of medicine," he said.
Helping men with black lung disease inflates the clinic's costs, both in treating them and in helping them qualify for disability pay. Many tests and procedures are required to prove the presence of this progressive condition in which an accumulation of coal dust ravages the lungs and breathing passages. Miners who can prove that they have the debilitating, sometimes fatal disease, as well as that it incapacitates them and that they contracted it mining coal can tap their former employers, if they can be found, or, if not, the Department of Labor's Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Either way, monthly benefits range from $387.10 for a miner with no dependents to $774.10 for a miner with three or more.
But nationwide, only 4 percent of the applicants last year qualified, compared with a peak of 48 percent in 1979, when standards were looser. And some have to spend years appealing for the benefits after rejections while the disease keeps wearing them down.
"You have to be near dead to get it," Mrs. Hall said.
Among the patients in Mrs. Hall's clinic one day in February was Omery Compton, 59. He worked for several mining companies for about 12 years, then worked for the state as a heavy equipment operator before being laid off. He was back in the mines in 1980 and 1981, despite evidence of black lung, because other jobs were scarce. His lungs forced him to quit.
 
Rejection Despite Findings
 Mr. Compton was first denied black lung benefits in 1973 and said he had been rejected repeatedly at various levels of the Governmet since, despite the positive findings of eight doctors. "I got a breathing machine now," he said. "I take oxygen on it. They want me to sleep with that oxygen, but you can't."
Roy Lawson came in the same day for painkillers. "I started work at 18 in the coal mines, worked in them 21 years," he said. At 51, he has black lung disease, ulcers, has suffered two heart attacks and lost the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand in a mine accident.
"Your lungs work on your walking and at night," Mr. Lawson said. "I couldn't walk 500 foot without resting. I sleep on three pillows. I got a breathing machine."
Thanks to Mrs. Hall, Mr. Lawson said he now gets black lung benefits -- $528 a month -- after a 10-year struggle, plus about $224 in workers' compensation insurance benefits. "Eula's my lawyer," he said.
The clinic also has two mental health workers. One, Don Laferty, explains that after retiring from the mines and being freed of the fear of accidents, men here routinely suffer the same post-traumatic stress disorder that afflicted Vietnam veterans. The clinic provides other services as well, like refuges for physically abused wives, which Mrs. Hall once was.
 
She Learned From Congressman
 People here say Mrs. Hall's forte is cutting red tape and badgering bureaucrats. She learned bureaucracy through her Congressman, Carl D. Perkins, a Democrat, who died in 1984 and was succeeded by his son, Carl C. A legend around here, the elder Mr. Perkins was the father of the first black lung legislation in 1969, and he would go to bat for Mrs. Hall in wresting assistance from Federal agencies.
John Rosenberg, head of the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund in the Floyd County seat of Prestonsburg, about 20 minutes north of Grethel, said many Floyd County people are illiterate and intimidated by officialdom, so Mrs. Hall helps them file and negotiate claims for workers' compensation, black lung disability benefits, food stamps and other forms of aid.
Jim Kelly, the Social Security Administration's director for a five-county district of easternmost Kentucky, said she is at least as competent as the lawyers who come to his office representing clients who are seeking Federal benefits. He said she is able to establish the fact that disabled miners are unemployable and have limited education and skills, which is essential to qualifying for disability aid.
 
Idea Formed in Her Youth
 Mrs. Hall said her efforts to help the poor began in her youth. She was the second child and first daughter of the seven surviving children of L.D. and Nanny Elizabeth Riley. The Rileys lived in Pike County, the turf of the Hatfields and McCoys, without electricity, running water or an automoble. She walked to the nearby grade school but did not go to high school because it was several miles away.
"My daddy was a saw logger and a farmer," she said, cutting trees for timber as well as to make furniture. The family's circumstances made Mrs. Hall realize early the importance of health care.
"I saw mommy almost bleed to death when she had a baby because there was no doctor," she said. "I got typhoid fever as a child. I was 11. All of my hair come out from the high temperature. I had a little brother and sister. I always worried because there was no doctor to take them to. My dream from the time I was a child was a health facility where nobody would be turned away."
 
Married at the Age of 17
 At 17, she married a miner. "He brutalized her," Dr. Joyce said. Mrs. Hall divorced him after 33 years and married Oliver Hall, a retired miner who has heart and lung ailments.
Mrs. Hall's small house became her clinic after the first year when it outgrew the original site. She and her husband and her five children moved into a trailer. An arsonist looking for drugs burned the clinic in 1982.
Mrs. Hall's response has become Floyd County folklore. Patients and a doctor, unaware of the fire, arrived the next morning. Mrs. Hall and a doctor set up shop on a picnic table, under a willow tree. They needed a telephone to order prescriptions, so Mrs. Hall called the telephone company and asked for a phone on the tree. Dr. Joyce told the rest of the story this way:
" 'We don't put phones on trees,' they told Mrs. Hall. 'You put them on poles at coal mines,' Mrs. Hall told them. 'You can put a phone on a tree. I got to stay in contact with these people.' She got the phone."
They worked that way for three days. Since school was out for the summer, the school board let her move the clinic into the elementary school. Then the State Department of Health and Human Services bought a second-hand trailer for her, the one that is now the water district office.
 
$400,000 for a New Clinic
 To build a new clinic, she needed $400,000. The Appalachian Regional Commission, a Federal development agency, agreed to put up $320,000 if she raised $80,000. With quilt raffles, radiothons and reaching for donors far beyond Kentucky, she raised $120,000. The new clinic opened in late 1984.
Now that clinic, too, is overtaxed, and so is Mrs. Hall, who has clients parked in her tiny office, with books for children on one wall, waiting to see her for help with their foods stamps, Medicaid, or other government benefits.
Their waits can stretch for hours, particularly when Mrs. Hall gets a call from someone sick or an abused woman, and she darts off to her car. "But they'll wait on me," Mrs. Hall said. Except for emergencies, she said, "They know I don't want to put anybody in front of anybody."

HEADLINE: West Plans 50% Write-Off of Polish Debt

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 14

 BODY:
Polish and French officials said today that Western governments would announce on Friday the write-off of a large portion of Poland's $33 billion in official debt in a move aimed at helping Poland's transition to a market economy.
Western officials said around 50 percent of Poland's debt would be forgiven. That is less than the 80 percent write-off Poland had requested, but would still represent one of the largest write-offs that creditor nations have ever allowed a debtor country. 
 Officials from the United States, Canada, Japan and numerous European creditor nations, in a group known as the Paris Club, were meeting today in Paris with Polish officials to make final the details on a debt-reduction package. In recent days, Western officials have said the Paris Club should give Poland more favorable treatment than many other debtor nations because it has been much more courageous in taking painful steps to reform its economy.
The United States has been pressing other nations to forgive almost the whole 80 percent Poland has requested, but Japan, France and Germany have argued for a lower percentage of forgiveness.
Officials said the Paris Club agreement would allow creditor nations several options in reducing Poland's debt burden.
Poland also owes $10.9 billion to commercial banks, and its commercial creditors, led by Barclays Bank, were also in Paris today to discuss whether and to what extent they should lighten Poland's debt load.
Polish officials said the nation's oppressive debt burden was hurting living standards by making it hard to import needed goods at a time when the nation's dismal living standards were being further traumatized by the move to a market economy.
Reuters reported today that Poland had approved a proposed three-year agreement with the International Monetary Fund that is needed to clear the way for the Paris Club write-off. Under the accord, which the IMF will now review for final approval, Poland may receive more than $2 billion over the next three years.
