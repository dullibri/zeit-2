To the Editor:
 Re "Top U.S. Officials Press Case Linking Iraq to Al Qaeda" (front page, Feb. 12): 
 It is now 17 months since the attack on the World Trade Center. 
In that time, we have managed to beat a third-world country into submission and capture or kill relatively low-level Qaeda operatives.
Osama bin Laden and most of his lieutenants remain at large. Only one person accused of connection to the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks has been captured.
We are now at a "high" level of terrorism alert and are being warned about likely biological or chemical attacks. 
And our government focuses on Iraq. 
Now, to continue the pressure on Iraq, we are being bombarded with daily "evidence" of the supposed link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. 
At what point will the American public realize that we are being led into a war that will only worsen terrorism -- one against a country that poses no imminent threat to the United States and, at worst, a weak, long-term one?
Yes, Saddam Hussein is evil. But let us focus our energies on the problems that we actually face: a very real Qaeda threat and an economy that is weak and for which the Bush administration has no credible plans.

HEADLINE: ON STAGE AND OFF 

BYLINE:  By Jesse McKinley 

 BODY:
Big Things Ahead For Lincoln Center
"The Coast of Utopia," Tom Stoppard's nine-hour, three-part epic of love and revolution in 19th-century Russia, is coming to the shores of Lincoln Center Theater along with a series of other ambitious projects, including a new/old Stephen Sondheim musical and a mysterious Martha Clarke piece.
 "Utopia" had its world premiere last fall at the Royal National Theater in London and is to arrive at the Vivian Beaumont Theater with a new director, Jack O'Brien, and a new designer, Bob Crowley, both of whom worked on Mr. Stoppard's "Invention of Love" on Broadway last season. One catch: it won't be here until the spring of 2005. 
 Before then, Mr. Stoppard is expected to be working on the plays, doing some cutting and addressing some issues raised by the London critics, including the play's sometimes lagging momentum. Another part of the long wait has to do with the sheer breadth of the project, which will require a cast of 30 adult actors and a small gaggle of children, with a budget that Andre Bishop, the theater's artistic director, estimates as "lots."
"I dread to think," Mr. Bishop said. "But the Beaumont was really built for these types of shows."
Well, not yet. The theater is undergoing a renovation that will keep it dark until the fall production of "Henry IV," Parts I and II, starring Kevin Kline, Richard Easton and Billy Crudup and directed by none other than Mr. O'Brien. That Shakespeare is to be followed by more Shakespeare and an attempt by one of the great actors of the day to put his stamp on one of the great parts of all time. Christopher Plummer is to play Lear, in a reprise of his performance last year at the Stratford Festival in Ontario. Mr. Plummer, 75, heads the cast from that production at the Beaumont, beginning next February.
Beyond that the schedule for summer 2004 is murkier, but two major projects are moving ahead. The first is "The Frogs," a reimagining of Mr. Sondheim's 1974 farce musical about Dionysos, the Greek god of partying and the theater, heading into Hades to dig up the greatest playwright of all time to resurrect the world theater scene.
The musical's book, by Burt Shevelove, riffing on the ancient text by Aristophanes, has been adapted by Nathan Lane, who is expected to star; Mr. Sondheim is writing new songs as well. Susan Stroman, who did a little show with Mr. Lane called "The Producers," will direct. Early indications, from a private reading last month, are very good. Schedules, however, are tight, and Mr. Lane's new television show, yet to be broadcast, might complicate things further.
The other possibility is an untitled project being cooked up in the basement rehearsal rooms at the theater by the choreographer Martha Clarke. It is based on the life and women of Toulouse-Lautrec and uses 19th-century music and a new text by Charles M. Mee. Beyond that, "I don't know what it all is yet," Mr. Bishop said, "but it seems wonderful to me." The best bet is probably "The Frogs," for a few reasons: 1) the subject matter that includes Shakespeare, which fits nicely with "Henry IV" and "King Lear"; 2) it seems further along; 3) it's by the "Producers" people and Mr. Sondheim. (Duh.)
Which, especially in times of economic trials and budgetary woes, could bring a welcome boost at the box office for a theater with big plans ahead. "It hasn't really affected us yet," Mr. Bishop said of the economic bad times. "But that doesn't mean it won't."

Off Broadway Closings
Two quirky and long-running Off Broadway shows will close in May, instantly putting dozens of flying acrobats and boisterous Italian-American actors out of work.
The first to go is "De La Guarda," which will shutter on May 4 after nearly five years at the Daryl Roth Theater on Union Square. The show, which was developed in Argentina and featured 15 sopping wet bungie cord aerialists, turned a nice profit but was eventually done in by rising operating costs.
Also saying ciao is a show that many people thought would never close, and one that does so only after becoming the second-longest-running show in Off Broadway history, topped only by the 42-year run of "The Fantastiks." It is "Tony and Tina's Wedding," the interactive comedy that opened in February 1988 outside, and later inside, a church on Christopher Street. It later moved to a church on West 46th Street, where it will walk down the aisle for a finaltime on May 18. Produced by Joe and Dan Corcoran, the show, with a cast of 32 actors portraying a gang of rowdy wedding guests, recouped its original investment in 10 months and has been in the black pretty much ever since.

Back to Bleecker Street
Without being too indelicate, Denny Doherty is the only Papa left. John Phillips, one of Mr. Doherty's band mates in the 1960's folk rock band the Mamas and the Papas, died in 2001. Mama Cass died in 1974. Only Mr. Doherty and Michelle Phillips, Mr. Phillips's ex-wife, survive.
But the stories about the band -- full of sex, drugs and folk rock 'n' roll -- are a whole other issue. "It was a soap opera, man," said the jovial Mr. Doherty. "It was 'All My Children' goes to 'General Hospital.' "
Starting March 14, those stories and songs will be recalled by Mr. Doherty and a six-member band in "California Dreamin,' " a musical described as a "multimedia production utilizing state-of-the-art projection technology." (Trippy.)
Written and narrated by Mr. Doherty, "Dreamin' " will play the Village Theater on Bleecker Street. "Forty years later I'm going to be back on the street I started on," Mr. Doherty said. "Talkin' to all those ghosts walking by."

Must Be in the Genes
Jared Harris, the son of the late British actor Richard Harris, will take the title role in the American premiere of "Humble Boy," opening at the Manhattan Theater Club in May.
The play, which was a hit at the National Theater in London and follows the story of a Hamletesque physicist dealing with mother issues, will also star Blair Brown, as said mother. John Caird will direct.

HEADLINE: Sega to Merge With a Mainstay of Japanese Arcades 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The Sega Corporation, the video game maker, said today that it would merge with Sammy, a leading manufacturer of pachinko machines. Pachinko, a vertical cousin of pinball, is played in arcades in Japan for prizes, much the way Americans may play slots or poker machines where they are legal. The terms of the merger have not yet been set.
 The deal, to take effect Oct. 1, ends years of speculation about the future direction of one of the oldest names in the game software industry. Sega, which also reduced its profit forecast for the current year by 90 percent, has struggled to compete with Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, all of which make high-powered video game consoles as well as game software; Sega dropped out of the console-making business in 2001. 
 Microsoft has been looking for partners to make software for its X-Box console and was thought to be interested in an alliance with Sega.
By combining forces with Sammy, though, Sega hopes to concentrate on software for arcade games. Most pachinko machines now incorporate computer chips to determine scores and winnings for each game. The deal also gives Sammy a route to expand beyond the pachinko industry, once thought to be recession-proof, where total revenue has slipped by 10 percent since 1995.
Though Sega is better known internationally and has a market capitalization about 20 percent greater than Sammy's, Sega will take a back seat to Sammy in the combined company. Hajime Satomi, Sammy's president, will lead the combined company, which would have sales of about 371 billion yen ($3.1 billion) and 1,750 employees if it existed today.
The companies hope to "make full use of our synergies developing technology in the amusement and consumer arenas, and combining Sammy's rapid growth with Sega's brand name," Mr. Satomi said in a statement. Sammy's sales have tripled over the last three years, while Sega's have fallen 40 percent. 
Sega has posted losses for the last five years, and today sharply lowered its sights for the current year, which ends March 31. The company now expects a profit of just 500 million yen ($4.1 million) -- it had previously forecast earning 10 times that. It also trimmed its sales forecast by 2.5 percent.
Sega was an early pioneer in the home video industry, but it ran into trouble in the mid-1990's after Sony introduced its PlayStation console.
Sony built on the success of the PlayStation 2, selling 50 million of them so far, and Nintendo did well with its GameBoy and GameCube. In response, Sega spent heavily to develop and produce the DreamCast console and to expand its amusement operations. But the DreamCast did not take off the way PlayStation did, and the company found itself saddled with nearly $3 billion in debt. It started selling or discarding operations to cut losses and raise cash, including shutting down DreamCast production in 2001. 
Sega managed to cut its debts, but sales plunged, and DreamCast owners were left without any new games for their consoles. Sega still produces popular game software like the Sonic the Hedgehog line, but it must now compete head-on with stronger players like Konami and Square.
"Once they abandoned their game platform, they became a video game producer like everyone else," said Ortwin Gierhake, an analyst at West LB Securities in Tokyo. "They are getting killed by Sony and Nintendo."
Two of Sega's rivals also made headlines today. Square, which is 19 percent owned by Sony, said shareholders had accepted a takeover bid from Enix, another game maker. And the largest of Japan's game publishers, Konami, reported 8.1 billion yen ($67 million) in profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31, largely because of strong sales of Yu-Gi-Oh game cards in the United States.

HEADLINE: MY BROOKLYN; 
Racing Upscale At Full Throttle

BYLINE:  By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
I don't remember exactly when I realized that my neighborhood had arrived, but I think it was sometime between the opening of the Japanese tapas bar and the European-style pressed sandwich cafe, a few doors down.
 In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Fifth Avenue has long been the poorer, grittier cousin to Seventh Avenue, the area's main dining and shopping street, which has bustled and thrived for years. Thrive, however, is not a word that's been widely associated with Fifth Avenue, at least until now. 
 I moved to the neighborhood just over three years ago, having traded a cramped Chelsea studio for a spacious flat in a gracious brownstone, complete with lush private garden and, incredibly, my own pear tree. 
At that time (it seems like ancient history now), Fifth Avenue was a rather dingy and sorry affair. Save for a couple of decent watering holes and a few old-neighborhood Italian restaurants that made the area livable, the strip was mostly a string of forlorn storefronts lurking behind shuttered metal gates, some covered in graffiti dating back to the Lindsay administration. 
Still, the place had a kick, a punch and a spirit that instinctively drew me to it. 
Having lived in Latin America for years, I loved the avenue's decidedly Hispanic flavor, from the Mexican greengrocer to the Dominican bodegas and botanicas to the pale pink facade of the Iglesia Pentecostal de Jesus Cristo Inc., whose worshipers' voices fill the air on Sunday afternoons with choruses of "Aleluya!" that rise above the twanging electric guitars and shaking tambourines of what could be described as Latin gospel.
All of those places, and much of the ethnic flavor of the avenue, remain intact. But economic pressures being what they are, and with housing prices heading ever skyward despite hard times, change was inevitable, I suppose, and gentrification was just a mocha latte away.
What astonished me, though, was the lightning speed of the transformation. The upscale home accessory boutiques, the designer jewelry stores, the high-end beer emporium, the pretty French restaurants -- they all appeared almost overnight. In 20 years of living in New York, I had never seen any place gentrify quite so quickly.
For the most part, the long-anticipated renovation of this stretch of Fifth Avenue has not brought about an unrecognizable alteration of the neighborhood, even though at least 25 new businesses have opened their doors between Sterling Place and Seventh Street in the last year. There's been no instant importation of corporate cookie chains, no fast-food franchises. 
There isn't even a Starbucks. That, as they say, is so Seventh Avenue. 
Instead, I would guess that 90 percent of the shops, bars and cafes along Fifth are owned and operated by people who live right in Park Slope. Apparently, like England, this is a small nation of shopkeepers. When you walk through the door, their smiles are genuine because they really are happy to see you.
"There's been extraordinary change, and it's been a huge challenge for us," said Brad Lander, executive director of the 26-year-old Fifth Avenue Committee, whose "Displacement-Free Zone" program is meant to help working-class people stay in the neighborhood. "Much of this area was abandoned to widespread blight and drug dealing." 
So all these new businesses are definite improvements, right?
Yes, Mr. Lander agreed, but only for those who can still afford to live here. "Back then, they certainly didn't have any of the stores catering to yuppies," he said. "Now, you can't swing a cat without hitting one."
I've never seen anyone swing a cat around here, but I have noticed a lot of new, young, mostly white faces appearing in my neighborhood, which still mixes a healthy down-home cocktail of races, religions and, with its sizable gay and lesbian population, sexual orientations. Many peopleare cool here, but nobody is fabulous.

Out on the Avenue
On weekends, the avenue comes alive with activity. It's an odd mix of local homeboys hanging on corners, young couples strolling with fresh-scrubbed toddlers, singles out to carouse, and enterprising chowhounds emerging from the Manhattan subway, here to sample some of the fledgling fare and nascent night life that's popping up along my little stretch of the avenue.
This weekend, love-struck Valentine couples out for a romantic evening will find many suitable spots for mutual eye-gazing and cocktail-glass clinking. The brand-new Gowanus Lounge is a good place to start, with its airy, modern corner bar up front and lounge that's like an opium den in the rear. With plush banquettes and muted lighting, it is quite elegant, for Park Slope.
Loki is another softly lighted spot with a great sound system, pool table and turn-of-the-century appointments. It attracts a stylish young crowd. Other fine places to bend some elbows with the locals include the Gate, with a rotating list chosen from 40 beers, mostly from Europe, and a very friendly pet policy; Bar Reis, with a downstairs lounge, backyard and karaoke night; Great Lakes, which has live rock music Sundays and Mondays; Ginger's, which is more lesbian than gay; and Excelsior, more gay than lesbian.
Park Slope even has its own bona fide, Manhattan-style rock club and dimly lighted, very spacious and comfortable cocktail lounge, known as Southpaw, which opened this fall. Recent acts have included Mooney Suzuki and the Black Kings.
For great coffee and tea, nothing around here beats Ozzie's, the anti-Starbucks. A neighborhood institution since 1999, it has poetry readings, book clubs, political discussion groups and other offerings to a predominantly left-of-center community.

A New Restaurant Row
One of the newest and most exciting culinary arrivals is surely Nana, opened on Dec. 26 by Eric Ong. Its mango- and lime-green-colored tiles behind the open kitchen provide a striking setting for the triumvirate of Thai, Malaysian and Japanese cuisines (with a separate chef for each) on the innovative and reasonably priced menu. The salmon tartare, with spicy pine nut garlic sauce and a raw quail egg on top, is, like Paris, something that's not to be missed before you die.
Nana will compete somewhat with Long Tan, a local favorite Pan-Asian bar and grill. Opened in the summer of 2001, it's one of the oldest newcomers on the street. Long Tan is terrific for its lively bar and live D.J. on Friday and Saturday nights, late-night dinners of delicious affordable food, a hip-but-not-trendy ambience and the best mojitos this side of Havana. It might seem odd that an Asian restaurant would serve Caribbean cocktails. But when you consider that the founders, Rory Dwyer and Jamie Webb, are from Ireland and Australia, respectively (yes, they have kangaroo on the menu), it all starts to make sense. (Mr. Dwyer bought out Mr. Webb two weeks ago.)
Across the street is Tamari, the Japanese tapas and sake bar. It was opened last May by Ken Kikuchi, who immigrated to Bedford-Stuyvesant from Yokohama via, of all places, Madrid (hence the combination). Japanese tapas, here at least, are small, reasonably priced treasures served in a tranquil, clean, cozy environment. In addition to 25 sakes, Tamari always has great specials. A recent example: sardine tempura with apple-mango salad and Indian spices.
Cocotte, which opened in September under the loving stewardship of Christine and William Snell, who live in Park Slope, is my favorite restaurant on the avenue.
Ms. Snell, who is from Brittany, calls the menu "French coastal comfort food," which means lots of shellfish and cream, with yummy accouterments like leeks, lardons and potatoes. Diet food it is not, but it is warm, wonderful and delicious. Besides, the romantic wood-paneled room will make you forget about calories.
The street has three Italian restaurants in a cluster. There is the venerable and pricey Cucina, with its authentic Tuscan cuisine, elegant minimalist decor and doting service. It's been around since the Middle Ages, otherwise known as 1988. Nearby is Al di La, a tin-ceilinged corner trattoria opened in November 1998 by Anna Klinger and her husband, Emiliano Coppa, who live nearby. They serve tasty home-cooked Venetian fare in a lively atmosphere. Across the street is a beloved old war horse, Aunt Suzie's, which has been cooking up vast pots of tangy marinara and southern-Italian-style pasta since 1987.
Another Italian place, Trattoria Mulino, just opened in October. Luis Mulina, one of the owners, came to New York from Ecuador in 1986 and worked his way up from dishwasher through a number of Italian restaurants in the city. He is also a co-owner of Los Pollitos across the street, which has delicious fresh tacos and roast chicken to go or to eat in.
Chip Shop and Curry Shop are at Sixth Street. (The two are connected inside.) Chip Shop fries up crisp, battered cod and haddock, bakes a mean steak-and-onion pie and actually makes Yorkshire pudding. Try it with beef and Old Speckled Hen stew (named for a British ale). The owners, Christopher and Victoria Sell (he is from Rugby, England), live around the corner. Walk into Curry Shop, with its pungent, enticing smells, and you're transported straight to London. "I wanted to go against the notion that English food was awful," Mr. Sell said. He's succeeding.
The food doesn't stop there. Beso has nouvelle Latin American food; 200 Fifth is great for burgers, pasta and bar fare, and it has a new music and sports television club next door, with live salsa and jazz. Sweet Mama's Griddle just opened as part of the Rising Cafe, for delicious Southern food accompanied by live folk, jazz and bluegrass; Bonnie's Grill griddles American home cooking in a cozy setting.
Blue Ribbon, part of a Manhattan chain, packs them in for outstandingly fresh oysters and eclectic dining in a fraternal atmosphere; Blue Ribbon Sushi just opened next door. Press 195 presses European-style hot sandwiches using freshly roasted meats and Hudson Valley foodstuffs, topped by a good wine list. Coco Roco, an old standby, still makes colorful, tangy Peruvian food in a lively and decidedly South American atmosphere.
I left town for less than two weeks in January, and by the time I got back, there was another new arrival: Moutarde, a surprisingly reasonable old-style French bistro that prides itself on a selection of flavored mustards.

Our Own Fifth Avenue
For weekend window shopping, or maybe for a little last-minute Valentine's indulgence, I can't think of a better Brooklyn thoroughfare than Fifth. And what better place to start than Diana Kane, a store that opened in August, selling only jewelry and lingerie?
The boutique is owned by Diana English (Kane is her maiden name), a jewelry designer who keeps a studio in the back while opening the front to sell her own intricate earrings, necklaces and bracelets, made from sterling silver and high-quality crystal. So what's with the high-end lingerie? "I couldn't find any nice underwear out here," said Ms. English, who lives nearby.
Otherplaces for clothes and accessories include Eidolon, a cooperative boutique owned by three designers. "It's very much a labor of love around here," said Andrea Fisher, who designs and sells blouses and dresses. Amara Felice makes wallets, clutches and crocheted hats, while Yukie Ohta turns out Ultrasuede handbags.
There's also the brand-new Serene Rose, a lovely, homey place painted pale yellow and owned by Hermian Charles and Gilbert Midonnet, who are husband and wife. It features locally designed clothing and accessories, as well as artwork ("as local as possible," Mr. Midonnet said). Albert & Piccolo combines clothing with collectibles and local artwork.
For custom-designed women's fashions and gifts, there's Kimera (selling in-stock and made-to-order items). For vintage clothing, accessories and collectibles, you can try Bopkat, Beacon's Closet, Reverse Vintage (also a bookstore) or Somethin' Else, run by Suzanne Tully, whose husband, Anthony Roman, operates the record section downstairs.
"It's stuff that needs to be out there but isn't available in bigger record stores," Mr. Roman said. "We didn't want a Seventh Avenue-style store. Fifth is more our speed, and this is more our kind of store. We like it a little grittier and edgier."
Children's clothing and toys can be found at the new Bumblez; Lulu's Cuts and Toys, which is also a children's hair salon; and at the very cute Go Fish. 
For gifts and housewares, the number of tiny outlets selling highly eclectic, artistic items not found in other stores seems to increase by the week. One of the newest is Extraordinary, which manages to live up to its name. It's a narrow, modern-looking shop with shelves laden with housewares, all unusual and handmade, with a decidedly Asian flair. 
Su Casa, a delightfully outfitted home shop owned by Amanda Nelson, a Park Slope native, carries linens, bathroom accessories, towels, shower curtains, rugs, mirrors and skin products.
Cog & Pearl sells so many different things, it's hard to pin down what kind of store it is. "We have highly unusual items," said Kristin Overson, a co-owner, in the understatement of the avenue. The cards, gifts, jewelry and other wares are all beautiful, and "as local as we could find them," she said.
Across the street is Patrias, owned by Paulina Perez Bemporad, whose family is from Colombia. The store, a small, sparkling jewel box filled with sequins and colored tin, carries handmade folk art from Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Haiti, El Salvador and, of course, Colombia. Right next door is Brooklyn Frameworks, which specializes in old images from around the borough, as well as many nice prints and lithographs.
Other great cards and gifts can be found at Bob & Judi's Coolectibles, one of my favorite places in Brooklyn; Nancy Nancy, with amusing tchotchkes like sequined tiaras and space-alien salt shakers; and Scaredy Kat, which also has gifts for babies.
And barely two weeks ago, on Feb. 1, Donna Regii moved her Slang Betty clothing and accessories boutique down here after six years just off Seventh Avenue. 

Fresh Provisions at Hand
If you want to grab a little something to nibble or sip to take home to your sweetheart, who is probably wisely staying warm by the fire, there are any number of gourmet stores.
For wine, Darrin Siegfried, a helpful connoisseur, stocks his Red White & Bubbly with a wide selection of worldwide vintages.
Pollio (established 1930) and A. S. Pork Store are throwbacks to the time when this neighborhood was settled by Italian immigrant families. Panorama Fine Foods, owned by Pat Ciesla and Sammy Boudina, is small but very European in its outlook and quality. The Fifth Avenue Bageltique Cafe has been there seemingly forever.
Finally, last year Daphne and Richard Scholz opened Bierkraft, where they offer one of the biggest and finest selections of top-end food and beer in the borough. They like to buy from small producers and also offer exquisite oils, breads and fresh and deli meats. With the store's more than 600 kinds of beer and 200 types of cheese, the discerning palates of Park Slope will not go unsatisfied. Also, the owners are my next-door neighbors.

HEADLINE: South Korea Has Big Plans For the Area Around Seoul 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: INCHON, South Korea, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
The sprawling urban region around South Korea's capital is determined to plunge ahead with ambitious plans to make itself a business hub for the Pacific Rim -- never mind that the tense and heavily militarized border with North Korea is just a long-range artillery shot away.
 "Seoul can become the financial center of Northeast Asia," said Lee Myung Bak, the former chairman of a construction company who was elected mayor of Seoul last year. "That means more than making policies and preparing tasks. We have to compete with China and Hong Kong." 
Along with the mayor of the port of Inchon, 30 miles from Seoul, and the governor of Kyonggi Province, Mr. Lee laid out a vision of glory for a gathering of foreign officials and business executives at the new Inchon International Airport last week, seemingly oblivious to the mounting international tensions over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and the possibility of military conflict between the North and the United States.
Even South Korea's president-elect, Roh Moo Hyun, stuck to much the same script, making only a brief allusion to the situation at the end of the meeting when he said with a smile, "At any rate, I am going to prevent war on this peninsula."
Some foreigners have trouble feeling so sanguine. Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, switched its long-term outlook for South Korea from positive to negative this week. 
Thomas Byrne, Moody's vice president for sovereign risk, said South Korea was still creditworthy, with an A3 rating, but that the uncertainties of the political situation were offsetting the progress the country had made recovering from the financial crisis of 1997. "The outlook change was the sharpest we could make," he said.
As for the dreams of turning Seoul and Inchon into an international hub to rival Hong Kong or Singapore, Mr. Byrne said the plans were "not totally unrealistic, but you need a system with low political risk -- you have to have a resolution of the North Korean crisis."
Other Western analysts echoed that view. "The nuclear standoff with North Korea is costing South Korea plenty," said David Roddy, who edits a newsletter on South Korean finance. He said that at least $56 billion in market capitalization had been erased from Korean companies since early December as stock prices have fallen. "If the nuclear crisis continues," Mr. Roddy said, "it could sabotage some of the significant gains that the Korean economy has made." 
Such concerns do not feature in the excited discussions about the plan among local South Korean leaders, who tend to brush the confrontation with the North aside as a transitory problem. Neither is much said about gathering signs that the economy is slowing down, like the recent Bank of Korea survey that found business confidence at a two-year low.
For Mr. Roh, turning the Seoul-Inchon metropolis into a regional center is as high on his agenda as restructuring the economy or, for that matter, dealing with North Korea. Speaking at the airport gathering, he warned officials of the government he would soon lead that he wants action on the plan. "If they don't do something, there will be trouble," he said. "I will make sure all the ministries will have positive thoughts."
If the promoters of the idea seemed to be whistling past a nuclear graveyard, South Korea's economy has confounded skeptics before, rising rapidly from the ashes of the Korean War, developing companies like Hyundai Motor and Samsung Electronics that can compete globally, springing back from the abyss of the 1997-98 financial meltdown and making much quicker progress in dealing with a huge overhang of bad debts in its banking system than Japan.
"We have great potential," Mr. Roh told foreign executives here. "We have made everything possible. We have readied ourself for the new era, so please don't worry about investing in Korea."
In their presentation, the mayors and the governor noted that the Seoul-Inchon metropolis is home to 24 million people, half the country's population, and that it is situated between Japan and China, the Russian Far East and Taiwan. To capitalize, the planners want to expand the new airport, build a huge new seaport, and reclaim mud flats to provide new sites for commercial development.
"Seoul and Inchon as a metropolitan city will be a beachhead for international companies to make their way into China and Northeast Asia," said Ahn Sang Soo, the mayor of Inchon. Though China is emerging as a rival as well as a customer for South Korea, said Song Hak Kyu, the governor of Kyonggi Province, "we are looking forward to infinite competition." 
Lee Soo Young, chairman of the Inchon Chamber of Commerce, said Seoul's great opportunity was to become the Hong Kong for northern China. "In order to win in Northeast Asia, we have to recognize that China is becoming the manufacturing center of the world," he said. By expanding the port and completing a rail link between South and North Korea, he said, the country could become the shipment point for Chinese goods bound for the rest of the region, and perhaps, by way of the Trans-Siberian Railway, even Europe.

HEADLINE: More Children In New York Are Homeless, Report Finds 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The number of homeless children in New York City has increased sharply over the last decade. Even with the boom economy of the late 1990's, the percentage of children living in poverty rose, and more than half a million children in the city are now impoverished.
 But the lives of children in the city have improved in a few areas where the government has invested money and resources: the infant mortality rate has fallen, teenage pregnancy has dropped, and fewer children have been placed in foster care now that the city works harder to keep families together. 
 Those are some of the findings of "Keeping Track of New York City's Children," a 291-page compendium of facts and figures that was released yesterday by the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, a nonprofit group.
The report offers an encyclopedic look at the city's nearly two million children and pays special attention to the wide disparities among children based on their race, ethnicity and where they live. Although the report is updated every two years, elected officials and advocates said that the one issued yesterday should be seen as a plea for more resources at a time when both the city and the state are cutting services to balance their budgets.
The report notes that African-Americans have higher infant mortality rates than any other racial group: 11.1 deaths per 1,000 births. Nearly 9 percent of African-American mothers receive inadequate or no prenatal care. Nearly 40 percent of Hispanic children are now born into families living below the poverty level, more than half of all teenage mothers are Hispanic, and more than a quarter of all Hispanic students drop out of high school.
Nearly a quarter of Asian children are born below the poverty level. 
Gail B. Nayowith, the executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, said the report showed what government could do when it applied itself to specific problems.
She pointed to two areas: the infant mortality rate, which fell 42 percent in the 1990's, and the percentage of teenage mothers, which dropped 15 percent. "This shows that targeted investments can improve the well-being of children," she said. But she also said the report showed how much need remains, especially with rising unemployment and a dearth of low-income housing. 
The release of the report came as many social service providers are gearing up for what promises to be a nasty budget fight in the coming months. Although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's preliminary budget plan for the next fiscal year seeks to preserve many services, it relies on more than $2 billion in help from the state that may not materialize. 
If it does not, severe cuts will have to be considered, officials agree. 
Speaker Gifford Miller of the City Council presided over the City Hall news conference at which the report was released, and called for restoring money that would be cut from state aid to city schools. Councilwoman Margarita Lopez of Manhattan said that some of the figures in the report made her want to cry. And Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn said that the report showed that the city should restore planned cuts to preventive services.

HEADLINE: Despite Quarter Loss, A.I.G. Chief Sees Big Profits This Year 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Maurice R. Greenberg, the long-time chief executive of the American International Group, shrugged off a fourth-quarter loss yesterday brought on by a huge one-time increase in reserves and said his company was well on its way to big profits this year.
 Mr. Greenberg said that with prices soaring, premiums in A.I.G.'s biggest commercial property unit jumped 50 percent in January. After expenses, he said, the company's property casualty businesses netted $1 billion in cash in the first month, almost as much as in the entire first quarter last year. 
 "We're off to a tremendous start," Mr. Greenberg told analysts and investors in a conference call. "We do not see any letup yet in the pricing environment. We believe it will continue for some time."
The company's stock jumped more than 3 percent yesterday, to $47.97. It is still down drastically from its high of about $100 two years ago, but has recovered somewhat from a sharp decline last week in reaction to the announcement of a $3.5 billion increase in reserves for unexpected liability claims.
Analysts said they expected the stock to continue to suffer along with the markets and the economy, but they said that once the economy began to recover it was likely to do well.
"Their capitalization is extremely strong and they are able to take advantage of opportunities that others can't," said Ira L. Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities in Fairfield, Conn. "A.I.G. is also poised to take advantage of the troubles that a lot of big European insurers are having."
In a move that analysts said contributed to the jump in the stock price, Mr. Greenberg veered from his usual refusal to project results for the coming year and said he expected the company to earn $3.78 to $3.92 a share in 2003, higher than analysts' consensus of $3.75. But Alice Schroeder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, noted in a report to investors that the estimate was based on the important caveats that there would be no major political or economic shocks and no more than the usual run of natural catastrophes.
"These are caveats that could swing the dial significantly," she said.
The company reported a loss of $103.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 as a result of a net charge of $1.8 billion for increased reserves -- after taxes and reimbursements by other insurers known as reinsurers. That compares with profit of $1.87 billion for the 2001 quarter.
Even with the losing quarter, however, A.I.G. managed to earn $5.5 billion for the year, up 2.9 percent from 2001. "When you look at all the charges, we earned more money than any other financial-insurance company in the world, with the exception of Citigroup, and they're no longer in the insurance business," Mr. Greenberg said.
In a far-ranging discussion for over an hour with the analysts and investors, Mr. Greenberg said "an epidemic of lawsuits" led to the big increase in reserves for coverage sold from 1997 to 2001 and he said A.I.G. and other insurers were mounting a major campaign for changes in the legal system. "Most members of Congress recognize that change has to take place," he said. "It's inevitable. Not just at the federal level, but a lot is going on at the state level."
Mr. Greenberg led the successful effort to get the government to pay most of the costs in a major terrorist attack. That legislation required all commercial insurers to begin offering terrorism coverage. But such coverage remains extremely expensive, and Mr. Greenberg said few customers were buying it. 
"The only ones taking it up," he said, are owners of "high-profile properties." Examples, he said, were stadiums, big office buildings and any prominent structure that might be regarded as "a trophy building."
Mr. Greenberg has been predicting a short, swift war with Iraq. "Once the war is over," he said, "I think the economy will benefit psychologically."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Down Again, but Deep Early Losses Are Trimmed

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for the third consecutive session yesterday, as Wall Street's anxiety over war and terrorism deepened with the arrests of three people at airports in Britain. 
 Late-day bargain hunting lifted the Dow Jones industrial average from a deficit of 129 points. But the major indexes still finished with losses, an expected outcome amid the selling that has dominated Wall Street for weeks. 
 "War worries continue to be the overwhelming deterrent for investors," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president at Fahnestock & Company. 
The Dow closed down 8.30 points, or 0.1 percent, at 7,749.87. The blue chips dropped 161.94 in the previous two days. Yesterday's decline was the seventh in eight sessions. 
The broader market fell but also managed to stave off bigger losses. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.53 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,277.44, recovering from an earlier deficit of 17.18 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.31 points, or 0.2 percent, to 817.37, having lost as much as 12.39 earlier. 
"There is still absolutely no reason to put money to work, to buy something," said Tony Cecin, head of institutional trading at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "It is what I would call a buyers' strike."
War jitters have been the driving force behind the market's slide in 2003, costing the Dow nearly 1,100 points since Jan. 14, when the blue chips stood at 8,842.62, their high for 2003. 
So far this year, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 have each dropped 7.1 percent, while the Nasdaq has lost 4.4 percent. 
Fears of more terrorism have also been weighing on investors. Yesterday's losses widened as the police in Britain arrested a man at Gatwick Airport, near London, with a grenade in his luggage, and two other suspects were taken into custody near Heathrow Airport, outside London, where troops have been on patrol after a terrorist threat. 
On the economic front, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell by 0.9 percent in January, a larger drop than the 0.6 percent decline analysts had anticipated. The market has been particularly sensitive to news about consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy. 
But excluding automobile sales, which can vary widely from month to month, retail sales rose by 1.3 percent, stronger than the 0.5 percent increase that economists had been expecting. 
Still, investors are afraid that a possible war with Iraq might prompt consumers to further curtail their spending. 
Retailing and auto stocks traded lower yesterday. Pacific Sunwear dropped 34 cents, to $17.08; the Gap fell 50 cents, to $14.68; and Limited declined 20 cents, to $11.30. UBS Warburg downgraded the retailers to neutral from buy.
General Motors fell 37 cents, to $33.65, and Ford declined 31 cents, to $8.44.
Among the gainers, Hasbro, the toymaker, increased 51 cents, to $11.80, on fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations by 4 cents a share. 
Dell Computer rose 31 cents, to $23.25, ahead of quarterly earnings. After the market closed, the company reported profits that met Wall Street's expectations, and its shares rose in after-hours trading.
In the bond market yesterday, the 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32, to 99 31/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.88 percent from 3.96 percent on Wednesday. 
The 30-year bond rose 19/32, to 108 21/32. Its yield fell to 4.81 percent from 4.85 percent.

HEADLINE: Weak Response on Global Warming 

 BODY:
In a transparent bit of salesmanship that should not be mistaken for a serious policy, the Bush administration announced Wednesday that it had persuaded several major industries to make voluntary reductions in the rate at which they produce carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming. It was the administration's latest effort to show that voluntary controls will make unnecessary the mandatory reductions called for by many scientists, environmentalists and members of Congress -- as well as by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that Mr. Bush rejected after taking office. 
 There are two main problems with the Bush policy. First, he is asking almost nothing in the way of real sacrifice. A serious approach would request net reductions in emissions. Mr. Bush asks only for a decrease in what he calls "carbon intensity," under which emissions can grow as long as they increase more slowly than the economy itself. That of course misses the point. The atmospheric buildup of carbon, already alarmingly high, is cumulative. Thus the name of the game is to start reducing emissions, not merely to slow their rate of growth. Indeed, by Mr. Bush's own calculations, his program would translate into an actual increase in emissions of 14 percent over the next 10 years. 
 Second, voluntarism won't do the job. The only strategy that makes economic and environmental sense, as the successful acid rain program has shown, is one that sets mandatory national limits on emissions and asks everyone to do his part. For one thing, companies are unlikely to spend millions of dollars on pollution control equipment if their competitors aren't doing likewise. For another, emissions trading -- which is seen as a way to reduce the overall costs -- will not work properly without a nationwide cap.
For all these reasons, an increasing number of legislators, most recently Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman, are lining up behind the idea of mandatory reductions as the only effective answer to warming. They would like nothing better than to see Mr. Bush at the head of this parade, but so far he shows no inclination even to join it.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Would Keep Retail Space Underground 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Plans for an underground concourse at the World Trade Center would allow for the building of several hundred thousand square feet of retail space below ground, or nearly as much as existed at the site before the 2001 attack, officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday.
 Testifying at a City Council hearing, the officials said that no decisions had been made yet about how the retail space at the trade center would be divided between above and below ground. 
 But in raising the possibility that a large amount of the site's retail stores might be located underground, along the passageways connecting the PATH commuter line, various subway lines and the World Financial Center, the Port Authority brought to light a looming conflict with city officials and many downtown residents.
The authority officials also said that their preliminary designs for the transportation hub at the trade center site, including the underground concourses, would work with either of the two designs being considered as finalists -- if the architects made several proposed modifications to allow for underground parking, transit stations and other structures at the site. 
The Port Authority also discussed its plans last night with an advisory council of family members of victims. Several family members objected to the proposal to put a bus parking lot beneath the planned memorial, saying it would be a security risk. Since the trade center was destroyed, downtown residents and civic groups have said retail space at and around the site should be built at ground level. Doing so, they have said, would reinvigorate street life downtown, something that an indoor mall would not do.
Westfield America, a shopping-mall company that, as a partner of Silverstein Properties, holds the rights to lease retail space at the trade center, favors enclosed retail space, much like that in the former concourse at the site.
Anthony G. Cracchiolo, the Port Authority's director of priority capital programs, told a joint meeting of the City Council's Transportation and Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Committees, "We're looking at options both above and below grade.
"We believe the retail development could occur both as part of the transportation facilities, as it occurs in Grand Central Station, for example, and above grade, integrating with the street life," Mr. Cracchiolo said.
But he also noted that thanks to moving walkways, the system of concourses that would stretch nearly half a mile from the World Financial Center to the Fulton Transit Center would enable commuters to shave 10 minutes off the walk from the No. 4 and No. 5 subways to the American Express building.
Robert Davidson, the Port Authority's chief architect, said the plans for underground retail space were not intended to conflict with street life, but rather to enhance it.
"All we're doing is offering up a viable alternative on those days where if you can help it you don't want to be out there" on the street, usually because of bad weather," Mr. Davidson said. "That is not to say this is the only way to do it. This is about choices, and it all depends on how we integrate what is happening at the street level with how you move from that street zone down into the transportation."
The two teams of architects whose plans are finalists for the design of the trade center site planned for hundreds of thousands of square feet of retail space underground. The Think plan would place three-quarters of its 1.1 million square feet of shops there, and the Studio Daniel Libeskind proposal would create 900,000 square feet of retail space, almost two-thirds of it underground. 
That disappointed city officials. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said yesterday that while the city did not have a specific preference for the amount of retail space in one location or the other, "Our top priority is to restore the vitality to the streets that surround the World Trade center site."
Restoring that vitality will depend on the efforts by the city and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to remake the character of Fulton Street and Broadway, he said. "In general, our preference is to have as little retail underground as makes sense," Mr. Doctoroff said.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Off Markedly; Other Retail Sales Rise 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Retail sales for January fell 0.9 percent, the Commerce Department said today, pulled down by a sharp drop in demand for cars as automakers cut back on financial incentives.
 But sales outside the auto industry posted the biggest rise in more than two years. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, sales increased 1.3 percent, far ahead of forecasts of a 0.5 percent rise. 
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits for the first time dropped last week, a small ray of hope in a gloomy labor market. Initial claims fell by 18,000, to a seasonally adjusted 377,000, in the week ended Feb. 8. Wall Street economists had expected claims to dip to 389,000.
But the four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, rose 3,500, to 389,000.
Analysts take some solace from seeing the four-week average hold below 400,000 for several weeks. Some economists view claims above that level as a sign of a deteriorating job market.
In the retail sales report, the Commerce Department said car sales dropped 7.5 percent in January, the largest decline since November 2001, but consumers otherwise spent money on a wide variety of goods.
Sales at building material and gardening equipment stores climbed 2.9 percent. There was also solid demand at food and beverage stores, and at health and personal care outlets. Sales at clothing and accessories stores rose a modest 0.3 percent.
"American consumers are holding up not only the U.S. economy but the global economy as well," said Bill Cheney of John Hancock Financial Services. "Their spending will remain crucial because the conflict with Iraq and the broader geopolitical uncertainties are keeping businesses on the sideline."
And Carey Leahey, senior United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said, "The labor market is moving sideways, but this gives you some hope that there is some firming up in the labor market data, which could make us feel a little better about the recovery." 
The Labor Department said import prices increased sharply in January, largely from a 12.4 percent rise in oil prices. The risk of an Iraq war and the strike in Venezuela have driven oil prices up more than 30 percent since the end of November.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: A DANGER TO COMMERCE; 
Old Trading Partners Are Concerned About Effects of the Split Over War

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
To celebrate its 100th anniversary, the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany gathered 1,000 business people last Tuesday at a Baroque palace on the banks of Rhine River in Wiesbaden near here for Champagne, canapes, and a rousing speech about German-American friendship, delivered by a local conservative leader, Roland Koch. 
 The talk in the crowd, however, was about the bitter rift between Berlin and Washington -- a political feud that many business people fear could sunder the countries' close commercial links. 
 "Germans initially found the dispute amusing," said Fred B. Irwin, the chairman of the chamber and an executive at Citibank in Frankfurt. "But this is no longer amusing. This has become extremely serious." 
Republican members of Congress are calling for punitive gestures like moving American troops out of Germany, or placing health restrictions on imported bottled water from France. 
However sulfurous the words from Washington officials, Germany and France are, along with Britain, the dominant partners in the world's most durable trading relationship. The emerging economies of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic barely register in trans-Atlantic trade statistics. Even Spain and Portugal are relative minnows. 
Germany exported $56 billion worth of cars and other goods to the United States last year, making it the fifth largest exporter, after China. Poland's exports barely totaled $1 billion. While Poland, one of the countries whose leaders are close to President Bush, imported about $620 million worth of American goods, Germany imported more than $24 billion. 
With a gross domestic product of more than $1.3 trillion, France's economy is larger than the combined economies of Spain, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. The German economy, the world's third largest, is twice the size of all those countries together.
"It's wonderful to have Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic supporting us," said Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker and former American ambassador to Paris. "But it's also unrealistic in the extreme to equate the weight of these three countries with Germany and France."
"Germany makes Mercedes; the Czech Republic makes Skodas," Mr. Rohatyn said, referring to the utilitarian Czech cars that are the country's major export, and since 1993, a subsidiary of Volkswagen. Mr. Rohatyn said he believed Germany and France were making a "historical mistake" in opposing the United States. But he said the rift should not be allowed to unravel a web of commercial ties spun over half a century. 
Though there is no evidence of that yet, executives here worry that American companies might steer future investments away from France and Germany to southern and eastern European countries, which have pledged fealty to the Bush administration. 
"Only a demagogue would say, 'Don't buy German' or 'Don't buy French,' " said Norbert Quinkert, the chairman of Motorola Germany. "The danger is that investment decisions could be changed because of the public pressure. Companies might say, 'Why should I go to Germany?' " 
Like other executives here, Mr. Quinkert is pleading for cooler heads to prevail. "I'm proud to be part of this 'old Europe,' which has been working for hundreds of years, despite our wars," Mr. Quinkert said. His reference was to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's recent remark that France and Germany symbolize yesterday's Europe -- a line that has caused much debate, and more than a little anger, here. 
Both sides have much invested in the relationship. German carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW depend on American customers to offset their depressed home market. Porsche sells nearly half its high-octane cars in the United States, and is rolling out a sport utility vehicle tailored for American tastes. 
But the risks are not all on one side. Mercedes and BMW have built sprawling assembly plants in Alabama and South Carolina. They also buy parts from American suppliers. Motorola, for example, supplies the microprocessors that run the gadgetry in BMW's 7-series sedans. For that matter, one of Detroit's Big Three, Chrysler, is owned by DaimlerChrysler of Stuttgart. 
Fifty years after the United States rebuilt Germany through the Marshall Plan, American business still has a huge presence here: 1,800 companies, employing 800,000 people, with combined sales of $583 billion. Ford and General Motors each generate $16 billion in sales from their German automotive divisions, which employ 63,000 workers. 
With their high costs and rigid labor markets, Germany and France are already vulnerable to losing American investment. Motorola considered closing a factory in the northern German city of Flensburg, which makes cellphones. Mr. Quinkert saved the plant, arguing that the skills of his German workers still outweighed the lower costs in countries like Malaysia. 
"I'm sure he's worried that the next time, he won't be able to do it," said Mr. Kornblum, who is now chairman of the German office of Lazard Freres, the French-American investment bank. 
In France, where the government has instituted a 35-hour workweek and strict policies against layoffs, the business environment for American companies is already so hostile that some executives say privately they doubt the political clash could make matters any worse. "I think it is going to be a non-event because no one is going to ask the question, 'Should we invest another $1 billion in France?' " said an American executive in Paris. 
Whether France's loss would be Eastern Europe's gain is an open question. But business people are already rubbing their hands together. Poland will join the European Union next year and Mr. Bush warmly greeted the Polish prime minister, Leszek Miller, last week at the White House. 
"Instead of seeing Poland mentioned with Lithuania and Slovakia, it's now being mentioned with Britain and Spain," said Tony Housh, an American board member of a vodka distribution company in Warsaw. 
Mr. Housh acknowledged that Eastern European countries still had impediments to business -- not least, endless red tape -- which could overshadow the glow of their newfound coziness with the United States. 
Nor are the "old Europeans" giving up without a fight. German industrialists plan to visit the United States to talk up the value of the German-American relationship. Atlantik-Brucke, a private German group that promotes closer trans-Atlantic ties, has reserved a full-page advertisement in The New York Times this Sunday.. 
Mr. Irwin, a gregarious former army captain who has lived in Germany since the 1960's, is putting himself through an intensive series of meetings, conferences, and press interviews to try to bridge the gap. 
"To me, the crisis could be turned into an advantage," he said, with unflagging enthusiasm. "It might be an opportunity to re-examine the German-American relationship since German reunification."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 15, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the risk to European-American commercial ties posed by the divisions over Iraq omitted the given name of the chairman of the German office of the Lazard Freres investment bank, who commented on the possibility that American investments could be withdrawn from Germany. He is John Kornblum.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Expands For 4th Consecutive Quarter 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Japan's economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with the previous quarter, the government said today, defying expectations that growth had stalled and that the fourth recession in a decade had begun.
 As in other quarters in 2002, growth was driven by strong exports and steady gains in consumer spending and capital investment, which offset declines in new-home starts and government spending. 
 The string of four consecutive quarterly expansions, though, may come to a halt this year if the global economy slows and the government's campaign to purge the financial system of its nonperforming loans gathers steam. Any setbacks would intensify calls on Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose popularity is fading, to find more ways to stimulate the sagging economy with more public spending and a more relaxed monetary policy. Such measures have only softened the slowdown in recent years, not generated a robust expansion. 
In the latest quarter, the economy grew 2.4 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, when the previous recession was just ending. For all of 2002, Japan's economy grew 0.3 percent. The stronger-than-expected figures gave stock prices a lift. The benchmark Nikkei 225-stock index jumped 1.5 percent just after the numbers were released. The yen also gained ground against the dollar.
Despite the surprisingly upbeat quarterly figures, which are notoriously volatile, government ministers have tempered their optimism about the potential for further growth this year. Indeed, gloomy signs are everywhere in Japan. Unemployment is higher than it has been at any time since World War II and is still rising, while wages and household spending are sliding. As in the United States, consumer and corporate confidence has been further damaged by rising geopolitical tensions.
Those tensions, ranging from faraway Iraq to nearby North Korea, threaten to sever the one economic lifeline still supporting Japan's economy: exports. Shipments of cars, machinery and semiconductors to the United States and elsewhere in Asia have been buoying manufacturers whose domestic sales have slumped. That has kept profits up at global brand-name companies, that benefited from a 4.5 percent rise in exports in the October-December period. But with competition from lower-cost rivals in South Korea, China and elsewhere, Japanese managers have been reluctant to use their profits to pay workers more or to hire new ones. This has cast a shadow over the economy.
"At best, the economy will be close to zero in the first half of 2003 and will hit bottom in the third or fourth quarter," said Mikihiro Matsuoka, an economist with Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. "Even then, I don't expect a sharp recovery."
The government, which is sometimes accused of pumping up its forecasts to deflate critics, says it does not expect much of a recovery either. For the fiscal year beginning April 1, the government is planning on growth of 0.6 percent in real terms; at nominal prices, before adjusting for deflation, the forecast is for a contraction of 0.2 percent.
Even these anemic estimates may prove to be too rosy, some analysts say. Consumer spending was surprisingly resilient last year despite rising unemployment and a sharp decline in bonuses, but the only demographic group that increased its spending in 2002 was people older than 60. "Consumer spending defied gravity last year, but older Japanese are going to start feeling heat," said Frank Packer, an economist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
Other Japanese already have. The government survey of consumer confidence fell for the fifth month running in January. Winter bonuses, which have typically been equal to two to three months' salary for many workers, shrank 3.1 percent on average in 2002. Spending by households headed by a salaried worker contracted by a staggering 12.2 percent in the fourth quarter from the third.
Japanese companies plan to trim their capital spending plans by 7.9 percent in the current fiscal year, a cabinet survey found.
The grim news has led to calls for Mr. Koizumi to abandon his policy of trying to rein in new public spending, and the weak G.D.P. figures released today may provide his opponents with the "smoking gun" they need.
But the prime minister, backed by officials in the Finance Ministry, is reluctant to abandon his fiscal austerity program. Instead, he has called on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further, even though the bank's interest rates are already effectively zero.
Mr. Koizumi has also promised to choose a "deflation fighter" to succeed the bank's departing governor, Masaru Hayami, who is set to step down March 19. Mr. Hayami has resisted calls for radical measures, insisting that easier monetary conditions would accomplish little unless accompanied by steps to clean up the debt-hobbled financial industry. He is unlikely to recommend any fresh action at the bank's two-day policy board meeting, which ends today.
However aggressive his successor may be, big changes are unlikely to be made overnight. Like many entrenched bureaucracies, the Bank of Japan tries to preserve the continuity of its policies, so any big shift toward trying to bolster the economy would take months, Mr. Matsuoka of Deutsche Securities said. "You can't suddenly subscribe to Buddhism if you've been a Christian," he said.

HEADLINE: Office Depot Matches Wall St. Expectations 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Office Depot Inc., the office supplies retailer, said today that its earnings rose 56 percent in the fourth quarter on a small increase in sales. 
 But the company, which is based in Delray Beach, said it expected earnings growth this year to be limited by a sagging economy. 
 Earnings were $62.9 million, or 20 cents a share, in the October-December period, up from $40.3 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, it earned 22 cents a share, matching the forecast of Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. 
Revenue rose to $2.84 billion from $2.78 billion. 
Although sales at United States and Canadian retail stores fell 1 percent, business sales grew 4 percent and international sales rose 17 percent. 
Office Depot's chief executive, Bruce Nelson, was not as hopeful for this year.
"As we look forward to 2003, we do not see many encouraging signs that we can expect a significant improvement in the overall economic environment during the first half of the year," Mr. Nelson said.

HEADLINE: Bankers Opposing New State Curbs On Unfair Loans 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES with JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The banking industry has stepped up a fight to block new state laws aimed at curbing unscrupulous mortgage lending.
 Disappointed with federal efforts, a number of states, including New York, have adopted their own laws over the last three years to combat mortgages that carry unjustly high fees or rates that can cost some borrowers their homes. 
 But bankers are warning that the emerging patchwork of state rules could seriously disrupt the marketplace that supplies credit to home buyers across the country. And yesterday, a Republican congressman proposed a new federal law that would pre-empt the state statutes entirely.
Although both sides expect New York and Washington to emerge as the next hot spots in this struggle, the focus right now is Georgia. Last year, Georgia enacted what consumer advocates call the nation's toughest law against this kind of lending, known as predatory lending. But in recent weeks, a grueling battle has been waged in the Georgia Legislature over how to address Wall Street's concerns without weakening protections for homeowners. 
The Georgia Fair Lending Act, the rope in this bitter tug of war, was intended to prevent what is happening now to Mildred White, a 76-year-old retired school cafeteria worker. As lobbyists worked the halls at the state Capitol last Tuesday, Ms. White was in Federal Bankruptcy Court a few blocks away trying to save her home from foreclosure.
Her troubles began in 1999, when a local mortgage broker persuaded her to refinance her home. The new mortgage left her nearly $70,000 in debt, with monthly payments that consume more than half of her monthly income of $1,100. "I haven't had a good night's sleep since this happened," said Ms. White, who relies on a church food pantry.
A mortgage like Ms. White's would probably be illegal today under the new law, said William J. Brennan Jr. of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. For one thing, the law prohibits loans made without regard to the borrower's ability to repay and requires counseling before closing, which would probably have warned Ms. White away, he said.
But most important, the law allows borrowers to sue not only the original lender but anyone who subsequently buys the mortgage. Like most mortgages, Ms. White's loan was sold by the original lender and became part of a pool of mortgages overseen by Citibank as the trustee.
"If she were subject to the new law, I think she'd have a claim, and she could assert it against Citibank," said Mr. Brennan, who is assisting Ms. White. "But I can't do that now. All we can do for her is file a bankruptcy petition."
It is, though, exactly that provision of the new law -- an arrangement that lawyers call assignee liability -- that has alarmed Wall Street and prompted the local banks and home builders to predict that mortgage money in Georgia will dry up unless the law is rewritten.
Although nearly a dozen states have adopted predatory lending laws, lawyers say the only other statute that clearly imposes assignee liability is the one that goes into effect in New York on April 1. But similar provisions are being considered in other states, including New Jersey.
Those state laws would all be moot, of course, if Wall Street persuaded Congress to adopt a federal response to predatory lending. Yesterday, Representative Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio, filed a bill that would amend the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, which regulates high-cost mortgage loans, to pre-empt the new local laws. Like the Georgia law, the federal law holds loan buyers liable for violations by original lenders, but rating-agency lawyers say the federal liability is more limited and predictable.
A large coalition of consumers, community groups, unions and civil rights organizations opposes the Ney bill, which they say will weaken or eliminate the federal language about liability. And without that protection, they say, abusive lenders can simply sell their loans and fold their tents, leaving a homeowner facing foreclosure for defaulting on an illegal loan.
"Without assignee liability, you might as well just throw the law out," said J. Michael Vaughan, a lawyer in Kansas City who has filed a class-action suit on behalf of Missouri homeowners who say they were charged excessive origination fees. The defendants in the cases include several banks and mortgage buyers that bought those disputed loans from the original lenders. 
But investment bankers say that assignee liability -- at least, the version built into the Georgia law -- strikes at the heart of the process Wall Street uses to raise money to finance home mortgages.
That process, called securitization, begins with the creation of a corporate shell called a trust. Like mutual funds that sell shares and use the money to invest in stocks, these trusts sell bonds, called mortgage-backed securities, and use the money to buy mortgages from lenders across the country. By selling their loans to these trusts, lenders raise capital to make new loans, which makes credit more available in the mortgage market.
Last month, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, rocked Georgia and Wall Street by announcing that it would no longer give credit ratings to securitization trusts that buy any home loans from Georgia. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have followed suit.
The rating agencies say the new law's liability provision, and its ambiguous language about which loans are subject to that provision, make it impossible to assess the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities backed by Georgia loans. Their concern, they said, is that the trusts could face unlimited punitive damages if they inadvertently buy even a few loans that turn out to have been illegal.
Securities issued by an unrated trust would be at a disadvantage in the marketplace because many institutional investors are not allowed to buy unrated securities.
Some lenders say that the secondary market for Georgia loans has since been in turmoil. On Feb. 1, the giant Residential Funding Corporation, a unit of G.M.A.C. that specializes in higher-cost loans, stopped buying such loans in Georgia, citing the uncertainty caused by the rating agencies' actions. Other mortgage buyers have expressed similar concerns, especially about loans made to less creditworthy borrowers.
"Georgia has shot itself in the foot," said Thomas H. Meyer, chief executive of the Homebuilders Financial Network, which provides mortgage services for major home builders. "This may become a major impediment to the growth of the real estate industry in Georgia."
With support from a local coalition of banks and credit unions, the state's House of Representatives unanimously adopted a bill last week that calls for substantial revisions to the assignee liability language and other provisions that lenders find onerous.
While supporters of the existing law acknowledged that the rating agencies' concern should be addressed, they are concerned that Wall Street is using that issue "as a smoke screen to gut the law,"' said Kathy Floyd, a lobbyist for AARP in Georgia. Her organization supports a bill adopted on Wednesday by the State Senate, which limits the liability facing loan buyers and clarifies some of the law's terms and definitions, but leaves it otherwise intact.
Consumer groups outside Georgia say that banks and underwriters are already citing the state's fears of a credit drought to challenge tough predatory lending bills elsewhere.
"They are in the process now of launching a huge campaign to wipe out everything we have done," said Bertha Lewis, of the New York chapter of Acorn, an advocacy group that supports the local initiatives. "We are quite concerned about 'the death of a thousand cuts' for predatory lending laws across the country."
The debate over a federal solution is just as heated. Consumer groups say the Ney bill could weaken the liability provisions in the federal law, leaving states with what one lawyer called "the worst of both worlds -- a federal law that doesn't work but that makes it impossible for states to enact laws that do work."
But mortgage market competitors are growing increasingly concerned about way the Georgia fight is affecting business. "At this juncture, the sharpening differences among federal, state and local laws make a long look at federal pre-emption an idea that should be carefully considered," said Michael Seats, general counsel for the Residential Funding Corporation.
Jeffrey Zeltzer, executive director of the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents lenders serving less creditworthy borrowers, favors the Ney bill but insists that it will not weaken federal law.
"There is no doubt that consumer protection needs to be bolstered," Mr. Zeltzer said. "But the mortgage market is a national market, and our concern is that there should be one clear national standard."

U.S. and Britain Drafting Resolution to Punish Iraq
The Bush administration is writing a resolution with Britain that they expect to present to the United Nations Security Council next week declaring that Saddam Hussein has failed to disarm and must now face unspecified "consequences," senior administration officials said. A1

American intelligence has obtained new evidence of movements by agents of Al Qaeda indicating that they may be poised to carry out two major attacks, including one inside the UnitedStates. Officials said the intelligence shows that the activities may have gone beyond the planning stages for two distinct plots. A1

Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council that the U.N. is planning to feed up to 10 million Iraqi civilians and care for at least 2.6 million refugees in the wake of war in Iraq. Mr. Annan met with the Council ambassadors to appeal for $120 million for contingency planning. A14

A Shaken Alliance
The Bush administration's preparations for a possible war with Iraq have provoked a rift far beyond the normal disagreements that sometimes take place among allies. Something deep and fundamental in the different views of Europe and the United States seems to have been brought to the surface by the Iraqi crisis. A1

European intellectuals tend to draw a distinction between the American government and the American people. But there is a sense that many of America's most admirable qualities have been so trampled in the debate over war as to have been rendered toothless or even nonexistent. A12

On such fundamental issues as the death penalty or social welfare, Europe and America have taken divergent paths and built societies with increasingly different worldviews. The Iraq crisis has sharpened those differences and exacerbated the sense of trans-Atlantic estrangement. A13

Israeli Outrage at Belgium
Israeli officials reacted with anger to a decision by Belgium's highest court that Belgium could try Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for war crimes once he leaves office. Israel recalled its ambassador from Brussels, while Benjamin Netanyahu summoned Belgium's ambassador to Israel to receive a protest. A4

Support for Zimbabwe
The presidents of Nigeria and South Africa are urging the Commonwealth nations to reinstate Zimbabwe -- and thus its leader, President Robert Mugabe -- to full membership. Membership was suspended after Mr. Mugabe won a new term in elections widely regarded as rigged. A10

Mexican Butterfly Recovery
A little more than a year after the largest known die-off of monarch butterflies occurred in the mountains of Mexico, researchers say the monarchs that migrate there appear to have recovered to near normal population levels. A6

Panel Cites Hole in Skin As Shuttle Disaster Cause
The panel investigating the loss of the space shuttle Columbia said a hole developed in its aluminum skin, allowing superheated gas to flow into the left wing and cause the ship's destruction. A1

The group of more than 1,500 emergency volunteers who rushed to the East Texas area to help retrieve debris from the space shuttle Columbia disbanded. A26

The senior Democrat on the House space subcommittee charged that NASA was "rapidly losing credibility" because of its unwillingness to allow an independent and credible investigation of the space shuttle Columbia disaster. A27

Poll Shows Qualms on War
Even after the administration's aggressive case for going to war soon in Iraq, a majority of Americans favor a delay to give United Nations weapons inspectors more time to complete their work so that any military operation wins the support of the security council. A1

Leaders from some of the 90 city councils that have adopted resolutions opposing military action against Iraq warned that the costs of war would devastate already crippled municipal budgets and deprive citizens of crucial services. A15

Spending Bill Passed
Congress approved a giant spending bill, ending afight that began last summer over the level of financing for federal agencies. A24

G.O.P. Antitax Fervor Fades
At least 24 states are considering ways to raise taxes even as President Bush is pushing for permanent federal income tax cuts to stimulate the economy. A20

Top Bush Adviser Resigns
Bobby Jindal, a key figure on Medicare policy in the Bush administration, announced that he was resigning to return home to Louisiana. He is considered a potential Republican candidate for governor there. A22

Deadlock on Judgeship
The Senate remained deadlocked over a filibuster by Democrats against a Bush administration appeals court nominee. A23

Mock Assault on Indian Pt. Planned for this Summer
For the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will resume mock armed assaults on nuclear plants, including a simulated invasion of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County this summer. B1

Death Penalty Reversal Probed
All 12 cases in the New York region in which Attorney General John Ashcroft has ordered federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty involve black or Hispanic defendants, newly released data show. The new information has moved prosecutors into a wider debate about the fairness of the federal death penalty. B2

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
For Old Friends, Iraq Bares a Deep Rift

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
As antiwar demonstrators prepare for what they are saying will be among the largest protest marches in history this weekend, many in Europe are asking themselves: how did trans-Atlantic relations, which were so good so recently, get so bad so quickly?
 What has become clear to many here is that the Bush administration's preparations for a possible war with Iraq have provoked something far beyond the normal disagreements that sometimes take place among allies -- as happened many times during the cold war and more recently over such questions as the Kyoto Protocol on global warming or the International Criminal Court, both favored in Europe but rejected in Washington. 
 Now, something deep and fundamental in the different views of Europe and the United States seems to have been brought to the surface by the Iraqi crisis.
Several hundred thousand antiwar protesters are expected Saturday on the streets of London alone, and it has become clear that the European public, from Britain to Poland, from "old" Europe to "new" Europe, is against war in Iraq.
Indeed, it is almost as if President Bush and his administration have unwittingly brought about a popular unity on this continent that belies the sharp differences among Europe's governments, which are openly divided on the question of a war to dislodge President Saddam Hussein. 
With turmoil in NATO, divisions on the Security Council and undiplomatically angry words being shouted across the Atlantic, many here have started to worry about the prospect of permanent damage to the very structures on which European peace and prosperity have been based for the past half century and more.
"Everything's falling to pieces; that's really the case, I believe," Michael Sturmer, a professor of history and an editorial writer at the conservative German daily Die Welt, said in a recent conversation. "We have various problems, all knotted together."
It may be -- and some diplomats here in the seat of the European community are predicting this -- that over the next few weeks the trans-Atlantic gaps are going to be bridged and that such alarming spectacles as the current disarray in NATO will disappear.
In this optimistic view, after the report of United Nations inspectors on Friday, the United States will manage to get a resolution passed in the Security Council that will authorize force, and then the French, who have led the charge against war, will move from opposing military action to taking part in it.
But such an outcome looks remote today. One of the reasons the leaders of Germany and France have so publicly defied the United States -- in the United Nations as well as in NATO -- is that it is popular to do so.
Certainly, it did not look like that just a few weeks ago. To be sure, American opposition to the Kyoto treaty, coupled with a kind of visceral distrust of the Bush administration, might have prepared the ground for widespread European opposition to American plans for war in Iraq.
But essentially, last fall, sympathy prompted by the losses of Sept. 11 was widespread, and on the strategic front, developments seemed positive.
Both NATO and the European Union were in the process of historic and tandem expansions, incorporating the former members of the Eastern bloc and spreading the net of military security, economic expansion and democratic governments to the very borders of Russia.
A majority of Europeans supported the United States in earlier military actions, from the Persian Gulf war of 1991 to the Kosovo war of 1999 to the action in Afghanistan after Sept. 11.
Now all that has been turned on its head. The German government, for the first time in its postwar history, has put itself in direct conflict over a major issue with the United States, and this is a very big change.
For years, even though Germany was a close partner with France when it came to powering the European Community forward, it always resisted the Gaullist impulse to keep a certain distance from America.
In only a few weeks, however, Germany, Europe's largest country and its most important economy by far, has entered into a sort of informal coalition whose very identity is opposition to a policy that an American administration deems vital to the security of the United States and the world.
To some extent, the divisions express what some have identified as growing fundamental cultural differences between Europe and the United States.
Most conspicuously, in the wake of Sept. 11, a gap has opened up in the European and American perceptions of danger. It is not too much to say that while Americans intensely sense a new vulnerability and an urgent new need for self-defense, Europeans, after the end of the cold war, do not. Put bluntly, the people of Berlin now feel safer even as the people of New York sense a new danger.
"I do think that there are different perceptions of risks on both sides," Javier Solana, the foreign affairs chief for the European Union, said in an interview.
While Americans recently experienced an attack on their mainland, Europeans, as Mr. Solana put this, are enjoying "the most secure period of our history."
Americans, aware of European peace and security, believe that these happy conditions were made possible by 50 years of American military expenditures and protection, which they feel that Europeans appreciate less than they should.
Europeans, while aware of American military protection, perhaps because of it, feel safe, safer than they should feel, in the view of some here.
"My father fought in two wars, but it's impossible to think that my sons will fight in wars in Europe," Mr. Solana said. "But we are not aware enough of the danger of weapons of mass destruction, and we have to correct that. Weapons of mass destruction are not just an American problem, they are a problem for all of us."
It is not that Europeans, a clear majority of whom are shown by polls across Europe to be opposed to war, have any kind regard for Mr. Hussein and his government.
But few of them seem really to believe that Mr. Hussein is anything more than another of the world's dictators, perhaps one of the most cutthroat of them, but not the most dangerous. Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, probably holds that distinction in the minds of many Europeans.
By contrast, in many quarters in Europe, the public deems unbridled American power in the service of a pre-emptive strike to be the greater international menace.
"What happens in the future if China or Russia decide that some other country is a threat to them, and they decide to go to war?" asked an editor for a Germany publishing company attending an antiwar demonstration in Munich last weekend. "What are you going to do then?"
There are those analyzing European-American differences who find this discrepancy in the view of threats could have a long-term effect on the main organizations of American-European cooperation, especially NATO.
"The North Atlantic alliance could survive without a common threat," said Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies, a British research organization. "Actually it has gone from strength to strength in the years since the end of the cold war. But it cannot survive without a common perception of what constitutes a threat."
Other cultural differences, many of them described in an article by Robert Kagan, an American analyst, read widely on both sides of the Atlantic, have been cited to explain the deeper reasons for the trans-Atlantic conflict. Europeans, embedded for decades by now in a community that has required ever more sacrifices of sovereignty, have come to see their future as part of a network of states, in which war, once so common and so devastating on this continent has come to be seen as illegitimate and unjustified, except in self-defense.
Americans, by contrast, are still fiercely attached to their sovereignty. Moreover, certain Americans, specifically the conservatives and neo-conservatives who make policy in the Bush administration, nurture a strong distrust of international organizations like the United Nations, which, in their view, is afflicted by a kind of unrealistic piousness, the first principle of which is that war is never morally justified except in cases of direct self-defense.
Matters are made more complicated by the fact that Europe itself, or, at least, European elites, are themselves deeply split on the question of Iraq.
Three weeks ago, a group of countries across Europe, a geographic sample extending from Britain in the north, to Italy in the south and to Poland in the east, signed a letter supporting the United States on Iraq.
A week later, on the very day of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's speech at the United Nations, 10 former members of the Soviet bloc signed a similar statement.
"The intention of the letter was not to divide Europe, as was being said in Germany and France," Alexandr Vondra, a deputy foreign minister of the Czech Republic, said.
"But a few weeks ago there we were listening to Chirac's message on Iraq stating European policy to be peace, peace, peace, and he didn't consult with us about it," he said, referring to President Jacques Chirac of France. "We had to hear it on the TV news."
"In economic affairs, on matters of European integration, Germany and France can do what they want, I suppose," he continued, "but when our relations with the United States are at stake, I think they have to be much more careful."
The divide inside Europe could also have long-term implications, since, even with populations that are antiwar, the countries of the old East are viewed as both more closely attached to the United States than those of the West and more suspicious of France and Germany, Europe's powerful major instrument.
"No country in Eastern Europe is going to be dictated to by Paris or Berlin," Mr. Eyal, the research director in London, said.
Mr. Vondra said, "For 50 years the United States helped us; now it's time for once for us to help the United States."
But if the Iraq question has created obstacles to a common European foreign and defense policy, there appears to be little doubt that the main divide remains between the European public and the American desire for a military solution in Iraq. That divide does not look likely to narrow soon.

HEADLINE: Klein Reveals How He Chose Top Schools 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH and JENNIFER MEDINA 

 BODY:
After weeks of public anticipation, Chancellor Joel I. Klein unveiled his formula for picking the roughly 200 New York City schools that will be exempt from the system's new mandatory curriculum. The formula is a complicated methodology, meant to ensure a mix of schools in rich and poor neighborhoods.
 But Mr. Klein, who had put off his announcement several times, still delayed answering the biggest question yesterday -- which schools made the list. He will release the list today, when parents, students and teachers will be heading into a long holiday weekend, followed by a week-long winter break. The timing makes immediate protest by parents and schools who think they should be on the list more difficult. 
 In using a formula that guarantees racial and economic diversity, Mr. Klein is clearly seeking to avoid rewarding only the top-scoring schools, since they tend to be mostly made up of middle-class students who are white or Asian. 
One education official who was briefed on the list said that 40 percent of the students enrolled in the 208 schools on the list are black and Hispanic. The official also said that 55 of the schools are predominately black and Hispanic, while the rest are white and Asian.
In the month since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced plans for a uniform curriculum, the list has become something of a holy grail for parents who cherish their school's individuality and a hot potato for the Department of Education.
Though the department was inundated with questions about how it was tabulating the list, it kept the process a secret until now, increasing the anxiety among parents who chose schools because of their particular curriculums or philosophies.
But while schools on the list will enjoy more independence than the roughly 1,000 that will have to use the standard curriculum, Mr. Klein was insistent that they should not be seen as elite.
"It's not a formula that says, 'These are the great schools,' " he said, explaining his methodology for compiling the list during what he called a "technical briefing" rather than a news conference.
Yet, Mr. Klein said the 208 schools were "getting it right at a higher level, certainly, than a lot of schools in the city." 
The list includes schools from three categories -- high-, medium- and low-need -- based on poverty data, number of students for whom English is a second language, and number of special education students.
To determine which schools in each category qualified for the list, Mr. Klein looked at the percentage of students scoring at or above grade level on standardized math and reading exams.
The percentage figures were then combined to create a score for each school. For example, a school where 50 percent of the students were at or above grade level in both math and reading would have a score of 100.
Cutoff levels, which are to be officially released today, were determined for each category. The highest cutoff -- which the education official who was briefed said was 140 for elementary and middle schools and 160 for high schools -- was set for low-need schools. For medium-need schools, the cutoff was 15 points lower, while for high-need schools it was 30 points lower.
Thus, fewer students had to be at grade level in the medium- and high-need schools.
Schools with the biggest gains last year in the number of students at or above grade level were also put on the list if their score was within 10 points of the cutoff for their category.
Mr. Klein said that more than half the schools on the list were in the low-need category, meaning they probably serve many middle-class students.
He also said that schools not on the list could file an appeal and that his staff would reconsider their case. Those likely to appeal include "mini-schools," which are small programs within larger schools, often for gifted students. Since the test scores of mini-schools are combined with those of the larger schools they occupy, many feared they would not be considered separately for inclusion on the list.
Schools will have until March 3 to appeal, and Mr. Klein's office will decide by April 1 whether to add them to the list.
Mr. Klein said that more schools could make the list in future years, if their test scores improved. But he questioned why schools that improve after this year would want to be exempt from the new curriculum, since that would probably be the reason they had gotten better.
"It's hard to see why they'd want to flip," he said.
Mr. Klein also stressed that the new curriculum was a reward in itself, and that the schools who must use it will be getting at least as good a deal as those who can choose their own path.
Under the new curriculum, elementary and middle-school students will have at least 90 minutes of reading and writing each day, using books from classroom libraries instead of the standard basic readers. In addition, children in kindergarten through third grade will get up to 45 minutes of phonics instruction a day using a program called Month by Month Phonics.
For math, Mr. Klein has chosen Everyday Mathematics, a program developed at the University of Chicago, for kindergarten through fifth grade.
For sixth though eighth grades, an offshoot of Everyday Mathematics, called Impact Mathematics, will be used. High schools will adopt New York Math A: An Integrated Approach, a curriculum that Mr. Klein says is tailored to the New York State Regents exams. 
Mr. Klein said that he had delayed releasing the formula, and the list, because it took more time than expected to get the correct data for some schools. Education officials also said that Mr. Klein put off releasing the list for one more day because he did not want the methodology for formulating it to be lost in the frenzy over what schools were on the list.
Indeed, one education official said that schools that believed they would make the list wanted the education department to order banners and buttons announcing their victory.
The formula will surely infuriate some school officials and parents who believe their school should have made the list, said Jeffrey R. Henig, a professor at Columbia University's Teachers College.
"There's never going to be a way to defend that this is unambiguously the right way do it," Dr. Henig said.
But Jill Chaifetz, executive director of Advocates for Children, an education group, praised the plan for setting lower benchmarks for schools with higher poverty levels.
"There is an understanding nationally that you can't compare apples with oranges," she said. "You can't compare a school with kids from Scarsdale with kids starting from Bushwick. It's really that simple."

SELECTING THE SCHOOLS
Defining Success Within 3 Categories

To select the 208 schools that will be exempt from the standard math and reading curriculums next year, New York City officials took these steps:

* Using an existing formula, schools were divided into three categories -- high, medium and low need -- based on poverty data, the number of students for whom English is a second language and the number of special education students.

* The percentage of students performing at or above grade level in math and in reading was calculated for each school. Those figures were combined to give a score. For example, a school where 50 percent of the students were at or above grade level in both math and reading would have a score of 100.

* Cutoff levels, which are to be officially released today, were determined for each category of school based on the scores. Low-need schools had to have the highest percentage of students at grade level, while fewer students had to be at grade level in the medium and high-need schools.

* Schools with the biggest gains last year in the number of students at or above grade level were put on the list if their score was within 10 points of the cutoff for their category.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Electronic Data's Debt Rating Is Cut 2 Levels 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Debt of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the world's No. 2 seller of computer services, was cut two levels, to Baa2, by Moody's Investors Service yesterday on concern about cash flow and customers' ability to pay their bills. The senior unsecured debt had been rated A3, Moody's said. 
Electronic Data's short-term rating was cut to Prime-3 from Prime-2, Moody's said. About $4 billion of securities were downgraded. The Baa2 ranking is the second-lowest investment-grade rating at Moody's, which said Electronic Data may be hurt by reduced demand and by "credit weakness" at major customers like WorldCom. Moody's also said Electronic Data will continue using cash to provide contracted services to the United States Navy, and declines in business from General Motors were greater than expected. Electronic Data's notes maturing in October 2009, carrying a 7.125 percent interest rate, last traded at 104 cents on the dollar to yield 6.39 percent, according to Bloomberg data. The extra yield, or spread, on the notes is 3.17 percentage points higher than Treasury debt of similar maturity.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

* "ABOUT SCHMIDT," starring Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates and Hope Davis. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Nicholson's portrayal of Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance executive from Omaha at loose ends after the death of his wife, may be the most astonishing dramatic transformation of his 44-year screen career. Plodding in a weary, stiff-legged shuffle, this great actor reins in his bad-boy mannerisms to convey a deep, sorrowful awareness of human complexity. As the movie follows the attempts of this staid 66-year-old everyman to regain his equilibrium, it sustains an exquisite balance between a satire of Middle American life and the wrenching pathos of Warren's situation as he tries to form a bond with his resentful grown-up daughter (Ms. Davis). Much of the story takes place on the road from Nebraska to her wedding in Colorado. Ms. Bates has a flashy comic turn as the groom's garrulous, overbearing mother (Stephen Holden).

"AMEN," starring Ulrich Tukur and Mathieu Kassovitz. Directed by Costa-Gavras (not rated, 130 minutes). In his latest examination of the confrontation between liberal conscience and totalitarian evil, Costa-Gavras tells the story of Kurt Gerstein (Mr. Tukur), an SS officer who tried, from his privileged position within the Nazi machinery of death, to obstruct its workings. Gerstein's only ally is a young Italian Jesuit (Mr. Kassovitz), who tries to inform a dithering, timid pope about the extermination of Europe's Jews. The film's themes are powerful and intriguing, and Costa-Gavras, as he has before, tries to use cinematic suspense as a mode of ethical inquiry. Unfortunately, while "Amen" does succeed in raising troubling questions about the confused boundary between complicity and resistance, and about the failure of powerful institutions to respond to the Holocaust, it fails to dramatize these questions as effectively as it should. It is earnest and didactic, but in the end neither very illuminating nor terribly moving (A. O. Scott).

* "CATCH ME IF YOU CAN," starring LeonardoDiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). This supremely entertaining fable of self-invention in the land of opportunity tells the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Mr. DiCaprio), a teenager from New Rochelle, N.Y., who by the age of 19 had successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and amassed millions of dollars from forging checks. Part comedy, part caper film, this picaresque tale gently satirizes the sillier side of the swinging 60's. It is also a cat-and-mouse game in which Frank tries to elude Carl Hanratty (Mr. Hanks), an earnest, fuddy-duddy F.B.I. agent who finally catches up with him in France. Mr. DiCaprio, that chameleonic 28-year-old man-child, is, in a word, sensational (Holden).

"CHICAGO," starring Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere. Directed and choregraphed by Rob Marshall (PG-13, 108 minutes). It's rare to find a picture as exuberant, as shallow -- and as exuberant about its shallowness -- as Mr. Marshall's film adaptation of the Broadway musical "Chicago." The movie, set in Prohibition-era Chicago as it follows the murder trial of the manipulative Kewpie doll Roxie Hart (Ms. Zellweger), is tough, brittle fun. It's the raw expenditure of energy and the canniness of the staging that should pull audiences in and keep them rooted. This, of course, is undoubtedly the best way to present a movie take on Bob Fosse's digressive musical version of "Chicago." This new picture maintains the relentless spirit of Fosse's blunt suavity and the breathless, black-silk enthusiasm of Kander and Ebb's songs. Ms. Zeta-Jones, in Louise Brooks wig and ruthless smile, is Roxie's fellow felon and jailbird, Velma. And as the big-ticket defense lawyer and jury barometer Billy Flynn, Mr. Gere has never been better, turning spoiled princeling arrogance into a witty revel (Elvis Mitchell).

* "CITY OF GOD," starring Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora and Seu Jorge. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (R, 130 minutes; in Portuguese, with English subtitles). A scorching anecdotal history of gang warfare in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, "City of God" is narrated by Rocket (Mr. Rodrigues), a young photographer who chronicles the deterioration of the housing project in which he grew up from a shantytown into a war zone. The movie, which begins in the 1960's and ends in the early 80's, parallels Rocket's story with the rise of his childhood playmate Li'l Ze (Mr. da Hora) from a petty thief into a ruthless drug dealer and neighborhood kingpin commanding a small army of gun-toting children. The history is told in a loose, tall-tale style that suggests a quasi-cinema-verite version of Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas" (Holden).

"FINAL DESTINATION 2," starring Ali Larter, A. J. Cook and Michael Landes. Directed by David R. Ellis (R, 97 minutes). This gleefully morbid sequel may, in the end, be as nonsensical as its title, but it's also much more imaginative. Ms. Larter is Clear Rivers, the sole survivor of the first "Final Destination," who has locked herself away to hide from the grisly death she is sure must be stalking her. Ms. Cook is Kimberly, who has foreseen, and escaped, a horrific traffic accident and is now similarly stalked. But death, which turns out to have a macabre and elaborate sense of humor, gets all the best material, and the filmmakers delight in staging a series of ghoulishly slapstick demises, involving pigeons and refrigerator magnets as well as the more traditional exploding cars and out-of-control elevators. The spiritof the movie is best summed up in the following line, spoken by a television news reporter after one such death. "Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her air bag inflated." Ironically indeed (Scott).

* "GANGS OF NEW YORK," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 165 minutes). Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped about, Mr. Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story -- a revenge tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Mr. DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Mr. Day-Lewis) -- is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is the way it brings history to life, not merely by meticulously recreating its details but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity. It suggests, with vivid plausibility, that clues to the national character can be found in the violent, contradictory and often tragic story of the urban immigrant working class (Scott).

* "THE HOURS," starring Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep. Directed by Stephen Daldry (PG-13, 110 minutes). This remarkably faithful and moving screen adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning theme and variations on Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" stars Ms. Kidman as the English author, who committed suicide in 1941, and Ms. Moore and Ms. Streep as two of her literary and spiritual heirs. Ms. Kidman's Woolf is one of the most disturbing portraits of mental imbalance ever brought to the screen. Ms. Moore (as a depressed Southern California housewife in 1951) and Ms. Streep (as a book editor in contemporary New York) give richly shaded portrayals of intelligent high-strung women on the verge. David Hare's lean, incisive screenplay and Philip Glass's churning minimalist score fold stories that take place in different eras into a single timeless plane. Ed Harris gives a furious, anguished portrayal of an eminent poet dying of AIDS (Holden).

"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS," starring Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 100 minutes). Yet another mediocre New York romantic comedy, yes, but notably less mediocre than "Maid in Manhattan" and "Two Weeks Notice." This is because Ms. Hudson and Mr. McConaughey are an energetic, well-matched comic pair, and because the writers have smuggled a few sharp, funny jokes into the lockstep conventions of the plot. The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons. Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature story for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love? Nobody would, but it's sometimes fun to pretend, just as it's fun to pretend that the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by recession, the Knicks are in the N.B.A. finals and Staten Island is full of people who talk as if they're from Texas (Scott).

"JUST MARRIED," starring Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy. Directed by Shawn Levy (PG-13, 95 minutes). Ms. Murphy and Mr. Kutcher play a pair of dim, perky young newlyweds whose European honeymoon goes terribly awry. The movie is not quite so disastrous. The two leads have a certain squirmy, adolescent sexual chemistry (though various mishaps and squabbles prevent them from actually having sex), but the movie can't think of anything better to do with them than make them bump into doors and furniture and act loud and obnoxious around snooty Continental stereotypes (Scott).

"KANGAROO JACK," starring Jerry O'Connell, Anthony Anderson and Christopher Walken. Directed by David McNally (PG, 88 minutes). A marsupial steals some mob money from a pair of half-wit Brooklynites (Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Anderson), who are pursued across the Outback by various Australian and New York heavies. This might have been amusing, but except for the guilty pleasure of seeing Mr. Walken in yet another unredeemably bad movie, there is very little fun to be had. The movie's crude, dippy humor seems motivated by a deep contempt for its intended audience of school-age children (Scott).

"LOST IN LA MANCHA," with Terry Gilliam. Written and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe (R, 89 minutes). After watching this fascinating and compelling new documentary, you may forever wonder how it is that movies are made at all. "Lost" may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but it is a great story; its directors display dramatic intelligence. "Lost" is an inside view of how a film -- in this case, Mr. Gilliam's "Man Who Killed Don Quixote" -- can fall to pieces, even under the guidance of a master director. Imagine watching a real-life version of Ian McKellen's kindly, indomitable Gandalf in "Lord of the Rings" give his life for his cause, only to find that his supreme gesture is meaningless because his fellows are slaughtered anyway. That's what "Lost" is like. What's clear and astonishingly entertaining about "Lost" is that the directors' only good luck was that they happened to be safely behind the scenes when epic mishaps struck so often on the set that Beelzebub probably put in for overtime (Mitchell).

"THE RECRUIT," starring Al Pacino, Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Roger Donaldson (PG-13, 105 minutes). The C.I.A. setting, the utterly predictable plot twists, the chase scenes and the climactic bout of gunplay may suggest a thriller, but really this slick and pointless exercise belongs to a more specialized genre: the Al Pacino crazy-mentor picture. This time, Mr. Pacino is Walter Burke, whose job is to recruit and train intelligence operatives. "I have a scary eye for talent," he says. What Mr. Pacino displays is his peculiar, and often amusing, gift for ranting, spluttering and braying, and his wildly unpredictable, borderline-incoherent performance is the only interesting thing in the movie. Mr. Farrell, as Burke's troubled protege, James Clayton, an M.I.T. graduate student who seems to have misplaced his shaving kit in all the excitement, works very hard without producing anything like the casual, nutty intensity Mr. Pacino can summon so effortlessly. Ms. Moynahan is James's fellow trainee and love interest, who may or may not be a mole (Scott).

HEADLINE: Strong Franc Skews Swiss Profit Picture 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Switzerland's biggest companies are discovering the pain of being based in a country with a strong, stable currency as they report their annual performance for 2002.
 At first glance, those annual results look discouraging. Sales at Ciba Specialty Chemicals fell 4 percent in Swiss franc terms. At Adecco, the world's largest temporary staffing concern, they plummeted 8 percent in Swiss francs. And the drug giant Novartis, also calculating in Swiss francs, reported a modest 2 percent rise. 
 But a look at the figures in the currencies where the sales were generated gives a brighter -- and more realistic -- picture, companies and analysts say. In local currency terms, Ciba's sales actually rose 3.3 percent, Adecco's dropped only 3 percent and Novartis's soared 11 percent.
Nearly all Swiss blue chips are dependent on markets outside Switzerland to make their big bucks (or euros). And nearly all will see those numbers droop this year when their revenues are converted back to Swiss francs. Frustrated with the resulting headline headache, some say they will change the way they report their results in the future.
Doing so "avoids the volatility, but it doesn't change the reality," said Francois Vassard, the spokesman for Adecco, which will begin to report in euros this year. "In the end, it makes it easier to understand."
Because of its heavy export dependence, and since the European Union created its single euro-zone market, Switzerland alone has this currency problem during reporting season. Spain and the Netherlands had it until they became part of the single market. And Britain, which has kept its own currency, is not as export-dependent.
"Switzerland is so small," said Claude Zehnder, a market strategist for the Zurcher Kantonalbank. "The largest companies in the Swiss market index have more than 90 percent of their revenues in foreign countries."
Moreover, the margins of Swiss companies shrink when costs are incurred in Switzerland but revenues are earned in foreign countries. The strong franc is one reason for the index's lackluster performance, though uncertainties over a faltering economy and a possible war in Iraq have also weighed heavily on the market.
The Swiss franc is close to a record high against the euro and it is trading at four-year highs against the dollar. Currency traders and investors traditionally flock to the Swiss franc in times of economic and political turmoil, favoring Switzerland's steadfast neutrality, low inflation and constant current account surpluses.
The European Union, by far the country's most important trading partner, accounts for more than 70 percent of exports. The United States is the second most important market for most Swiss companies. Depending on how much a company exports, it can lose 6 percent to 10 percent in revenues merely on the currency conversions, Mr. Zehnder calculated.
This year was particularly bad because of the franc's continued rise in strength against both the euro and dollar, though its most marked difference is against the greenback. It traded on average at 1.68 francs the first quarter of 2002. Now the dollar is worth only 1.35 francs. 
Some Swiss companies say that they will begin reporting results in the currency of the country most important to them, to more accurately reflect how the business is doing.
Novartis, for instance, which logs about 42 percent of its sales in the United States, will start reporting in dollars this year. Doing so for 2002 would have shown sales figures mirroring the local currency calculations: an 11 percent rise, instead of that 2 percent rise as calculated in Swiss francs. Operating income, which rose 8 percent in Swiss franc terms, shot up 17 percent in dollar values. Net income, up 4 percent in francs, jumped 13 percent in dollars.
A switch to reporting in dollars, Raymund Breu, Novartis's chief financial officer, said at a news conference last month, reduces currency-induced volatility of earnings.
Adecco, which generates about half of its revenue from countries that use the euro but less than 2 percent from Switzerland, will also change its reporting this year, to euros. Still, a euro accounting would have given the company a 5 percent loss in sales for 2002 -- better than the 8 percent in Swiss franc terms but not as good as the 3 percent as calculated in all local currencies.
Europe's largest biotechnology company, the Geneva-based Serono, has been accounting in dollars since the early 1980's. And the weaker dollar this year did enhance the company's reported results. In dollar terms, revenue in 2002 rose 13.9 percent; in local currencies, including the franc, it rose 11.5 percent.
"Serono has reported in dollars for many years because it more accurately reflects our business and where it is growing" said Allan L. Shaw, Serono's chief financial officer. Though euro countries account for more sales than dollar countries do -- 42 percent versus 33.7 percent -- Mr. Shaw said most of the growth is in North America. Sales in Switzerland account for only 2 or 3 percent of revenue, he added.
Nestle, which has been reporting patriotically and perhaps stoically in Swiss francs for the last 50 years, scoffs at the newcomers.
"If you are a large company based in the world's strongest currency, you get used to it," shrugged Francois-Xavier Perroud, spokesman for Nestle, where 99 percent of sales are outside Switzerland. "You have to live with the fact that every now and then this happens. Over time, it balances out."
In the late 1990's, the dollar's higher value relative to the Swiss franc gave Nestle's balance sheet a more rosy hue. And Mr. Perroud acknowledges that the strong Swiss franc will make current earnings visually less impressive.
Every few years, Nestle's accountants consider switching to dollars, but in the end they stick with the solid franc, Mr. Perroud said, adding, "It really disciplines you." To help investors sort things out, however, Nestle does provides important figures in dollars and euros at the front of its annual report.
Kevin Lyne-Smith, head of group equity research at Bank Julius Baer, said that it made sense for companies to switch to reporting in either dollars or euros, especially since the Swiss stock exchange has ordered all blue chips to start reporting results based on internationally recognized accounting standards.
"Anythingthat unifies and simplifies," Mr. Lyne-Smith said, "will help in the long run."

HEADLINE: Ratings Agencies Not Alarmed by New York Laws 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER with DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Two major Wall Street rating agencies say that new city and state laws against predatory lending in New York do not seem to pose the same risks to investors that a similar measure does in Georgia.
 The New York City law, which would penalize any Wall Street firm that helped finance predatory lending, is, however, prompting several major firms to leave the business of high-cost mortgages, those most vulnerable to abuse. 
 The market for home mortgages in Georgia has been effectively closed since earlier this month, when the major credit agencies stopped rating securities backed by mortgages in the state. The Georgia law allows borrowers who contend they have been victims of predatory lending to sue not only the original lender but also anyone who later buys the mortgage. 
But because New York will not impose the same liabilities on those who buy predatory mortgages in the secondary market, the laws are less worrisome to the two rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.
"On the face of it, these two laws are different from the Georgia law," said Jay Siegel, a managing director at Moody's.
Steve Grundleger, a managing director at Fitch, said that while the agency was "not ready to say we will rate pools that include mortgages from New York State or New York City, we may be able to adequately assess the risks to bondholders that the New York State and New York City legislation creates."
In contrast to Georgia, the New York State law, which takes effect in April, does not specifically allow for punitive damages. For rating agencies, "the potential for punitive damages was a key concern in the Georgia law," Mr. Siegel said.
The New York City law, which takes effect next Thursday, poses even fewer worries because its primary penalty is to exclude anyone involved in predatory lending from doing business with the city for three years. That would not reduce the financial returns for investors in mortgage-backed securities.
While Moody's has not made a formal decision, Mr. Siegel said it was likely that the agency would continue to rate mortgage pools that include loans from New York City.
But the city's law is already having a chilling effect on Wall Street. Firms that violate the law risk losing three years of city business and benefits, which include underwriting municipal bonds, holding city bank deposits and receiving city tax breaks and subsidies.
Because of this risk, J. P. Morgan Chase said it would not make any high-cost loans as defined by the city law, and Bear Stearns said it would not buy or underwrite such loans. According to market participants, Merrill Lynch has already left the high-cost mortgage business. Citigroup said it was "currently assessing the full impact of the recently adopted antipredatory lending laws on our various businesses." Each firm has been the lead underwriter on more than $2.6 billion of New York City municipal bonds since 1999, according to Thomson Financial.
Their response has come despite a provision in city law that allows underwriters to avoid penalties if they do a sampling of the loans they buy and throw out any predatory loans they find. In addition, firms that make or underwrite predatory loans can work with the city's comptroller to avoid penalties.

HEADLINE: On the Second Day, Atlas Waffled 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Dear Alan Greenspan:
 After reading your recent testimony, I'd like to share some Objectivist philosophy with you. As a disciple of Ayn Rand, you'll undoubtedly appreciate it. Here it is, from John Galt's big speech in "Atlas Shrugged": "A is A: non-contradiction." 
 John Galt wouldn't be very happy with you right now.
On Tuesday you went some distance toward repairing your reputation and steering the country away from fiscal disaster. But the next day you appeared to waffle.
In your initial remarks you more or less acknowledged the grim fiscal outlook. As your discussion of "accrual" accounting made clear, you know that if the federal budget took into account the future liabilities of Social Security and Medicare -- as it should -- it wouldn't show the "modest" deficits the White House talks about; it would show a government deep in the red.
Yet here's what you said on Wednesday: "Actually, it turns out that we do not really have a fiscal problem of moment until we get beyond the end of this decade . . . deficits even under the president's program beyond these next two years will be in areas where the rate of debt to G.D.P. does not move up in any way which suggests we are in an unstable system."
There's a strict interpretation in which that statement is true. But it was widely read as a gesture of appeasement to the Bushies, as you surely knew it would be. And neither you nor the country can afford that kind of appeasement. 
Surely you aren't going to let rosy budget projections snooker you, yet again, into supporting irresponsible tax cuts? By now you know that this administration always projects big budget improvement two years ahead; but every six months it marks its projection down another $140 billion or so, blaming outside events. Independent analysts, who take into account the stuff the administration pretends doesn't exist -- the war, the alternative minimum tax, and so on -- think we're looking at deficits of 3 or 4 percent of G.D.P., maybe more, for the next decade. And then it will get much worse.
Moreover, since you advocate accrual accounting, you obviously realize that the ratio of debt to G.D.P. is a highly misleading number. Properly measured, the U.S. fiscal system is already "unstable" -- and the new Bush proposals would quickly push it past what you called the "point of no return."
Fed chairmen aren't allowed to speculate about disaster scenarios, so let me do it for you. If the administration gets what it wants, within a decade -- or perhaps sooner -- the United States will have budget fundamentals comparable to Brazil's a year ago. The ratios of debt and deficits to G.D.P. won't be all that high by historical standards, but the bond market will look ahead and see that things don't add up: the rich have been promised low tax rates, middle-class baby boomers have been promised pensions and medical care, and the government can't meet all those promises while paying interest on its debt. Fears that the government will solve its problem by inflating away its debt will drive up interest rates, worsening the deficit, and things will spiral out of control. 
So why are you still giving these people political cover?
No doubt you're under intense pressure to be a team player. But these guys are users: they persuade other people to squander their hard-won credibility on behalf of bad policies, then discard those people once they are no longer useful. Think of John DiIulio, or your friend Paul O'Neill. It's happening to Colin Powell right now. (A digression: The U.S. media are soft-pedaling it as usual, but the business of the Osama tape has destroyed Mr. Powell's credibility in much of the world. The tape calls Saddam Hussein an "infidel" whose "jurisdiction . . . has fallen," but says that it's still O.K. to fight the "Crusaders" -- and Mr. Powell claims that it ties Saddam to Al Qaeda. Huh? All it shows is that Al Qaeda views a U.S. invasion of Iraq as an excellent recruiting opportunity.)
Two years ago you acted as George W. Bush's enabler; you share part of the blame for our plunge into deficit. But now the situation is truly dire. If you waffle now, and take the easy way out, your reputation -- and the country's finances -- will quickly pass the point of no return.

HEADLINE: Africans Press to Refurbish Zimbabwe's Battered Image 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The presidents of Nigeria and South Africa are urging the Commonwealth nations to reinstate Zimbabwe -- and thus its leader President Robert Mugabe -- to full membership, saying the troubled country has made meaningful progress toward resolving its political crisis.
 Membership was suspended 11 months ago after Mr. Mugabe, Zimbabwe's leader since independence in 1980, won a new term in elections widely regarded as rigged. The move to restore Zimbabwe, which became public this week, has stirred a furor here and abroad with Western officials and supporters of Zimbabwe's opposition accusing the prominent African leaders of closing their eyes to ongoing violence and intimidation. 
 President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria praised "critical developments" in Zimbabwe, including the government's assertions that it will negotiate with the opposition about a power-sharing deal and has ended violent farm invasions.
Meanwhile, a senior official in South Africa said today that Mr. Mugabe had promised to amend harsh laws that bar political meetings and prohibit journalists from criticizing the president and working without government-issued permits.
But there is little evidence to suggest that Mr. Mugabe is keeping his word. Violence and intimidation of opposition supporters, journalists and white farmers have continued since the election last March.
In January, the police arrested and jailed the mayor of Harare for trying to meet with his supporters. Days later, an opposition party legislator was tortured in jail after he was arrested on charges that were later dismissed. This month, the leader of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, is standing trial on charges that he and two colleagues plotted to assassinate Mr. Mugabe. 
Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, who presides over the Commonwealth, is calling for Zimbabwe to be suspended for another year. On Wednesday, the American State Department applauded Mr. Howard's stance. Zimbabwe's suspension is set to expire next month.
"The general feeling is, and what has been presented to me, is that there has not been an improvement in the situation over the last 12 months," said Don McKinnon, the secretary general of the Commonwealth, in a local radio interview.
Critics say the lobbying by Mr. Obasanjo and the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, on Zimbabwe's behalf raises serious questions about their commitment to democracy and good governance.
Last month, African leaders voted as a bloc to ensure that Libya -- a country with what is widely regarded as a deplorable human rights record -- would be elected to chair the United Nations' top human rights body.
Analysts here say such criticism could as easily be made about the United States and other Western countries that have also allied themselves with authoritarian regimes.
Many African leaders are standing by Mr. Mugabe because they believe Western governments are only concerned about the white minority in Zimbabwe, whose officials have redistributed most white-owned farms to blacks in an effort to right the wrongs of history and return land stolen during British colonial rule. 
If Western leaders truly care about democracy, officials say, why are they not complaining as loudly about political repression in overwhelmingly black countries like Swaziland, Eritrea or Liberia? 
African officials say they were mandated by the Commonwealth to promote reconciliation between the opposition and the governing party and to help end Zimbabwe's economic and agricultural crises during its 12-month suspension. They complain that Mr. Howard -- who announced last year's suspension -- was not serious and simply wanted to impose sanctions.
Mr. Obasanjo said that continuing dialogue with Zimbabwean officials and allowing the suspension to lapse would be the best course.
"It is important that we remain positively engaged with Zimbabwe," he said in a letter to Mr. Howard, which was leaked to Zimbabwean and other media this week.
Mr. Obasanjo said Mr. Mugabe has promised to resume talks with the opposition once the opposition agrees to drop its lawsuit contesting the presidential election. Mr. Mugabe also acknowledged police involvement in the attack on the jailed opposition leader, and he said the officers involved would be disciplined. In his letter, the Nigerian leader made no mention of any move to drop the suit against Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, Zimbabwe's main opposition party. 
Mr. Obasanjo said he believed the government was committed to amending its harsh laws when Parliament returns to work this month. "I am assured in this regard the government of Zimbabwe continues to make genuine efforts to respond to such concerns," Mr. Obasanjo said.
Abdul Minty, acting director of South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs, said that Mr. Mbeki also supports dialogue as opposed to suspension or sanctions. "At this stage, we're not asking for any further suspension, no," he said at a news conference today.
Mr. Minty did not respond to repeated questions from journalists seeking examples of how conditions in Zimbabwe have improved over the past year. He said the government of Zimbabwe was prepared to make major concessions in future, but declined to describe the planned moves.
In Zimbabwe, opposition leaders say they feel betrayed by Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Obasanjo. Both presidents lead countries that have only recently been liberated from brutal, dictatorial regimes. Yet, opposition leaders say, these men are willing to ignore the plight of those suffering under similar circumstances. 
"Mbeki and Obasanjo on their part have clearly decided to abdicate their responsibility leaving the people of Zimbabwe exposed to mortal danger," said Paul Nyathi, a spokesman for the opposition.

HEADLINE: Unreal 'Real' Figures and Other Good News 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IS it just war and terrorism worries? Or is there something fundamentally wrong with the economy?
 The most revealing part of Alan Greenspan's Congressional testimony this week came when he tackled the issue of what happens to the economy when the war with Iraq is over. 
 If geopolitical "uncertainties diminish considerably in the near term," Mr. Greenspan said, "we should be able to tell far better whether we are dealing with a business sector and an economy poised to grow more rapidly -- our more probable expectation -- or one that is still laboring under persisting strains and imbalances that have been misidentified as transitory." 
In other words, is the burst bubble still causing damage that an easy monetary policy cannot solve?
That is an important question for Mr. Greenspan's legacy, and his legacy should be far more important to him than the question of whether President Bush will offer him another term as Federal Reserve chairman in 2004.
When stocks were soaring, Mr. Greenspan cited estimates by Wall Street analysts to justify high-technology stock prices and promised that the Fed would be able to handle any economic problems if a bubble were to burst. But after the bubble did burst, neither Mr. Greenspan nor the Bush administration appears to have understood the extent to which the bubble had inflated tax revenue -- largely through taxes on capital gains and stock options -- and did not realize how rapidly tax receipts were going to decline.
Mr. Greenspan has kept his rose-colored glasses and, unlike some investors, has retained his faith in Wall Street analysts. In the Fed's semiannual Monetary Report to the Congress, released this week, the principal measure of stock market valuation the Fed uses is dependent on Wall Street forecasts of pro forma earnings. (The forecasts look pretty good, as it turns out.)
Another good sign, the Fed says, is that spending on computer equipment "rose 25 percent in real terms" in 2002, a gain that "more than reversed the previous year's decline."
The discovery that computer spending is at record levels will come as a surprise to investors in such companies, as well as to executives who keep cutting budgets for such spending. In fact, spending is not up much. The "real" number comes from the government's adjustments for the fact that computers keep getting better.
Even if those adjustments are reasonable, which is questionable, they reflect no increases in income or jobs. The Commerce Department report from which the Fed got its numbers warns that "the estimates for computers are especially misleading." The Fed report did not pass on that warning.
Nor did the Fed mention that spending on computers, measured in actual dollars, grew only 0.3 percent in 2002, and was 20 percent below the record set in 2000. And, points out Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, Labor Department figures show computer industry employment fell 12.6 percent in 2002.
Over all, the economy is growing slowly and unevenly. The strongest retail sales numbers now come from gasoline stations, where sales in January were up 18.5 percent from a year ago. They may rise even more if a war with Iraq drives oil prices up even further, but that will not be a sign of economic strength.
Investors are depressed. Over the last month, the major stock averages are down about 12 percent, and the declines have hit 94 percent of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500. Such relentless declines are often followed by a rebound, and one could come even without a conclusion to the Iraqi dispute. But Mr. Greenspan has good reason to worry whether the economy has other ills.

HEADLINE: State G.O.P. Legislators Think the Unthinkable 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The corridors of the Capitol here, where Republicans control everything, are abuzz with talk about taxes. Not about cutting them. Raising them.
 "It's killing us," Senator John L. Valentine, the majority whip, said of the party leadership. "We don't want to have tax increases on our watch." 
 They might have no choice. Lawmakers here and elsewhere have reached a point where they say they can no longer cut their way out of crippling deficits that have put states in the worst financial shape since World War II. 
Faced with rising costs in health care and education, new domestic security programs and a slow economy, at least 24 states -- 13 with Republican governors -- are now considering ways to raise taxes even as President Bush is pushing for permanent federal income tax cuts to stimulate the economy. And much of the talk around the states is coming from Republicans, for whom raising taxes is anathema to their political souls.
Among them, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, who has cut taxes 48 times, has proposed increasing sales and cigarette taxes for three years, calling it "one of the toughest decisions of my career." 
Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada wants new business taxes, property taxes, amusement taxes, gambling taxes and gross receipts taxes, telling Nevada residents, "The state of our state is fragile."
Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas told residents that without new taxes there would no money for teacher raises, scholarships, prescription drugs for the elderly and that "we'll have to have a massive early release of thousands of inmates."
Not that Democratic-led states have it any easier. In California, where the projected deficit is $35 billion, the highest of any state, lawmakers are considering higher income taxes. Gov. Bob Holden of Missouri has proposed eliminating tax loopholes, raising gambling taxes and adding a tax surcharge on households earning more than $200,000 a year to help close a projected $1 billion shortfall. Gov. Bob Wise of West Virginia, where the gap may reach $200 million next year, wants to triple the state cigarette tax. 
"We're all in the same boat," Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said of states like his, where tax increases are all but certain. "It's not part of what we want to do, and we take these steps very reluctantly, only as a last resort. We've cut as deeply as we can and we'll cut some more. We're pretty much at the end of the line, but we don't want to jeopardize public health and safety."
"The risk we run," Mr. Taft added, "is that we may entirely negate the effect of the federal stimulus." 
Nearly every state is careening toward high deficits as the 2004 fiscal year approaches, in June for most states. By then, the National Conference of State Legislatures predicts, the cumulative gap of the states will reach $70 billion or more. 
All states have been cutting spending. Some are reducing benefits for the poor, elderly and disabled. Some are releasing prisoners early. Some are shortening the school year. 
With much wrangling ahead, it remains uncertain whether any of the states will actually take the fateful step of raisingtaxes. But it seems inevitable in many, especially with the rising costs of federal programs and little federal money to help pay for them. Officials in many states blame Washington for making their situation worse. 
A recent survey found higher taxes on cigarettes or alcohol products under study in 15 states, higher income taxes in 7 and higher sales taxes in 6.
In Utah, where 78 of 104 lawmakers are Republican, as is the three-term governor, Michael O. Leavitt, talk of raising taxes began only recently with the looming certainty that the state will be unable to meet urgent needs in public education.
Utah has the highest birth rate of any state and spends the least per pupil in public schools, and that combination has created what a blue ribbon panel appointed by Mr. Leavitt called "an impending crisis" that could leave the state as much as $100 million short with a growing number of overcrowded classrooms, overworked teachers and a projected enrollment increase of 100,000 children over the next decade. 
Utah has raised taxes before. In the last eight years, lawmakers have passed 15 tax increases, raising $201 million. But they have also cut taxes 37 times over the same period, saving $1.6 billion. 
Mr. Leavitt and another leading Republican, Representative Martin R. Stephens, the House speaker, say they are not yet convinced it is time to raise taxes again. Mr. Leavitt has proposed raising the education money by adjusting water rates and delaying road construction. 
Mr. Stephens said, "I choose to be an optimist," insisting that "raising taxes should be the last thing we should do."
But other Republicans dismiss those positions as political posturing. Mr. Leavitt has not ruled out running for a fourth term in 2004, and Mr. Stephens, an eight-term member of the House, is widely known to be considering a run for governor.
While Mr. Leavitt conceded that even members of his own party "do not like my ideas" and Mr. Stephens said "it's very unusual to hear talk in these hallways" about tax increases, lawmakers are floating at least three plans that would cover the education needs by raising taxes. It is too soon to know their prospects for passage, but lawmakers say the discussion reflects a quantum shift in thinking, especially among Republicans.
"I know this is terribly wrenching for them," Representative Patricia W. Jones, a Democrat, said of her Republican colleagues. "It's like trying to convert the pope to Mormonism."
The most ambitious plan comes from Ms. Jones and a Republican lawmaker, Representative Steve Mascaro, who are sponsoring a bill that would remove tax exemptions for children, eliminate deductions for federal taxes and overhaul all the state's tax brackets, changes that Mr. Mascaro said would generate about $90 million in new revenues for education.
"The idea that Republicans and Democrats would get together is a little extraordinary," Mr. Mascaro said. "We're having a hard time getting the Republican leadership to listen. But we'll see what happens."
He and Ms. Jones discussed their ideas with Mr. Leavitt on Monday.
"He listened intently," Ms. Jones said. "He didn't commit to anything, but I didn't expect him to." 
A second plan involves raising the state sales tax. A third would increase income and corporate taxes. 
Senator Leonard Blackham, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was "very concerned about raising taxes" for the effect it would have on families.
"But we're there now," Mr. Blackham said. "Cuts are getting very difficult. I don't see raising taxes if it were not for our education needs, and I believe most Republicans somewhat agree with that." 
While Governor Leavitt said he was sticking with his plan, he did not slam the door on the possibility that he would sign a tax increase if it reached his desk.
"Nothing's off the table, I guess," he said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: IMPATIENCE IN WASHINGTON; 
Defenders of Close Ties With Europe Are Now on the Defensive in the U.S.

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
American impatience with France and Germany, the powers at the heart of continental Europe, has reached a fever pitch.
 All week, members of Congress have been denouncing France and Germany. A favored theme is their supposed ingratitude after being saved from disaster in World War II and defended by American troops throughout the cold war. There have been calls for boycotts of French products, including wines and cheeses. 
 The theme has echoed through editorial pages across the country. "The United States saved France's bacon in World War II," the Tulsa World editorialized on Wednesday. "The United States has long stood by and protected Europe. But this is not a question of payback. It's simply a matter of doing the right thing."
The Boston Herald wrote, "The graves of soldiers" should serve as "a timely reminder that there is no appeasing a tyrant, not then and not now."
Anti-Europeanism is almost certainly not as prevalent in the United States as anti-Americanism is in Europe. One reason is that while an all-powerful America looms large in the minds of Europeans, Americans do not think much about European military or economic activity at all. But the Iraq crisis appears to have prompted a growing view of a feckless Europe unready to make the tough choices that many Americans now see as necessary for the West's security.
"I'm concerned about it," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, referring to anti-European sentiment. "This is an awkward political moment. But politics has lots of awkward moments. Professionals are usually able to work their way through them."
Notwithstanding Mr. Lugar's comments, this has been a difficult time for longtime American advocates of the alliance with Europe. The French and German rebuff to an American-backed United Nations resolution authorizing force against Iraq has placed Europeanists in the State Department on the defensive.
Those with more unilateralist views, on the other hand, have seen their positions reinforced. Richard Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board, which advises the Pentagon, said, "I think we have to abandon the romantic, nostalgic notion of the United States and the members of the European Union as allies working to achieve a common policy," adding that he was speaking for himself and not the administration.
Mr. Perle added that France seemed to see itself as a "counterweight" to American influence rather than an ally. Perhaps, he added, the United States should respond by seeing itself as a counterweight to Europe.
But this idea is anathema to the State Department, where Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has been defending the importance of European ties, even as he has demanded that France and Germany work with the United States to threaten the use of force against President Saddam Hussein.
"Many people in this government are alarmed over the rhetoric ricocheting around on both sides of the Atlantic," said a State Department official. "But when we get over this shouting match, and you look at our relationship with Europe, you will see that these people are our friends. Our longtime friends."
Mr. Powell has had his ups and downs with the French, particularly after President Bush's "axis of evil" speech a year ago. It was denounced by Hubert Vedrine, then the foreign minister, as "simplistic."
Mr. Powell dismissed Mr. Vedrine as a victim of "the vapors," and last summer the foreign minister was replaced by Dominique de Villepin, who started out with a good relationship with Mr. Powell but who more recently has angered him with his uncompromising demand for inspections to continue in Iraq as an alternative to war.
What dismays the wing of the administration that defends strong ties with Europe is that by alienating France and Germany, the United States is diminishing the possibility -- even if they do not join in a military action against Iraq -- of them sharing the burdens of keeping the peace after a war, and supplying Iraqis with food, medicine and other forms of relief.
Longtime students of the European-American relationship note that there have many troubled times in the past, each time provoking a wave of denunciations of the French in particular as passive, ungrateful, selfish and unrealistic about the dangers facing the West.
During the early 1980's, President Ronald Reagan tangled with President Francois Mitterrand of France over the French insistence on building a natural gas pipeline to the Soviet bloc countries. Mr. Mitterrand stood by Mr. Reagan's proposal to install medium-range missiles in Europe, but that move provoked anti-American protests across the Continent, particularly Germany.
"The current crisis has brought back a lot of old cliches," said Stanley Hoffman, professor of international relations at Harvard. "How the French haven't mattered for 75 years, how we saved Europe twice. This is one more episode in a long history of disagreements."
But Mr. Hoffman said the current disagreements had been aggravated by what he called the unusually imperious tone coming from Washington.
"I don't think the tone was quite as strong during the cold war," he said. "The accepted notion is, if someone disagrees with us, they are wrong, without examining whether isn't something right on both sides. One should not treat one's allies as if they are satellites. We used to condemn the Soviets for doing that."
Administration officials say anti-European sentiments have widened the divide within the circle around Mr. Bush over whether to work with allies on crises or to act alone in pursuit of American interests.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's advisers warned last year that a major American investment in trying to get a United Nations resolution on inspections first, and then on the use of force against Iraq, would be unsuccessful and paralyzing.
Some of these same officials are arguing that France and Germany can now be disregarded as the United States seeks support among other European nations, even though France and Germany account for a large share of the European economy. 
But others are worried that such a stance would amount to rash disregard of important friends. "We just have to separate the wheat from the chaff on this debate," said Mr. Lugar. "My guess is that at some stage, the Europeans will recognize -- especially if we keep visiting with them long enough -- that Iraq poses a threat to our national survival. I think we'll keep our cool sufficiently not to become too critical of our friends."

HEADLINE: Wall St. Firms Are Faulted In Report onEnron's Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Wall Street banks, acting on the advice of leading lawyers and accounting firms, helped Enron devise shelters that let the company operate tax-free for years while exaggerating its reported profits by billions, the Senate Finance Committee was told today.
 Senators said that the findings, in a three-volume report by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, raised disturbing questions about the reliability of corporate financial reporting. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the committee, said that "the report reads like a conspiracy novel." He and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the ranking Democrat, pledged to campaign for legislation closing abusive tax shelters and to push for further reform of accounting rules and enforcement of ethical standards governing accountants and lawyers.
At a hearing on the report today, Lindy L. Paull, chief of the joint committee staff, said that Enron's tax department "was converted into an Enron business unit, complete with annual revenue targets." 
The tax shelters were intended to allow Enron to book $2 billion of profits almost immediately, even as the company was saving $2 billion of federal income taxes over a period of years, according to the report.
The tax savings and the manufactured profits "were mostly from internal machinations where we couldn't find any benefit to the company," Ms. Paull said.
The front page of one tax shelter deal, known as the Steele Project, was titled "Show Me the Money!"
The transactions, according to the report and testimony at the hearing today, relied on technical interpretations of the differences between tax and accounting rules to allow Enron to deduct some dollars from its tax liabilities more than once, treat some of the company's capital as an expense and generate tax losses while creating the appearance of profits.
Most of the shelters were put together in the 1990's by Wall Street firms, led by Bankers Trust, which has since been purchased by Deutsche Bank. It was paid more than $40 million by Enron for the shelters, according to the report.
One shelter used a "triad" of Cayman Islands entities to hide money from the Internal Revenue Service, an example of what the report said were transactions so complex that the I.R.S. lacked the capacity to deal with them.
The report also found that Enron's board was so lax in overseeing compensation for the company's 200 top executives that it appeared that no request for a bonus or other extra pay was ever turned down. 
One executive, Lou L. Pai, was given part ownership of a Hawker corporate jet, although the chairman of the board's compensation committee said he could not recall approving that deal, the report said. Supporting records for many payments could not be found, it said, though Enron cooperated with the Congressional investigators.
"Enron's very top executives essentially wrote their own compensation," Ms. Paull said. 
The use of tax shelters has become so widespread among the 10,000 largest corporations that their effective tax rate was just 20 percent in 1999, according to the I.R.S. That was far below the statutory rate of 35 percent and well below the tax rate of the next 31,000 companies, which experts say are too small to attract much interest from tax shelter promoters. Several studies by economists have suggested that tax shelters allow companies to deprive the government of about $50 billion annually in tax revenues.
The report, the first detailed look by the government at Enron's tax practices, found that the company paid huge fees to banks, law firms and accounting firms to set up the shelters, often in what Ms. Paull said was a collusive manner. She said that the tax and accounting opinion letters that Enron obtained from top-flight advisers ignored or glossed over accounting and legal issues that made the deals untenable.
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, one of the most influential law firms in Washington, was paid a $1 million fee for an opinion letter for one of three shelters it advised on, the report said, adding that the firm was to be a participant with Enron. The law firm apparently was replaced at the last minute. 
"We would question the independence of the advisers" in these deals, Ms. Paull said. "We would say at a minimum that they turned a blind eye to some critical facts."
Kristin White, an Akin, Gump spokeswoman, said that the firm would not comment.
In her testimony, Ms. Paull also criticized an 85-page opinion letter by William S. McKee and James D. Bridgeman of McKee, Nelson, Ernst & Young, a tax boutique set up by the Ernst & Young accounting firm. Ms. Paull said that letter, for which Enron paid more than $1 million, skirted crucial issues that made the deals improper. The report said that one part of the opinion "may not be patently false, but it understates" a crucial issue.
The shelter, called Project Cochise, involved the transfer of real estate interests subject to accounting and tax rules that do not match. This both generated income and deductions, which were inflated by taking some of them twice.
Mr. McKee said in an interview that he still believed that "the opinion is fine" and that the shelter it reviewed so carefully conformed to the tax laws that he did not even regard it as aggressive.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said that "instead of drilling for oil and gas, Enron was drilling the tax code, looking for ways to find more and more tax shelters."
Senator Grassley said that "what hit me the most was the moral fiber of the people involved," who he said displayed "unbridled greed and blatant disregard for the law of fairness."
Together with Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus said that the findings showed that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board needed to review their rules and that the relevant ethics boards should investigate the lawyers and accountants involved in the shelters.
"The day of reckoning has come for shelter promoters," Mr. Grassley said. Noting that many in the hearing room were from accounting, banking and legal firms that sell tax shelters, he vowed to win passage of an ironclad law that would outlaw every abusive tax shelter in existence.
"We have to hunt them down, we have to shut them down and do whatever it takes to purge that cancer from our system," Mr. Grassley said. "It may take years or it may take only months."
In recent days, the S.E.C., the Justice Department and FinCEN, the government's agency for investigating money laundering, have all asked the Cayman Islands government for details of Enron's business dealings there, according to one person involved in the inquiries. Cayman authorities have agreed to cooperate with at least two of the requests, this person said.
The report found that the financial manipulations at Enron that cost so many investors and employees their savings could have been halted much sooner had the I.R.S. acted on information it obtained in an audit of Enron's 1993 and 1994 tax returns.
In 1998, the report said, an unnamed I.R.S. appeals officer concluded that Enron's reports to shareholders "fooled" both investors and securities regulators about its financial condition. 
"Should the I.R.S. condone this?" the appeals officer asked in a memo. 
The officer, the report said, made strenuous attempts to persuade the I.R.S. to reject Enron's position, but was thwarted at every step by the I.R.S. national office. 
The I.R.S. settled the audit issues in tax court, without any disclosure of the suspicions about Enron's financial statements, on Oct. 1, 1999, more than two years before the company's collapse into bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: AID; 
U.N. Planning To Feed Iraqis In a War, Annan Says

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON with JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council today that the United Nations was planning to feed up to 10 million hungry Iraqi civilians and care for at least 2.6 million refugees in the wake of an American-led war in Iraq.
 Saying that his organization was moving to a "higher level of preparedness" for military conflict in Iraq, Mr. Annan met with the 15 Council ambassadors in his offices here to appeal for $120 million to pay for urgent contingency planning. 
 Mr. Annan emphasized repeatedly that he did not regard war as inevitable and that he was engaging only in "prudent" advance planning, according to diplomats who attended the session. But the midday meeting added to the sense here that the start of American military action to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq might be only weeks away. 
The figures Mr. Annan cited filled in a newly specific picture of the tremendous displacement and hardship that the United Nations is anticipating for Iraq's civilians in the event of war. 
Kenzo Oshima, the top United Nations official for emergency relief aid, said the organization had already moved food, shelter and health supplies into the region to care for 600,000 refugees both inside Iraq and across its borders. At a news conference after Mr. Annan's closed meeting, Mr. Oshima said that the United Nations was expecting a "huge, gigantic task." 
He noted that the United Nations, through what is called the oil-for-food program, was currently distributing 460,000 tons of food per month in Iraq. This, he said, is "four times the largest quantity we were able to deliver" in the days immediately after the fighting subsided in Afghanistan. 
After 11 years of severe economic sanctions, Iraq's economy is paralyzed, with about 60 percent of the population depending entirely on the United Nations program for their food, he said. The program uses income from Iraqi oil exports to buy food, medicine and other critical goods.
At the session, the American ambassador, John D. Negroponte, said that the Bush administration had already provided $18.3 million for the contingency planning and that there was $40 million more in the pipeline, several participants in the meeting said. Bush administration officials are calculating that about 2.2 million people will become refugees in the fighting. 
In Washington, InterAction, an umbrella organization of 160 relief aid groups, questioned whether the Bush administration was prepared to cope with the humanitarian crisis the United Nations was predicting.
"The U.S. government may be unprepared to mount an adequate response to meet the relief and reconstruction needs of a country in which 60 percent of the people already rely on international donations to live," said Mary E. McClymont, InterAction's president and chief executive. The group has been meeting regularly with officials at the Pentagon to plan aid for Iraqi civilians during and after a war. 
In a confidential planning document dated Jan. 7, Mr. Oshima's office reported that infant mortality rates in Iraq were 2.5 times the level of 1990, when the sanctions were initially imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait. "We can predict a fairly bad situation particularly among children because the malnutrition among children is already high," Mr. Oshima said today.
United Nations and United States officials said today that they expected the world organization to play a major role in caring for refugees and providing food during and after a war because relatively few nongovernmental organizations have aid programs in Iraq. But several Council diplomats acknowledged that the administration's plans could be thrown into doubt if the United States did not obtain another Council resolution to support its war to disarm Mr. Hussein. 
But Mr. Oshima said he has had only "very limited contacts" with the United States military to discuss plans. He said that the United Nations' relief effort could be stymied if Mr. Hussein used chemical or biological weapons against Iraqi civilians to stop the advance of allied troops, as Pentagon officials have predicted. 
Ms. McClymont questioned the administration's willingness to respond to a chemical or biological attack on civilians. 
A senior administration official said that American troops would do whatever they could to help civilians injured in such attacks. 
"To the extent that military doctors have time, I'm sure they would tend to people if they could," the official said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE POLL; 
Poll Finds Most In U.S. Support Delaying a War

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Even after the administration's aggressive case for going to war soon in Iraq, a majority of Americans favor giving United Nations weapons inspectors more time to complete their work so that any military operation wins the support of the Security Council, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
 The public supports a war to remove Saddam Hussein. But Americans are split over whether the Bush administration and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell have made a convincing case for going to war right now, even though much of the public is inclined to believe that Iraq and Al Qaeda are connected in terrorism. 
 The poll found that while the economy still commands the greatest concern among Americans, the prospect of combat in Iraq, fear of terrorism and the North Korean nuclear standoff are stirring additional anxieties.
These worries may be taking a toll on Mr. Bush's support. His overall job approval rating is down to 54 percent from 64 percent just a month ago, the lowest level since the summer before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
Three-quarters of Americans see war as inevitable, and two-thirds approve of war asan option. But many people continue to be deeply ambivalent about war if faced with the prospect of high casualties or a lengthy occupation of Iraq that further damages the American economy. Twenty-nine percent of respondents in the poll, which was conducted Monday through Wednesday, disapprove of taking military action against Iraq. 
With major decisions of war and peace still pending, 59 percent of Americans said they believed the president should give the United Nations more time. Sixty-three percent said Washington should not act without the support of its allies, and 56 percent said Mr. Bush should wait for United Nations approval.
As concurrent crises converge on the White House, including a rancorous conflict within the NATO alliance over Iraq war planning, President Bush's job approval ratings have lost ground across the board. Fifty-three percent of Americans disapproved of the way he is handling the economy, and 44 percent disapproved of his overall management of foreign policy.
Though 53 percent of Americans said they approved of the way Mr. Bush is handling Iraq, only 47 percent approved of his foreign policy management over all. 
Moreover, a year and a half after the Sept. 11 terrorist assault, only a third of Americans said they think the United States and its allies are winning the antiterror campaign, while 38 percent think that neither side is winning and 20 percent regard the terrorists as still having the upper hand. Only 49 percent of Americans think Mr. Bush has a coherent plan for dealing with terrorism.
If historic trends hold, a decision by Mr. Bush to go to war, even without United Nations backing, is likely to rally the country behind the president. Still, these poll results indicate that the reluctance many Americans feel about the costs of war represent a significant political risk for the Bush administration.
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 747 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. 
Americans, overwhelmingly, continue to take the threat of terrorist attacks very seriously, with 80 percent saying that another attack is either "very" or "somewhat" likely within the next few months. And the number of Americans paying closer attention to news media reports about the prospect of war has increased to 71 percent from 43 percent since September. 
Still, while there is a high degree of awareness, substantial conflict and confusion exist among the public about Iraq and the antiterror campaign, so much so that 42 percent of those polled said they believed Saddam Hussein was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. Neither the Bush administration nor any other authority has alleged such involvement. 
More than anything, Americans remained concerned about the threat of Qaeda terrorism far more than any threat from Iraq, though concern about the threat from Baghdad has gained some ground. 
In January, 59 percent of the public saw Al Qaeda as a greater threat to peace and stability than Iraq. Fifteen percent saw Iraq as the greater threat. In this week's survey, 28 percent saw Iraq as the greater threat, but 51 percent still perceived the Qaeda threat as more serious.
"I think Al Qaeda is a bigger threat because they are in little pockets all over the world," said Nancy Alonso, 66, of Lincoln, R.I. "That is more dangerous than having them in one big place." 
Ms. Alonso, a retired nurse, was one of the poll respondents interviewed after the survey was taken. She said she was concerned that the rest of the world might "turn on us" if Mr. Bush failed to pursue his goals with patience and diplomatic skill. "The administration is pushing too quickly for war," she said, adding that the inspectors should get six months to a year to complete their task.
At the same time, poll respondents gave Mr. Bush credit for explaining his administration's position on Iraq than they did six months ago, when 64 percent felt he had not explained his policy.
Those who said they believe the Bush administration has clearly articulated a rationale for attacking Iraq has nearly doubled, to 53 percent from 27 percent in September.
But more information has not translated into greater support for war, which remains at 66 percent. A year ago, a CBS News poll recorded 74 percent in favor of military action against Iraq. The support level for war has held firm at two-thirds of Americans, but this majority breaks down on questions of timing and diplomacy.
"I think if we gave weapons inspectors more time, perhaps countries like France and Germany would change their minds," said Rocky Ostermeyer, 42, who owns a landscaping company in Tucson. "It would help if we were more united," Mr. Ostermeyer added, referring to efforts by Paris and Berlin to extend and strengthen the United Nations inspection process until it is clear that it has no chance of succeeding. 
In Appleton, Wis., Ruby Neilson, 74, a retired nursing assistant, said: "I think we should give the weapons inspectors more time because that may help prevent a war. I am very afraid of war."
As to how much time, Mrs. Neilson said she was not in a hurry.
"They should have as much time as it takes, three months at least," she said. After the inspectors have exhausted their search activities, "if they think there are weapons still hid, then they could just say let's get it over with."
The poll was taken five days after Mr. Powell's speech to the United Nations laying out the administration's case for war. Polls taken immediately after Mr. Powell's presentation to the Security Council showed a marked increase, up to 70 percent, in support for military action. But that has decreased in recent days. 
It was not clear from the poll just how much Mr. Powell's popularity has influenced public support for the war. 
Respondents to the poll showed the same ambivalence about the war and its potential consequences whether they were responding to a question about Mr. Powell's view or the Bush administration's view in general.
It was clear, though, that whether it is the Bush administration or Mr. Powell in particular, the case for war has not been fully made. The public is not convinced that Mr. Bush has tried hard enough to use diplomacy to avoid war. Poll respondents were divided, 45 percent to 48 percent, over whether Mr. Bush has tried hard enough to reach a diplomatic solution or whether he has been too quick to get military forces involved.
Bert Jarvis, 66, a retired Methodist minister from Amarillo, Tex., said a lot would depend on the report on Friday to the Security Council by Hans Blix, the chief weapons inspector.
"I'm from Texas and I understand Bush's mindset: just go get the bad guys," Mr. Jarvis said. But he cautioned that more time was needed. "Probably not past a year," he said, but more time.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Monday through Wednesday with 747 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
U.S. WILL ASK U.N. TO STATE HUSSEIN HAS NOT DISARMED

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER with ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is drafting a United Nations Security Council resolution with Britain declaring that Saddam Hussein has failed to disarm, and must now face unspecified "consequences," senior administration officials said today.
 The resolution, which they expect to present next week, is designed to counter efforts by France and Germany to give the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq more heft and more time, an approach that administration officials insist would be futile. Senior officials describe the drafts of the resolution as a short restatement of key passages of Resolution 1441, passed unanimously in November. 
 It would conclude, one official said today, with "words to the effect that Saddam didn't avail himself of his final chance to disarm, and will now face the 'serious consequences' we've been talking about." It makes no specific reference to military action, although that is clearly the intent. 
The Security Council is scheduled to meet Friday morning to hear another update from the leaders of the inspection teams, Hans Blix and Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei. In advance of their presentations, President Bush, speaking today to thousands of sailors at the Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville, Fla., challenged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi compliance with 17 resolutions the Security Council has passed regarding it since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
"The decision is this for the United Nations: When you say something does it mean anything?" Mr. Bush said, standing in front of the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and alongside a Navy cruiser that launched some of the first Tomahawk missiles into Afghanistan. Mr. Bush said he was still "optimistic" that the Security Council would show "backbone" and confront Iraq.
"I believe when it's all said and done, free nations will not allow the United Nations to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society," Mr. Bush said.
But France and Germany continue to press the case that Mr. Hussein is contained as long as inspectors are in the country, and that Mr. Bush is simply rushing the schedule to meet the Pentagon's desire to conduct military action when the weather is still cool. France, Russia and China -- each of which has differing levels of reservations -- are all permanent members of the Security Council, with the power to veto any resolution.
Mr. Bush's aides do not seem especially concerned about the prospect of a veto. But they concede they do not know if they have the votes to pass what one official called "a clearly worded resolution." Several officials expressed fear today that the deep divide over Iraq that has already triggered a crisis within the NATO alliance -- a formal meeting of NATO ambassadors was called off today -- may soon engulf the European Union.
Clearly worried about that prospect, Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, wrote a letter today to his fellow European Union leaders, demanding that they support military action when they meet next week. 
"While we all of course regard military action as a last resort," Mr. Blair said, "we must make clear that no member state rules it out if needed to uphold the authority" of the Security Council.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, appearing before the House Budget Committee, repeated that he was still hopeful that the United States could bridge differences with European allies. He argued that much depends on the report from the weapons inspectors on Friday, including their finding that Iraq had violated limits imposed by the Security Council on the range of its missiles.
"I think this is a serious matter," Mr. Powell said of this finding, though other experts say that if the Iraqi missiles had greater range than permitted, it was by a margin of 20 to 30 miles. "It shows, if that's what he confirms tomorrow in his presentation, it shows continued Iraqi noncompliance and it would be a serious matter."
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, dismissed the reports about the missiles when he arrived in Italy today to meet Pope John Paul II at Vatican City.
"There is no serious violation," he told reporters. "It should not be exaggerated."
In an interview published today in Italy's leading newspaper, Corriere della Sera, Mr. Aziz called Mr. Bush "the new Hitler," and questioned why the Italian government has sided with him. "What have we done to the Italians?" he was quoted as asking. 
Mr. Bush's aides are increasingly frustrated by calls from France and Germany -- and Russia -- to take more time with inspections, while containing Iraq's power.
They argue that Mr. Bush yielded to calls last year that he take the issue to the Security Council, patiently negotiated over the content of Resolution 1441 over seven and a half weeks, and agreed to seek a second resolution. But they say that the moment has finally come for the enforcement of the resolution -- and it is time for the rest of the world to move toward Mr. Bush's position, and acknowledge Iraq's refusal to disarm.
The president seemed to give voice to his frustration today in Florida, where the martial background chosen for his remarks made clear that he is ready for military action.
"At any moment during the last 97 days -- and during the last 12 years -- Saddam Hussein could have completely and immediately disarmed himself. Instead, he's used all this time to build and to hide weapons. He must be hoping that by stalling he'll buy himself another 12 years."
"He's wrong," the president said to applause.
Mr. Bush continues to insist, in public and in private, that he is fully prepared to assemble a coalition outside of the Security Council. But a range of his closest allies have cautioned him in recent days that the broader the consensus he can build within the United Nations, the quieter the streets of Europe and Southeast Asia may be if war breaks out. 
"This isn't something we need," a senior American official said of the additional resolution, "but rather something that would make the politics of this a lot easier for friends and allies. So we'll give it a try."
Although Mr. Bush said that military force was still a last option, his remarks at the naval station were taken as a battle cry toward what the sailors said was the foregone conclusion of an American attack on Iraq.
"There's no if, it's only when it's going to happen," said Freddy Patell, 18, an airman apprentice on the carrier John F. Kennedy, which returned here last August after four months in the North Arabian Sea. "The sooner the better. Just go get it over with and stop worrying."
The White House carefully paired the president's combat talk to the sailors with a quick visit to a forum in nearby Jacksonville to promote his 10-year tax cut plan to small business owners -- a tableau designed to stress that Mr. Bush had not lost sight of the nation's economic troubles at a time of threatening war. But the president's trip was intended largely as part of the intensifying White House campaign to rally Americans toward support of the war, and to put pressure on the United Nations Security Council to take on Mr. Hussein by force. 
Mr. Bush spent 40 brisk minutes at the economic forum, changed into a Navy flight jacket, then delivered his most impassioned words in his speech to the sailors, invoking the memory of one of his Democratic predecessors, John F. Kennedy, who understood, he said, "that dangers to freedom had to be confronted early and decisively." The American military, he added, will protect America and its allies from "these thugs."
Echoing comments made this week by his advisers about aid to a post-Hussein Iraq, Mr. Bush said that his quarrel was not with the Iraqis. "In case of conflict, this great nation is already putting plans and supplies into place, so that food and other humanitarian relief will flow quickly to the Iraqi people," Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: Some Unfinished Business Remains in Arena Site Deal 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
As the state chose a plan this week to redevelop the Continental Airlines Arena site as a family entertainment complex, the official euphoria masked a less palpable anxiety over some unfinished business: negotiating a detailed contract and dealing with continuing political opposition to the plan. 
 State and county elected officials -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- agreed today that it was just a beginning when the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority announced on Wednesday that it had chosen the $1.3 billion redevelopment plan by the Mills Corporation and the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation over two competing proposals. 
 The winning project, called Meadowlands Xanadu, promises a mixture of entertainment, sports, shopping, lodging and offices that its supporters believe will draw crowds.
But yet to be addressed are the guarantees that many officials believe they need to ensure that Xanadu remains all that it promises six or seven years from now. 
A particular concern, they said, is that changes in the economy and consumer tastes could force the developers to convert the project's entertainment or office components to retail, turning the project into a mammoth mall that would cannibalize existing stores and malls in the area.
Still undelivered, they added, is a long-sought mass transit connection to the Meadowlands that many state officials and others initially promised. 
And some officials continue to question whether the deal is rich enough, even with its upfront guarantees of about $250 million to the sports authority, which owns the site, and increased annual payments to the 14 surrounding communities.
They said that if Xanadu were wildly successful, it could bring in millions in revenue to the region each year. But at the moment there is no clear mechanism to allow the authority and the region to share in that bounty.
"It's not good that they did that," said the Bergen County executive, Dennis McNerney, a Democrat who was otherwise a big supporter of the Meadowlands Xanadu plan, referring to the state's failure to lock in a profit-sharing arrangement at the outset. 
"In general," Mr. McNerney said, "I think that this helps Governor McGreevey in the county and it helps the sports authority budget." 
George R. Zoffinger, the president and chief executive of the sports authority, said that he and others who will now negotiate with the developers planned to reach some sharing arrangement after revenues reached a certain level.
"We are excited about this," he said of the project, "and think that we have delivered on what we said we would do."
Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Gov. James E. McGreevey, said the governor was sure that the authority would "hammer out the final details in the negotiations that will make the project a home run." 
Hanging over the entire process is a renewed threat that the Meadowlands redevelopment plan -- which was prodded by the New Jersey Nets' and Devils' decision to move from the Continental Arena to a proposed state-supported arena in Newark -- would become mired once again in the state's political wars between cities and suburbs.
Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano, a Bergen County Republican, said that "people in Bergen are still angry about losing the teams, the circus, concerts, ice shows and other attractions at the arena to Newark" and still harbor some hopes of keeping them. 
The Xanadu proposal would allow the Continental Arena to remain in place until 2005, while other attractions are built around it. Both Mr. McNerney and Mr. DiGaetano said they have watched the slow pace of negotiations between Newark and the teams' owners over the new arena, and see some hope for the teams' return to a renovated Continental Arena should those talks collapse. 
Mr. Zoffinger did not discourage such thinking. When asked about this possibility at Wednesday's announcement, a sly grin spread over his face. 
But Richard Monteilh, business administrator for Newark who is involved in the already six-month-long negotiations with the YankeeNets, the teams' owners, insisted that negotiations were going well and that there was "no notion on anybody's part that going back to the Meadowlands was an option." 
Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Bergen County Democrat, said she was concerned about nailing down the provisions for mass transit and other transportation investments at the site. She took issue with Mr. Zoffinger's suggestion that the site's success would attract federal and state dollars for a rail connection. 
Calling that "the-if-you-build-it-they-will-come" approach, she said that the site was already a more proven draw than many of the family entertainment attractions planned by Mills and Mack-Cali. 
The partners have conceded that many of its attractions will be assembled in one location for the first time. Among the proposed attractions are an indoor ski slope, an indoor surfing pool, a miniature Formula One racing oval, wildlife and music museums, a miniature village for role-playing activities by children, a skate park and a minor league baseball stadium.

HEADLINE: House Endorses Stricter Work Rules for Poor 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The House passed a bill today to impose stricter work requirements on poor people who receive cash assistance from the federal government. It also endorsed President Bush's plan for fundamental changes in the landmark 1996 welfare law, widely regarded as one of the most successful experiments in social policy of the last 25 years.
 The House vote, 230 to 192, generally followed party lines: 11 Democrats voted for the bill, and 2 Republicans voted against it. 
 The bill goes now to the Senate, where Republican leaders said it would have a high priority. Senators of both parties said they would try to provide more money for child care. 
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Finance Committee, said he intended to write a bipartisan welfare bill.
"Since the Senate is narrowly divided," Mr. Grassley said, "we can't act as quickly and decisively as the House, but I hope the committee will approve a bipartisan bill in the next few months that the full Senate will then approve."
Senators promised to pay close attention to the concerns of governors, who say the work requirements would impose costly new mandates on states. Currently, states are struggling with the worst fiscal problems since World War II.
House members had little opportunity to hear from state officials or other experts on the bill. The measure was introduced just nine days ago, and the House acted on it without any hearings on it this session.
The bill passed today is similar to one that died in the Senate last year after being approved by the House. Since then, Democrats said, the fiscal condition of the states has deteriorated, and some have cut back welfare and child care programs.
Republicans said the House bill was a logical extension of the 1996 law, which ended a 60-year-old federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children and gave each state a lump sum of money, with vast discretion to run its own welfare program. Since passage of the welfare bill, the number of people on welfare plunged to 5 million in September 2002 from 12.2 million in 1996, a decline of 59 percent.
Still, the House leadership felt the 1996 bill did not go far enough. 
"Even now, after the extraordinary success of the 1996 reforms, the vast majority of welfare recipients still do not go to work every day like the rest of the country," said Representative Tom DeLay, the Texas Republican who is majority leader. Democrats, Mr. DeLay said, would leave the poor "mired in perpetual dependency," with nothing but welfare to cling to.
But Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said: "In 1964, Lyndon Johnson declared a war against poverty. Today, my Republican colleagues and the president have declared a war against the poor."
Republicans counter that the welfare reforms they have championed have benefited low-income people. 
"Nearly three million children have been lifted out of poverty since 1996," said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Another California Republican, Representative Wally Herger, said, "Black child poverty is at a record low, and the welfare rolls have continued to decline over the last two years even though we are in a recession and unemployment rates have risen."
Before the final vote today, the House rejected two Democratic alternatives, by votes of 300 to 124 and 225 to 197.
Democrats argued that House Republican leaders short-circuited the legislative process by rushing the welfare bill to the floor. 
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said: "This legislation is just rubber-stamping George Bush's proposals. Tom DeLay leads the politburo, and he keeps sending things up here."
Republicans said that House committees held more than 20 hearings on welfare in the last two years, and that they saw an urgent need for swift action. Major provisions of the 1996 law expired on Oct. 1, 2002, and have been extended temporarily by stopgap spending bills. 
But Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, noted that there were more than 50 new House members who had no opportunity to study or vote on welfare legislation in the last Congress. 
Mr. McDermott said the Republicans were demanding stricter work requirements because they wanted to "squeeze poor people." But Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said, "Welfare reform has been most successful in states with the most stringent work requirements."
Under the bill passed today, the government would provide up to $300 million a year for programs to promote healthy, stable marriages. The money could be used for premarital education and counseling.
Mr. Stark said this was a waste of money, "inspired by the Republicans' blind allegiance to holy rollers of the Christian right."
Republicans favor state flexibility in other programs, including Medicaid, Head Start and food stamps. But Democrats said the welfare bill was highly prescriptive.
Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said he agreed the 1996 law had been a success but that the House bill "severely restricts state flexibility and attempts to impose a one-size-fits-all approach." 
Another Democratic governor, Gray Davis of California, said states should be able to expand the definition of work to include vocational education. Also, Mr. Davis said, states should be allowed to use federal money to provide welfare benefits to legal immigrants who have not become citizens.
Under one section of the bill, states would have to end aid to a family, including the children, if a parent failed to meet work requirements for two consecutive months. The bill exempts New York, whose Constitution requires the state to provide for "the aid, care and support of the needy." But the exemption lasts only a year. After that, the state could face financial penalties if it did not comply.
Under the bill, states would get a block grant of $16.5 billion a year, the same as under current law. But more welfare recipients in each state would have to engage in work activities for more hours each week.
By 2008, at least 70 percent of a state's adult welfare recipients would have to be engaged in work or job preparation activities, up from 50 percent required under current law. In addition, welfare recipients would have to participate in supervised activities for 40 hours a week, including at least 24 hours of actual work. The comparable figures under current law are 30 hours and 20 hours.
 President Bush wanted to continue child care spending at the current level, $4.8 billion a year, for a total of $24 billion over five years. House Republicans added $2 billion. Democrats wanted to add $11 billion.
 Republicans denied that their bill would impose a straitjacket. Indeed, they said, it encourages states to conduct demonstration projects. Federal officials could waive almost any federal law or regulation on welfare, food stamps, public housing, job training, child care and other programs for low-income people.
 The bill also allows states to use up to 50 percent of their welfare money for child care and other social services. Such transfers are limited to 30 percent under current law.
Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, helped push the 1996 law through Congress as an aide to President Bill Clinton. But today Mr. Emanuel said: "I cannot vote for the Republican bill because it's punitive in nature. You've got to put more money into health care, child care and transportation to help people move from welfare to work."

Japan Economy Grows For a 4th Straight Quarter
Japan's economy expanded 2 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with the previous quarter, defying expectations that growth had stalled and that the fourth recession in a decade had begun.
 As in other quarters, growth was driven by exports and steady gains in consumer spending and capital investment, which offset declines in new-home starts and government spending. But the string of four consecutive quarterly expansions may come to a halt this year if the global economy slows. Page C2. 

Retail sales for January fell 0.9 percent in the United States, pulled down by a drop in demand for cars. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, sales rose 1.3 percent. C12.

HEADLINE: Treasury Secretary Hits the Road to Promote Administration's Tax Cut Proposal 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
For a while today, John W. Snow sounded less like the secretary of the Treasury and more like an evangelist.
 "We are taxing twice the life-blood of capitalism," he said heatedly in the first of many stump speeches he plans to give around the country to promote President Bush's tax plan. "There's a reason we call it capitalism, and that's because it depends on capital." 
 At times sounding folksy, at times sounding like a tough-as-nails chief executive, Mr. Snow told several hundred executives here today that Mr. Bush's plan is based on what some people call "a radical idea." 
"I don't think it's radical," he said, "but some people in Washington think it's radical, and that is that people ought to be able to keep more of their money."
The good news for President Bush today was that Mr. Snow showed he could act like the salesman he is supposed to be.
The bad news is that his reception here, from top executives as well as ordinary people he spoke to at a coffee shop just outside town, was at best mixed.
At an early morning visit to the Senate Coney Island coffee shop in Livonia, Mich., Mr. Snow encountered many people more worried about the plunging stocks in their portfolios thanthey were interested in Mr. Bush's plan to eliminate taxes on stock dividends.
Bob Kunkel, a former engineer at the Ford Motor Company who took early retirement as part of a corporate retrenchment, said the value of his Ford shares had plunged to $128,000 today from $400,000 five years ago.
"Dividends don't do much for me," said Mr. Kunkel, who now owns a small chain of golf shops with his wife. "All I want right now is to work and earn money." 
Many executives in Detroit, meanwhile, wanted to know why Mr. Bush was not giving tax breaks directly to corporations.
Mr. Snow also found himself straddling between the "talking points" he uses in Washington, where White House officials avoid words like "stimulus" because it sounds too much like Democratic-style economic pump-priming, and the concerns of people here who want to see stimulus right now.
"It was a mixed reaction," said Steve Morris, owner of a commercial real estate company in Southfield. "I think they want to see more help to the corporate side. There's just not a lot of demand in the economy."
The Bush administration is on the defensive about its handling of the economy. Starting with Mr. Snow, 15 to 20 cabinet and subcabinet officials will be speaking across the country in the next few weeks to build support for Mr. Bush's plan for a second round of tax cuts, worth an estimated $674 billion over 10 years.
But moderate Republicans in the Senate worry about the proposal's central feature: that elimination of taxes on stock dividends. Estimated to cost the Treasury $385 billion, not only is it expensive, they say, but the overwhelming bulk of dividends flow to the very wealthiest taxpayers.
Democratic lawmakers are overwhelmingly opposed to the plan, and are attacking it as "reckless" and "fiscally irresponsible" because it would lead to big budget deficits for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Bush took a blow on Tuesday when Alan Greenspan, the enormously influential chairman of the Federal Reserve, said it would be "premature" to initiate a new stimulus program and said the tax plan should be offset by either more spending cuts or other tax increases.
"We're having some difficulty, I'll be honest with you," Mr. Snow admitted to people in the coffee shop. "We have a new concept here."
Mr. Snow, a former chief executive of the CSX Corporation, a big rail company, is stepping into a void in the administration that has existed since President Bush fired his first Treasury Secretary, Paul H. O'Neill.
Mr. Snow and Mr. O'Neill are both former chief executives at Fortune 500 companies, but in many ways the two men could not be more different.
Mr. O'Neill had an irrepressible sense of humor and loved to talk about big ideas, but his candor led to embarrassing gaffes.
He infuriated White House officials in 2001, for example, by voicing skepticism about the wisdom of tax cuts.
When Brazil was trapped in a currency crisis last year, Mr. O'Neill sent the country's currency, the real, down even further by saying he did not want aid to Brazil ending up in "Swiss bank accounts."
Mr. Snow, by contrast, has yet to go what White House officials call "off message." With or without a text, he repeats the administration's standard arguments with tireless regularity.
The government's forecast of a record $300 billion deficit this year is "unwelcome" but "understandable." The economy is "surprisingly resilient" but the president will not be satisfied until every person who wants a job has one. Mr. Bush's tax plan would give a family of four with an income of $39,000 a tax reduction of $1,100 a year. Millions of people receive taxable dividends, including many senior citizens.
Mr. Snow said he saw his main job at the moment as selling other people's ideas.
"It's legislation I am proud to be associated with," he said, referring to Mr. Bush's tax proposal. "I was not involved in creating it, but I'm now pleased to be an advocate for it."
Mr. Snow found plenty of support here for two of Mr. Bush's arguments: that the economy needs a stiff jumpstart, regardless of what the Federal Reserve thinks; and that many people are more interested in tax cuts than in balanced budgets.
"Anything that reduces taxes will be a help," said Wes Smith, owner of E & E Manufacturing, a small company in Plymouth, Mich.
Because this is a core region for manufacturing, a sector that has been largely stagnant for two years, the executives attending Mr. Snow's speech at the Economic Club of Detroit agreed with Mr. Smith that they wanted to see more tax relief aimed directly at their own problems.
The first question he was asked following his speech was "Wouldn't it make much more sense to give the tax break to businesses?"
Mr. Snow responded that eliminating dividend taxes at the corporate level would cost more.
"We gave a very clear message to him and that was about our great concern about the state of the economy," said G. Richard Wagoner, the chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, referring to Mr. Snow.
Would the dividend plan restore enough confidence to stir the economy? "It's hard to say, relative to the Iraq situation," Mr. Wagoner. "It could help."

HEADLINE: The Cost of Slavery 

BYLINE:  By Dalton Conley; Dalton Conley, associate professor of sociology and director of the Center for Advanced Social Science Research at New York University, is author of "Being Black, Living in the Red: Race, Wealth and Social Policy in America" and "Honky."

 BODY:
Marching across the South in 1865, Union soldiers seized up to 900,000 acres of "abandoned property." Some radical Northerners hoped to use this land to provide freed slaves with the now-legendary "40 acres and a mule" as restitution for slavery. Their hopes were obviously dashed. But the argument for reparations lives on nearly 140 years later. 
 While few doubt that slavery was a great wrong, the challenge before us is how to make things right through financial restitution. But just how would we devise a practical formula to determine who gets what? 
 Most assessments start with the notion of payment for lost wages. One researcher took 1860's prices for slaves as an estimate of their labor value and applied compound interest. The result: $2 trillion to $4 trillion. Six generations after slavery's demise, such approaches present serious difficulties. There are issues of what to do with whites (and blacks) who immigrated here after slavery ended. What about descendants of blacks who lived freely during the antebellum period? Does someone who is born to a white parent and a black parent cancel out? It would take Solomon to solve this.
Perhaps the issue needs to be looked at differently. One way is to recognize slavery as an institution upon which America's wealth was built. If we take this view, it is not important whether a white family arrived in 1700 or in 1965. If you wear cotton blue jeans, if you take out an insurance policy, if you buy from anyone who has a connection to the industries that were built on chattel labor, then you have benefited from slavery. Likewise, if you are black -- regardless of when your ancestors arrived -- you live with slavery's stigma.
Extending the reparations argument this broadly frees one to move beyond the issue of lost wages and seek out other factors on which to base a formula. If there were one statistic that captured the persistence of racial inequality, it would be net worth. 
The typical white family enjoys a net worth that is more than eight times that of its black counterpart, according to the economist Edward Wolff. Even at equivalent income levels, gaps remain large. Among families earning less than $15,000 a year, the median African-American family has a net worth of zero, while the corresponding white family has $10,000 in equity. The typical white family earning $40,000 annually has a nest egg of around $80,000. Its black counterpart has about half that amount.
This equity inequity is partly the result of the head start whites enjoy in accumulating and passing on assets. Some economists estimate that up to 80 percent of lifetime wealth accumulation results from gifts from earlier generations, ranging from the down payment on a home to a bequest by a parent. If the government used such net-worth inequality as a basis, and then factored in measures like population size, it could address reparations by transferring about 13 percent of white household wealth to blacks. A two-adult black family would receive an average reparation of about $35,000.
What would be the effect of wealth redistribution on such a vast scale? My own research -- using national data to follow black and white adolescents into adulthood -- shows that when we compare families with the same net worth, blacks are more likely to finish high school than whites and are equally likely to complete a bachelor's degree. Racial differences in welfare rates disappear. Thus, one generation after reparations were paid, racial gaps in education should close -- eliminating the need for affirmative action. 
The unpopularity of this radical plan would no doubt be unprecedented. There are also no guarantees that reparations would be a magic bullet for lingering racial problems. That said, it remains vital, especially during Black History Month, to explore formulas and keep the reparations debate alive. It is important because each resulting dollar amount implies a theory of race, history and equal opportunity. That includes the figure implicit in our current policy -- zero -- which rests on the most absurd assumption of all: that slavery didn't matter.

HEADLINE: Underground Shopping

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Pataki Presents Transit Hub Plan" (front page, Feb. 8) reports that city officials and some downtown community groups fear that an underground concourse in the new transportation hub in Lower Manhattan will be similar to the previous concourse at the World Trade Center. 
 This view does not consider the desires of local residents and office workers, who made the prior shopping mall one of the most successful in the country. It combined shopping in a weather-protected environment with convenience to subways.
Some opponents of underground shopping fear that nearby retail businesses will not be able to compete. But there were many successful nearby businesses before 9/11. The concentration of retail stores envisioned by current plans, with some on the street and some in a concourse, can serve as a magnet to draw more shoppers downtown. Restricting consumer choice by eliminating underground shopping is the wrong decision.

HEADLINE: Putting Some Pizazz Back in the Skyline 

BYLINE:  By Sarah Williams Goldhagen; Sarah Williams Goldhagen, a lecturer at the Harvard Design School, is author of "Louis Kahn's Situated Modernism."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
The good news is that two thoughtful and innovative designs were named finalists for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site. Unfortunately, the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease, are under no obligation to use either of these schemes. And thus far, neither has demonstrated much inclination to heed to the public demand for great urban spaces and imaginative architecture. 
 Even if they end up doing the right thing, the confusing -- and to many, disheartening -- course of the trade center redevelopment process has highlighted a widespread problem in the way architecture and urbanism are conceived and practiced in America. For the last few decades, our new buildings and public works have become ever less inspiring and ever less functional. There are many causes for this, including a nationwide patchwork of regulatory schemes that are in some instances overly permissive and in others excessively restrictive. 
 At the root of the problem, however, are two mutually reinforcing factors: an almost total absence of demand for excellent architecture, and a flawed system of undergraduate and professional education that supplies our architects and planners. 
Citizens are the consumers of architecture, but Americans do not receive the education to help them appreciate and judge what they inhabit and, as taxpayers and clients, buy. Few American grade schools or high schools give class time to architecture or urban planning. This has made for clients who have trouble evaluating what they are paying for. Consequently, they are often skittish and overwhelmingly conservative. Those architects and urban designers who do succeed with corporate clients often do so by sacrificing social responsibility, aesthetic innovation and sometimes just plain good judgment. 
We saw this dynamic in the dreadful initial plans for the trade center site, which were abandoned only in the face of public outcry, generated largely through a concerted effort by the city's architects and news media. 
The other part of the problem is on the supply side. Most architecture students enter professional school without undergraduate degrees in architecture or even intensive study in the field. Graduate programs are usually only two to three-and-a-half years -- not enough time for schools to teach the engineering, technology and sociology of architectural and urban design, as well as the business and the politics of the practice, and its art. Most top programs have opted to concentrate on design, often at the expense of training in urbanism, engineering, business and zoning.
As a result, many architects are intellectually unprepared to think about how to create a captivating, monumental complex of buildings that will also create successful urban spaces. This same problem -- little demand, skewed supply -- exists around the country, including Boston, where there is even less chance that the 30 acres of prime downtown real estate opening up in the "Big Dig" project will become an inspiring public realm. 
How to improve the situation? Primary and secondary schools around the country should include some education in architecture and urbanism intheir curriculums. This would help produce clients who appreciate that the marks they make on the urban landscape, good or bad, profoundly affect the public life of society.
Universities should institute more undergraduate programs in architecture and urban design. Graduate schools should stop offering shorter programs for students with undergraduate degrees in architecture. For people entering a profession that requires a remarkably complex set of skills, architects get too little training.
Meanwhile, New Yorkers should keep the pressure on the trade center developers not to dismiss or cynically eviscerate the good designs that have emerged. If the selection process does in the end produce the first successful large-scale architectural and urban project in a generation, it will only be because the catastrophe that cleared the site has, for once, created the public demand for what the public deserves ordinarily and everywhere.

HEADLINE: Arafat Will Appoint a Prime Minister, a Major U.S. Demand 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, announced today that he would appoint a prime minister in a step toward meeting a central demand of the Bush administration for a resumption of the peace process.
 Mr. Arafat did not say who would fill this new post or what powers it would have. Palestinians and Israelis are jockeying to improve their diplomatic positions, in response to domestic political pressures and in anticipation of a revival of the peace process as a result of a possible American war on Iraq. 
 The antagonists here are looking ahead to the aftermath of an Iraq war and to what one top Israeli official called "a fork in the road" in American policy. Each side foresees the Bush administration either seeking to mend fences with European and Arab nations by pressing Israel for concessions or else continuing its tilt toward Israel by treating Mr. Arafat as an outcast.
Mr. Arafat's statement appeared timed to precede a meeting in London early next week of the diplomatic group that has drafted a road map to achieve peace and a Palestinian state in 2005. The group is composed of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.
Mr. Arafat also told diplomats from the group for the first time today that he fully accepted the draft road map, backing off previous objections. Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister, has said he accepts the road map, but he is seeking to change it substantively.
Mr. Arafat made his statements in a meeting in the remnant of his official compound here with representatives of the United Nations, the European Union and Russia. They have had repeated sessions with the Palestinian leader in recent days to press for a prime minister. 
While demanding that Mr. Arafat yield his executive powers to a prime minister, the Bush administration has downgraded its diplomatic communications with him, declining to send senior representatives. 
Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations special envoy, said Mr. Arafat had made "two important steps" in endorsing the road map and the appointment of a prime minister.
"What we now hope and expect is that he will appoint a credible prime minister and an empowered prime minister, and these steps will have to follow," he said.
The extent of the prime minister's powers, and his identity, are likely to be the next contentious issues for diplomats and Palestinian officials.
Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said after meeting with Mr. Arafat today: "It's no secret that Arafat will appoint the prime minister, and the prime minister will be accountable to Arafat. Those who say this will weaken Arafat -- that is not the case." Asked to describe the prime minister's duties, Mr. Erekat said he would "run the cabinet."
Palestinian officials are anxious that the creation of a prime minister not appear to be a foreign initiative. But diplomats here believe that to gain support abroad for the move, Mr. Arafat will have to appoint one of two men: Salam Fayyad, a former official of the International Monetary Fund who became the Palestinian finance minister last year and has been embraced as a reformer by the Bush administration; or Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is second to Mr. Arafat in the Palestine Liberation Organization and has been involved in peace talks with Israel and American diplomats for years.
Mr. Sharon has declared Mr. Arafat irrelevant, while continuing to hold him responsible for stopping Palestinian violence. He has demanded that Mr. Arafat be removed from power as one of several conditions for peace talks. Mr. Sharon's office declined to comment on Mr. Arafat's announcement. 
Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Arafat said he would call for an "immediate meeting" of the Palestinian Legislative Council "to discuss this decision and to take the needed measures." Palestinian officials said the central council of the P.L.O., the umbrella organization over the governing Palestinian Authority, would also need to approve the step. Mr. Roed-Larsen said he expected movement on both fronts "within days."
In 1996, Mr. Arafat was elected president of the Palestinian Authority, which was provided limited autonomy to govern Palestinians under the Oslo accords. It has lost most of that autonomy over the last two years as the conflict with Israel has intensified and Israel has taken back control of territory it had ceded under Oslo.
While he has been under pressure from abroad, Mr. Arafat has also been pressed by Palestinians complaining of corrupt and ineffective governance.
Mr. Sharon has bridled at the role of the four-member international diplomatic group in Middle East diplomacy, harshly criticizing European nations as being biased against Israel. 
Yet since his overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections here last month, Mr. Sharon has renewed direct contacts with Palestinian officials. He has been proposing a formula that has failed amid mutual recriminations in the past, to withdraw Israeli forces from those areas where Palestinians assure Israeli security.
Mr. Sharon's motives are the subject of an intense guessing game in Israeli and Palestinian circles. He is trying to persuade the left-of-center Labor Party to join a new unity government. That has led some diplomats here to dismiss as mere coalition politics his contacts with Palestinians, which have been leaked to the Israeli press.
Israel is also facing a profound financial crisis, which Mr. Sharon has linked to the conflict with the Palestinians. He has told other leaders of his Likud Party that progress with the Palestinians is essential to shoring up Israel's economy.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Rises 0.7% 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Though consumers remain the economy's main engine, figures released yesterday suggest that companies are starting to contribute as well. New jobs, however, may still be a distant prospect.
 The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.7 percent in January, double the gain forecasters had predicted. Business inventories tripled expectations by jumping 0.6 percent in December, according to the Commerce Department. 
 "The business sector, in a fundamental way, is in better shape than it was six or nine months ago," said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J. P. Morgan Chase. "On the production side of the economy, you almost certainly have another couple of months of good news ahead."
Production rose sharply in military and space industries, in autos and in durable consumer goods like tires and televisions. Output and capacity use by utilities also grew substantially, thanks to unusually cold temperatures in the Northeast.
The hint of a spark in the corporate sector came just as consumers have been showing some signs of fatigue. On Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that retail sales fell 0.9 percent in January, with a weak appetite for cars accounting for most of the drop. Putting autos aside, sales rose 1.3 percent.
But the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment for February plunged to its lowest level since September 1993, sinking to 79.2, from 82.4 in early February, The Associated Press reported yesterday.
"The consumer has had a good two- to three-month run here, and I think that's over," Mr. Kasman said.
Part of the problem for consumers is that while companies have begun to produce more, they have not necessarily begun to buy new equipment or hire additional workers. A survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, also released yesterday, suggested that small businesses were showing more enthusiasm for building inventories than expanding their operations. 
"You've been growing capacity at a very, very modest pace," Mr. Kasman said. "You've been doing little more than replacing the capital that's been depreciating."
Before businesses decide to grow, Mr. Kasman said, they will need to see higher profits. Yet where those profits will originate is far from clear.
The stock market bubble of the late 1990's collapsed when big investments in information technology did not pay off, said Edward E. Leamer, director of the Anderson Forecast at the University of California in Los Angeles. "Businesses were unable to find ways of squeezing profits off those new-economy investments," he said. "We'll eventually get back to a point where that overhang is gone," but it will take time.
Even when companies decide to grow, their spending may be less apparent than in the past. "No longer are we an economy where spending goes to plant, equipment and machinery," said Liz Ann Sonders, senior managing director and chief investment strategist at the Charles Schwab Corporation.
For one thing, she said, about two-thirds of corporate investment now goes to financing intangibles, like improvements in workers' skills and increased efficiency in supply chains.
Companies are also finding ways to stretch the life of their existing equipment, focusing on near-term savings rather than long-term growth.
"It's a mind-set more than anything else," Ms. Sonders said. "When you magnify it across a corporation, they're so overfocused on costs and margins that they're going to stretch this stuff as long as they can. Everybody's being rewarded now for underspending."
Uncertainty about war in the Middle East and terrorism at home continues to hold both consumers and businesses back, Ms. Sonders added. "It's like being in a plane, and there's a huge fog or cloud below you that you just can't get through," she said. "The magnitude of the upswing will continue to be limited by what's going on there."
But Professor Leamer said that the importance of a war in Iraq was overstated. "The war is plus and minus, and I don't think it adds up to a big issue," he said. While the war might affect the psychology of investors, he added, its influence might be limited to the markets. "The story of psychology driving the business cycle is just not consistent with historical data."
Professor Leamer argued that a pullback in spending by state and local governments could cause far more damage to the economy than a war in Iraq. State and local governments, he said, have accounted for about a sixth of economic growth in recent years, buoyed by tax revenue from capital gains in the stock market.
"That's never going to come back," he said.
He also expressed concern that the markets for cars and homes, which have experienced a surge of spending over the last 18 months, might slacken at the same time.
Mr. Kasman said he, too, would be carefully watching sales of durable goods as well as oil prices and claims for unemployment benefits. "Those three things will give me my guidance," he said.

HEADLINE: The Price We Pay 

 BODY:
War in Iraq will not come cheap -- and neither will peace. The aftermath of a war can be even more costly than the war itself. No one knows what the ultimate price will be. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, says the conflict could cost $50 billion to $60 billion, less than half of what Lawrence B. Lindsey, the former chief economic adviser to the White House, estimated last fall. The cost of the war is not included in the budget President Bush submitted to Congress earlier this month. 
 The accounting difficulty stems from the wide range of possibilities. How long will the war last? How many soldiers will be needed? Will Saddam Hussein use chemical and biological weapons? Will there be urban fighting? What kind of assistance will allies -- who paid for about 90 percent of the costs in the Gulf war -- provide this time around? 
 The postwar costs are even more uncertain. For humanitarian assistance, for example, we drew upon the work of the economist William D. Nordhaus, who calculates that similar costs in the Balkans in the 1990's amounted to about $500 per person per year. Assuming that 5 percent to 20 percent of the Iraqi population of 24 million might need aid over a period of two to four years, we arrived at our low and high estimates. We derived the middle number from discussions with experts in and out of the government.
The United States will not bear all these postwar costs, but it will have to bear some of them. Maintaining a peacekeeping force, rebuilding infrastructure, paying for government services: all these tasks are expensive. The United States spent $10 billion on Afghanistan last year, and many criticized that as too little.
So what's the bottom line? The figures below show a range of possible costs in several areas, and simply adding up the columns would be misleading. (For readers who insist, the low range totals $127 billion, the high $682 billion.)
Monetary costs are not the only consideration, or even the primary one, in deciding whether to go to war in Iraq. But cost is an important factor, particularly at a time when the economy is uncertain and the deficit is growing. The chart below may help Americans better understand the full range of expenses associated with the war; then we can debate whether we think they're worth paying.

A Note on Sources:
The figures shown are our own estimates, using data from a variety of sources: Asia Development Bank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Council on Foreign Relations, the House Budget Committee Democratic Caucus, the United Nations, the World Bank and the economist William D. Nordhaus. In some cases we have extrapolated from these numbers, providing a range of costs for the war based on assumptions about its length, for example

HEADLINE: McGreevey Seeks Unified Agency to Run 2 Main Toll Roads 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Trying to set into motion an idea that has been proposed and abandoned by several of his predecessors, Gov. James E. McGreevey announced legislation today to combine the operations of the state's two main toll roads.
 The plan would merge the Turnpike Authority and the Highway Authority, which runs the Garden State Parkway, promising to save enough to avoid toll increases for years. 
 The savings, projected at several million dollars a year, are intended to finance repairs of roads and improvements in the troubled E-ZPass system, including installation of high-speed E-ZPass lanes.
Mr. McGreevey, who has made New Jersey's much-maligned transportation system a focus of his administration, pledged last year in his first budget address to combine the toll road agencies. 
He said then that he would include the Atlantic City Expressway, run by the South Jersey Transportation Authority, but the commission he appointed concluded that the agency had too many other roles, like overseeing the Atlantic City airport economic development projects, to be absorbed by a larger toll-road authority.
The legislation to combine the turnpike and parkway agencies, a plan supported by the chairmen of the Assembly and Senate transportation committees, grew out of the commission's recommendations, which were also released today.
Under the plan, the Turnpike Authority, which took in $433 million last year, would take over the smaller, older Highway Authority, which has yearly revenues of less than $200 million.
The administrative staff would be cut by 5 percent, or about 130 jobs, state officials said.
Since the parkway is primarily used by residents, and trucks are banned on most of the road, it is politically difficult to raise tolls; the last increase was in 1988. As a result, the Highway Authority cannot finance even some of its basic repairs.
The Turnpike Authority, by contrast, receives more than one-third of its revenue from out-of-state drivers and trucking companies and has raised tolls, most recently last month, to build a surplus.
While the authorities are financially independent, "we need to identify redundancies and cost savings wherever we can find them," said Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey.
The projected savings include $42 million over six years in operational costs, to reach about $10 million a year by 2008. More savings will be realized, officials said, by combining and restructuring debt.
Among planned improvements are a high-speed E-ZPass system, which would replace some toll booths with a gantry with equipment to read transponders on cars traveling at normal highway speeds.
The proposals would give the Department of Transportation a voice in projects that would affect the governor's promised antisprawl plan.

HEADLINE: Thousands of Bolivians Protest Police Deaths 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Thousands of angry Bolivians marched through the capital today to mourn nine police officers killed in two days of rioting, while the country's largest union called for a national strike.
 The disturbances began when 7,000 police officers, seeking a 40 percent raise, walked off the job to protest government plans for a new tax to reduce the budget deficit, as required by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for new emergency loans. 
 Clashes between government troops and striking police officers and protesters left 22 dead -- including the officers -- and more than 100 people injured. Protesters left 12 government buildings in flames. 
Mourners wept over the flower-strewn coffins of the officers and carried them through a downtown plaza. As officials arrived to show their support, the crowd started shoving them and chanting, "Murderers! Murderers!"
The Central Bolivian Workers Union called for a 48-hour national strike beginning Monday to protest the government's handling of the economy and its response to the striking police officers.
Hours after the funeral for the police officers, more than 2,000 students, farmers and labor leaders marched in La Paz, calling for President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to resign and shouting, "Out with the I.M.F.!" Troops stood guard today outside the presidential palace and police officers watched over shops to avoid renewed looting.
Government officials said Mr. Sanchez de Lozada was working on a new economic plan at his residence in a La Paz suburb, where he fled shortly after the riots began.
Mauricio Antezana, a presidential spokesman, said Mr. Lozada was also considering a possible cabinet shake-up.
Bolivian human rights groups have called for an investigation into what they say was the government's heavy-handed response to the protests, criticizing the used of live ammunition and tanks to break up demonstrations in La Paz's central plaza.
In the Chapare region in the country's center, coca growers resumed roadblocks after overnight clashes with soldiers left more than seven people injured. Farmers have set up blockades in the area to protest an American-backed coca eradication program.

HEADLINE: Beliefs; 
The new archbishop of Canterbury is known for taking stands, and often stirring controversy.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
No doubt about it, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams, who will be formally enthroned as archbishop of Canterbury on Feb. 27, makes good copy.
 As soon as his name began circulating as a likely choice for the post, months before the appointment was announced last July, Archbishop Williams was being written up for everything from his bushy beard to his 1985 arrest (while reciting Psalms) in a protest against nuclear missiles at a military base in Britain. 
 His acknowledgment that he had ordained a man he knew to be gay -- and generally thought that the church should listen attentively to gay and lesbian Christians and re-examine its positions on homosexuality -- stirred up talk of schism among conservative Anglicans. 
So did his support for not only ordaining women to be priests but also bishops, a step taken more than a decade ago by the Episcopal Church in the United States but still rejected by the Church of England and many independent regional Anglican churches that the archbishop of Canterbury unites as symbolic head of the Anglican Communion.
Archbishop Williams's declared opposition to going to war in Iraq without United Nations backing also put him at odds with Tony Blair, who as Britain's prime minister effectively had the final say in selecting the new archbishop, even if the appointment was duly rubber stamped by Queen Elizabeth II.
There were lots of other colorful detail. He is would be the first Welshman to be archbishop of Canterbury for at least 1,000 years. He once contemplated becoming a Roman Catholic monk but could not accept the papacy in its current form. He praises "The Simpsons," started writing imitation Dylan Thomas poems "as every self-respecting Welsh teenager had to do" and has published two volumes of better stuff since then.
British headlines labeled him a "liberal" or "radical," words frequently preceded by "outspoken." The articles reported, however, that he was also a widely admired theological scholar whose theological reflections were deeply rooted in Scripture, the early church thinkers and classic Christian doctrines.
At age 52, Archbishop Williams may be the first world religious leader to be a child of the 1960's. His politics -- and his facial hair -- may reflect that era's rebelliousness but so, in a quite different way, does his theology. After his appointment last July, a commentary in The Times Literary Supplement noted that the academic climate of his student days was one of an established skepticism and a religious liberalism that felt obliged to adjust its beliefs to what was termed "the modern mind."
This did not sit well with the future archbishop, the commentary suggested: "Though always sensitive to how much religious language looks like fantasy to many atheists and agnostics, he is also aware that an organization wedded to the philosophy of the present age is likely to be left a widow in the next."
It is relatively easy to make Archbishop Williams appear interesting -- and steeped in the tradition -- by noting the figures who played important parts in his theological maturing. As he recounted in an interview last spring in The Christian Century, his early, undergraduate enthusiasm for St. Thomas Aquinas was countered with a stiff dose of the Protestant Karl Barth and evolved into an engagement with the Swiss Roman Catholic Hans Urs von Balthasar, often considered the favorite theologian of Pope John Paul II.
It is also easy to demonstrate Archbishop Williams's power to disrupt assumptions by pointing to an essay in his book "Lost Icons" (Morehouse, 2000) on protecting the "imaginative space" of childhood.
He argues there against the pressures on childhood from stodgy moralizing, premature sexualizing, calculated marketing and rigid education, and one can imagine many liberals nodding in agreement until being drawn up short by his vigorous moral (although not legal) critique of arguments about abortion rights.
It is much harder to explain, at least in any brief way, how this unusual mixture of influences, idioms and convictions plays itself out in more basic theological writings like those collected in his book "On Christian Theology" (Blackwell, 2000).
That book opens with a useful typology of modes of doing theology. Celebratory theology elaborates and refines ideas and images already existing within the religious tradition's language of sacred text, sermons, hymnody and worship. It is what happens in a great deal of preaching.
Communicative theology tries to bring the tradition's inherited language and categories into conversation, hopefully fruitful conversation, with different (and possibly hostile) language and categories that operate in the surrounding culture. Early Christian thinkers did this with Platonic thought; Aquinas did it with Aristotelian thought; liberation theologians did it with Marxism.
Critical theology re-examines, in either a conservative or revisionist direction, the fundamental meanings of a tradition when those have become destabilized by their encounter with those new categories or other contrasting ways of construing the world.
Much of "On Christian Theology," beginning with an essay on what constitutes integrity in theological thought, falls into this latter category. Archbishop Williams takes on the big issues. What are the limits of pluralism in Christian belief? Is Christian speech and practice answerable to the judgment of the world or only to its own internal standards? How must Scripture be read? Creation, incarnation, trinity, resurrection, revelation, sacrament -- they are all topics here, although the author is more interested in offering fresh insights than any overall system.
Often enough, those insights are striking ways of sustaining classic doctrines by recovering classic perspectives, as in Archbishop Williams's defense of God's creation ex nihilo, out of nothing, portrayed in the Bible's first pages, against certain feminist accusations that it is an exercise of patriarchal power.
Of course, theology is not just preaching with footnotes but a technical discipline, and though it is far more open to the outsider than, say, physics or economics, "On Christian Theology" is not bedtime reading.
Nonetheless, what is manifest here, and in Archbishop Williams's other writings, including his more political ones, is that theology, precisely because it deals with the inexhaustible, cuts itself off from further questions only at the cost of becoming an instrument of power and a source of corruption. Theology provides answers, yes, but the answers always raise new questions.
Archbishop Williams, who was at Trinity Church on Sept. 11, 2001, only a few hundred yards from the World Trade Center, spoke about the world's current mood in an interview last spring with an Australian Anglican publication.
"Anything that makes us less capable of questioning ourselves," he said, "is deeply perilous."

Powell's Call to Act on Iraq Meets Resistance at U.N.
The chief United Nations weapons inspectors reported some progress in Iraq, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell faced deep resistance to his call for a Security Council decision to authorize military force. A1

Debate about war in Iraq in the United Nations Security Council chamber was uncharacteristically emotional and personal. A1

Saddam Hussein complied with one of the United Nations arms inspectors demands by issuing a presidential decree banning the construction or import of weapons of mass destruction, only hours before the two top inspectors delivered an updated report to the Security Council on Iraq's cooperation with weapons inspections. A9

Hundreds of thousands of peace demonstrators have gathered in European capitals to march against the United States-led campaign that threatens war in Iraq. Nowhere is the situation so politically fraught as it is in London, where a large turnout could undermine Washington's staunchest European ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair. A12

Reports of modestly improved cooperation by Iraq provided encouragement to those who are opposed to war, further isolating the United States and Britain as the only two Security Council members favoring imminent military action, European analysts and political figures said. A9

The Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, warned European countries not to join or support an American-led military strike against his country, saying that it would be seen as a crusade against Muslims and would have bitter consequences. A12

The Pentagon has ordered 20,000 additional Army troops to the Persian Gulf, including an armored unit from Colorado, as part of the steady buildup for a potential war with Iraq, military officials said. A9

American Killed in Colombia
An American working for the United States government and a Colombian soldier were shot dead after their plane crashed in a region of southern Colombia dominated by guerrillas, Colombian and American officials said. The rebels are believed to have made off with three other Americans who had also been aboard the plane. A3

Arafat to Name Prime Minister
Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, announced that he would appoint a prime minister in a step toward meeting a central demand of the Bush administration for a resumption of the peace process. A4

Cloned Sheep Dolly, 6, Dies
Dolly, the sheep who made history as the first clone from a mammal, died of a lung infection in Edinburgh. A4

Vatican to Open Archive
The Vatican will open secret archives today in an effort to allay accusations that Pope Pius XII, whom the Vatican wants to make a saint, did not do enough to save Jews from the Holocaust. A4

Administration Scrambles To Calm a Nervous Public
The Bush administration tried to calm a jittery public after a wave of recent terrorism warnings, with Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, saying that the government had no new intelligence to suggest an imminent attack. A1

NASA Official Had Confidence
Leroy E. Cain, the Nasa flight director in charge of the shuttle Columbia's re-entry, said that despite the accumulating signs of trouble aboard the spacecraft as it crossed the southwestern United States he had remained confident that it would land safely. A1

A Doctor's Touch in Agenda
Republican Senate leaders unveiled a legislative agenda heavily influenced by the medical interests of Senator Bill Frist, the surgeon who is their new majority leader, one mixing tax cuts with an unusually wide variety of health issues. A1

Joining Counterterrorist Forces
The counterterrorism sections of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. will move to a single facility in a big bureaucratic shift to better coordinate the analysis and tracking of information on terrorists. A14

Americans Deride France
Many Americans have unleashed verbal vitriol at European allies that have challenged the Bush administration stance on attacking Iraq. The acid is being flung at France in particular, because of the country's resistance to imminent military action against Iraq, while a growing anti-American sentiment is being expressed in Europe. A12

Wife Sentenced in Murder Case
A jury sentenced Clara Harris, a Houston dentist and mother of two four-year-old twins, to 20 years in prison for running over her husband with her car in the parking lot of a hotel where he was having an affair with his receptionist. A15

Four Ex-Radicals Sentenced
Four former members of the radical Symbionese Liberation Army were sentenced to state prison terms ranging from six to eight years for the murder of a bank customer during a robbery nearly 28 years ago. The hearing took the authorities nearer to closing the books on the group. A16

HEADLINE: Republicans in Senate Preparing Agenda With a Surgeon's Touch 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Republican Senate leaders unveiled a legislative agenda today that mixed tax cuts with an unusually wide variety of health issues, showing the influence of Senator Bill Frist, the surgeon who is their new majorityleader.
 Of the Top 10 bills that Republicans plan to introduce, half reflect Dr. Frist's medical background, particularly a measure to combat the spread of AIDS, which has also been championed by President Bush, and one that bans a form of late-term abortion. Other medical bills would add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, limit medical malpractice insurance costs and make it easier for drug companies to manufacture vaccines. 
 Party leaders also plan an energy bill that will probably include increased domestic oil drilling, an education bill that adds more local flexibility to federal requirements, and a bill matching one passed in the House on Thursday that adds stricter work requirements for welfare recipients. Another top-priority bill, already introduced, would repeal the estate tax. 
Although issues like Medicare reform or limits on medical malpractice awards might have come up under the leadership of Dr. Frist's predecessor, Trent Lott, it is unlikely that so many health issues would have received such prominence. 
The ceremonial unveiling of the list was about six weeks later than usual. The list of high-priority bills is normally presented by each party's leader on the first day of the Congressional session in January. But Dr. Frist took office after the turmoil of Mr. Lott's resignation and did not have time to assemble the agenda. Also, though they risked appearing tentative, several senators said they wanted to wait until after they received their "marching orders" from President Bush's State of the Union address, and the Senate then took a month to approve last year's unfinished spending bills.
Having helped shepherd the spending measure to approval late Thursday, Dr. Frist asserted that today was the first real day of the Congressional session.
"I am here today to declare that the 107th Congress is over," he said at a news conference, calling today a "pivot point" in the transition to a Congressional session led entirely by Republicans. Though he dutifully explained the party's belief that cutting taxes would create jobs, he reserved his most passionate language, as he always has, for the need to spend $15 billion to fight the spread of AIDS around the world.
"This little virus is only 22 years old but has killed 23 million people," Dr. Frist said. "And in the best of all worlds, it's going to kill another 45 million. And I want the history books 30 years from now to look back and say America stood up and changed the course of history, which will affect tens of millions of people, saving their lives."
Dr. Frist also said that the abortion bill, which was introduced today, was a strong personal interest. The measure would ban the late-term medical procedure that opponents call "partial birth abortion," a procedure that he described as "outside the practice of medicine today" and one that he said offended most Americans.
Any legislative agenda is only a vague outline of the following two years, because the details always change in political negotiation, and several of the bills on today's list consisted of little more than a title. With many Congressional Republicans disagreeing with the administration's plans to require seniors to join health maintenance organizations to get prescription drugs under Medicare, Senate leaders have not yet decided which direction to go in their drug bill, aides said. Dr. Frist said on Thursday that he wanted the Senate to write its own Medicare bill, implying a degree of independence from the White House's plans.
Similarly, few details were available about the party's energy plan, in part because several moderate Republicans oppose new oil drilling in Alaska.
But many of the proposals are familiar because they essentially match those of President Bush. The bill known as the American Jobs and Growth Package will include most, if not all, of the administration's proposed tax cuts, which several senators defended today despite suggestions from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that they could push the deficit too high.
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a member of the Finance Committee, said that even if the effect of the cuts was primarily long-term, they could still benefit the short-term economy.
"The best short-run impact is for a long-run program," Senator Kyl said, "because the market, the investors, the people who are trying to create capital to create jobs understand that it will be there, and therefore they react in the short run to the promise of good long-run policy."
Senator Kyl and Dr. Frist said they saw no need to ask for Mr. Greenspan's resignation, even as some Republicans said that Mr. Greenspan had undermined the administration's budget plan, which would create record deficits.
The estate tax bill was introduced last month by Mr. Kyl, but its bill number was moved up today to reflect the importance placed on it by party leaders. Though it is touted as a measure to protect family farmers and small-business owners from the tax, the bill says nothing about limiting the repeal to farms or businesses.
While Republicans control both the Senate and the House, many of the bills proposed today may be blocked by Democrats, who still have considerable power to oppose initiatives in the Senate. Even as the Senate recessed today for a week, it remained tied up in a Democratic filibuster over one of Mr. Bush's judicial nominees, and many Republicans have acknowledged that months of contentious negotiations between the parties lie ahead. The AIDS bill is the only one proposed today that is considered likely to pass without major changes.
Dr. Frist implicitly acknowledged that his reputation was riding on his ability to push through today's agenda and arrive at the necessary compromises. Though he said he did not know if the prescription drug plan, for example, could be approved by his target date of late summer, he all but invited skeptics to follow his progress.
"These are bills, as has been pointed out, that we feel strongly about," Dr. Frist said. "Two years from now, I want you and others and our colleagues to come back and say, 'Did you accomplish all of this?' "

A CLOSER LOOK
The Senate Republicans' To-Do List

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 -- Following are the top 10 items on the Senate Republicans' legislative agenda as outlined yesterday by the leadership, in rough order of priority:

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- Provide a prescription drug benefit through Medicare for older people.

JOBS -- Pass a package of tax cuts intended to create jobs in the short term and economic growth in the long term.

ABORTION -- Prohibit a late-term form of abortion that opponents call partial birth, unless it is necessary to save the pregnant woman's life.

EDUCATION -- Increase local flexibility, raise federal financing and channel money to their intended programs.

WELFARE OVERHAUL -- Enact stricter work requirements for welfare recipients.

MEDICAL LIABILITY -- Curb doctors' costs for malpractice insurance.

GLOBAL AIDS -- Increase financing to fight the global AIDS epidemic.

ESTATE TAX -- Eliminate the estate tax.

ENERGY -- Promote a reliable domestic energy supply, possibly by increasing drilling of oil and natural gas.

PREPAREDNESS FOR BIOLOGICAL ATTACK -- Provide vaccines and other countermeasures to protect Americans from attacks using biological weapons.

HEADLINE: Three Airlines Increase Fares To Help Cope With Fuel Prices 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Three leading airlines increased nearly all their fares by $10 each way yesterday. 
 The move, the most significant attempt at a fare increase since last summer, was an effort to re-establish pricing power as fares have hit record lows. But several industry experts raised doubts that the airlines would be able to keep the higher fares. With the possibility of a war, travel has continued to slump, they say, and the situation will only worsen if the United States attacks Iraq. 
 The three carriers -- Continental Airlines, American Airlines and US Airways -- will also have to see whether their top rivals decide to match the increase. If those carriers -- Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines -- do not raise their fares, then the three will probably have to back down.
People in the industry are watching Northwest in particular, because it did not go along with several fare increases last year, forcing its rivals to return to lower fares.
Continental, the country's fifth-largest carrier, was the first to put the fare increase into effect yesterday morning .
"Although the airline industry is suffering from overcapacity and weak demand, this fare increase is necessary to get Continental back on the path to financial recovery," the company said.
Continental said the increase was necessary to help offset "dramatically higher fuel expenses."
American soon matched the increase, and US Airways acted by late afternoon, according to Terry Trippler, an air fare expert who works for CheapSeats.com.
Fuel is the second-highest expense for airlines, behind labor costs. In the last year, fuel prices have spiked because of the labor strife in Venezuela and tensions with Iraq, said John Heimlich, an economist for the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group. All the big airlines have a certain amount of their fuel hedged in case the price of oil goes up, but they have not been able to avoid paying higher prices on average.
The spot price for a gallon of jet fuel is now $1.20, more than double the 57 cents it was a year ago, according to the trade group. The price for West Texas intermediate crude oil is expected to be $34.25 a barrel this month, compared with $20.65 a year ago.
In December, airlines paid an average of 77.4 cents a gallon for fuel, up from 60.1 cents in December 2001.
The cost of crude oil, and thus jet fuel, will almost certainly go up if there is a war in Iraq.
Even so, there is no guarantee the fare increase will stick, experts said. That will depend on the market conditions for air travel, which are dismal right now. Furthermore, they said, carriers with relatively good cash reserves -- Northwest, for instance -- can better afford to keep fares lower than some of their competitors.
"The airline industry needs it," Michael Boyd, an airline consultant based in Evergreen, Colo., said of the price increase. "Whether it'll stick is another issue. With war jitters out there and other things, I don't know whether it'll stick."
Just after Christmas, US Airways tried adding a fuel surcharge of $10 each way on round-trip fares. American soon matched the increase, but the two carriers retracted their moves before the end of the year. Frontier Airlines, the low-cost carrier, tried adding a $5 surcharge each way around the same time, but eliminated the increase before the end of January.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL; 
Lavin Senses End Approaching With the Bruins

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: TUCSON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Steve Lavin watched U.C.L.A. make another turnover, watched Arizona turn it into another resounding dunk during a splurge of 21 straight points on Thursday, and looked as if he wanted to say something. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Then he tried again, opening it a little wider, but Lavin either could not speak or did not know what to tell his players.
 One of the referees jogged by, and Lavin, the beleaguered coach, spotted a perfect exit ramp. He placed his fingertips on his shoulders, the signal for a 20-second timeout, and without saying a word, Lavin stopped the madness. Briefly, anyway. Lavin wished he could have stopped Arizona as easily and surely wishes he could stop a depressing season that may be his last one at U.C.L.A. 
 This is an exasperating time for Lavin and U.C.L.A., the college that is home to 11 national men's basketball championships, the college where no mortal coach will come close to scribbling plays on John Wooden's chalkboard precisely enough and the college of Lew Alcindor, Bill Walton, that legendary 88-game winning streak and gigantic, usually unrealistic, expectations.
The Bruins are 5-15 this season, crawling to their worst record in more than six decades. Lavin will probably be asked to crawl out the door in a few weeks.
In a peaceful, somewhat sad way, Lavin seems accepting of the possibility that he will be fired after a mostly successful run of seven seasons. After the 106-70 drubbing from the Wildcats, who are ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll, Lavin was offered a soda and wondered if strychnine was available. He mentioned that he had lost 30 pounds through increased exercise, not stress, and said, "If nothing else, I'll be the best-conditioned unemployed coach in April." He asked a fellow graduate of Chapman University if she could find him a decent position at that Division III school.
"You have to remember it's not life or death," Lavin said. "It's not 9/11. It's not Columbia. There's enough events in our life daily, weekly, monthly and yearly that remind us of what's most important. It's your faith, your family, your health and your friends. But with that being said, we're competitive and we want to win a lot of ballgames and we want to win national championships, if we can."
The Bruins are a long way from being a national championship contender this season, but they have been perennial contenders under the 38-year-old Lavin. U.C.L.A. has qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament for the last six seasons and has advanced to the Round of 16 five times. The only other coach who has been to the Round of 16 five times in the last six seasons is Mike Krzyzewski, who is such a deity at Duke that the court is named after him.
But off this disappointing season, which includes a 2-9 record in the Pac-10, Lavin will most likely lose his job. Lavin said he was accustomed to being "the pinata, the punching bag" after 12 seasons at U.C.L.A., including five as an assistant. He got the job after Jim Harrick was fired for filing bogus expense reports, one year after coaching U.C.L.A. to its last championship. Even then, Lavin had the interim coach tag hanging precariously above him. Lavin said his first season as coach "and, potentially, my last" have been his greatest learning experiences.
The Bruins started the season ranked 14th in the A.P. poll because of their 21-12 record and Round of 16 appearance last season, a ranking they never deserved. The team has nine freshmen and sophomores, veterans like Ray Young and T. J. Cummings who have been erratic, and no trusty center or point guard.
"It's definitely tough because there are a lot of expectations at U.C.L.A.," the freshman Ryan Hollins said. "There's a lot of pride and tradition at U.C.L.A. This hurts."
While Lavin said, "We haven't shot the ball well going back to F.D.R. or Calvin Coolidge," U.C.L.A. actually has a slightly better field-goal percentage (45 to 44) than its opponents. Still, the Bruins have been unreliable, dropping two games in overtime, two by a point and three others by 5 points or fewer. Lavin, who is imploring his team to climb into eighth place in the Pac-10 to reach the conference tournament and shock some teams, blamed inconsistent shooting, defense, concentration and himself for the collapse. 
"This is one year where I felt like every button I pushed has been the wrong button, every combination of players I played has been the wrong combination and every adjustment I made has been the wrong adjustment," Lavin said.
That admission is one that could arise when Lavin meets after the season with Dan Guerrero, the first-year athletic director. Guerrero has already said that he will not dismiss Lavin during the season, a comment that simply turned Lavin into a coach with a noose sliding past his slicked-back black hair. Guerrero declined to comment for this article. 
Lavin, who thought about resigning in January, would receive a $1.3 million buyout over six years if he were dismissed. He would receive $578,000 next season and about $150,000 each of the next five seasons.
The Arizona fans at the McKale Center took a rest from watching Thursday's rout and chanted, "Fire Lavin," but he never budged from his crouching position and said he was amused by the same taunting he has heard at other arenas. 
"That's not exactly original subject matter," Lavin said. "It's a lack of imagination. The fans get an A-minus. In terms of their imagination, they just weren't very creative. Fire the coach? That's been used too many times."
Lute Olson, who has coached Arizona for 20 prosperous seasons, explained that Lavin is at a college where the tradition is so storied from Wooden's snaring 10 championships in 12 seasons in the 1960's and 70's that only a title is sufficient. Olson mentioned Andre Patterson's absence from an injured ankle and academic ineligibility, Evan Burns's departure to San Diego State and the loss of some early games as reasons the Bruins have fizzled.
"Steve is a quality guy," Olson said. "That job is a next-to-impossible job. I don't know how many coaches they've had since Coach Wooden left, but the average tenure is about three years. So Steve has outlasted that."
Outlasted is probably not a word that will be associated with Lavin once the season is over. 
Lavin received an encouraging call last week from Jerry West, the Hall of Famer, who told him "sometimes we never find the answers" to the problems. But Lavin keeps on searching for a speck of light in the roughest and darkest of seasons at U.C.L.A.
"I thought we showed some of our ability in the first half against Arizona," Lavin said. "It was a glimpse of the future. It was a sneak preview. That will be rewarding to watch, even from a distance. On a satellite in some cold Eastern city, wherever it happens to be."

PERSON: Walt Whitman Rostow 

HEADLINE: Walt Rostow, Adviser to Kennedy and Johnson, Dies at 86 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Walt W. Rostow, an economic historian who became one of the principal architects and passionate defenders of the Vietnam War as an adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, died on Thursday night at a hospital in Austin, Tex., where he lived. He was 86.
 The son of a Socialist immigrant who named him for the poet Walt Whitman, Mr. Rostow graduated from Yale at 19, won a Rhodes scholarship, served as a major in the Army's covert Office of Strategic Services in World War II, then pursued a brilliant career as a scholar of economic modernization and an adviser to politicians. He coined Kennedy's 1960 campaign slogan, "Let's Get This Country Moving Again." 
 But it was his relentless support of American military intervention in Southeast Asia, first as a White House and State Department official in the Kennedy administration and then as Johnson's national security adviser at the height of the Vietnam War, that marked him for life. 
"He became the president's national security adviser at a time when criticism and opposition to the war were beginning to crystallize, and he eventually served the purpose of shielding the president from criticism and from reality," wrote David Halberstam in "The Best and the Brightest," his 1972 study of the war's origins. "He deflected others' pessimism and rewarded those who were optimistic. It was not contrived; it was the way he was."
Friends and foes alike described Mr. Rostow as a perpetual optimist, easygoing and ebullient, unfailingly polite, a "sheep in wolf's clothing," as the writer Townsend Hoopes once put it. Scorned by much of the academic world after his White House service, he taught at the newly established Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, where he was an emeritus professor of political economy. The author of more than 30 books, Mr. Rostow remained active in school and civic affairs until his death.
Kennedy, in a not entirely flattering comment, once declared, "Walt can write faster than I can read."
Mr. Rostow was also, colleagues recalled, a whirlwind of supreme self-confidence, talkative to the point of verbosity, certain of the moral rectitude of his positions and unwavering in the face of criticism, even as doubts about the wisdom of the Vietnam War grew in Johnson's inner circle.
"I finally understand the difference between Walt and me," Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who was Johnson's under secretary of state and attorney general, once remarked after an argument about bombing. "I was the navigator who was shot down and spent two years in a German prison camp, and Walt was the guy picking my targets."
But in the beginning, Mr. Rostow's optimism about Vietnam was widely shared. He came to it by way of his academic work, mostly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on economic development. In his best-known book, "The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto" (1960), he argued that economic growth was a multistaged process, stimulated by desire for improvement of life, as well as profits. He said modernization was characterized by a crucial "takeoff" period of rapid growth stimulated by expansion in a few crucial segments of the economy.
He argued that the United States should speed this process of modernization in places like Southeast Asia, and that until such takeoff could be achieved, it should make efforts by all diplomatic or military means to stop guerrilla infiltration that threatened Communist takeover.
In a memorandum to Kennedy on April 12, 1961, Mr. Rostow, alarmed at the Communist insurgency in Southeast Asia, urged "gearing up the whole Vietnam operation," by appointing a fulltime policy coordinator, increasing aid and sending Special Forces advisers. Many of the recommendations were eventually accepted.
Later, Mr. Rostow was among the first officials to urge the bombing of North Vietnam, and he was the principal author of a November 1961 report recommending an increase in United States military aid and advisers at all levels to the South Vietnamese government, shifting the relationship from purely advisory to one of "limited partnership."
In December 1963, Mr. Rostow, by then chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Council, wrote what later became known as the Rostow thesis. First circulated in the summer of 1964, it held that externally supported insurgencies could be stopped only by military action against the sources of external support, through a series of escalating measures intended to impart maximum psychological blows.
In 1964 and 1965, Mr. Rostow argued for a broad American troop presence in the Pacific region, some ground forces in Laos and South Vietnam and an intensive naval blockade of North Vietnam. Though the initial White House response was milder, Johnson eventually adopted all of those measures.
At almost every turn, Mr. Rostow argued for an escalation of the war. Sustained American bombing of North Vietnam began in March 1965, but on limited targets. By May 1966, he was advocating "systemic and sustained bombing" intended to destroy petroleum installations in Hanoi and Haiphong as a way to cut off supplies to forces in South Vietnam.
On Nov. 1, 1967, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, increasingly skeptical, called for "stabilizing" the war effort by re-examining American ground efforts and shifting a greater burden to the South Vietnamese and calling a bombing halt by the end of the year. Mr. Rostow supported the first two goals, but opposed an unconditional bombing halt, and Johnson soon took a similar position.
"Walt was up to his elbows in raw intelligence, looking for information to support his very strongly held view that we were winning, that we would win over the long haul," Richard Moose, an aide at the time, recalled today. "The morning of the Tet offensive, in the Situation Room in the very early morning hours, Walt was sure that while all the rest of the world was looking at the pictures of the Saigon Embassy and so forth, Walt said, 'This is a great victory for our side.' "
"Walt was thinking in terms of the casualties that had been inflicted on the North Vietnamese and Vietcong," Mr. Moose added. "Years later, we learned that in fact their losses had been horrendous. But Lyndon Johnson's losses in terms of image were very much greater."
Walt Whitman Rostow was born Oct. 7, 1916, in New York City to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents who gave their three sons proud and distinctive American names. Mr. Rostow's older brother, Eugene Victor, named for the Socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, became dean of the Yale Law School and Johnson's under secretary of defense for political affairs. A third brother, Ralph Waldo, was named for Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Walt was a standout from the start, earning his Ph.D. from Yale in 1940 and starting his career as an economics instructor at Columbia University. After his wartime service, for which he received the Order of the British Empire, he joined the State Department as assistant chief of the German-Austrian Economic Division, later returning to England to teach American history, first at Oxford, then Cambridge.
From 1950 to 1961, he was professor of economic history at M.I.T. and also a staff member of its C.I.A.-supported Center for International Studies. He did occasional consulting work for the Eisenhower administration and became a policy adviser to Kennedy, then a senator from Massachusetts, in 1958.
He is credited by some sources with giving the Kennedy the phrase "the New Frontier," a theme that appeared in "Stages of Economic Growth" and was used by the candidate in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in 1960.
In January 1961, Kennedy named Mr. Rostow as deputy special assistant to the president for national security affairs. That fall, in a staff shuffle, he went to the State Department, returning to the White House in early 1966 as Johnson's special assistant for national security affairs, the post now known as national security adviser, where he remained until Richard M. Nixon was sworn in.
"He and Westmoreland were tried and true for the war to the end," said Robert Dallek, the author of a two-volume biography of Johnson who came to known Mr. Rostow during his years of research at the Johnson Library in Austin. "He argued that the war did make a positive difference, in the sense that it gave those Southeast Asian nations time to develop and ward off the possible consequences of Communist takeover. It gave them space and time to develop and stabilize themselves. Whether it was true or not, he believed it and it may have been a kind of comfort to him and the thousands of Americans who lost relatives in that war."
Because of his hawkish stance, Mr. Rostow was a pariah in many academic quarters, but he flourished at the University of Texas. His wife of 55 years, the former Elspeth Davies, a political scientist, joined him on the faculty there. In the early 1990's, Mr. Rostow became head of the Austin Project, an organization dedicated to expanding public and private programs providing prenatal care and aid to disadvantaged children.
Besides his wife and his brother Ralph, of Sarasota, Fla., Mr. Rostow is survived by a son, Peter, of Del Rio, Calif., a daughter, Ann, of Austin, and one grandchild. His other brother, Eugene, died last November.
To the end of his life, he expressed no public regrets about his position on the war, contending in a 1986 interview that Congressional cuts in military aid had caused the fall of South Vietnam.
"I'm not obsessed with Vietnam, and I never was," he said then. "I don't spend much time worrying about that period."
Still, he knew that for many members of the Vietnam generation, he would forever be identified with what they saw as a hugely failed policy. 
"I remember the first time I met Tom Hayden," he said, referring to the antiwar activist who later became a state senator in California. "He couldn't believe it. He said out loud: 'Just think of it. I'm talking to Walt Rostow.' "

HEADLINE: Mayor Trims Money for Arts But Donates Own $10 Million 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
There are times when disgruntled New Yorkers, frustrated by crippling budget cuts, are known to implore the billionaire mayor to open his checkbook and help plug the city's budget gap.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has done just that, again. This week, letters went out from the Carnegie Corporation to 162 small and medium-size cultural institutions around the city, informing them that they had been chosen to receive awards ranging from $25,000 to $100,000. 
 The grants stem from a $10 million anonymous gift, the same size gift that Mr. Bloomberg gave last spring to the corporation, with the specific request that the donations be made to small and medium-size arts groups. People with knowledge of the gift said yesterday that the latest $10 million check was also written by Mr. Bloomberg. 
The gift comes at a time when the city's cultural institutions are feeling the effects of the economy, with government budget cuts, a drop in tourism and a decline in contributions from private donors taking a toll. Large institutions, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum of Art, are facing large deficits, and have scaled back shows and reduced staffs that had built up in the economic boom. 
Mr. Bloomberg recently ordered a 6.2 percent cut in the city's Cultural Affairs budget, bringing the total cutbacks at the agency to nearly 18 percent for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
The mayor's press secretary declined to comment yesterday when asked about the mayor's gift. 
Groups must return forms proving their nonprofit status before Carnegie sends them their checks; a full list of recipients will be made public when that happens, said Susan King, a vice president at Carnegie.
Among those chosen were the Brooklyn Children's Museum; Flushing Town Hall; High 5 Tickets to the Arts, an organization that arranges reduced-cost tickets for city teenagers wishing to attend cultural events; the Harlem School of the Arts; and the Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York, which represents Off Broadway theaters. 
Every borough is represented and the array is vast, Ms. King said. 
"People were chosen from across the entire city," she said. "We didn't want to be Manhattan-centric." Ms. King refused to comment on the identity of the donor.
During his campaign for mayor, Mr. Bloomberg said he would keep his philanthropic life private, saying, "You can't put yourself in the place where, if the city budget can't do something, then every constituent group will say I should pay for it from my personal funds." But he has given anonymous gifts for various projects, including the rehabilitation of Gracie Mansion.
Before he was elected, Mr. Bloomberg served on the boards of three cultural institutions in New York and two in London and regularly gave money to arts groups. His company, Bloomberg L.P., sponsors audio guides to cultural attractions in New York and various public art projects through the Public Art Fund. He has taken an interest in placing art in City Hall and has borrowed artwork for City Hall and City Hall Park.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WARTIME ECONOMY; 
U.S. TRIES TO EASE JITTERS ON TERROR

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
The Bush administration tried today to calm a jittery public after a week of heightened terrorism warnings, with Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge saying that "we just don't want folks sealing up their doors or sealing up their windows." Senior administration officials said the government had received no new intelligence in recent days to suggest an imminent attack.
 Clearly worried that some people had gone too far in responding to the government's recommendation this week that they buy duct tape and plastic sheeting to seal doors in the event of a biochemical attack, Mr. Ridge said he wanted to remind the public that the emergency supplies should be kept ready -- but not used. 
 "I want to make something very, very clear," he said at a news conference. "God forbid there may come a time when the local authorities or national authorities or someone will tell you that you've got to use them."
President Bush also joined the effort to quell the anxiety created by last week's decision to raise the national terrorism alert level to "high" and the government's advice on Monday that families prepare a home disaster kit that included a flashlight, a can opener and bottled water.
In a speech at F.B.I. headquarters in which he announced a major reorganization of the bureau and the C.I.A., moving their counterterrorism divisions into a single location, Mr. Bush said the government was taking "unprecedented measures to protect the American people."
"There is no such thing as perfect security against a hidden network of cold-blooded killers," he said. "Yet abroad and at home, we're not going to wait until the worst dangers are upon us.
"We're trying to protect you. We're doing everything in our power to make sure the homeland is secure."
Senior administration officials said there was some hope that the period of gravest danger of new wave terrorist attacks, the final days of the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage, had passed. They said the intelligence that led to the decision on Feb. 7 to raise the terrorism alert level had suggested that attacks might be timed to the end of the Hajj, which was Thursday.
"We can't let our guard down, we won't let our guard down, but there is sense of relief that we've gotten through this week," said an official, who would speak only on the condition of not being named.
The government's alarm grew earlier in the week when the Arabic-language satellite television network al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape that appeared to be from Osama bin Laden, in which the speaker expressed solidarity with Iraq in the face of a threatened American invasion and called for suicide attacks against American targets.
An administration official said tonight that a technical review of the tape by the C.I.A. and other American intelligence agencies concluded that the voice was "almost certainly" that of Mr. bin Laden, the Qaeda leader.
At his news conference Mr. Ridge said, "We have not received any additional intelligence that would lead us to either raise or lower the threat level at this time."
"I would like to remind everyone again that the information we have to work with, more often than not, is very vague," he said. "It does not tell us when, where or how a terrorist might harm us again. I assure you, however, that if we get detailed, credible intelligence that we can act upon, we will certainly let the appropriate authorities know."
Democrats ridiculed the administration this week for dispensing home-safety advice that centered on buying duct tape and plastic sheeting, and some Republicans in the Senate were also critical of how the situation was handled. 
The Democrats said that what was really needed was billions of dollars in new spending for domestic security.
In a joint lettertoday to Mr. Bush, the House and Senate Democrat leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, said it was "indefensible that you have not made funding for homeland security your top priority."
"Republicans have sought to explain their opposition to these measures by claiming that additional investments in homeland security are unaffordable," they said. "We reject this contention, especially in light of your plans to spend $1.5 trillion on new tax breaks that mainly benefit the very wealthy."
The White House appeared to be feeling some pressure from the attacks, which have been most pointed among the potential Democratic presidential candidates.
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, tried to distance the administration from elements of the 2003 budget package approved this week by the Republican majorities in Congress.
Mr. Fleischer noted that the spending plan did not provide state and local governments with all the $3.5 billion that President Bush had sought for police departments, fire departments and other emergency-response agencies that would be called on to respond to a terrorist attack.
"The funding levels that Congress has passed are doing more and are providing additional resources -- but not enough and not the right way," he said, adding that the White House tabulation showed that only about $1.3 billion would go to the state and local governments for domestic security efforts.
Although Republican Congressional negotiators have labeled $3.5 billion in the budget as domestic security financing, Mr. Fleischer said that most of the money was actually earmarked for local projects, like special narcotics courts, that are "not part of the war on terrorism."
"The president would like Congress to do more to help provide funding" in next year's budget, Mr. Fleischer said, noting that Mr. Bush had requested another $3.5 billion for the state and local governments in the 2004 budget request.
On Capitol Hill, the Senate Republican leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, joined with the administration today in trying to play down the possibility of a widespread chemical or biological attack on the United States.
Donning what he called his "physician's hat," Dr. Frist, the only doctor in the Senate and the author of a recent book on the threat posed by biological and chemical weapons, said the risk to public health from an attack remained low, despite the confusing and frightening suggestions of others in the government.
"The overall risk of biological agents or chemical agents being used successfully as agents of mass destruction in this country is small," he said. "But the threat is real."
He appeared to contradict some of the information provided earlier this week by the administration, saying that not everyone needed a disaster supply kit, recommending them only for those who lived near a highly visible potential target.
Dr. Frist also suggested that the interests of public health would be better served if people paid attention to more obvious threats to their physical well-being, including stress.
"Play cards, play bridge or take part in something that's larger than just yourself," he advised his colleagues on the Senate floor. "Exercise regularly, eat well and get a good night's rest."

 JENNIFER GOVERNMENT
By Max Barry.
321 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $19.95.
 "IT'S simply impossible to be cynical enough about marketing." This observation comes not from some radical, anticapitalist culture jammer but from the editor of the weekly trade magazine Advertising Age, warning readers that product placement and other marketing tactics have become so pervasive and duplicitous that they've begun to "stampede the boundaries of consumer tolerance." At what point, he asks, "does the consumer become so jaded that the messages lose effectiveness?"
One answer to this question is suggested by "Jennifer Government," a funny and clever novel by Max Barry that's set in the "near future." In the book's opening pages, we learn of the latest guerrilla marketing campaign from Nike: to build buzz, the shoe manufacturer orders up a carefully orchestrated series of shootings at stores selling its new line of sneakers. "We take out 10 customers, make it look like ghetto kids, and we've got street cred" to spare, a Nike marketing executive explains. "I bet we shift our inventory within 24 hours. . . . Talk about edgy. This defines edgy."
Just to reiterate: this is merely a satirical novel, not an investigative report. Even so, one wonders what the real-life lawyers at Nike and various other corporations with cameos in "Jennifer Government" will think of the book, which makes a very spirited attempt to be "cynical enough about marketing." The plug-a-few-customers-for-profits initiative -- which comes off quite nicely for Nike's sales and earnings -- is only the beginning, and sets in motion a much bigger showdown designed to impress even the most jaded reader.
Barry, a 29-year-old Australian who lives in Melbourne, paints a world dominated (even more so than the one we live in) by corporations and "capitalizm." Here marketing imagery is present on a scale that makes the nightmarish total ad immersion of the film "Minority Report" seem subtle. Individuals even carry the names of the organizations they work for -- a hapless young man named Hack Nike is drawn into the deadly shoe promotion by two ruthless marketing executives, both named John Nike -- leaving the unemployed with no surnames at all. As in "Nineteen Eighty-Four," the planet seems to have been carved into a handful of massive nation-states (Australia is part of the United States). But Big Brother is a private enterprise, geopolitics are irrelevant compared with transnational corporate competition, and frequent-flier programs have morphed into huge affinity schemes that link companies in NATO-like alliances. Institutions like government and the police still exist, but they're so weak that in order to finance, say, an investigation of the Nike slayings, they must raise money from the victims' families.
It is in this way that an agent called Jennifer Government is able to pursue the case of the Nike killings. And it's fairly clear that her motivations are unusually strong. She seems to have it in for one of the John Nikes. In addition, the bar code tattoo under her left eye is a good hint that she used to work, enthusiastically, in the private sector and perhaps has scores to settle. As for John Nike, at first he actually seems to be in trouble with headquarters for the shoe-selling stunt, but soon he commandeers power on a global scale as he advocates a take-no-prisoners style in the increasingly pitched battle between the two big frequent-buyer alliances. "Battle" is not a metaphor: with corporations free to hire anyone from street gangs to paramilitary groups (the police are available for a fee, and so is the National Rifle Association), establishing brand dominance can easily spiral into armed strikes.
Barry is obviously up to more than letting an amusing thriller unfold against a heavily branded backdrop. At times, he even seems to be aiming for a kind of ad-world version of "Dr. Strangelove." As the action heats up, John Nike lectures the honchos of Nike and its allies: "Let's not pretend these are the first people to die in the interests of commerce." Finally, he advocates sweeping government out of the picture once and for all, and by any means necessary. "Just do it," he concludes.
The new corporate world Barry portrays is outrageous, but he doesn't exactly seem outraged by it. In fact, he appears ambivalent, almost fatalistic -- this is "capitalizm" run amok, but it's more funny than scary. Hack Nike eventually signs on with a group of anti-big-business pranksters who pull stunts like spray-painting "feed me" on a billboard image of a rail-thin woman in a Gap outfit. But their antics seem small and a bit pathetic. The experience transforms Hack, allowing him to stop being a mindless cog,but for a moment it also looks to be turning him into a selfish jerk, although Barry never quite gets around to fleshing this out.
It's probably not fair to criticize "Jennifer Government" for failing to make the reader angry enough to toss a chair through a Starbucks window. Even the most ambitious social satires tend to have rather limited power in the real world, and Barry is surely more interested in entertaining than in preaching or inciting. And he is entertaining. For the first hundred pages or so, he unleashes enough wit and surprise to make his story a total blast. If the last two-thirds of the book don't quite live up to that promise, it's because keeping up the breakneck pace means sketching too many flat characters and a plot that tends toward the black-and-white. The novel is written in a style concerned less with an enduring shelf life than with quickly satisfying the customer. There's a bustling cast, the nonstop action is broken into 86 easily digestible chapters, and most of the exposition is in the form of dialogue. Barry rarely has the patience for a paragraph that lasts more than a few sentences.
Presumably, he's after the same under-35 peers that the advertising world is targeting. And it may be that maintaining his tone -- a little disgusted, highly amused -- is a more effective strategy than trying to lead the overt backlash Advertising Age was so worried about. Recently, when that same journal published the results of a poll about product placement, the most surprising revelation was that 35 percent of the respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 said the practice is "not pervasive enough." If taken at face value, this is startling. But I prefer to think that what it really means is that 35 percent of the people in that age group thought the question was too ridiculous to deserve a serious answer.
Either interpretation might help put those Nike lawyers at ease when they're thinking about how much of a threat "Jennifer Government" is to the company's reputation -- and about Max Barry's intent. My review copy includes a brief summation of publicity plans that include a "guerrilla marketing campaign," as well as a report that the film rights have already been optioned. This is good news. "Jennifer Government" could be a very diverting movie. And, needless to say, the opportunities for ingenious product placement are just about unlimited.

HEADLINE: Architects, in Theory 

BYLINE:  By Arthur Lubow; Arthur Lubow last wrote for the magazine about the conductor David Robertson.

 BODY:
In preparation for their retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, along with a small team from their architecture office, gleefully assembled on a chilly January morning at the closed-for-reconstruction Museum of Modern Art building in Midtown Manhattan. Without telling the Whitney what they were up to, they had obtained permission from friends at the Modern to remove a MOMA wall fragment to install in their show. A work by Marcel Duchamp once hung in exactly this spot. The former white-walled museum gallery was now a command station for the MOMA demolition crew. 
 Originally, Diller and Scofidio planned to excise a number of "auratic" walls -- backdrops on which the aura of masterpieces might be said to have rubbed off. Then the qualms set in. They were daunted by the gritty task of sawing through Sheetrock, plywood and studs. In the realm of theory, they faced an even more worrisome roadblock. "When we started putting together the walls, we realized we were recurating the collection," Diller says. By taking some walls and rejecting others, they would be performing a curator's function: deciding which works are aesthetically or historically important. That was not what they wanted to get at here. 
 With a single wall, they could underline how anything acquires an "auratic power" simply by being hung on the wall of a museum. So one wall it was, and with that settled, there was little question which wall it should be. To Diller and Scofidio, Duchamp is a pioneer, witty and profound. Other architects might daydream of designing a Brunelleschi dome or a Schinkel facade, but the ultimate project for Diller and Scofidio would be a structure that called into question the nature of architecture, the way Duchamp's "Fountain," a porcelain urinal that the artist named, turned upside down and signed, questioned the nature of art. If you're interested in games of perception, the power of wordplay and the discovery of unexpected beauty in the prosaic, Duchamp is your man.
For this foray, Diller and Scofidio, who are married, were both wearing gray ribbed sweaters and black trousers, yet they projected very different auras. With short dark hair and an engaging, toothy grin, Diller, 48, displays the mischievous mien of a perennial grad student. Her voice, which has the accentlessness of someone who learned English in another galaxy, ripples with enthusiasm and nervous energy. By contrast, Scofidio, 67, has the handsome, graven face of an Olmec idol. Even though his cropped hair and soul patch have turned steel gray, he looks far younger than his age. He speaks less often than Diller, and when he does, it is in a low voice, with a gurgle suggesting that he wants to swallow each word before it emerges. His manner is soothing and earnest -- the bass clef to her treble. "I'm the one that whips everybody in the studio," Diller said. "Ric is on his own schedule, in his own space. Sometimes he drives me nuts. I think he should be working faster and harder. But I'm neurotic, and he's not."
Like scrub nurses in surgery, the team was starting to prep the patient -- in this case, the wall. "We're not really sure of what is behind this wall," Diller said to me. "We don't really have a Plan B. We have a Plan A and a Plan A-prime."
"The first plan is to remove the plywood and the studs," Scofidio continued. "But it may be that the electrical conduits run through the studs and we can't remove the whole wall. So then we go to Plan B, in which we just remove the Sheetrock from the plywood, and it pops free."
"We have to inscribe the wall very carefully without making any marks on it," Diller said, eyeing the two young staff members who were outlining with a pencil the area to be cut. "As absurd as it is, we still want to protect the authenticity of that wall." 
The assistants finished taping protective paper over the Sheetrock section, leaving a safe margin on all sides. Another man then screwed a wooden palette to the wall.
"I just had this strange feeling that we're taking this wall into captivity and moving it to another site," Diller said with a giggle.
Diller and Scofidio are receiving a major museum retrospective, opening March 1, at the moment they are preparing to break ground on their first major building, the $37 million Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Their influence, however, overshadows their list of completed commissions. "In experimental architecture and design, they are the only ones who made as the core of their work the question 'What do we mean by architecture?"' says Aaron Betsky, director of the Netherlands Architecture Institute and curator of the Whitney show along with K. Michael Hays, the museum's adjunct curator of architecture. Architects starting out, from Le Corbusier to Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas and Daniel Libeskind, often rely on journalism and essays to make their theoretical points. Unusually, Diller and Scofidio have always built -- by their own definition, on whatever scale they could. Back in 1981, they placed 2,500 orange cones in Columbus Circle for 24 hours to illustrate traffic patterns. Five years later, they constructed a span inside the anchorage of the Brooklyn Bridge with a gap that an intrepid performer vaulted over. Sometimes they collaborated with choreographers and theater directors; at other times they composed video pieces and museum exhibitions. "We always thought of it as an architectural practice," Scofidio says. "We started at a time of recession, but we didn't want to do paper architecture." 
The opportunity of mounting a midcareer retrospective naturally gratified the architects, but it also discomfited them. The individual works were knowing and self-conscious; adding an extra level of curatorial scrutiny could overrefract, like glazing something that was already in a bell jar. On top of that, their past on-site installations were hard to transplant. Besides, putting all these pieces together implied some common element other than their authorship, a notion that Diller and Scofidio resist. Then there was the career- and ego-boosting visibility of a museum retrospective, which demanded a contrapuntal line of self-effacement. (These are architects whose scruffy fifth-floor loft office has an unlisted phone number and who, until a year and a half ago, didn't use business cards; yet at the same time, they were entering competitions to design museums and urban plans.) And hovering above all those quibbles was the larger problem of the partners' ambivalence toward museums.
They knew they would have to zoom in on the core issue: the museum's presumed authority to winnow the estimable from the disposable. After much discussion (there is always much discussion at Diller + Scofidio), the architects devised two approaches. "One idea was to play with the curatorial voice and the museum label," Diller says. "We decided we would have the curators play two roles, representing the two ways of reading our work." One curator would analyze the show in critical and historical context, and the other would be clueless. Each curator's moving lips would be displayed on video monitors that slid on a track through the galleries. That scheme fell apart when neither curator proved eager to play the scripted role of the ahistorical, acritical dolt. "They took it too seriously," Diller says.
The alternative notion, on reflection, seemed better, anyway. "We started to think about the inevitability of the white wall to set off any of these pieces," Diller says. "When we considered the invention of the white wall as a system of segregation from the world, and as a system for the start of a new narrative, we decided it would be interesting to make the walls a self-conscious piece -- the object of the show." 
Instead of two video monitors chattering art-speak, a moving robot drill would bore noisily into the walls. "For us, it had the sense of constructing something and undermining it at the same time," she says. "It's always there, as a kind of annoyance." Driven by a computer program devised by Honeybee Robotics, a company composed of young engineers that was concurrently assembling a core-sample excavator for a NASA Mars mission, the robot drill would appear to move randomly. (Only on the Duchamp wall would there be an ordered pattern.) Every two minutes the steel bit would buzz, shattering the museum's contemplative lull. By the end of the show's three-month run, the walls that normally cordon off exhibits would resemble Swiss cheese, and light would filter into the spaces that had been darkened for video projections. "I don't think any of us know how disturbing this is going to be," Diller said six weeks before the opening. "Light and sound control are part of what the museum is supposed to give you. We are violating our work. If we were in a group show and somebody had this piece, we would pull out of the show."
Diller and Scofidio met at Cooper Union, where she was a second-year architecture student and he was the teacher of her studio class. She was the daughter of Jews who emigrated from Poland to New York when she was 5. Scofidio, born in New York, came from a musical family. His father was a handsome band leader who "looked like Errol Flynn, except that he was black," Scofidio says. "But he insisted to his dying day that he was Italian. My mother was light-skinned, but she was actually half-black. I was continually told as a child to be invisible. It's been difficult all my life to have a presence. To this day, in a crowd, I want to retreat."
When Diller entered his class, Scofidio was unhappy in both his marriage and his career. He had worked in a large firm, then started a smaller practice with partners, before finally going out on his own. "I found I was spending more time flying around meeting clients than I was on the board," he says. "It was a great frustration at not being able to use my abilities. I realized at that point I had to change my life. I like driving. I used to race. I would drive very, very fast. I knew if I didn't resolve something, I was going to end up wrapping the car around a tree one day."
Both Diller and Scofidio say that a romantic relationship did not develop until after she had completed the course. "She was a student, and I respected that," he says. "He had a family, and I knew it," she says. But at the end of the year, they realized they shared more than an intellectual affinity. They began a tortured, covert affair. "Ric was conflicted," Diller says. "I really was in love with him, but I knew it wouldn't work. I would go out with other people, and he would get enraged. I didn't know what I had gotten myself into. But it seemed inevitable." 
She took a semester off, and afterward they moved in together. "It meant abandoning everything and starting over," Scofidio says. "When I came to Elizabeth, I had a string bass, my suitcase and a huge, red flying Pegasus sign. It was a catharsis of what I had been. It was like shedding skin."
To their relief, when they confessed their relationship to John Hejduk, Cooper Union's dean, he gave them his blessing. Hejduk, who died in 2000, was an oversize personality. More a theorist and a draftsman than a builder, he took the list of functional requirements that architects refer to as a building's "program" and infused them with literary motives and fanciful narratives. 
In their wide-ranging approach to architecture, Diller and Scofidio have clearly been influenced by Hejduk. However, in their enthusiasm for new technologies (Hejduk notoriously rejected computers) and their emphasis on how man-made environments affect behavior, they are reacting to him. Like Hejduk, they are artist-architects; unlike him, they express their artistry by building.
For a long time their work resembled art more than architecture, and they lived like struggling artists as well, in the grimy East Village. They taught at architecture schools -- he is still at Cooper Union, she now at Princeton -- and they had a few small building jobs. But mostly, their public reputation was as avant-garde theater and installation artists. Then, a decade into their joint practice, they received a pivotal commission.
the quickest way of explaining how, within the profession, Diller + Scofidio became a catch phrase is to describe its iconic project, the "Slow House." A weekend retreat on the Long Island waterfront, it was designed in 1989 for a Japanese art investor. "Our client came to us and said he wanted a house with a view," Diller recalls. That request provoked them to explore the very notion of a view -- for instance, the evolution of the picture window and the terminology in real-estate ads. "Why is architecture a technology that creates a view?" Diller recounts. "Because it mediates it with a window frame." The couple argued that the picture window represents a more advanced technology than the video display -- "because it strips away the hardware that you have on a TV monitor and leaves only the effect."
Out of this research emerged a design that, depending on where you are coming from, is either dazzling or lunatic. Although "Slow House" does include certain necessities (like a kitchen and guest bedrooms), it is essentially a retreat with a view. The design has a clarity that architectural lingo, including the discourse of Diller + Scofidio, usually lacks. Knowing that the client would arrive at his weekend hideaway after an automobile trip (with its own windshield-framed view), the architects extended the journey with a long driveway up to a narrow building facade that was just a doorway. The house curved like a banana; once you were inside, the shape prevented you at first from seeing the window in the back. When you finally got to the window-framed view, it was partly obstructed by a video monitor, displaying the same vista. In a revelation worthy of Duchamp, you realized that while the sea has always been there, only man can make a view. 
The design won an award from the magazine Progressive Architecture in 1991 and remains Diller + Scofidio's most influential single work. "You walked by students' desks, and every one had drawn this banana shape," Hays, the Whitney curator, recalls. The house itself, however, was never built. Soon after the foundation was dug, the art market crashed, and the financially stricken client pulled the plug. "It was absolutely heartbreaking," Diller says. 
Another project in 1989 also heightened the firm's profile. Invited by the Museum of Modern Art, the architects created "Para-site," which also looked at the act of viewing -- in this case primarily with surveillance cameras that displayed live images of the spectators. What the strip window was to Le Corbusier, the surveillance camera is to Diller + Scofidio, a signature style element. At the Brasserie, which they redesigned in 2000 in the landmark Seagram Building, the architects placed one monitor in the windowless entrance vestibule to display the street scene outside and a row of 15 monitors over the bar to record in freeze-frame each arrival. The design of the Brasserie riffs on the simultaneous acts of seeing and being seen, but its tufted leather banquette dividers, hand-hammered nose-cone down lights and pale green resin tables proved that these far-out downtown architects could deliver a sleek, luxurious product. "I adore their inventiveness, and they're also hugely disciplined -- it's rare that you have these things together," says Phyllis Lambert, the Bronfman heir who retained Mies van der Rohe to design the original building and strongly backed Diller + Scofidio to redo the Brasserie.
It is tempting to think of Scofidio, a born tinkerer who loves to rebuild old cars, as the detail devotee and Diller as the luftmensch theorist. Scofidio is always sketching; Diller is always talking. But in fact, each draws, and each criticizes the other's sketches. "I could work on something for a month, and she could come by for 10 minutes, and it would radically change what I was doing," Scofidio says. "And vice versa. Elizabeth draws beautiful, really impossible details. She'll work them out, or I'll work them out." In the early days of their partnership, Diller did a couple of solo projects. "I think she was concerned at first that she would be swallowed up by me and not have her own voice," he says. But by the early 80's, as she puts it, "we started merging identity." The cover of "Flesh," a monograph on their work that they produced in 1994, depicts Diller's right buttock on the front cover, Scofidio's on the back and a common crack running up the spine.
In the renaissance, when the client commissioned art as well as architecture, many practitioners (Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael) pursued both lines of work. Later, while architecture continued to be driven by the client's demands, the content of the "pure" arts came to be seen as properly determined by the artist. When Diller and Scofidio speak of straddling the line between artist and architect, they mean that as architects they assert the artist's prerogative of dictating the program. In a remarkable way, the form of their best work is generated from their wide-ranging inquiry into program, not geometries. Of course their client gives them a site and a list of practical requirements, but the resulting building comments on those demands while satisfying them. One recent project was the "Blur" pavilion, built over Lake Neuchatel for Swiss Expo '02. A steel structure studded with thousands of nozzles generated walls of mist. It was an immaterial building, a spectacle without substance.
Over the last two years, Diller and Scofidio, beneficiaries of the trend for attention-grabbing design, have started to win big commissions. It remains an open question whether, in a multimillion-dollar project, they can edit the building program rigorously enough for the theoretical points to emerge. Their biggest commission so far is the Institute of Contemporary Art. Exploiting the Boston Harbor site, they designed a glass box cantilevered over the waterside promenade. Beneath the protective box, a monumental outdoor staircase, of the sort you find on Aztec pyramids, allows visitors to sit and watch the boats go by; continuing inside the building, the steps become theater seating. Another big new Diller + Scofidio project is "Eyebeam," a center for new media and technology in downtown Manhattan. Eyebeam is intended to house studios and exhibition space, with those dual functions cleverly expressed as two interlocking forms. As formally inventive as these buildings are, Betsky, the curator, tried at first to keep them out of the Whitney show, contending that the underlying ideas weren't legible in the models. "I don't know why you're allergic about our projects for the real world," Diller grumbled at a working dinner in December.
Diller + Scofidio is up for two big New York City projects. One, in collaboration with David Rockwell, is a waterfront development on the tip of Manhattan; part of it would be a lawn pulled on the East River by a tugboat. The other, which the firm is favored to win, is a general plan for the public spaces in and around the buildings of Lincoln Center. "We want to intensify the Lincoln Center-ness of it," Diller says. "We are interested in the performative aspects of the exterior spaces." Paradoxically, these grand projects might restore the critical edge of their earlier alt-art work, returning them to the concerns that drew Diller into the profession. "What fascinated me about architecture was not so much the nuts and bolts," she says. "It was much more about real-time performance, choreographing bodies in space. I was specifically not interested in the constructed artifact as an autonomous thing, but the interactions with people." If the world's a stage, she wants Diller + Scofidio to be its set designer.
The saw began to buzz against the Duchamp wall. After a few moments, the carpenter reported cheerfully, "There's only one layer of plywood." 
"Let's just take out a small piece and see what we're working with," Scofidio said. He verified that there was no electrical conduit. The sawing continued.
I asked Diller why she sought to conceal the Duchamp wall project from the Whitney. "We tried to keep it out of the object list and have it go under the radar," she said. "The registrar has a checklist, and if this is on it, it's going to come in the museum, and they're going to say, 'What the hell is this?' We always like to keep things loose and decide at the last moment. If it doesn't have the status of an object, we don't have to say now exactly what it is going to be." 
A couple of minutes later, she returned on her own to the subject of the subterfuge. "We don't want it to become an art object," she said. "It's a wall. It's a part of the armature. We want to subvert the hierarchies and procedures and protocols by which the museum works."
"Over the years, we've been doing installations without curators, and we're used to making decisions at the penultimate moment," said Scofidio, who walked up as Diller and I were talking. "The moment you say, 'This is it,' it becomes very difficult to change in the minds of the curators."
All of that is no doubt true. Yet I felt that their fundamental motive was simpler: a desire to cling to their position as subversives at a time that they are being given a rare museum retrospective and some substantial commissions. You could say that they are demonstrating their critical or dialectical mode of thought. Alternatively, you could say that they are trying to have it both ways.
The saw completed its circuit. Four men gathered to ease the wall segment down. It needed a little more sawing at some sticky points, but eventually it came off cleanly, and they lowered it to the floor. The auratic wall was free to go. Everyone looked relieved.
"This was anticlimactic," Diller said.

HEADLINE: Unspeakable Conversations 

BYLINE:  By Harriet McBryde Johnson; Harriet McBryde Johnson is a lawyer in solo practice in Charleston, S.C. She has been a disability rights activist and advocate for more than 25 years.

 BODY:
He insists he doesn't want to kill me. He simply thinks it would have been better, all things considered, to have given my parents the option of killing the baby I once was, and to let other parents kill similar babies as they come along and thereby avoid the suffering that comes with lives like mine and satisfy the reasonable preferences of parents for a different kind of child. It has nothing to do with me. I should not feel threatened. 
 Whenever I try to wrap my head around his tight string of syllogisms, my brain gets so fried it's . . . almost fun. Mercy! It's like "Alice in Wonderland." 
 It is a chilly Monday in late March, just less than a year ago. I am at Princeton University. My host is Prof. Peter Singer, often called -- and not just by his book publicist -- the most influential philosopher of our time. He is the man who wants me dead. No, that's not at all fair. He wants to legalize the killing of certain babies who might come to be like me if allowed to live. He also says he believes that it should be lawful under some circumstances to kill, at any age, individuals with cognitive impairments so severe that he doesn't consider them "persons." What does it take to be a person? Awareness of your own existence in time. The capacity to harbor preferences as to the future, including the preference for continuing to live. 
At this stage of my life, he says, I am a person. However, as an infant, I wasn't. I, like all humans, was born without self-awareness. And eventually, assuming my brain finally gets so fried that I fall into that wonderland where self and other and present and past and future blur into one boundless, formless all or nothing, then I'll lose my personhood and therefore my right to life. Then, he says, my family and doctors might put me out of my misery, or out of my bliss or oblivion, and no one count it murder. 
I have agreed to two speaking engagements. In the morning, I talk to 150 undergraduates on selective infanticide. In the evening, it is a convivial discussion, over dinner, of assisted suicide. I am the token cripple with an opposing view.
I had several reasons for accepting Singer's invitation, some grounded in my involvement in the disability rights movement, others entirely personal. For the movement, it seemed an unusual opportunity to experiment with modes of discourse that might work with very tough audiences and bridge the divide between our perceptions and theirs. I didn't expect to straighten out Singer's head, but maybe I could reach a student or two. Among the personal reasons: I was sure it would make a great story, first for telling and then for writing down. 
By now I've told it to family and friends and colleagues, over lunches and dinners, on long car trips, in scads of e-mail messages and a couple of formal speeches. But it seems to be a story that just won't settle down. After all these tellings, it still lacks a coherent structure; I'm miles away from a rational argument. I keep getting interrupted by questions -- like these: 
Q: Was he totally grossed out by your physical appearance?
A: He gave no sign of it. None whatsoever. 
Q: How did he handle having to interact with someone like you?
A: He behaved in every way appropriately, treated me as a respected professional acquaintance and was a gracious and accommodating host.
Q: Was it emotionally difficult for you to take part in a public discussion of whether your life should have happened?
A: It was very difficult. And horribly easy. 
Q: Did he get that job at Princeton because they like his ideas on killing disabled babies?
A: It apparently didn't hurt, but he's most famous for animal rights. He's the author of "Animal Liberation."
Q: How can he put so much value on animal life and so little value on human life?
That last question is the only one I avoid. I used to say I don't know; it doesn't make sense. But now I've read some of Singer's writing, and I admit it does make sense -- within the conceptual world of Peter Singer. But I don't want to go there. Or at least not for long.
So I will start from those other questions and see where the story goes this time. 
That first question, about my physical appearance, needs some explaining. 
It's not that I'm ugly. It's more that most people don't know how to look at me. The sight of me is routinely discombobulating. The power wheelchair is enough to inspire gawking, but that's the least of it. Much more impressive is the impact onmy body of more than four decades of a muscle-wasting disease. At this stage of my life, I'm Karen Carpenter thin, flesh mostly vanished, a jumble of bones in a floppy bag of skin. When, in childhood, my muscles got too weak to hold up my spine, I tried a brace for a while, but fortunately a skittish anesthesiologist said no to fusion, plates and pins -- all the apparatus that might have kept me straight. At 15, I threw away the back brace and let my spine reshape itself into a deep twisty S-curve. Now my right side is two deep canyons. To keep myself upright, I lean forward, rest my rib cage on my lap, plant my elbows beside my knees. Since my backbone found its own natural shape, I've been entirely comfortable in my skin. 
I am in the first generation to survive to such decrepitude. Because antibiotics were available, we didn't die from the childhood pneumonias that often come with weakened respiratory systems. I guess it is natural enough that most people don't know what to make of us. 
Two or three times in my life -- I recall particularly one largely crip, largely lesbian cookout halfway across the continent -- I have been looked at as a rare kind of beauty. There is also the bizarre fact that where I live, Charleston, S.C., some people call me Good Luck Lady: they consider it propitious to cross my path when a hurricane is coming and to kiss my head just before voting day. But most often the reactions are decidedly negative. Strangers on the street are moved to comment:
I admire you for being out; most people would give up. 
God bless you! I'll pray for you. 
You don't let the pain hold you back, do you?
If I had to live like you, I think I'd kill myself.
I used to try to explain that in fact I enjoy my life, that it's a great sensual pleasure to zoom by power chair on these delicious muggy streets, that I have no more reason to kill myself than most people. But it gets tedious. God didn't put me on this street to provide disability awareness training to the likes of them. In fact, no god put anyone anywhere for any reason, if you want to know.
But they don't want to know. They think they know everything there is to know, just by looking at me. That's how stereotypes work. They don't know that they're confused, that they're really expressing the discombobulation that comes in my wake. 
So. What stands out when I recall first meeting Peter Singer in the spring of 2001 is his apparent immunity to my looks, his apparent lack of discombobulation, his immediate ability to deal with me as a person with a particular point of view. 
Then, 2001. Singer has been invited to the College of Charleston, not two blocks from my house. He is to lecture on "Rethinking Life and Death." I have been dispatched by Not Dead Yet, the national organization leading the disability-rights opposition to legalized assisted suicide and disability-based killing. I am to put out a leaflet and do something during the Q. and A. 
On arriving almost an hour early to reconnoiter, I find the scene almost entirely peaceful; even the boisterous display of South Carolina spring is muted by gray wisps of Spanish moss and mottled oak bark. 
I roll around the corner of the building and am confronted with the unnerving sight of two people I know sitting on a park bench eating veggie pitas with Singer. Sharon is a veteran activist for human rights. Herb is South Carolina's most famous atheist. Good people, I've always thought -- now sharing veggie pitas and conversation with a proponent of genocide. I try to beat a retreat, but Herb and Sharon have seen me. Sharon tosses her trash and comes over. After we exchange the usual courtesies, she asks, "Would you like to meet Professor Singer?"
She doesn't have a clue. She probably likes his book on animal rights. "I'll just talk to him in the Q. and A." 
But Herb, with Singer at his side, is fast approaching. They are looking at me, and Herb is talking, no doubt saying nice things about me. He'll be saying that I'm a disability rights lawyer and that I gave a talk against assisted suicide at his secular humanist group a while back. He didn't agree with everything I said, he'll say, but I was brilliant. Singer appears interested, engaged. I sit where I'm parked. Herb makes an introduction. Singer extends his hand. 
I hesitate. I shouldn't shake hands with the Evil One. But he is Herb's guest, and I simply can't snub Herb's guest at the college where Herb teaches. Hereabouts, the rule is that if you're not prepared to shoot on sight, you have to be prepared to shake hands. I give Singer the three fingers on my right hand that still work. "Good afternoon, Mr. Singer. I'm here for Not Dead Yet." I want to think he flinches just a little. Not Dead Yet did everything possible to disrupt his first week at Princeton. I sent a check to the fund for the 14 arrestees, who included comrades in power chairs. But if Singer flinches, he instantly recovers. He answers my questions about the lecture format. When he says he looks forward to an interesting exchange, he seems entirely sincere.
It is an interesting exchange. In the lecture hall that afternoon, Singer lays it all out. The "illogic" of allowing abortion but not infanticide, of allowing withdrawal of life support but not active killing. Applying the basic assumptions of preference utilitarianism, he spins out his bone-chilling argument for letting parents kill disabled babies and replace them with nondisabled babies who have a greater chance at happiness. It is all about allowing as many individuals as possible to fulfill as many of their preferences as possible. 
As soon as he's done, I get the microphone and say I'd like to discuss selective infanticide. As a lawyer, I disagree with his jurisprudential assumptions. Logical inconsistency is not a sufficient reason to change the law. As an atheist, I object to his using religious terms ("the doctrine of the sanctity of human life") to characterize his critics. Singer takes a note pad out of his pocket and jots down my points, apparently eager to take them on, and I proceed to the heart of my argument: that the presence or absence of a disability doesn't predict quality of life. I question his replacement-baby theory, with its assumption of "other things equal," arguing that people are not fungible. I draw out a comparison of myself and my nondisabled brother Mac (the next-born after me), each of us with a combination of gifts and flaws so peculiar that we can't be measured on the same scale. 
He responds to each point with clear and lucid counterarguments. He proceeds with the assumption that I am one of the people who might rightly have been killed at birth. He sticks to his guns, conceding just enough to show himself open-minded and flexible. We go back and forth for 10 long minutes. Even as I am horrified by what he says, and by the fact that I have been sucked into a civil discussion of whether I ought to exist, I can't help being dazzled by his verbal facility. He is so respectful, so free of condescension, so focused on the argument, that by the time the show is over, I'm not exactly angry with him. Yes, I am shaking, furious, enraged -- but it's for the big room, 200 of my fellow Charlestonians who have listened with polite interest, when in decency they should have run him out of town on a rail. 
My encounter with Peter Singer merits a mention in my annual canned letter that December. I decide to send Singer a copy. In response, he sends me the nicest possible e-mail message. Dear Harriet (if he may) . . . Just back from Australia, where he's from. Agrees with my comments on the world situation. Supports my work against institutionalization. And then some pointed questions to clarify my views on selective infanticide. 
I reply. Fine, call me Harriet, and I'll reciprocate in the interest of equality, though I'm accustomed to more formality. Skipping agreeable preambles, I answer his questions on disability-based infanticide and pose some of my own. Answers and more questions come back. Back and forth over several weeks it proceeds, an engaging discussion of baby killing, disability prejudice and related points of law and philosophy. Dear Harriet. Dear Peter. 
Singer seems curious to learn how someone who is as good an atheist as he is could disagree with his entirely reasonable views. At the same time, I am trying to plumb his theories. What has him so convinced it would be best to allow parents to kill babies with severe disabilities, and not other kinds of babies, if no infant is a "person" with a right to life? I learn it is partly that both biological and adoptive parents prefer healthy babies. But I have trouble with basing life-and-death decisions on market considerations when the market is structured by prejudice. I offer a hypothetical comparison: "What about mixed-race babies, especially when the combination is entirely nonwhite, who I believe are just about as unadoptable as babies with disabilities?" Wouldn't a law allowing the killing of these undervalued babies validate race prejudice? Singer agrees there is a problem. "It would be horrible," he says, "to see mixed-race babies being killed because they can't be adopted, whereas white ones could be." What's the difference? Preferences based on race are unreasonable. Preferences based on ability are not. Why? To Singer, it's pretty simple: disability makes a person "worse off." 
Are we "worse off"? I don't think so. Not in any meaningful sense. There are too many variables. For those of us with congenital conditions, disability shapes all we are. Those disabled later in life adapt. We take constraints that no one would choose and build rich and satisfying lives within them. We enjoy pleasures other people enjoy, and pleasures peculiarly our own. We have something the world needs. 
Pressing me to admit a negative correlation between disability and happiness, Singer presents a situation: imagine a disabled child on the beach, watching the other children play. 
It's right out of the telethon. I expected something more sophisticated from a professional thinker. I respond: "As a little girl playing on the beach, I was already aware that some people felt sorry for me, that I wasn't frolicking with the same level of frenzy as other children. This annoyed me, and still does." I take the time to write a detailed description of how I, in fact, had fun playing on the beach, without the need of standing, walking or running. But, really, I've had enough. I suggest to Singer that we have exhausted our topic, and I'll be back in touch when I get around to writing about him.
He responds by inviting me to Princeton. I fire off an immediate maybe. 
Of course I'm flattered. Mama will be impressed. 
But there are things to consider. Not Dead Yet says -- and I completely agree -- that we should not legitimate Singer's views by giving them a forum. We should not make disabled lives subject to debate. Moreover, any spokesman chosen by the opposition is by definition a token. But even if I'm a token, I won't have to act like one. And anyway, I'm kind of stuck. If I decline, Singer can make some hay: "I offered them a platform, but they refuse rational discussion." It's an old trick, and I've laid myself wide open. 
My invitation is to have an exchange of views with Singer during his undergraduate course. He also proposes a second "exchange," open to the whole university, later in the day. This sounds a lot like debating my life -- and on my opponent's turf, with my opponent moderating, to boot. I offer a counterproposal, to which Singer proves amenable. I will open the class with some comments on infanticide and related issues and then let Singer grill me as hard as he likes before we open it up for the students. Later in the day, I might take part in a discussion of some other disability issue in a neutral forum. Singer suggests a faculty-student discussion group sponsored by his department but with cross-departmental membership. The topic I select is "Assisted Suicide, Disability Discrimination and the Illusion of Choice: A Disability Rights Perspective." I inform a few movement colleagues of this turn of events, and advice starts rolling in. I decide to go with the advisers who counsel me to do the gig, lie low and get out of Dodge. 
I ask Singer to refer me to the person who arranges travel at Princeton. I imagine some capable and unflappable woman like my sister, Beth, whose varied job description at a North Carolina university includes handling visiting artists. Singer refers me to his own assistant, who certainly seems capable and unflappable enough. However, almost immediately Singer jumps back in via e-mail. It seems the nearest hotel has only one wheelchair-accessible suite, available with two rooms for $600 per night. What to do? I know I shouldn't be so accommodating, but I say I can make do with an inaccessible room if it has certain features. Other logistical issues come up. We go back and forth. Questions and answers. Do I really need a lift-equipped vehicle at the airport? Can't my assistant assist me into a conventional car? How wide is my wheelchair? 
By the time we're done, Singer knows that I am 28 inches wide. I have trouble controlling my wheelchair if my hand gets cold. I am accustomed to driving on rough, irregular surfaces, but I get nervous turning on steep slopes. Even one step is too many. I can swallow purees, soft bread and grapes. I use a bedpan, not a toilet. None of this is a secret; none of it cause for angst. But I do wonder whether Singer is jotting down my specs in his little note pad as evidence of how "bad off" people like me really are. 
I realize I must put one more issue on the table: etiquette. I was criticized within the movement when I confessed to shaking Singer's hand in Charleston, and some are appalled that I have agreed to break bread with him in Princeton. I think they have a very good point, but, again, I'm stuck. I'm engaged for a day of discussion, not a picket line. It is not in my power to marginalize Singer at Princeton; nothing would be accomplished by displays of personal disrespect. However, chumminess is clearly inappropriate. I tell Singer that in the lecture hall it can't be Harriet and Peter; it must be Ms. Johnson and Mr. Singer. 
He seems genuinely nettled. Shouldn't it be Ms. Johnsonand Professor Singer, if I want to be formal? To counter, I invoke the ceremonial low-country usage, Attorney Johnson and Professor Singer, but point out that Mr./Ms. is the custom in American political debates and might seem more normal in New Jersey. All right, he says. Ms./Mr. it will be. 
I describe this awkward social situation to the lawyer in my office who has served as my default lunch partner for the past 14 years. He gives forth a full-body shudder. 
"That poor, sorry son of a bitch! He has no idea what he's in for."
Being a disability rights lawyer lecturing at Princeton does confer some cachet at the Newark airport. I need all the cachet I can get. Delta Airlines has torn up my power chair. It is a fairly frequent occurrence for any air traveler on wheels. 
When they inform me of the damage in Atlanta, I throw a monumental fit and tell them to have a repair person meet me in Newark with new batteries to replace the ones inexplicably destroyed. Then I am told no new batteries can be had until the morning. It's Sunday night. On arrival in Newark, I'm told of a plan to put me up there for the night and get me repaired and driven to Princeton by 10 a.m. 
"That won't work. I'm lecturing at 10. I need to get there tonight, go to sleep and be in my right mind tomorrow." 
"What? You're lecturing? They told us it was a conference. We need to get you fixed tonight!"
Carla, the gate agent, relieves me of the need to throw any further fits by undertaking on my behalf the fit of all fits. 
Carmen, the personal assistant with whom I'm traveling, pushes me in my disabled chair around the airport in search of a place to use the bedpan. However, instead of diaper-changing tables, which are functional though far from private, we find a flip-down plastic shelf that doesn't look like it would hold my 70 pounds of body weight. It's no big deal; I've restricted my fluids. But Carmen is a little freaked. It is her first adventure in power-chair air travel. I thought I prepared her for the trip, but I guess I neglected to warn her about the probability of wheelchair destruction. I keep forgetting that even people who know me well don't know much about my world. 
We reach the hotel at 10:15 p.m., four hours late. 
I wake up tired. I slept better than I would have slept in Newark with an unrepaired chair, but any hotel bed is a near guarantee of morning crankiness. I tell Carmen to leave the TV off. I don't want to hear the temperature. 
I do the morning stretch. Medical people call it passive movement, but it's not really passive. Carmen's hands move my limbs, following my precise instructions, her strength giving effect to my will. Carmen knows the routine, so it is in near silence that we begin easing slowly into the day. I let myself be propped up to eat oatmeal and drink tea. Then there's the bedpan and then bathing and dressing, still in bed. As the caffeine kicks in, silence gives way to conversation about practical things. Carmen lifts me into my chair and straps a rolled towel under my ribs for comfort and stability. She tugs at my clothes to remove wrinkles that could cause pressure sores. She switches on my motors and gives me the means of moving without anyone's help. They don't call it a power chair for nothing. 
I drive to the mirror. I do my hair in one long braid. Even this primal hairdo requires, at this stage of my life, joint effort. I undo yesterday's braid, fix the part and comb the hair in front. Carmen combs where I can't reach. I divide the mass into three long hanks and start the braid just behind my left ear. Section by section, I hand it over to her, and her unimpaired young fingers pull tight, crisscross, until the braid is fully formed. 
A big polyester scarf completes my costume. Carmen lays it over my back. I tie it the way I want it, but Carmen starts fussing with it, trying to tuck it down in the back. I tell her that it's fine, and she stops.
On top of the scarf, she wraps the two big shawls that I hope will substitute for an overcoat. I don't own any real winter clothes. I just stay out of the cold, such cold as we get in Charleston. 
We review her instructions for the day. Keep me in view and earshot. Be instantly available but not intrusive. Be polite, but don't answer any questions about me. I am glad that she has agreed to come. She's strong, smart, adaptable and very loyal. But now she is digging under the shawls, fussing with that scarf again.
"Carmen. What are you doing?" 
"I thought I could hide this furry thing you sit on."
"Leave it. Singer knows lots of people eat meat. Now he'll know some crips sit on sheepskin."
The walk is cold but mercifully short. The hotel is just across the street from Princeton's wrought-iron gate and a few short blocks from the building where Singer's assistant shows us to the elevator. The elevator doubles as the janitor's closet -- the cart with the big trash can and all the accouterments is rolled aside so I can get in. Evidently there aren't a lot of wheelchair people using this building. 
We ride the broom closet down to the basement and are led down a long passageway to a big lecture hall. As the students drift in, I engage in light badinage with the sound technician. He is squeamish about touching me, but I insist that the cordless lavaliere is my mike of choice. I invite him to clip it to the big polyester scarf. 
The students enter from the rear door, way up at ground level, and walk down stairs to their seats. I feel like an animal in the zoo. I hadn't reckoned on the architecture, those tiers of steps that separate me from a human wall of apparent physical and mental perfection, that keep me confined down here in my pit. 
It is 5 before 10. Singer is loping down the stairs. I feel like signaling to Carmen to open the door, summon the broom closet and get me out of here. But Singer greets me pleasantly and hands me Princeton's check for $500, the fee he offered with apologies for its inadequacy.
So. On with the show. 
My talk to the students is pretty Southern. I've decided to pound them with heart, hammer them with narrative and say "y'all" and "folks." I play with the emotional tone, giving them little peaks and valleys, modulating three times in one 45-second patch. I talk about justice. Even beauty and love. I figure they haven't been getting much of that from Singer. 
Of course, I give them some argument too. I mean to honor my contractual obligations. I lead with the hypothetical about mixed-race, nonwhite babies and build the ending around the question of who should have the burden of proof as to the quality of disabled lives. And woven throughout the talk is the presentation of myself as a representative of a minority group that has been rendered invisible by prejudice and oppression, a participant in a discussion that would not occur in a just world.
I let it go a little longer than I should. Their faces show they're going where I'm leading, and I don't look forward to letting them go. But the clock on the wall reminds me of promises I mean to keep, and I stop talking and submit myself to examination and inquiry.
Singer's response is surprisingly soft. Maybe after hearing that this discussion is insulting and painful to me, he doesn't want to exacerbate my discomfort. His reframing of the issues is almost pro forma, abstract, entirely impersonal. Likewise, the students' inquiries are abstract and fairly predictable: anencephaly, permanent unconsciousness, eugenic abortion. I respond to some of them with stories, but mostly I give answers I could have e-mailed in.
I call on a young man near the top of the room. 
"Do you eat meat?"
"Yes, I do."
"Then how do you justify--"
"I haven't made any study of animal rights, so anything I could say on the subject wouldn't be worth everyone's time."
The next student wants to work the comparison of disability and race, and Singer joins the discussion until he elicits a comment from me that he can characterize as racist. He scores a point, but that's all right. I've never claimed to be free of prejudice, just struggling with it. 
Singer proposes taking me on a walk around campus, unless I think it would be too cold. What the hell? "It's probably warmed up some. Let's go out and see how I do." 
He doesn't know how to get out of the building without using the stairs, so this time it is my assistant leading the way. Carmen has learned of another elevator, which arrives empty. When we get out of the building, she falls behind a couple of paces, like a respectful chaperone. 
In the classroom there was a question about keeping alive the unconscious. In response, I told a story about a family I knew as a child, which took loving care of a nonresponsive teenage girl, acting out their unconditional commitment to each other, making all the other children, and me as their visitor, feel safe. This doesn't satisfy Singer. "Let's assume we can prove, absolutely, that the individual is totally unconscious and that we can know, absolutely, that the individual will never regain consciousness."
I see no need to state an objection, with no stenographer present to record it; I'll play the game and let him continue. 
"Assuming all that," he says, "don't you think continuing to take care of that individual would be a bit -- weird?" 
"No. Done right, it could be profoundly beautiful." 
"But what about the caregiver, a woman typically, who is forced to provide all this service to a family member, unable to work, unable to have a life of her own?" 
"That's not the way it should be. Not the way it has to be. As a society, we should pay workers to provide that care, in the home. In some places, it's been done that way for years. That woman shouldn't be forced to do it, any more than my family should be forced to do my care."
Singer takes me around the architectural smorgasbord that is Princeton University by a route that includes not one step, unramped curb or turn on a slope. Within the strange limits of this strange assignment, it seems Singer is doing all he can to make me comfortable. 
He asks what I thought of the students' questions. 
"They were fine, about what I expected. I was a little surprised by the question about meat eating."
"I apologize for that. That was out of left field. But -- I think what he wanted to know is how you can have such high respect for human life and so little respect for animal life." 
"People have lately been asking me the converse, how you can have so much respect for animal life and so little respect for human life."
"And what do you answer?"
"I say I don't know. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me." 
"Well, in my view--"
"Look. I have lived in blissful ignorance all these years, and I'm not prepared to give that up today."
"Fair enough," he says and proceeds to recount bits of Princeton history. He stops. "This will be of particular interest to you, I think. This is where your colleagues with Not Dead Yet set up their blockade." I'm grateful for the reminder. My brothers and sisters were here before me and behaved far more appropriately than I am doing. 
A van delivers Carmen and me early for the evening forum. Singer says he hopes I had a pleasant afternoon. 
Yes, indeed. I report a pleasant lunch and a very pleasant nap, and I tell him about the Christopher Reeve Suite in the hotel, which has been remodeled to accommodate Reeve, who has family in the area. 
"Do you suppose that's the $600 accessible suite they told me about?"
"Without doubt. And if I'd known it was the Christopher Reeve Suite, I would have held out for it."
"Of course you would have!" Singer laughs. "And we'd have had no choice, would we?"
We talk about the disability rights critique of Reeve and various other topics. Singer is easy to talk to, good company. Too bad he sees lives like mine as avoidable mistakes. 
I'm looking forward to the soft vegetarian meal that has been arranged; I'm hungry. Assisted suicide, as difficult as it is, doesn't cause the kind of agony I felt discussing disability-based infanticide. In this one, I understand, and to some degree can sympathize with, the opposing point of view -- misguided though it is. 
My opening sticks to the five-minute time limit. I introduce the issue as framed by academic articles Not Dead Yet recommended for my use. Andrew Batavia argues for assisted suicide based on autonomy, a principle generally held high in the disability rights movement. In general, he says, the movement fights for our right to control our own lives; when we need assistance to effect our choices, assistance should be available to us as a matter of right. If the choice is to end our lives, he says, we should have assistance then as well. But Carol Gill says that it is differential treatment -- disability discrimination -- to try to prevent most suicides while facilitating the suicides of ill and disabled people. The social-science literature suggests that the public in general, and physicians in particular, tend to underestimate the quality of life of disabled people, compared with our own assessments of our lives. The case for assisted suicide rests on stereotypes that our lives are inherently so bad that it is entirely rational if we want to die.
I side with Gill. What worries me most about the proposals for legalized assisted suicide is their veneer of beneficence -- the medical determination that, for a given individual, suicide is reasonable or right. It is not about autonomy but about nondisabled people telling us what's good for us.
In the discussion that follows, I argue that choice is illusory in a context of pervasive inequality. Choices are structured by oppression. We shouldn't offer assistance with suicide until we all have the assistance we need to get out of bed in the morning and live a good life. Common causes of suicidality -- dependence, institutional confinement, being a burden -- are entirely curable. Singer, seated on my right, participates in the discussion but doesn't dominate it. During the meal, I occasionally ask him to put things within my reach, and he competently complies. 
I feel as if I'm getting to a few of them, when a student asks me a question. The words are all familiar, but they're strung together in a way so meaningless that I can't even retain them -- it's like a long sentence in Tagalog. I can only admit my limitations. "That question's too abstract for me to deal with. Can you rephrase it?" 
He indicates that it is as clear as he can make it, so I move on. 
A little while later, my right elbow slips out from under me. This is awkward. Normally I get whoever is on my right to do this sort of thing. Why not now? I gesture to Singer. He leans over, and I whisper, "Grasp this wrist and pull forward one inch, without lifting." He follows my instructions to the letter. He sees that now I can again reach my food with my fork. And he may now understand what I was saying a minute ago, that most of the assistance disabled people need does not demand medical training. 
A philosophy professor says, "It appears that your objections to assisted suicide are essentially tactical." 
"Excuse me?"
"By that I mean they are grounded in current conditions of political, social and economic inequality. What if we assume that such conditions do not exist?"
"Why would we want to do that?"
"I want to get to the real basis for the position you take."
I feel as if I'm losing caste. It is suddenly very clear that I'm not a philosopher. I'm like one of those old practitioners who used to visit my law school, full of bluster about life in the real world. Such a bore! A once-sharp mind gone muddy! And I'm only 44 -- not all that old. 
The forum is ended, and I've been able to eat very little of my pureed food. I ask Carmen to find the caterer and get me a container. Singer jumps up to take care of it. He returns with a box and obligingly packs my food to go. 
When I get home, people are clamoring for the story. The lawyers want the blow-by-blow of my forensic triumph over the formidable foe; when I tell them it wasn't like that, they insist that it was. Within the disability rights community, there is less confidence. It is generally assumed that I handled the substantive discussion well, but people worry that my civility may have given Singer a new kind of legitimacy. I hear from Laura, a beloved movement sister. She is appalled that I let Singer provide even minor physical assistance at the dinner. "Where was your assistant?" she wants to know. How could I put myself in a relationship with Singer that made him appear so human, even kind?
I struggle to explain. I didn't feel disempowered; quite the contrary, it seemed a good thing to make him do some useful work. And then, the hard part: I've come to believe that Singer actually is human, even kind in his way. There ensues a discussion of good and evil and personal assistance and power and philosophy and tactics for which I'm profoundly grateful. 
I e-mail Laura again. This time I inform her that I've changed my will. She will inherit a book that Singer gave me, a collection of his writings with a weirdly appropriate inscription: "To Harriet Johnson, So that you will have a better answer to questions about animals. And thanks for coming to Princeton. Peter Singer. March 25, 2002." She responds that she is changing her will, too. I'll get the autographed photo of Jerry Lewis she received as an M.D.A. poster child. We joke that each of us has given the other a "reason to live."
I have had a nice e-mail message from Singer, hoping Carmen and I and the chair got home without injury, relaying positive feedback from my audiences -- and taking me to task for a statement that isn't supported by a relevant legal authority, which he looked up. I report that we got home exhausted but unharmed and concede that he has caught me in a generalization that should have been qualified. It's clear that the conversation will continue. 
I am soon sucked into the daily demands of law practice, family, community and politics. In the closing days of the state legislative session, I help get a bill passed that I hope will move us one small step toward a world in which killing won't be such an appealing solution to the "problem" of disability. It is good to focus on this kind of work. But the conversations with and about Singer continue. Unable to muster the appropriate moral judgments, I ask myself a tough question: am I in fact a silly little lady whose head is easily turned by a man who gives her a kind of attention she enjoys? I hope not, but I confess that I've never been able to sustain righteous anger for more than about 30 minutes at a time. My view of life tends more toward tragedy. 
The tragic view comes closest to describing how I now look at Peter Singer. He is a man of unusual gifts, reaching for the heights. He writes that he is trying to create a system of ethics derived from fact and reason, that largely throws off the perspectives of religion, place, family, tribe, community and maybe even species -- to "take the point of view of the universe." His is a grand, heroic undertaking. 
But like the protagonist in a classical drama, Singer has his flaw. It is his unexamined assumption that disabled people are inherently "worse off," that we "suffer," that we have lesser "prospects of a happy life." Because of this all-too-common prejudice, and his rare courage in taking it to its logical conclusion, catastrophe looms. Here in the midpoint of the play, I can't look at him without fellow-feeling.
I am regularly confronted by people who tell me that Singer doesn't deserve my human sympathy. I should make him an object of implacable wrath, to be cut off, silenced, destroyed absolutely. And I find myself lacking a logical argument to the contrary.
I am talking to my sister Beth on the phone. "You kind of like the monster, don't you?" she says.
I find myself unable to evade, certainly unwilling to lie. "Yeah, in a way. And he's not exactly a monster."
"You know, Harriet, there were some very pleasant Nazis. They say the SS guards went home and played on the floor with their children every night."
She can tell that I'm chastened; she changes the topic, lets me off the hook. Her harshness has come as a surprise. She isn't inclined to moralizing; in our family, I'm the one who sets people straight. 
When I put the phone down, my argumentative nature feels frustrated. In my mind, I replay the conversation, but this time defend my position. 
"He's not exactly a monster. He just has some strange ways of looking at things."
"He's advocating genocide."
"That's the thing. In his mind, he isn't. He's only giving parents a choice. He thinks the humans he is talking about aren't people, aren't 'persons."'
"But that's the way it always works, isn't it? They're always animals or vermin or chattel goods. Objects, not persons. He's repackaging some old ideas. Making them acceptable."
"I think his ideas are new, in a way. It's not old-fashioned hate. It's a twisted, misinformed, warped kind of beneficence. His motive is to do good."
"What do you care about motives?" she asks. "Doesn't this beneficent killing make disabled brothers and sisters just as dead?" 
"But he isn't killing anyone. It's just talk." 
"Just talk? It's talk with an agenda, talk aimed at forming policy. Talk that's getting a receptive audience. You of all people know the power of that kind of talk."
"Well, sure, but--"
"If talk didn't matter, would you make it your life's work?"
"But," I say, "his talk won't matter in the end. He won't succeed in reinventing morality. He stirs the pot, brings things out into the open. But ultimately we'll make a world that's fit to live in, a society that has room for all its flawed creatures. History will remember Singer as a curious example of the bizarre things that can happen when paradigms collide." 
"What if you're wrong? What if he convinces people that there's no morally significant difference between a fetus and a newborn, and just as disabled fetuses are routinely aborted now, so disabled babies are routinely killed? Might some future generation take it further than Singer wants to go? Might some say there's no morally significant line between a newborn and a 3-year-old?"
"Sure. Singer concedes that a bright line cannot be drawn. But he doesn't propose killing anyone who prefers to live." 
"That overarching respect for the individual's preference for life -might some say it's a fiction, a fetish, a quasi-religious belief?"
"Yes," I say. "That's pretty close to what I think. As an atheist, I think all preferences are moot once you kill someone. The injury is entirely to the surviving community." 
"So what if that view wins out, but you can't break disability prejudice? What if you wind up in a world where the disabled person's 'irrational' preference to live must yield to society's 'rational' interest in reducing the incidence of disability? Doesn't horror kick in somewhere? Maybe as you watch the door close behind whoever has wheeled you into the gas chamber?"
"That's not going to happen."
"Do you have empirical evidence?" she asks. "A logical argument?"
"Of course not. And I know it's happened before, in what was considered the most progressive medical community in the world. But it won't happen. I have to believe that."
Belief. Is that what it comes down to? Am I a person of faith after all? Or am I clinging to foolish hope that the tragic protagonist, this one time, will shift course before it's too late? 
I don't think so. It's less about belief, less about hope, than about a practical need for definitions I can live with. 
If I define Singer's kind of disability prejudice as an ultimate evil, and him as a monster, then I must so define all who believe disabled lives are inherently worse off or that a life without a certain kind of consciousness lacks value. That definition would make monsters of many of the people with whom I move on the sidewalks, do business, break bread, swap stories and share the grunt work of local politics. It would reach some of my family and most of my nondisabled friends, people who show me personal kindness and who sometimes manage to love me through their ignorance. I can't live with a definition of ultimate evil that encompasses all of them. I can't refuse the monster-majority basic respect and human sympathy. It's not in my heart to deny every single one of them, categorically, my affection and my love. 
The peculiar drama of my life has placed me in a world that by and large thinks it would be better if people like me did not exist. My fight has been for accommodation, the world to me and me to the world. 
As a disability pariah, I must struggle for a place, for kinship, for community, for connection. Because I am still seeking acceptance of my humanity, Singer's call to get past species seems a luxury way beyond my reach. My goal isn't to shed the perspective that comes from my particular experience, but to give voice to it. I want to be engaged in the tribal fury that rages when opposing perspectives are let loose.
As a shield from the terrible purity of Singer's vision, I'll look to the corruption that comes from interconnectedness. To justify my hopes that Singer's theoretical world -- and its entirely logical extensions -- won't become real, I'll invoke the muck and mess and undeniable reality of disabled lives well lived. That's the best I can do.

HEADLINE: Forget Diversity 

 BODY:
 Traub's conclusion that we should eliminate our pursuit of diversity and "do something about the educational failure that has made affirmative action necessary in the first place" misses the point. The courting of diversity by American colleges and universities is hardly a high-minded effort to address the needs of minority populations. Rather, because post-secondary education provides America with its top level of employees, diversity (an example of social engineering) is a response to the needs of corporate America. In an economy as globally invested as ours, it is imperative that we have managers and executives who more closely resemble the internationals with whom they will be dealing.

The Efficient Way to Not See Each Other

BYLINE:  By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I JUST finished the upgrade of our cellphones, the time every two years when I re-enlist with my provider in exchange for more minutes for less money than my previous plan. As part of the deal, I also get a new phone, one that does tricks that were not yet invented the last time I got a phone, and which I won't learn how to use until it's time to replace this one.
 So I am learning to send text messages. Not just because there was a free one-month trial, which there was, or because it's cool, which I'm told it is, but for the most practical of reasons. It might actually help me keep in touch with my husband. 
 We have a very modern marriage. In other words, we never seem to see each other. A recent 10-day stretch went something like this: Bruce had a committee meeting on Tuesday night and a work dinner on Wednesday night; on Thursday, we actually ate at the same table; then he was on call on Friday and Saturday, and I left for a three-day overseas work trip on Sunday. Hours after I returned, he was off overnight for a business trip of his own. On Friday, we reintroduced ourselves.
But just because we weren't together doesn't mean we weren't in touch. We knew each other's travel schedules, and dinner plans and the status of the children's homework, and when to give medicine to the dog. On weeks as bad as this one, and on more typical weeks which are only half as busy, we talk all the time -- by phone, yes, and, increasingly often, by e-mail.
My theory is that e-mail is replacing phone conversation for working couples. It is particularly helpful when time zones get in the way. Bruce Richardson, a senior vice president of research for AMR Research in Boston, travels 80 percent of the time. His wife, Ellen Slaby, director of strategic communications for Centra Software, rarely calls him on his cellphone for fear of interrupting a speech or a meeting. But she knows he'll check his e-mail any chance he gets.
Over the last year, she told me (via e-mail, of course) they have chatted about the following without actually talking: "the schedule for our ballet tickets, who was picking up a book for my father's birthday, potential job openings for unemployed friends and relatives, which of us are taking our Red Sox tickets for a particular night, what was the status of our broken sewer pipe (yuck), did I stop the mail delivery for our upcoming vacation, our application to refinance our house, and almost every week, our dinner reservations for Friday night. But the best e-mail I received from him simply said, 'Can I come home?' after a particularly long and grueling 10-day business trip."
Even when couples aren't traveling, though, e-mail has become a primary form of communication. "There's another way?" asks Kelly Deters Baker, a managing partner of Ridgeland Properties. "I can't remember the last time we called each other during the day." Her husband is the owner of a flavor company and, "invariably when we do talk person-to-person in the middle of the day, there's tension because one of us is in the middle of a huge project behind deadline," she said. Instead, they use e-mail "to do everything from drop a quick 'hi' to arrange meetings to make weekend plans; it keeps us connected without the conflict."
Jack Jackson, who runs a marketing company near Boston, agreed. "We've been married for 20 years and I feel like we rarely talk, he said, referring to his wife, Cindy. He and Cindy, a director for the management-consulting firm Bain & Company, "manage the kids (we get e-mail from teachers), our social lives (booking dates with each other or with other couples) and our family matters (elderly mother, picking her up from the eye doctor) all through e-mail."
And it has come to the point where working couples are using e-mail not only when they are traveling, or at the office, but together at home. While Mr. Jackson was in one room talking to me online about his e-mail habits, his wife was in another room, logged into her office. That's when this happened: "Instead of calling out to me -- to see whether I remembered to call the school about something that day -- she e-mailed me. (Sigh)."
Bruce and I have not done that -- yet. But we have been known to beam notes via our Palm Pilots, and I will even admit to paging him once or twice when I was upstairs and he was all the way downstairs and it was just too far to walk. So e-mailing from room to room may not be far behind.
On this weekend after Valentine's Day, though, I prefer to look at another side of this trend. I've learned that 17*31707*1 in a text message spells "I Love You" if you turn it upside down.

A Hand That Freely Left Its Mark

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
In 1978, Keith Haring, a 20-year-old graphic whiz from Kutztown, Pa., arrived in New York dreaming of artistic glory and quickly drew his way to fame. He loved the city -- its streets, museums, ethnic complexity, sexual freedom and downtown club scene. Unaided by dealers or galleries, he made his debut in the city's subway stations, where he rendered exuberant pictographs in white chalk on the black paper of empty advertising spaces. 
 In the process, and along with other precocious, graffiti-inclined artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kenny Scharf, he helped inaugurate the cultural multiplex that was the 80's art scene. It was a period in which figurative painting, political consciousness and popular culture became important forces in contemporary art, and Haring touched all three bases with consummate ease. 
 The expanding universe of dancing figures, yapping dogs, crawling babies and levitating pyramids that Haring created was further animated by short all-purpose dashes and commas that conveyed everything from spiritual radiance to anger to music. These gyrating images and patterns told tales of transcendence and celebration and were adaptable to any surface, flat or not. They proliferated on vinyl tarps and wood sculptures that Haring showed in galleries and at clubs, on public murals executed before audiences of awed schoolchildren and on T-shirts, buttons, skateboards and lunch boxes sold at the Pop Shop, which Haring opened on Lafayette Street in SoHo in 1986 and which is still in business. 
Haring's artistic journey not only provides the story line to "Radiant Baby" but is also built into the musical's dazzling, economical stage set.
Designed by Riccardo Hernandez, with lighting by Howell Binkley and projections by Batwin & Robin Productions, the set marshals projected images and actual-size reproductions of the artist's work into a giddy full-scale retrospective. Splayed across a stark white set whose crisp proscenium arches resemble the borders of 35-millimeter slides, the projected images conjure up studio walls, gallery shows and magazine spreads.
Toward the musical's close, the many public projects that Haring completed in the last three years of his life, when he knew he had AIDS, flash before the eyes and recede in the distance, like a final display of fireworks. ROBERTA SMITH

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO; 
Country Radio: Nowhere in New York

BYLINE:  By FRED GOODMAN; Fred Goodman is the author of "The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Commerce."

 BODY:
WHEN the country musician and producer Marty Stuart was in New York late last year to promote "Kindred Spirits," a tribute to the songs of Johnny Cash, it should have been easy. With performances by Mr. Stuart and other established country performers like Travis Tritt, Emmylou Harris and Steve Earle as well as rockers like Sheryl Crow, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan, "Kindred Spirits" is a heartfelt and wide-ranging homage to a country music giant from musicians who have sold hundreds of millions of albums.
 Yet Mr. Stuart found just two radio stations interested in it. One was WNYC-AM, a National Public Radio station with a news and talk format, and the other was WFUV-FM, Fordham University's eclectic folk, rock and roots station. With the exception of WFUV, it is unlikely that any of the recordings on "Kindred Spirits" were played, or will be played, in New York. 
 As musicians and executives from the world of country music travel to New York this week for the Grammy Awards, at a time when their national profile and sales are way up, it's a sad and deflating paradox that they won't be hearing country music on New York radio. Mr. Stuart's quandary is one that has been facing them, as well as country fans, since last May, when WYNY-FM (107.1) switched from country to a Top 40 Spanish format, leaving New York without a country music station. 
And despite widespread agreement that a New York country station could be lucrative, the situation is unlikely to change soon. "It's sad and it's frustrating," Mr. Stuart said. "There's a misapprehension that there are no country fans in New York." He pointed out that New York was the scene of several watershed performances in the history of country music, including Flatt and Scruggs's 1962 Carnegie Hall concert and Waylon Jennings's 1973 appearance at Max's Kansas City. But the lack of a country station makes it more difficult for country musicians to bring their tours to the New York area.
"Now there's no club like the Lone Star in New York and no radio station," Mr. Stuart added. "If you want to play New York, you have to scale down your show and go to the Bottom Line or out to Old Westbury on Long Island. If we had a radio station it could be different. I don't understand why no one wants to step up."
Nationwide, country remains a mainstay of radio: there are 2,195 commercial stations employing a country format, about 20 percent of all commercial stations, according to Interep, an advertising sales and marketing company specializing in radio. Yet broadcasters are hesitant to program country music in New York. Some radio executives say that has nothing to do with demand and everything to do with advertiser prejudice.
"IF someone started a country station in New York, they'd probably be in the top 10," said Eric Wellman, assistant director of programming at the classic-rock station WAXQ-FM (104.3). "But they couldn't sell it. The stations get listeners, but advertisers tend to feel they're not the ones they want. The attitude is that you may get 20 million listeners but they're all on welfare and driving rusted pickup trucks."
In reality, studies demonstrate that the economic profile of the average country music fan in the New York area is almost identical to that of listeners to such top-rated adult contemporary stations as WLTW-FM (106.7) and WPLJ-FM (95.5) -- one of the most sought-after demographics. Most country music fans in New York live in the suburbs, and they actually appear to be slightly more affluent than adult-contemporary listeners: they have higher rates of home ownership, second cars and managerial jobs. Country audiences do tend to skew slightly toward women, however -- not as attractive a target audience as one that is predominantly male or equally divided. "Apparently, country music fans don't drive cars or eat," Mr. Wellman said with a roll of the eyes.
The veteran New York disc jockey Jim Kerr, who has had shows on both WPLJ and WYNY, said: "A full-power country station in New York could, without much trouble, draw an audience equivalent to that of WPLJ, which is perceived to be a successful station." And like many who have worked in New York country radio, Mr. Kerr said he was mystified by the absence of a country outlet considering the past success enjoyed by stations like WHN-AM and WYNY.
During the late 70's, when Ed Salamon was its program director, WHN was the No. 2 station in New York with 1.5 million listeners. "Of course the market can support a country station," said Mr. Salamon, now president of the industry trade group Country Radio Broadcasters. "All those people didn't move out of New York. The people in the greater New York area are not all that different from the rest of America, and the issues for a country broadcaster are very much the same as they are for any other format: you've got to provide a compelling station." 
Sean Ross, the Group Editor at Airplay Monitor, the radio publication of Billboard, and a longtime observer of New York radio, agreed. "WHN was a world-class station that happened to be a country station," he said. "There has always been a niche and some money for country in New York if somebody was willing to do it." Indeed, when WHN switched to a sports format in 1987 and became WFAN, WYNY immediately stepped in to fill the country void, broadcasting first as an NBC-owned station at 97.1 and later, when General Electric sold NBC's radio holdings, at 103.5 under the ownership of Westwood One.
During the early 90's, WYNY demonstrated country's continuing appeal to New York listeners, grabbing the sixth-largest adult audience in the city. Mr. Kerr said that the numbers the station was garnering then would today put it right behind the talk station WABC-AM (770), which is currently No. 7 in the New York radio market among listeners 12 and older. But the steady numbers and listener loyalty that were the hallmarks of the country format were proving less and less important in the evolving world of New York radio, and in 1996 a new owner, Evergreen Broadcasting, replaced WYNY with WKTU, an urban hits station (which quickly became No. 1 in the market).
"People in the radio business don't want consistency, they want growth," said an industry veteran who did not want to be identified. "If you're a country station in New York, you're going to top off: you're never going to be No. 1 in the market, and people want to be No. 1. Of course, in pursuit of being No. 1 you usually wind up being No. 25. So why not go after the country market knowing that you can be the No. 7 or 8 station in New York?"
That may very well have been the thinking behind the next incarnation of WYNY. The format and call letters were picked up by New York-based Big City Radio and moved to 107.1, where the station became known as Country Y-107. But before the station had broadcast on a single strong New York City signal. The new WYNY was actually an amalgam of four small suburban transmitters in Stroudsburg, Pa., Long Branch, N.J., Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and eastern Long Island, all broadcasting on 107.1. The result was an uneven and hard-to-hold signal that was particularly elusive in New York City; WYNY dropped from the 3.5 percent share of the New York market it had enjoyed at its peak in the 90's to 1.2 percent in early 2001.
But even with the weak signal, Mr. Kerr pointed out, the station was the No. 1 suburban broadcaster in the market -- an accomplishment he thinks could have been built on. Instead, Big City converted WYNY last May to Rumba 107.1, a Latin hits station. In its first Arbitron ratings book, the station failed to register, scoring a zero. Last month, Big City declared bankruptcy and sold the stations to a New Jersey broadcaster for $43 million. Their future format is unclear.
That's scant comfort for the fans, musicians and executives who want to see a country music station in New York. In the absence of airplay, country music sales have not made the same gains in New York that they have in much of the rest of the country. According to Nielsen SoundScan, total sales of country albums in the United States rose to 76.9 million last year from 68.5 million in 2001, but country sales in New York were virtually unchanged.
"The only options we have for promoting country artists in New York are the morning news shows, programs like 'Regis and Kelly,' and local newspapers," said Joe Galante, chairman of the RCA Labels Group, Nashville. "It's a problem when your artist can't get exposure to the largest metropolitan market in the U.S."
Yet while acknowledging broadcasters' concerns that country can't provide the big, immediate payoff that executives crave, he and other country music executives have so far resisted broadcasters' suggestions that record companies should help underwrite a New York country station. "There have been conversations with a number of chains," Mr. Galante acknowledged. "But that's not our job."
Within the New York radio community, speculation has focused on WNEW-FM (102.7) stepping in to fill the void. Once a rock powerhouse, WNEW has lagged badly as a talk station in recent years and was forced last summer to suspend its top-rated show, Opie and Anthony, after the shock-jock duo encouraged a couple to have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral as part of an on-air contest. "It's the first thing I'd do with WNEW," said Billboard's Mr. Ross. "There's absolutely a hole here and a station should be flipped to fill it." Although WNEW's parent company, Infinity Broadcasting, has given up on the station's FM talk format (and operates a successful Chicago country station, WUSN), it appears unlikely that WNEW will become a country station. A company spokesman, Dana McClintock, declined to comment on what the new format, expected to begin in March or April, would be, but noted that the station is currently playing pop music. Radio executives suspect the new format will continue in that direction.
Nor is Fordham's WFUV-FM (90.7) interested in altering its current programming mix to attract WYNY's former listeners. "We've debated whether we should fill the void," said WFUV's program director, Chuck Singleton. "But we weren't playing what Y-107 was before they went off the air, and this hasn't changed us. Y-107 attracted a very different audience."
WFUV plays country artists like Mr. Stuart, Ms. Harris and Mr. Earle, who have one foot in Nashville and the other planted firmly in the music that gave root to contemporary country sounds. But its music format is known in the radio business as Triple A (for Adult Album Alternative), and much of its music is what's called Americana. Unlike the country format, which emphasizes current hits with strong pop appeal, Americana plays historic and contemporary music based on American folk, blues and country traditions. Although largely confined to public and college radio stations, the music's growing popularity was demonstrated by the phenomenal success of the soundtrack album "O, Brother, Where Art Thou?" The divide between country and Americana remains pronounced, with few fans of a pop-oriented country performer like Shania Twain interested in hearing the bluegrass music of the Stanley Brothers, and vice versa. 
Marty Stuart, for one, wonders if New York isn't the market to bridge the divide. "They like a bit of authenticity in New York," he said. "The more popish things don't play as well here as they do in other parts of the country. In Nashville they're still sticking to their guns that 'O Brother' was a fluke. Well, six million records is not a fluke. That's the culture crying with its hand out. And I also wonder why, if country now poses as a pop music, it doesn't have an oldies format. Every other pop music does. What was it Roger Miller said about writing songs? 'I never wrote what was on the charts -- I looked for the holes and tried to fill 'em in.' The Big Apple is wide-open for a hillbilly station."
The place where country radio may ultimately flower into a myriad of formats is satellite broadcasting. One satellite broadcaster, Sirius, is currently experimenting with five different country formats including the kind of "classic" country programming Mr. Stuart advocates. Yet satellite radio's reach is still extremely limited, and it's impossible to say what the programming mix will actually be like when and if satellite broadcasting becomes an everyday option for New York listeners. Mr. Kerr is among the former WYNY disk jockeys who now has a country show on Sirius, and he's hopeful that the new technology will achieve the kind of penetration that will let it reach New York's country fans -- largely because he has tossed in the towel on New York country radio.
"It's unfortunate that I have to say this because I really do care about that audience," Mr. Kerr said. "But I just do not see a commercial country station in New York in the foreseeable future."

Talk of War Brings Changes in Travel Plans

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE American travel industry is girding for war, with some travelers already shifting or canceling their plans to avoid any possible problems if there is an American-led invasion of Iraq.
 While the evidence is mostly anecdotal so far, travel industry executives say that they are seeing a broad drop-off in interest in international travel for this winter and spring, especially to Europe and the Middle East, and that many people who would normally prefer to travel abroad on vacation are choosing to stay close to home instead. 
"We're seeing shorter domestic trips, more driving trips, more last-minute trips," said Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association of America, the industry's leading trade group. 
 If there is a war with Iraq, she said, "wethink there will be an immediate impact on air travel, with international inbound travel hurt the most." 
 "Domestic air travel would also be hurt," she added. "Business travel would probably fall again."
 At Ambler Tours and Travel Service of San Diego, Wayne Ambler, the president, said he was receiving two or three calls a week from clients worried about whether they should change or cancel their travel plans, both overseas and within the United States. 
 "I tell them if they're concerned, that maybe they should look at a different destination or time," he said. "I leave it to them -- to their hearts -- to decide."
 He said that while none of the clients of his 50-year-old travel agency had canceled a trip because of the threat of war with Iraq, it was having an effect. 
 "We're seeing quite a bit more interest in domestic travel," he said. "People don't want to travel so far."
 The possibility of war is another blow to the nation's beleaguered airlines, and they have already suggested that if there is a war, they will go to the government to request compensation, much as they did after the terror attacks on Sept. 11. 
 War jitters have helped push up the price of jet fuel in recent weeks, and the cost is likely to go higher in the event of war. And business travel by air, already down sharply because of the bad economy and the effects of Sept. 11, is expected to plummet again, at least for the duration of a war. 
 United Airlines and US Airways, the two major airlines that entered bankruptcy in the last year, have extensive route networks to Europe that would be expected to suffer a sharp drop in passenger traffic in the event of a war.
 Jeffrey Campbell, the chief financial officer of AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which also flies extensively in Europe, said, "We certainly have been very engaged in Washington to make sure that those in Congress and the White House fully understand the potential impact on American and the whole U.S. airline industry from a war." 
 Perennially profitable Southwest Airlines, which has no international routes, would also feel the impact, according to Gary Kelley, executive vice president of the discount carrier. Although Southwest's reservations and income for the first three months of the year were up from the same quarter last year, "war with Iraq would seriously damage any traffic and revenue trends," he said.
 While most airlines will not release figures for passenger loads in recent weeks, the best evidence of the drop in international travel may come in the form of the extraordinary air-fare bargains available this winter, especially across the Atlantic.
 Earlier this month, Lufthansa was offering a $187 round-trip fare (plus taxes) from Washington to London, available through the end of March. Its round-trip fare from Washington to Paris was $212. British Airways is offering packages to London, including air fare and a three-night hotel stay, beginning at $279 a person (plus taxes) from New York, based on double occupancy.
 If there is any good news for the travel industry in the threat of war, it is a growing perception that since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, many Americans are refusing to allow international chaos and the threat of terrorism to dictate their travel.
 A telephone poll in December commissioned by Travelocity, the Internet travel site, found that despite international tensions and the possibility of war with Iraq, 83 percent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they were at least somewhat likely to proceed with their travel plans this year; 86 percentsaid they were at least somewhat likely to proceed with business travel plans.
 "We have found since Sept. 11 that a lot of people feel it is their patriotic duty to get out and travel," said Ms. Keefe of the Travel Industry Association. "Even with this uncertainty, people want to travel. They feel it is part of their lives. They want that freedom."

After Long Drought, High-End Housing for Hartford

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
HARTFORD lost much of its middle and upper middle class to the suburbs in the last part of the 20th century, but there are signs that the exodus may be ending.
 Developers of residential real estate who have shunned Connecticut's capital for years are sensing a change and buying property on which to build high-end homes in or near downtown, with easy access not only to offices on State Street but also to the Hartford Symphony at the Bushnell Performing Arts Center, the Hartford Stage and the Wadsworth Atheneum. 
 Two major properties now under development are restorations at the historic Goodwin Estate and the Colt Armory complex, both designed to appeal to professionals and well-to-do empty nesters.
The first site seems an unlikely one, a 17,000-square-foot mansion so ruined that its condition brings to mind downtown Dresden after the World War II bombings. The slate roof is gone and the upper portion of the 12-inch-thick brick walls are shattered, leaving the interior exposed to the elements. The windows are a distant memory and whatever a 1996 fire failed to damage past redemption, vandals accomplished. During the years that the property has been vacant, the 17-acre grounds, which contains scores of specimen trees and shrubs, have reverted to wilderness. 
Nevertheless, the historic Goodwin Estate, built in 1903 at 1280 Asylum Avenue, will be restored by the Ginsburg Development Company of Hawthorne, N.Y., with seven condominium flats offered along with 56 new town houses to be built on the property as Hartford's first new high-end housing in 20 years. 
The estate has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Prospect Street Historic District since 1985. Consequently, restoration of the mansion is central to the $20 million redevelopment. The deed requires the Connecticut Historical Commission to approve any demolition or alterations, but none of any consequence are expected.
Amenta Emma, architects for the project, have no drawings or plans as guides in reconstructing what was lost, so they are using old photographs of the house in trying to replicate the exterior. The interior will be reconfigured for six two-bedroom units and one with three bedrooms, a fitness center, community room with kitchen and bar and residents' lockers for the outdoor pool to be built in the mansion's enclosed courtyard. The original paneled library escaped serious damage and will be preserved for the use of residents. 
The three-bedroom town houses will be constructed in groupings of two or four units in 18 buildings in a landscaped semicircle around the mansion's rear sides and back, echoing its traditional architecture and its red brick exterior walls with white wood trim. A faux slate material will be used for the roof, since real slate would be prohibitively expensive.
Because of the sloping terrain, almost all of the town houses will have walkout lower level patios and decks above them, as well as two-car garages. Flats in the mansion will have outdoor covered parking. A new road beginning and ending on Asylum Avenue will wind into and around the cluster of homes.
"Some trees will be cleared to provide a view of the mansion from Asylum Avenue," said Robert Emma, "lighted in a restrained way at night." Wildlife will continue to occupy the remaining 10 acres of unspoiled meadows, woods and wetlands in perpetuity, but the developed areas will have extensive landscaping by Henry Withers, a principal in CR3, a firm in Simsbury.
Estimated prices are modest by comparison with similar homes built by Ginsburg in other places. The company sells three-bedroom town houses in Fairfield County for around $650,000, but the Goodwin homes will vary from $250,000 for a 1,500-square-foot flat to $450,000 for a 3,000-square-foot town house. Common charges are estimated at $225 a month.
Although site work has barely begun and at least a year of work lies ahead before the first units are completed, the project, which is two blocks from the governor's residence in Hartford's exclusive West End, has already attracted a list of almost two dozen buyers, including several members of the State Legislature. Other prospective owners are scaling down from larger homes or want the convenience of living near where they work.
Ginsburg Development acquired the estate in December from the city for $409,500, a fraction of the $1.9 million the city paid to purchase it from the state in 1989. The state was given the property by the Goodwin family in 1953 to be used for educational purposes, and the University of Connecticut held classes there until 1989. 
THE city's timing of the acquisition could hardly have been worse, as real estate prices collapsed in the late 80's and early 90's and the property became a white elephant. "We couldn't dispose of it," said Bruno Mazzulla, Hartford's director of housing and community development.
A request for proposals from developers was sent out and brought no responses. A second request, issued two years ago, generated four proposals, including Ginsburg's. Its cluster plan won over the other three, which featured single-family homes on large lots.
"We're pretty excited about finding a developer of this caliber to do this," Mr. Mazzulla said. He estimates that the city will receive $450,000 a year in property taxes when the project is completed.
"We have an undersupplied market in Hartford for the kind of housing we build," said Martin Ginsburg, co-principal of the development company with his brother Samuel. "We are very selective about where we go," he said, "and we design specifically for the site and its relationship to the community."
The 38-year-old company, which has a number of successful developments in Westchester and Fairfield Counties, New Jersey and Florida, has been moving deeper into Connecticut. It has projects completed or under construction in Redding, Newtown and Danbury and projects pending in Farmington and West Hartford, according to Thomas Gissen, executive vice president at the Connecticut division headquarters in Danbury. 
The move into the capital city, however, is noteworthy. "Private developers have not seen fit to invest in Hartford since the 80's," said Matt Fleury, director of communications for the Capital City Economic Development Authority, a quasi-public organization established to carry out Gov. John G. Rowland's Six Pillars Revitalization Plan for Hartford. The "pillars" are a convention center, parking, riverfront improvement, civic center revitalization, downtown renewal and housing -- specifically the creation of 1,000 new market rate units downtown.
Increased investment in home ownership is the goal, in a city where only 25 to 30 percent of the homes are occupied by their owners. "The Goodwin project," he said, "is an example of 100 percent private developments that are starting to follow the subsidized projects and spark a long-term sense of confidence in this market."
Four subsidized downtown residential developments that will include market-rate rental apartments have been approved. A development on Trumbull Street is already in the works; construction at the former Sage-Allen department store, Adriaen's Landing and the site of the Civic Center Mall, which is to be torn down, will break ground this summer.
Each project will contain 100 or more units and have shops and restaurants at street level. The city, reimbursed by the state, will invest $60,000 per unit, with the remaining costs borne by the developers. 
In addition to the Goodwin project, a second major upscale redevelopment is getting under way at the former Colt Armory complex, whose star-spangled blue onion dome overlooking Interstate 91 has been a marker for travelers since the highway was built in the late 50's.
Built in the early 1850's, the armory is part of the Colt Industrial District, placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Late last month it was purchased for $5.7 million from Coltsville Heritage Park Inc., a nonprofit entity, by Colt Gateway L.L.C., a venture of Homes for America Holdings Inc. of Yonkers. 
FOR the past few decades, the Colt factory's 700,000 square feet of space in 12 buildings have been partially occupied by a variety of tenants, including artists, some of whom maintain live-work units; small manufacturers; and commercial businesses. "There are 110 tenants," said Robert Kohn, chief operating officer of Homes for America. "We are trying to relocate them within the complex. We believe the people who live and work there have kept the property alive."
Some smaller buildings with structural faults will be taken down, Mr. Kohn said, but the $110 million conversion into a residential, office, retail and restaurant complex will not involve new construction. "We will work with what is there," he said. There will be 300 apartments, 650 to 1,400 square feet, and lofts with plumbing and electricity installed will measure 1,000 to 2,500 square feet.
The developers were encouraged to take on the project by the effort already under way at Adriaen's Landing, the city's long-delayed, mixed-use development on the Connecticut River of residences, hotels, retail, recreation and entertainment. "Having the city and state do their work at Adriaen's Landing opened the door for us to come in," Mr. Kohn said. "If there was no master plan and additional apartments coming in, we would have felt the timing was not right."

Developing Software for Managing Real Estate

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
A GROUP of eight real estate companies, including some of New York and New Jersey's major players, is investing money, ideas and hands-on experience in the creation of a Web-based computer software product tailored to suit the particular needs of property managers. 
 The software being developed by Integrated Business Systems of Fairfield, N.J., incorporates a Web browser that provides access to a company's central database via any Internet connection and employs the Internet's speed and agility for complex business tasks. For large diversified real estate companies, this means that offices in different places and divisions handling different kinds of business have a live connection to consolidated information and can generate instant reports and analysis, said Robert Entin, president of Integrated Business Systems. 
 The software, to be called IBS 10.0i -- following tradition, since the current IBS product is named 10.0 -- is being designed to be "as deep as it is wide," said Mr. Entin. "It is scalable, so it can be used to serve the particular needs of smaller companies as well as large corporations. And it can meet the specific requirements of individual department heads working in the New York metropolitan area." 
For managers of a large shopping mall, for instance, it will automatically determine how much each tenant pays in rent for the mall's common areas according to an extraordinarily complicated government formula, Mr. Entin said.
And for residential property managers, the software will automate compliance with New York City's rent regulations and controls, rent renewal procedure, agency registration requirements, fuel surcharges and taxes -- with the correct government forms popping up on the screen at the time they are needed, he said.
"Some of the other large, bulky pieces of software can get the big jobs done," Mr. Entin said, "but it's like covering the wall with a paint roller. I think ours is really the one that is so detailed. It will be like paint-by-number with incredibly small boxes."
"This area has the most demanding property owners anywhere," he asserted, "and the toughest lease market to service, because the level of complexity of New York leases is way higher than it is elsewhere. We are working on a software that will understand the nuances, for both residential and commercial property owners."
The investor group financing the $3 million to $5 million software development project consists of the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, Vornado Realty Trust, the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, Jack Resnick & Sons, the Feil Organization, the Donald Zucker Organization, Koeppel & Koeppel and Pantzer Properties. The companies became preferred stockholders in I.B.S., and all have had a say in determining what features IBS 10.0i will offer, according to Mr. Entin. They will, however, pay fees touse it, as they do for IBS 10.0, he said.
Software for property management is a highly competitive field. Other software companies with products specifically tailored for property owners and managers include Yardi Systems, TTI, MRI and J. D. Edwards, some of them specifically designed for property managers, and a few -- Yardi's Enterprise Voyager, for example -- also incorporating Web browsers.
Gualberto Medina, the former New Jersey commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development who now directs Cushman & Wakefield's team working to stimulate high-tech business development in New Jersey, said the I.B.S. software project signifies the cresting of a trend. "Right now, every service organization is looking for this type of solution," he said, "comprehensive, agile software that operates from anywhere, from any network, any device."
Some companies are looking for narrower solutions, said Jonathan B. Schultz, president of the Woodbridge-based Shultz Oganization. His real estate company's technology team is working on developing Web-enabled software that focuses on leasing and works with a device that scans written leases into a computer, then automates aspects of the leasing process.
MORE than 120 real estate firms in the region, owning or managing a total of 500 million square feet of residential and commercial property, use products developed by I.B.S., which was founded 22 years ago, Mr. Entin said.
He began devoting his time solely to development of the new application a year and a half ago, Mr. Entin said, and quickly assembled teams of programmers to work on aspects of the project. Because the technology market has been hit so hard, he said, many highly qualified people were available -- and the work proceeded "speedily and efficiently." 
The real estate companies that invested in developing the 10.0i software each had a say over the past year and half of development about specific features they wanted, he said. 
The Jack Parker Corporation is field testing the new software alongside 10.0, said its chief operating officer, Jean-Pierre Vaganay. His company is not among the investors but has been using I.B.S. products for 14 years.
Speaking of the new version, Mr. Vaganay said: "We are very impressed. It has a user-friendly browser and icons, within a highly integrated real estate package that permits you to effectively run your business, from construction to accounting, and through the leasing process."
"With the assistance of this system," he said, "our financial people can deliver consolidated financial statements on the entire empire by the 10th of each month."
Mr. Entin said that because Jack Parker's holdings are so diverse and far-flung, it was an excellent company to test the new application. The company, based in Queens, owns and manages a range of types of property across the Northeast and Florida, including more than 4,000 apartment units, 5 million square feet of office and industrial space, and two New York hotels. In New Jersey, Jack Parker owns and manages Parker Plaza, a Class A office building in Fort Lee that is currently 98 percent occupied. The company also has a full-service construction division, which builds both commercial and residential structures.
Jack Parker's president, Adam Glick, who is the third generation to run his family's business, told Integrated Business Systems that what he wanted was "complete technology integration" for the separate businesses that make up the large corporation, Mr. Entin said. "For I.B.S.," he said, "this meant implementing connections and fostering compatibilitybetween the company's New York City hotels and residential buildings, its New York-area commercial properties, its industrial sites in Raleigh and its Tampa-based residential and construction operations."
Another investor in the software's development, Edward S. Pantzer, president of Pantzer Properties, said one of his aims was making the tool user friendly. The software, he said, "is going to make retrieval of data so much simpler. We employ nearly 175 people who would be using it, so user-friendliness is very important to us."
Pantzer owns more than 6,000 apartment units and three office buildings in five states. Mr. Pantzer noted that his company considered switching to some other company's software if it could generate better, faster reports. But his company is enthusiastic about the I.B.S. software's real-estate accounting applications, he said -- and besides, he added, converting to a new program is "agony."
"We chose to invest, and to be closely involved in the development of the new software, so that our needs will be met for the foreseeable future," he said.
Mr. Pantzer said his company's focus is on multifamily housing and it needs to generate continuous reports on leasing activity, apartment availability and expenditures made by landlords and managers. Mr. Entin said the new software would deliver reports graphically laid out in the particular manner Pantzer prefers.
Mr. Entin said I.B.S.'s history covers both the residential and commercial real estate fields. "From the beginning, we had two different perspectives and developed the two separate residential/commercial systems," he said. "My grandfather was a property owner-developer," he added, "and I was a computer engineer, so we had both perspectives in that way too."

HEADLINE: Even in a Harsh Job Market, Veterans Find a Welcome 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
AFTER 20 years as a career naval officer, Richard S. Richard Jr. did not expect his transition from military to civilian life to go quite so smoothly.
 Mr. Richard joined the Navy in 1982, right out of high school, and spent the next two decades crisscrossing the country from San Diego to Groton, Conn., to Bremerton, Wash., his final posting. Then, at 38, he retired from the military last November and embarked on the first job search of his life. 
 He assumed that the naval training he had received in data systems and electronics and the leadership skills he had acquired as a chief petty officer would give him an edge in a weak economy. What he did not foresee was the esteem that his military background would inspire.
"Everybody I spoke with seemed to believe it was a plus," Mr. Richard said. "My maturity and hard-won experience in difficult environments, that's something that the average college guy doesn't have." Since the Persian Gulf war, the public's perception of the military "has changed for the better, and it's been strong ever since," he said.
Within three months, Mr. Richard received several job offers. Though he and his wife wanted to return to their native Long Island to raise their 3-year-old twin sons, he reluctantly turned down a $60,000 position with the Brookhaven National Laboratory there to accept the same salary as an information technology analyst in Virginia Beach, where the money would stretch further.
Many corporate recruiters who specialize in placing former military personnel agree with Mr. Richard's assessment. They say that despite the uncertain economic outlook, it is a good time to be a veteran looking for work in the private sector, particularly for those with strong technology skills.
And, they say, with the nation on a war footing and patriotism on the rise, corporate America is taking an increasingly sympathetic look at the intangibles of leadership, teamwork and trustworthiness that are the mark of military life. That is good news for the estimated 250,000 men and women who leave the armed services every year.
Ted Daywalt, president of VetJobs.com, one of the largest Internet job sites for veterans, said that those with strong technology skills, health care experience and sales ability are in demand, while those seeking administrative and human resource positions are having a more difficult time.
There were 38 new job listings for the New York metropolitan area posted on VetJobs.com in January, with companies like Home Depot, Philip Morris and Young & Rubicam seeking applicants for management, sales and finance positions. Combined Insurance Company of America, a unit of the Aon Corporation, hired 115 veterans who posted resumes on the job site, many in its New Jersey office, according to Mr. Daywalt.
Home Depot has been particularly aggressive in courting veterans, and has teamed with the Department of Labor and military headhunters to lure them into its two-year management training program.
"Leading a platoon is like leading a store," said John Simley, a spokesman for Home Depot. "There's a fine line between combat and retail, but both have the same objective, to beat the competition. Both require creativity and improvisation and understanding of risks and rewards."
Last year, the U.S. Alliance Group, a corporate recruiter with offices in New York and Virginia, placed about 100 candidates in the Home Depot program, according to its president, Alfred Schreiber.
"I think 9/11 was a double-edged sword for the military," said Mr. Schreiber, whose firm specializes in matching employers with military personnel. "It was a tragedy that woke people up to the contribution the military can make."
It is not that all employers have dropped all their reservations about soldiers. Recruiters say some hiring managers persist in viewing military men and women as being too "dictatorial" and having trouble "developing consensus." And, said Mr. Daywalt, himself a former Navy captain, an executive once surprised him by asserting that veterans lacked "real-world experience."
One problem, he said, is that many human resources managers do not know anyone in the military. "For many, there's still an image of a gun-toting John Wayne or an incompetent Beetle Bailey," he said. "It's so far removed from the reality."
To combat such preconceptions, Mr. Schreiber advises clients to unlearn some of their military ways, like excessive formality. And they should shed military jargon, especially as it can mask their accomplishments. A fire control technician on a submarine, for example, might be misperceived merely as someone who can put out fires, whereas in reality the job requires familiarity with sophisticated technology like missile-guidance radar systems.
Unemployment among former military personnel has stayed fairly consistent over the last five years, at a half point or so lower than the general population. The preliminary figure for last year was 4.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent for nonveterans, though in New York State it was 4.6 percent, slightly higher than the jobless rate of 4.4 percent for nonveterans.
While veterans with technical expertise or management skills are doing well, lower-level soldiers and sailors are having a tougher time of it. Wesley Poriotis, the chairman of Wesley, Brown & Bartle, a New York executive search firm, and the founder of the Center for Military and Private Sector Initiatives, a nonprofit organization and advocacy group, says veterans sometimes have difficulty getting licensing for the same tasks, like driving trucks, programming computers and repairing aircraft engines, that they mastered in the military.
Frederico Juarbe Jr., assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment and training, said his agency was working to ensure that licensing officials give greater recognition to the accomplishments of servicemen and servicewomen.
Gordon Berg, a spokesman for Mr. Juarbe's division, summed up his position. "Clearly, we're trying to eliminate the redundancies," he said. "If someone can fix jet aircrafts, clearly they can fix a 737. But the F.A.A. says they have to prove it."
Mr. Juarbe says that the image of veterans has improved a great deal since the Sept. 11 attacks, and many former military members say they have noticed the change.
"There's a better appreciation of what uniform veterans bring to the work force," he said. "Punctuality, leadership experience, experience in teams. It translates into greater value that they bring to employment."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES: TAX TIPS; 
Benefit Cuts May Bring Deductions

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
TAXPAYERS who explore the nooks and crannies of the tax code, which is full of provisions applying to many special situations, may be able to pare their bills, both on 2002 returns and in the future.
 Because of the current economic slowdown, some employers are cutting back on benefits, as well as paring payrolls. As a result, some people can claim deductions for which they did not qualify in past years, said Avery E. Neumark, the partner in charge of employee benefits and executive compensation at Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company, an accounting firm in New York. 

MEDICAL EXPENSES -- These costs, including medical insurance premiums, are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, he noted. Taxpayers may more easily qualify for the deduction if their income is down or if they have to pay a greater share of their insurance costs.
MISCELLANEOUS DEDUCTIONS -- These costs, which include unreimbursed employee expenses, are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. To keep their jobs in a tight job market, some people are bearing expenses that their employers would have borne in the past, Mr. Neumark said.

DEDUCTIBLE I.R.A.'S -- Mr. Neumark also advised eligible taxpayers to make deductible contributions to I.R.A.'s or retirement plans for the self-employed before filing their 2002 tax returns. I.R.A. contributions for 2002 must be made by this April 15, even by taxpayers who get extensions to file their returns. "It may be your last opportunity for a deductible contribution," he said, referring to President Bush's proposal to replace deductible accounts with Retirement Savings Accounts that would be funded with after-tax money.
For 2002, up to $3,000 can be put into an I.R.A. ($3,500 if you are 50 or older), and the contribution is deductible if you are not covered by a pension plan. Even if you are covered by such a plan, the contribution is fully deductible if you are single and if your modified adjusted gross income is below $34,000; the deduction phases out at $44,000. For married people filing jointly, the limits are $54,000 and $64,000. 

RETIREMENT SAVINGS CONTRIBUTION CREDIT -- New for the 2002 tax year, this credit is for lower-income workers. A single person who contributed to either an employer-sponsored retirement plan or an I.R.A. may be entitled to up to $1,000, Mr. Neumark noted. A single person can claim a credit of up to 50 percent of the contribution if his or her adjusted gross income is not more than $15,000; the credit phases out at $25,000 of income. The credit and the income limits double for couples.

ADOPTION CREDIT -- A credit of up to $10,000 for qualifying expenses is available to people who adopted children in 2002, noted Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and accountant. The full credit is available to people whose adjusted gross income is $150,000 or less; the credit phases out at $190,000. The credit limit is twice that of previous years. A special tax form, 8839, must be attached to the tax return in order to claim the credit.

TWO NEW EDUCATION DEDUCTIONS -- Teachers who spent out-of-pocket money for classroom expenses can deduct up to $250, while people who incurred higher-education costs can deduct up to $3,000 in 2002 and 2003, if their adjusted gross income does not exceed $65,000 for single filers or $130,000 for couples filing jointly.
In addition to reducing taxes for 2002, taxpayers can plan their personal finances to gain tax benefits in future years. Bernard S. Kent, personal financial services partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Detroit, discussed two ways to do that.

EMPLOYER-PROVIDED EDUCATION ASSISTANCE -- Employees are not taxed on up to $5,250 a year of education assistance paid by an employer. "This is a nice benefit to have, particularly for people who do not have degrees," Mr. Kent said. Beginning last year, the benefit also applied to graduate, as well as undergraduate, courses.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION -- If tax rates drop this year or if your income drops, putting you in a lower tax bracket, you can realize significant tax savings by deferring compensation. But Mr. Kent offered an important caveat: be sure that your employer is financially sound before entering into any deferred-compensation arrangement. If the employer files for bankruptcy, as a number of big companies did in 2002, you could lose your deferred pay or get just pennies on the dollar. That is because the deferred-compensation agreement makes you a general unsecured creditor of your employer. JAN M. ROSEN

College Savings Plans: You'll Need a Scorecard

BYLINE:  By HILARY APPELMAN 

 BODY:
MORGAN LUNT, 20, and Toby Lunt, 17, began working for their father's plumbing contracting business in Emeryville, Calif., even before they were teenagers. "They started around the office, organizing paperwork and materials around the shop," said Jim Lunt, their father. "As they got older, they were able to go out and actually assist in the field."
 Mr. Lunt's company could deduct Morgan's and Toby's wages as business expenses, while their low incomes meant that they were only lightly taxed on their earnings. Encouraged by matching funds from their father, the brothers socked away thousands of dollars in I.R.A. savings. 
 When Morgan enrolled at Dartmouth College, Mr. Lunt stopped claiming him as a dependent on his tax return, enabling Morgan to qualify for a Hope Scholarship credit on his own return. The credit offset all of Morgan's taxes. 
Mr. Lunt also took advantage of the hottest trend in education savings, state-sponsored college savings plans, opening accounts for both sons with California's Golden State ScholarShare College Savings Trust. The savings plans, commonly called 529 plans after the section of the tax code that authorized them, grew vastly more appealing when Congress made their earnings tax-free, effective in 2002.
The 529 plans may be the most popular game in town, but they are far from the only one. Parents looking to shave their tax bills and save for college face a bewildering array of investment options and tax credits, each with a different set of regulations and income restrictions. 
"There are more choices than there ever were," said Steven Calvelli, a partner in the personal financial services group at the PricewaterhouseCoopers office in Florham Park, N.J. "It's a very complex maze, and you have to figure out where you fit in."
New for 2002, Congress quadrupled the annual contribution limit to education I.R.A.'s, now called Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, to $2,000. It also allowed use of the accounts' tax-free distributions for elementary and secondary school tuition and expenses as well as for higher education.
If the Bush administration wins Congressional approval for its proposed Lifetime Savings Accounts, the options will change again next year. Under the proposal, individuals could save $7,500 a year -- couples $15,000 -- for any purpose. As in a 529 plan, after-tax money would go in, and earnings, when withdrawn, would be free of tax. Under the administration proposal, 529 plans, Coverdell accounts and Archer medical savings accounts could be converted to the new Lifetime Savings Accounts before Jan. 1, 2004.
In this filing season, people are realizing some of the changes enacted in the 2001 tax law. Child tax credits will gradually rise from $600 for 2002 to $1,000 in 2010, and a new deduction of up to $3,000 for higher education expenses is allowed on 2002 returns. Also starting for 2002 returns, the time limit for deducting interest on student loans has been repealed. The law also provided higher income limits for many educational tax benefits and eased restrictions on combining tax breaks in the same year.
Section 529 plans, which are popular because of their lack of income restrictions and their high contribution ceilings -- more than $300,000 in some states -- became hard to beat once Congress made their earnings tax-free, Mr. Calvelli said. In addition, more than 20 states allow full or partial tax deduction of contributions to in-state 529's. Mr.Calvelli said, however, that the new Lifetime Savings Accounts would be even more attractive for most taxpayers.
The 529's are one of the few education tax breaks available to high-income taxpayers. Contributions count toward the annual gift tax exclusion -- $11,000 from any one donor to one recipient. But the law allows five years' worth of contributions -- up to $55,000, or $110,000 from a married couple -- to be made at once.
That front-loading provision makes the 529 a good estate planning tool, said Meloni Hallock, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Ernst & Young. "That $110,000 is now out of your estate," she said. "It's a wonderful device, so I have a lot of clients who do it." 
Julie and Michael Stapleton of Penfield, N.Y., a suburb of Rochester, initially bought individual stocks for their children, ages 1, 3 and 5, but recently decided to open 529 accounts instead. The couple, whose fourth child is due in June, cashed in savings bonds that the children had received from grandparents and other relatives and suggested that future gifts go into the accounts as well. "Our life is very hectic," said Mr. Stapleton, a nurse manager. "I'd rather have it all in one account."
Philip Johnson, a financial planner in Clifton Park, N.Y., who specializes in education planning, recommends that families leave a significant percentage of their savings in all-purpose investments available for other needs -- a concern that the Lifetime Savings Accounts would address. "A good 529 plan is a very good tool," he said, "but it isn't the whole toolbox."
ANOTHER attractive possibility for middle-income people is Series EE and I Savings Bonds. They can be bought in an adult's name and redeemed tax-free to pay college expenses -- subject to restrictions on adjusted gross income in the year of redemption. On 2002 returns, the limits are $57,600 for single filers and $86,400 for married couples for income to be fully tax-free. The phase-out range for the interest exclusion is $15,000 for single people and $30,000 for joint filers.
Parents can also invest in growth stocks, then transfer them to their child to sell before tuition payments are due and take advantage of the child's lower tax rate.
Nancy Flint-Budde, a financial planner also in Clifton Park, N.Y., is using that strategy to help save for her three sons, now 10, 12 and 15. Ms. Flint-Budde's husband inherited some highly appreciated General Electric stock eight years ago. When their oldest son turned 14, she and her husband gave him $6,000 worth of the stock. When it is sold, her son will be eligible for a new 8 percent capital gains tax rate -- less than half the 20 percent rate she and her husband would pay. "Next year my second-oldest boy will turn 14," she said, "and we'll do the same thing with him."
Children 14 and older are taxed at the regular single taxpayer rate -- 10 percent on the first $6,000 of taxable income and 15 percent up to $27,950. Taxpayers in those brackets pay 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains or 8 percent on property held more than five years. Unearned income of more than $1,500 held by children under 14 is taxed at the parents' top rate -- the so-called "kiddie tax."
Small-business owners can do what Jim Lunt did: hire their own children, even young ones in a family owned business. The wages are a deductible business expense, and for this year children can earn up to the standard deduction of $4,750 before owing tax -- or up to $7,750 if they put the difference into an I.R.A. If the business is a sole proprietorship or partnership of the child's parents, children under 18 are exempt from Social Security and Medicare taxes and children under 21 from federal unemployment tax. Experts caution that the children must perform real work for reasonable wages, and parents should be prepared to show documentation to prove it.
For parents with children already in college, tax breaks include the Hope Scholarship credit -- up to $1,500 a student for the first two years of college. There is also the Lifetime Learning credit -- up to $1,000 a household for higher education expenses; it will double this year. But full credits are available only to single filers with modified adjusted gross income below $41,000 and to couples with less than $82,000. The phase-out limits are $51,000 for singles and $102,000 for couples.
If parents whose income is too high forgo claiming the children as dependents, financial advisers note, the students may be able to take the credits on their own returns. If a student would not be not taxed enough to offset the credit, parents can give an asset to the child who can sell it to generate a capital gains tax, Mr. Calvelli said. But he warned parents to make sure that "emancipating" a child did not have side effects like making the child ineligible for the parents' health care coverage.
 OTHER sources of tax-advantaged college funds include home equity loans and student loans, both of which have tax-deductible interest. Early I.R.A. withdrawals can be made without penalty for qualified higher education expenses, but any taxes would still be due. Roth I.R.A.'s are a better option because withdrawals, up to the amount originally contributed, can be made free of tax and penalty.
"As a general rule, people want to save for their own retirement as their No. 1 priority," noted Joseph Hurley, founder and chief executive of Savingforcollege.com, a Web site that compares and evaluates 529 plans. "If you have to, it can be tapped for college. You're not going to get financial aid for retirement, and you might get it for college."

Who's Blocking the Xbox? Sony and Its Games

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
XBOX, the video game console that Microsoft introduced nearly 14 months ago, is technologically sophisticated and, by many accounts, the best way to play games against competitors over the Internet.
 But the advantages have not translated into the returns Microsoft had hoped for. It has sold nine million Xbox consoles, on the low end of its projections; it continues to lose money on each one it sells; and it remains desperately behind Sony, whose PlayStation 2 is selling at a record pace. Wall Street analysts have mixed opinions about whether Microsoft's early effort has been successful, but they agree that it has a way to go. 
 Avid game players like Brian Green, 26, who spends hours each week on both consoles, have a simple explanation for why Microsoft has yet to make the inroads it sought. "The Xbox is cool," he said, "but the PlayStation is where the games are at." 
That is not good news for Microsoft, because people tend to buy electronics based on the amount of software they can use. Sony learned that lesson two decades ago, when its technically superior Betamax video recorders were swamped by VHS machines that had more tapes available.
Makers of video games are starting to produce more games for Xbox, but the 2-to-1 gap with PlayStation will take some time to close. And while Microsoft, which has more than $40 billion in cash on hand, can afford to be patient, analysts and investors wonder how much time and money it is willing to invest before it starts to turn a profit.
The issue is of no small significance. The market for consoles and video games is worth more than $9 billion a year. Even while losing on selling consoles, Microsoft could still make a lot of money from game makers. They pay the console makers about $10 for each copy of the games they manufacture -- and they made well in excess of 50 million games in the United States last year. Games typically sell at retail for $50.
For now, though, there are only losses for Microsoft. It declines to say how much it loses on each console, but industry analysts estimate the figureat close to $100. Sony, by contrast, does not sell PlayStation 2's below cost.
Part of Microsoft's problem is the ambitious design of Xbox: its chipsets and other electronic components are more expensive than those of the PlayStation. Microsoft has also been unable to realize certain economies of scale because sales have not been as robust as expected.
Joseph Osha, a semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch who follows Nvidia, a company that makes the graphics processing chips for the Xbox, said Microsoft had had to "pull back sharply" on its orders. He estimated that Microsoft had 1 million to 1.5 million unsold Xbox chipsets, which are the brains used in Xbox consoles.
Microsoft is too big to have its stock price move significantly on sales of Xbox. But the effect of all that idle Xbox inventory is evident on its profit-and-loss statement. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Microsoft said its home and entertainment segment, which includes the Xbox and television divisions, lost $348 million in its most recent quarter on sales of $1.28 billion. In the period a year earlier, the home and entertainment unit lost $180 million on sales of $833 million.
On a micro level, investors "don't like it because they lose money on every piece of hardware they sell," said Michael P. Wallace, a video game industry analyst at UBS Warburg. But, he added, "on a macro level, they're in the No. 2 spot."
In addition to overtaking Nintendo, which makes the GameCube console, as the second-place console maker, Microsoft has put itself in a position to compete with Sony for years to come, Mr. Wallace said.
When Microsoft introduced the Xbox in January 2001, it promised to put $2 billion into the product -- $500 million in advertising alone. It may well need to spend it all. In 2002, according to UBS Warburg, Sony sold 18.3 million PlayStation 2 consoles, while Microsoft sold 5.2 million Xbox machines and Nintendo sold 4.7 million GameCubes. These figures reflect consoles sold to consumers, not consoles that the manufacturers ship to wholesalers or retailers.
THE good news for Microsoft is that industry experts expect it to widen its lead over Nintendo this year. Electronic Arts, the world's largest game maker, is projecting that in North America in 2003, Sony will sell 9 million to 10 million PlayStation 2's, Microsoft will sell 2.5 million to 3 million Xbox consoles and Nintendo will sell 2 million to 2.5 million machines.
Electronic Arts also projects that Microsoft will beat Nintendo in Europe, the second-biggest market after the United States. Still, Microsoft is particularly struggling in Japan, where it has been virtually shut out of the market, selling a mere 300,000 consoles, according to the company. Throughout all of Asia, Microsoft has sold only 500,000 Xbox consoles, according to UBS Warburg, compared with Sony's sales of 3.67 million PlayStation 2's.
Microsoft officials say they are hampered in Asia because Sony and Nintendo, both Japanese companies, have entrenched positions and great control over distribution and sales channels there. But industry analysts say Microsoft should come up with more than excuses.
"If Xbox has any chance of closing the gap against PlayStation, Microsoft is going to need a better Japanese strategy," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research. He said it needed to have better games and to burrow into the Japanese distribution channel.
Microsoft said it was already making progress on games, introducing in Japan a game called DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball. The 80,000 games sold out within two days.
Robert J. Bach, a senior vice president for the home and entertainment division, acknowledged that the Xbox was continuing to lose money, but he said that such losses were natural with a new business. A better picture of the situation, he said, is how the company is performing relative to its business plan. "We're doing very well on that basis," he said.
Analysts said Microsoft must also persuade video game makers to produce versions of their products for the Xbox. According to figures provided by Microsoft but compiled by NPD Funworld, an industry research group, there are 458 games available for the PlayStation 2, versus 207 for the Xbox and 168 for the Nintendo GameCube.
Microsoft faces a chicken-and-egg problem: makers of video games won't make versions of their games for a given console unless the machine has a wide installed base, but it is hard to build a base without a lot of games.
Some big game makers have made versions only for the PlayStation 2. Most notable has been Grand Theft Auto, the most popular game the last two years. Microsoft said it is in discussions with the game's maker, Take Two Interactive, to persuade it to produce a version for the Xbox.
Xbox also suffers because video game publishers will sometimes release a PlayStation 2 version of a game first, then deliver an Xbox version months later. That happened last year with Medal of Honor, a top-selling game from Electronic Arts that came out some six months earlier on the PlayStation 2. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, said, however, that the company was increasingly releasing games concurrently for the two platforms.
Industry analysts like Mr. Wallace of UBS Warburg said Microsoft needed to find video game makers that would produce hit titles exclusively for its console. 
To bolster its game portfolio, Microsoft has been in discussions to buy Vivendi Universal Games. Microsoft would not comment on the issue.
In the meantime, Microsoft has quietly begun to make inroads with a feature that cuts across individual games: Xbox Live. This is a $50 attachment that lets console owners play games against one another over the Internet. Microsoft, citing figures from NPD Funworld, said it sold 350,000 Xbox Live kits since introducing the service in November. Sony has sold 438,000 of its own online kit, said Microsoft, citing NPD Funworld figures, but Sony has been selling its kit for almost twice as long, since August.
Mr. Bach said that these kinds of numbers showed that Microsoft, by sticking to its plan, could succeed, and he has said so to Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer. "In the conversations I have with Bill and Steve, they want to know where we are on that plan," he said. "We're on that plan."
The question is whether Brian Green and other gamers are on board, too.

From Beehive To Kitchen Table To Mass Production

BYLINE:  By JANE TANNER 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C. 

 BODY:
ROXANNE QUIMBY was just looking for a little extra income when she teamed up in 1989 with Burt Shavitz, a local beekeeper, and started a kitchen-table production line to bottle honey and make beeswax candles in rural Maine.
 In 1991, when Ms. Quimby began making beeswax lip balm, sales soared, so she added other personal care products. She called the company Burt's Bees and packaged its ointments and shampoos in distinctive bright yellow tins and bottles. She sold them through a network of natural food stores, and they were even picked up by Bloomingdale's. 
 Within three years, she had outgrown the makeshift factory and moved Burt's Bees to this central North Carolina city, the home of Duke University. Sales reached $43.5 million last year, up 30 percent from 2001. Burt's Bees is among the fastest-growing companies in the natural personal care industry, which itself is expanding rapidly. 
Now Burt's Bees, like the three or four other natural body-care companies that have built sales to more than $30 million, faces the difficult task of moving into the mass market without compromising its commitment to pure ingredients, its employees and the environment.
Sales of body-care products made exclusively or nearly exclusively from natural ingredients rose 10 percent last year, to $4.5 billion, said Patrick Rea, who follows the category for the Nutrition Business Journal.
The niche, which includes creams, soaps and shampoos made with ingredients like rosemary leaf, willow bark extract and comfrey root, captures about 10 percent of overall personal care sales, Mr. Rea said. It has also drawn attention from bigger companies like Tower Records, Books-A-Million and Urban Outfitters.
"Companies like Burt's Bees will come head to head with larger companies in only a few more years," Mr. Rea said. "They can only ignore it for so long."
Paddy Spence, who runs Spins Natural Track, which compiles and analyzes sales data for natural products, said companies like Burt's Bees, Tom's of Maine and Nature's Gate have gained market share quickly as they expanded distribution outside of the traditional, fervent customer base at the nation's 7,000 natural food stores.
Mr. Spence credits Burt's Bees with having the most diverse range of retail outlets. "Roxanne has managed to get the products in all different types of stores," he said. The products are sold in 6,000 outlets, as various as car washes, Nordstrom stores and the L. L. Bean catalog.
Dozens of small companies have piled into the market for natural body-care products, including the W. S. Badger Company, which mixes creams, balms and salves in Gilsum, N.H., and Evergreen Research, a San Diego company that makes skin cream from olive oil produced in the Peloponnesian region of Greece. But only a handful, including Burt's Bees, have sales of at least $30 million.
Burt's Bees churns out 144 products in its automated plant here. Ms. Quimby's original partner, Mr. Shavitz, got out years ago to live contently in a converted turkey coop in Maine. But his bearded face is still featured on cream and ointment tins.
National chains have lined up to sellMs. Quimby's products. Yet her strong views on many topics often clash with conventional business practices. She describes herself as a 1960's radical who was a back-to-the-land homesteader in Maine before becoming an entrepreneur in 1989.
Consider the collapse of talks last month with the Target Corporation, over its requirement to package two Burt's Bees items in a box, to conform to Target's distribution system. Ms. Quimby rejected the idea as wasteful. "We started adding up all these boxes and decided this is too much," she said.
A Target spokesman declined to comment on talks with Burt's Bees, but said the company "keeps an eye on these emerging new-age and health-oriented trends."
Sometimes Ms. Quimby manages to straddle her principles and business ambitions. A few years ago, she agonized over whether to start a cosmetics line. Her business instincts dictated a move into highly profitable beauty products, even though makeup ran counter to her feminist sensibilities. "I thought makeup was a mask," she said.
In the end, Ms. Quimby calmed her worries by featuring regular women instead of models in Burt's Bees advertising and on packaging. A 40-year-old waitress and part-owner of a restaurant in Asheville, N.C., modeled for Burt's Bees tinted moisturizers. One of Ms. Quimby's 24-year-old twin daughters, Hanna, the company's New England territory manager, posed for photographs for Burt's Bees lipstick and other products. Even the scraggly bearded Burt appears on the Web site, incongruously advertising shaving soap and after-shave lotion.
"They have a more human quality," Ms. Quimby, 52, said of her just-folks models. "They are not perfect."
Big companies in the industry, meanwhile, are edging in to capture a share of the demand for natural body products. Some flaunt "natural" and "plant derived" on packaging when all but a speck of the ingredients are synthetic, said Darrin C. Duber-Smith, the strategic marketing director at the Natural Marketing Institute, a research and consulting firm in Harleysville, Pa.
The Food and Drug Administration regulates only the list of ingredients on the back of packages, so companies take liberties with words like "natural" on the front, Mr. Rea of the Nutrition Journal said. " 'Natural' is losing its value with consumers," he said.
Burt's Bees products contain at least 91.6 percent natural ingredients, Ms. Quimby said; most have more than 95 percent. Of companies with more than $30 million in sales, only one, Aubrey Organics of Tampa, Fla., produces 100 percent organic products. The company's shampoo, conditioner and skin creams are blended in small quantities -- 50-gallon batches -- and whisked to stores to avoid down time in warehouses, where they might go bad.
Conventional retailers are realizing that growing numbers of shoppers will pay more for products made with natural ingredients, said Tom Chappell, founder of Tom's of Maine, the maker of natural toothpastes and mouthwash.
"There was one language that we could share with the CVS's and the Hannaford Brothers of the world," Mr. Chappell said, referring to drugstore and supermarket chains in the eastern United States. "They wanted to serve our kind of customer, who is looking for value in what's inside the product, not what it's priced."
Bath and Body Works, a unit of Limited Brands, began carrying Burt's Bees products in 20 stores on a trial basis during the holiday season. Similar market trials are under way at Hannaford Brothers in New England and Publix Super Markets and Winn-Dixie Stores in the South.
IN the mid-1980's, Tom's of Maine was the first maker of natural body-care products to break into the mass market; its products are now sold in 30,000 retail outlets, including Walgreens, Target and Wal-Mart, Mr. Chappell said. In 1968, two years after college, he bailed out of a career in insurance and moved from Philadelphia to rural Kennebunk, Me., where Tom's is based.
Mr. Chappell and Ms. Quimby both say they do not offer volume discounts. Other retailers and a retail consultant say it is hard to imagine that Wal-Mart pays the same per-unit price for a tube of Tom's of Maine toothpaste as a local health food store does, but Mr. Chappell says he does not adjust his prices even for fast payment of invoices. Officials at Wal-Mart declined to comment.
Ms. Quimby says large chains eventually accept the terms "because, at the end of the day, it sells."
In running Burt's Bees, Ms. Quimby keeps costs down and refuses to take on debt. She credits eight years of raising her twins in a rustic cabin in the woods as great discipline for economizing. Until recently, Burt's Bees bought only second-hand equipment, including a giant mixer from a cafeteria at Duke. Every Wednesday, the staff meets to review a spreadsheet that lists every slip-up and its exact dollar cost.
But she insists that containers be made from recycled plastic. Burt's Bees pays a premium of 7 percent to 10 percent to use discarded milk containers in packaging, said Thomas Loeper, president of Tel Pak Inc., one of the company's suppliers. Ms. Quimby said her pretax margins run from 25 percent to 30 percent.
She continues to live in Maine, in a small house in Winter Harbor, a fishing village of 500 people. She flies to Durham every other week and otherwise stays in touch through e-mail.
One day, she said, she expects to find a buyer who will continue to operate the company with the same values. Then, after selling, she said, she will devote herself full time to land conservation.
"It's going to take everything I've learned so far," she said. "It will be a real benefit and not just about wrinkles or shiny hair."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Representative Sue Myrick and her Republican Study Committee are not fond of the deficit, but, you report, "they say it plays a useful role in fighting off something they like even less -- government spending" ("Conservatives Now See Deficits as a Tool to Fight Spending," Washington Talk, Feb. 11). 
 Representative Myrick's financial formula is equivalent to a family's carrying heavy credit-card debt as a way of holding down further spending. She must know, as we all do, that it doesn't work. 
To carry the comparison further, this is a family that insists on cutting its own income along the way. The inevitable result is poverty, bankruptcy or, in the case of government, inflation.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes; 
Breaks for Those in Retirement, or Gaining on It

BYLINE:  By DAN CUFF 

 BODY:
THESE days of economic difficulty may not seem the best time to increase your contributions to retirement plans. Nor may they seem the best time to take money out, although the law requires you to start withdrawing money from tax-deferred accounts after you have reached age 70 1/2.
 The 401(k) retirement plans and individual retirement accounts of many Americans have been battered by the falling stock market, so adding money to them or having to withdraw from a depleted account may be especially painful right now. 
 "I was required to take the minimum distribution" from an account at Merrill Lynch, said Hartley E. Grundstrom of Hampden, Mass., who reached the magic age recently. "Merrill Lynch will give me a check every year whether I want it or not from my seriously depleted I.R.A. account. Big Brother wins again." 
Ouch. But Mr. Grundstrom and others in his boat owe one to Big Brother nevertheless. The Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on required minimum distributions from retirement plans last April, and now "the bottom line is that you can take less money out," said Nicholas Kaster of CCH Inc., a provider of tax and pension information. The smaller withdrawals mean less taxes to pay and leave more money in the account to grow on a tax-deferred basis.
As for the people who would like to be in Mr. Grundstrom's shoes and have such an account to provide money in their old age, the 2001 tax law increased the amounts they can add to a variety of retirement accounts, beginning last year, and allowed those 50 and over to make additional "catch-up contributions." And if the Bush administration's latest proposals are enacted, they will be able to save even more -- up to $7,500 annually in new Retirement Savings Accounts that would replace I.R.A.'s.
Contribution limits for the proposed Employer Retirement Savings Accounts, which would replace several plans, would be $12,000, rising to $15,000 by 2006; those ceilings are the same as for current 401(k)'s but higher than for some other plans. Employees 50 and over could save an additional $2,000 a year, rising to $5,000 in 2006.
Both types of proposed accounts would work similarly to Roth I.R.A.'s today: after-tax money would go in, but withdrawals after age 58 would be free of tax.
Because of the retreat of defined-benefit pension plans, in which companies pay retirees a set pension each month, employees have to look out for themselves when it comes to retirement savings -- a much harder task now than it was before the financial markets' three-year slide. And Social Security checks are not enough. "If all you have to live on is Social Security, you will be living at the poverty level or below," said Douglas P. Stives, a partner at Curchin & Company in Red Bank, N.J.
Mr. Stives tells his clients that they have no alternative to saving as much as possible in their retirement accounts. "The whole concept of saving for yourself has been woefully ignored," he said.
But after watching their accounts shrink, many savers may be asking, "Why throw good money after bad?"
Because, Mr. Stives said, the money put into the accounts is tax-deferred. "If you're nervous about the market, buy a C.D. or Treasury bills or put it in a money market fund," he said. "At least you are not paying income tax on the money before it goes in."
The stock market, he fears, will not recover for a while because many people, still reeling from recent losses, are reluctant to invest in it again. He predicts that a large number of traditional pension plans at companies may fail, and that the government may not have enough money to bail them out. "What the company promised may not be there," he said.
Indeed, the federal agency that insures company pension plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, reported an unexpectedly large $3.6 billion deficit last month, its biggest ever. In contrast, it finished 2001 with a $7.7 billion surplus. The deficit reflects the declining health, particularly in the steel industry, of the many company plans that the government now insures. The agency estimates that these plans owe a total of $300 billion more to current and future retirees than they can afford to pay. 
One saver who plans to take advantage of the new rules is Laurance W. Fader, a violist in the New York City Ballet Orchestra and the New York City Opera Orchestra. He said he believed that would be the best use of his extra cash. "We don't have anything that we really need to spend it on," said Mr. Fader, whose children are grown. "Getting the tax deferral is the best deal."
For this year, as for 2002, individuals can contribute up to $3,000 to either a traditional tax-deferred I.R.A. or a Roth I.R.A. In 2005 through 2007, that becomes $4,000, and in later years, $5,000.
 THERE are other rules. Anyone who does not participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k) can contribute to a traditional I.R.A., but single people who are in employer-sponsored plans can earn up to $34,000 and joint filers up to $54,000 and still take a full traditional I.R.A. deduction. Partial deductions are allowed for people with a bit more income, but they phase out with $10,000 more in income. (A good explanation of this complex business is found in an article in CCH's online book "Whole Ball of Tax 2003" at cch.com/wbot2003/007retirement.htm.)
For 2003, employees can defer up to $12,000 in 401(k) and similar plans like a 403(b) plan for employees of nonprofit organizations or 457 plans for government employees, with the maximum amount increasing in later years. CCH advises contributing the maximum to one of these accounts before putting money into other retirement accounts. The employer often matches the contribution in a 401(k), and employees can borrow from their accounts. But only employers that amend their plan rules -- they are not required to do so -- will make all the changes available to employees. For example, a company with a 401(k) plan may not want to match the higher contributions now allowed.
As for mandatory withdrawal of money after age 70 1/2, the I.R.S. has made the rules friendlier to taxpayers by adopting a simple and uniform distribution table, replacing the former single and joint life expectancies. The new rules took effect officially on Jan. 1, although I.R.A. holders were allowed to use them in 2002. For a person who is 70 1/2, the rules assume a life expectancy of 27.4 years -- a year longer than was on the tables in 2001. The I.R.S. says that because Americans are living longer, less money can be withdrawn each year so people can live longer on their nest eggs.
Other changes, mostly stemming from the Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001, allow employees of small businesses to participate in simplified employee pension plans known as SEP-IRA's and saving incentive match plans called Simple. But these plans, like 401(k) and similar plans, could be replaced by Employer Retirement Savings Accounts if the administration's proposal becomes law.
People 50 and older are allowed to make additional "catch-up" contributions for most retirement accounts, and lower-income workers may qualify for a tax credit to help them invest more money in them.
Individuals can contribute to Roth I.R.A.'s whether or not they are in an employer-sponsored plan, but there are income limits. A single person's adjusted gross income must be below $95,000, with benefits phasing out completely at $110,000. For married people filing jointly, the figures are $150,000 and $160,000.
Whether Roth I.R.A.'s are superior to traditional I.R.A.'s is a battle for the accountants. Mr. Kaster of CCH says most practitioners favor the Roth, but arguments can be made both ways.
Kenneth G. Rocky of Little Silver, N.J., found a solution through Mr. Stives. Mr. Rocky had a heavy year of medical deductions as guardian for his aging parents. He was able to take more than $100,000 out of his 401(k) plan and roll it over to a regular I.R.A. and then to a Roth, using the medical deductions to offset the taxes he had to pay on the conversion. Withdrawals are not required from a Roth after age 70 1/2, so he will be free to delay them until he needs the money or to leave it for his beneficiaries and not have to pay a single penny of tax on it.

HEADLINE: Economy and Sprawl 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 What is most remarkable in your Feb. 9 news article about the impact of the economic downturn on public attitudes toward protecting open space, and insisting on smart growth rather than sprawl, is how little evidence you found of a backlash. 
 In Habersham County, Ga., the voters this fall elected a slow-growth County Commission. In Erie, Colo., developers spent a fortune trying to unseat Mayor Barbara Connors and failed. In Loudon County, Va., speculators who weren't able to win their case in the court of public opinion are turning to the courts.
While land-use lawyers and real estate interests are, as always, eagerly proclaiming that bad times for Americans are good times for sprawl, the American people appear, quite sensibly, to be insisting that growth be smart, planned and good for them and their families -- not just profitable for speculators.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Anton V. Schutz; 
Burnham Financial Services Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
ANTON V. SCHUTZ, who runs the $90 million Burnham Financial Services fund, has invested nimbly in a sector whose many components respond very differently to the same economic conditions.
 One part of the financial services industry is savings institutions, which have had the wind at their sails despite the weak economy. That is because the Federal Reserve has been lowering interest rates in recent years, reducing their cost of money, Mr. Schutz said. 
 But asset managers, another part of the sector, have been hurt as the stock market has slumped, he said, and many consumer finance companies have suffered because their customers have defaulted on loans.
"You have some haves and some have-nots in one sector," he said.
His fund returned 36.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing first among 77 financial services funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The group returned 5.1 percent a year, on average, during that time, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 15 percent, on average.
The fund returned 12.1 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 15.7 percent for its group and 25.7 percent for the index.
Mr. Schutz, 38, is based in Rochester and is president of Mendon Capital Advisors, which runs the fund for Burnham Asset Management in New York. The fund's Class A shares, sold with a 5 percent load, or sales charge, through brokers and financial advisers, are available without a load through fund supermarkets like those operated by Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments.
To pick the 50 to 70 stocks in the fund, Mr. Schutz starts by evaluating interest rates, earnings, global events and other macroeconomic factors. The overall economy is now very murky, he said.
"It's not easy to see whether the U.S. economy will be recovering soon or falling into an abyss," he said. "Then there's a question about Iraq."
His macro analysis is largely keeping him away from savings institutions, where the easy money has already been made, he said, and pointing him toward life insurers and broker-dealers, which are trading at low prices because of the weak economy.
Next, he reviews company-specific factors. Among life insurers, for example, he reviews the types of products they sell and the companies' own investment portfolios.
In October, he began buying shares of Federated Investors, the asset management company based in Pittsburgh. The stock trades for about 12 times the company's projected 2003 earnings, he said, compared with a multiple of 16 for its group. Mr. Schutz said investors believe that because about one-third of Federated's revenue comes from its money market funds, the company will miss an upturn in the stock market. But the company is introducing more stock mutual funds and managed accounts, he said, and is a good acquisition target.
He paid $25.99, on average, for his shares; they now trade at $24.68.
Another holding is First Niagara Financial, a savings institution based in Lockport, N.Y. The company has an unusually strong balance sheet, Mr. Schutz said; its ratio of equity to assets is 20 percent, versus 8 percent for its competitors. 
First Niagara's management has much commercial banking experience, he said, and its earnings from high-yielding business loans have made it less vulnerable to interest rate shifts. He first bought shares in January 2001, paying $8.16, on average; they now trade at $11.11.
ANOTHER holding is Prudential Financial, the insurer and money manager based in Newark. The company is working to shed Prudential's losing operations and to cut costs, Mr. Schutz said, to increase its return on equity and earnings. In December, Prudential announced its acquisition of the American operations of Skandia; the deal is expected to close by June. Because Skandia has a big business in variable annuities, the move will give Prudential more exposure to a recovery in the capital markets, Mr. Schutz said. 
He bought shares starting in December 2001, paying $30.52, on average. They now trade at $30.72.

Dreary Winterfor British Shares

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
THE latest interest-rate cut by the Bank of England surprised the British stock market, but not pleasantly. The move was widely viewed as a good-will gesture to investors whose confidence had evaporated with share values. But the reaction has generally been "thanks, but no thanks."
 After a fleeting gain just after the cut was announced at noon on Feb. 6, the benchmark Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell about 2 percent over the rest of the afternoon, and it remains at about that level. 
 With home prices having raced ahead 22 percent last year, economists and professional investors treated the central bank's action, reducing its benchmark rate to a 48-year low of 3.75 percent from 4 percent, as a cure for which there is no known disease.
"The move looks bizarre," said Helen Roberts, a portfolio manager at the London investment firm F&C Management. "Despite weak survey data in the U.K. recently, the housing market remains strong. The move has more to do with the lurch down" in the stock market, she said, than with "an evident sharp slowdown in the economy."
As for the limp response from the stock market, she added: "That is a bad sign."
The market decline was hardly a reversal of fortune. British stocks lost more than any other major market in January. The FTSE-100, which comprises the 100 largest British companies, nearly one-third of which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, fell for 11 consecutive days, the first time that has happened in the 19-year history of the index.
The steep decline has been attributed largely to selling by life insurance companies trying to meet solvency requirements. As share prices fell, the insurers were forced to sell, which drove prices down further, forcing more sales. The drop compelled regulators to suspend enforcement of the rules, and the stock market began to recover. It has gained about 1.2 percent in the first two weeks of February.
The insurance companies "were not selling because they thought the market was expensive; they were selling because they had to," said Sacha Sadan, a manager of British equity funds at Gartmore Investment Management. "The good news about that is it means there's more value out there, and people are stepping in to buy."
The relentless selling last month left British stocks at valuations that, by at least one measure, are close to their cheapest since 1959. That was the last time that the dividend yield on the stock market was as high as the yield on 10-year government bonds, which is about 4.2 percent.
"There are compelling valuation arguments, with 53 percent of the FTSE-100 yielding more than 10-year bonds," said Alan Custis, who runs portfolios of large British stocks for JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management. 
Mr. Custis looks for stocks of companies with "strong cash flow, high sustainable yields and a catalyst for change in the business." The sectors where these criteria are being met best, he said, include banking, construction, health care and oil.
Among the companies he likes is HSBC Holdings, "a very solid bank with strong management" that exploits its scale to make the most of acquisitions, like the deal announced in November to add Household International. Mr. Custis noted that HSBC trades at just 10 times its annual earnings and yields 5.2 percent, good value for "one of the major banks of the world."
Other favorites include Wolseley, a construction company mainly involved in the American plumbing and lumber businesses, and the drug maker AstraZeneca. Wolseley has "huge cash flow" of $:8 billion to $:9 billion a year ($12.9 billion to $14.5 billion) and is "extremely well run and cheap," Mr. Custis said, noting that the company has recorded 25 straight years of earnings growth.
He said AstraZeneca's pipeline of drugs under development "is one of the strongest for any of the major pharmaceutical companies." It plans to begin sales this year of Crestor, which it forecasts to take 20 percent of the $24 billion annual market in cholesterol-lowering drugs.
Mr. Custis recommended two telephone companies, the Vodafone Group and the BT Group, which he called "self-help stories" for the restraint they have shown in cleaning up their balance sheets by paying down debt and selling assets, or at least shunning costly acquisitions. He noted that Vodafone sells at 14 times earnings, "not expensive for the largest mobile telecommunications company in the world."
His preferred oil company is BP, which Mr. Sadan also likes. "At these levels," Mr. Sadan said, "it trades at a huge discount to Exxon." To demonstrate BP's financial strength, he noted that it is buying back $3 billion of stock, and that it announced plans last week to invest $6.75 billion for a 50 percent stake in a new company that will be the third-largest oil producer in Russia. "It's not one or the other, but both," he said.
Two financial stocks that Mr. Sadan holds in his portfolios are the Lloyds TSB Group and the life insurer Prudential P.L.C., which is not connected to Prudential Financial of the United States. "Prudential got very oversold; there was a lot of talk that it was going to go bankrupt" if the stock market continued to fall, he said, "but it's still got great cash flow and it's paying dividends, and if the market has any kind of rally, it will lead it."
Mr. Sadan said he is generally optimistic about British stocks. "There are really good blue-chip stocks at reasonable valuations and with high yields, and you know they're going to pay those yields year in and year out."

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
A Doctor's Bonus Could Also Help the Patients

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Florence Phillips was told by her doctor two years ago that she had congestive heart failure, she didn't have to worry about how she would manage the disease. 
 A health educator from her doctor's practice, the Hill Physicians Medical Group in San Ramon, Calif., called her immediately to talk about her condition and sent along a packet of material about it. Over the next several weeks, Ms. Phillips, 86, received more information and follow-up calls. She learned how to deal with her illness daily by watching her weight, restricting her salt intake and keeping up with her medications. She learned to look for signs of problems that would require her doctor's immediate attention, and to schedule regular checkups to monitor her condition. 
 Although there is no cure for congestive heart failure -- which occurs when the heart cannot pump blood efficiently -- her illness is under control. Ms. Phillips is pleased with her care. "They check into everything, and if I have any problems they always get me in right away," she said.
In recent years, disease management programs have sprung up nationwide as employers and insurers grapple with rising medical costs. Nearly two-thirds of those costs go toward treating chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure.
But Ms. Phillips's experience is uncommon in one very notable way: the disease management services are being sponsored by her doctor and her doctor's medical group, not by a health insurer or an employer. And her doctor stands to make more money from the Hill Physicians Medical Group, in the form of an annual bonus of roughly 10 percent of his compensation, if he can keep her and his other patients out of the emergency room, keep their cholesterol under control and make sure they're taking their medications, among other things. 
This is not the way doctors normally practice medicine, but maybe it should be. "The American medical system has been designed around heroic efforts, not around creeping diseases," said Steve McDermott, chief executive of Hill Physicians, an independent-practice association with 2,000 doctors and 350,000 patients in Northern California. 
For example, he said, heart surgeons are among the highest-paid doctors and often perform heroically during emergencies.
"You want your reactive systems to work very well," Mr. McDermott said, "but that's a talent and a skill and a mind-set that's very different than the teamwork that's required in disease management."
Doctors are only beginning to embrace this approach. A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the average physician group with 20 or more doctors used just 5 out of 16 "care management processes" prescribed by the authors, like case management and patient education, to treat patients with four chronic diseases -- diabetes, asthma, congestive heart failure and depression. 
Because smaller practices lack the people and resources to put these systems in place, they "are almost certainly doing even less of this," said Dr. Lawrence Casalino, an assistant professor of health studies at the University of Chicago and a principal author of the study.
Disease management programs sponsored by health plans or employers may do an excellent job, but they're often perceived -- sometimes accurately -- as limiting care rather than encouraging it. Catherine Marschilok, manager of the Northeast Health Diabetes Centers at Albany Memorial Hospital and Samaritan Hospital in Troy, N.Y., described the not-uncommon experience of a patient whose doctor referred him to Northeast Health for a five-session diabetes self-management course after the diagnosis. The man's insurance company refused to pay unless he had been hospitalized or admitted to the emergency room twice, citing the contract with his employer. "I was shocked," Ms. Marschilok said. "What they paid in disease management they could actually save in hospital costs."
From a patient's perspective, it makes sense that a doctor would be the point person in managing care: the doctor, after all, does the examining and sees the patient regularly. Traditionally, however, doctors haven't been paid to monitor and manage patients' care. Instead, their compensation has often been based on diagnosis and treatment. In other words, they've been paid to make you healthy, but not to keep you that way.
Offering financial incentives to doctors, as Hill Physicians has done through its bonus program, is an effort to shift the focus toward better patient care management. Others are trying similar approaches. In one of the largest experiments, six California health plans covering eight million patients in health maintenance organizations started a "pay for performance" effort in January in which they agreed to pay physician practices extra for meeting certain performance measures. 
WILL performance incentives for doctors work on a broad scale? It's too early to tell. "We currently have a payment system that's very wrong-headed," said Margaret O'Kane, president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which accredits managed-care plans and last year began accrediting disease management programs. "The question is how do you get people motivated," she said. "They're running out of tools to drive better quality, and this is a new approach."
With any luck, giving doctors performance incentives will turn out to be a bonus for patients, too.

Today, Good Advice Is the First Stop for Travelers

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
TRAVELERS have every right to be jittery these days, amid government terror alerts, the threat of war and, last week, the partial shutdown of Gatwick Airport outside London when a passenger was found with a hand grenade. But there are many things people can do to protect themselves and their investment in trips already booked -- or in the planning stages.
 Venturing abroad is diciest, and some travel experts recommend postponing all overseas travel, if possible, for 30 to 60 days. By then, it might become clear whether war will break out and whether the confrontation will be short and surgical or extended and messy. Jack Stradley, a managing director of Kroll, the risk consulting company, recommended postponing travel to predominantly Muslim countries or regions, though he said travel to Europe and Australia would "probably be safe." 
 The best way to keep track of travel safety and security issues is to monitor the news media, Web sites and other services offering up-to-the-minute data.
Helpful Web sites include one run by the State Department (www.travel.state.gov). It carries travel warnings, consular information and regional and worldwide public announcements about conditions and dangers for travelers. The department issued a worldwide travel warning on Feb. 6, extending to May 4, reminding Americans to be vigilant. 
The Overseas Security Advisory Council (www.ds-osac.org), a group run by the State Department, provides security-related information to American businesses operating overseas. Information can also be found on the site of the Transportation Security Administration site (www.tsatraveltips.us).
Web sites run by foreign governments -- including Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada (www.voyage.gc.ca) and Australia (www.dfat.gov.au) -- offer different perspectives on geopolitical matters. Still another source of information is iJET Travel Intelligence, at www.ijet.com, of Annapolis, Md., which sells reports on destinations worldwide, priced from $14.95.
Before buying a ticket to travel, you should ask about the company's rules, restrictions and fees imposed for cancellations or changes. You need to understand what will happen if you decide to change your travel plans, or if a war breaks out. Many airlines, cruise companies and tour operators have this information available on their Web sites.
You should always pay with a credit card; if the travel company is unable to provide the service -- for instance, an airline stops operating -- the card issuer will generally get a refund for you. 
If possible, buy tickets that can be changed or are refundable; they will be more expensive, but the flexibility may be worth it. Some experts also recommend upgrading to the highest class of service you can afford.
"If you're in first class," said Robert Jarvis, a professor of travel law at Nova Southeastern University, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., "they try to take better care of you than if you're in steerage." 
JOSH ROMANOW, a lawyer at Pillsbury Winthrop in Washington who represents airlines, hotel and cruise companies, advises having a backup plan.
"Think of another way to get there, taking other airlines, leaving from other airports," he said. He also suggests avoiding an airline's last flight of the day. "If there are any delays or cancellations," he said, "you run the risk of being stranded." Similarly, he recommends taking nonstop flights, not connecting ones. 
If you are planning a vacation, Ed Perkins, retired editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter, advises against buying complete tour packages; instead, he recommends buying refundable tickets and making hotel and rental-car reservations that can be canceled and do not require prepayments. He also suggests paying at the last minute. 
"In this weak economy, you'll find very few tours and cruises that you can't buy within a few weeks of departure," he said, "possibly even with an enticing price reduction." 
Most airlines, hotel companies, cruise lines and tour operators that were contacted last week said they had not yet formulated policies for refunds, changes or cancellations in case of war. In recent weeks, some cruise lines -- like SeaDream Yacht Club, Uniworld, Crystal Cruises, Holland America Line and Royal Olympia Cruises -- have announced liberal cancellation policies. These generally let travelers cancel trips 24 hours or less before departure, giving them at least a partial refund or credit; in the case of Crystal Cruises and Holland America, the purchase of the cruise line's trip insurance is required. Several tour operators, including Collette Vacations, already had liberal policies.
Although travel insurance may also protect you, it generally does so only under certain circumstances. Many policies -- like those offered by Access America, a division of Allianz; Travel Guard International; and Travel Insured International -- provide coverage if a terrorist attack occurs within 30 days of a policyholder's trip. But they do not provide coverage if a war breaks out, or if someone is simply afraid to travel.
IF your trip involves flying, be aware that airport security has been tightened since the Homeland Security Department raised the national alert level on Feb. 7. The government has increased security in and near airports, put more air marshals on flights and limited parking at some airports. If you are driving to the airport, check parking availability before you depart, either by calling the airport or by looking at its Web site.
Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, an advocacy group, suggests traveling lightly, so you can get through airport security as quickly as possible. At overseas airports, he recommends staying away from Americans traveling in large groups, which can be potential terrorist targets.
Experts suggest that travelers carry certain items that may be useful in an emergency or if they are stranded: water and nonperishable food; a cellphone; photocopies of passports, visas and medical prescriptions; and a small first-aid kit.
If you are traveling overseas, remember to register at United States embassies or consulates; their locations are available on the State Department's Web site. In an emergency, you should contact the embassy for assistance and information.
The State Department also offers a telephone service to answer travelers' inquiries (888-407-4747 or 317-472-2328, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time on weekdays; 202-647-5225 at other hours).
Emergency services for travelers who are stranded or otherwise need help are also available from some credit card companies. Holders of American Express cards, for example, can use the company's 24-hour hot line to arrange for medical care, extra cash and legal and other services around the world.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Stocks Are Best Option For Beating Inflation

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
AFTER watching the stock market grind up their portfolios for three consecutive years, a lot of investors are probably just about ready to give up.
 A little pickup in the markets, enough to recover some losses, and you're ready to stop playing this fool's game forever, right? Conversely, if the market falls further this year, doesn't that prove that there really is no light at the end of the tunnel? 
 Maybe you figure you can put your money in something safe, like bonds, and sleep better at night. But for anybody who is saving for the longer term -- for retirement or to help pay for a child's college education -- that could be a big mistake. 
That's because the biggest threat to your wealth is not the risk that the market, which still seems overvalued by almost any measure, will fall further. The greatest risk is that inflation -- even moderate inflation -- could seriously erode your savings and put a huge crimp in your future standard of living.
That view comes not from one of the perennial cheerleaders for the market, but from David Levine, a former Wall Street economist and investment strategist who was among the first -- in 1998 -- to warn that the stock market was in a bubble that was bound to burst. At that point, Mr. Levine urged investors to begin reducing their exposure to the market.
In 1999, Mr. Levine retired from Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, which is perhaps the most respected source of independent research on Wall Street. But he has remained active as a private investor. He recently sent to friends and fellow professionals a long analytical letter, titled "What's the Best Strategy Now?," that provides a framework for thinking about how to invest for an uncertain financial future.
Mr. Levine straddles the long-running debate between the pessimists, like Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist who believes that the market remains so overvalued that people should stay out of it until it goes a lot lower, and the optimists, like Mr. Shiller's longtime friend and intellectual sparring partner, Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who argues that stocks can be counted on to outperform any other investment over any reasonable period.
Like Mr. Shiller, Mr. Levine thinks that the broad market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500, is more likely than not to fall from where it is today. He is convinced that the market's performance over the next couple of decades will be far worse than the double-digit returns that stocks have generated, on average, in the past. But, like Mr. Siegel, he thinks that because no one is smart enough to time the peaks and troughs of the market, the safest strategy is to stay meaningfully invested in the market all the time.
Boiled down to its essence, Mr. Levine's argument is that "stocks, unlike bonds, are just about guaranteed to protect you against inflation over the long run."
IN contrast to bonds, which pay only a fixed-income stream that is corroded as the general price level rises, a broad portfolio of stocks gives an investor a share in the very businesses that set prices in the economy. To the extent that prices change, so does the revenue of companies in the market.
While he still considers the stock market overvalued, he argues that it has fallen enough to make it worth investing more. Under almost any reasonable future script for the market, except for a deep deflation (which has happened only once in the last century, during the Depression), stocks can be expected to outperform both conventional bonds and inflation-protected bonds, particularly after taxes. The faster the economy grows and the higher prices move, the better stocks perform relative to bonds.
Though paradoxical to some, Mr. Levine's argument is that investors should see any further decline in the market as an opportunity to start buying more stocks. "The lower the market goes, the cheaper it is," he says.
By his calculations, the safest long-run bet for investors today is to hold no less than 50 percent and as much as 80 percent of their assets in stocks.
To the extent the S.& P. 500 falls further, Mr. Levine would gradually shift even more money into the market. He thinks investors should maximize the amount they are willing to put into stocks (he will go to 100 percent and recommends 70 percent for the least aggressive investors) if the S.& P. 500 falls to less than 600 from about 800 today.
Acknowledging a high degree of uncertainty, particularly over the reliability of corporate earnings, Mr. Levine still worries that most investors have been so burned by the market that they are, so to speak, keeping too much money under the mattress. But more people, he says, "have been damaged by fear than by greed."

HEADLINE: Did My Car Join Al Qaeda? 

BYLINE:  By Woody Hochswender; Woody Hochswender, a former reporter for The Times, is co-author of "The Buddha in Your Mirror."

DATELINE: SALISBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
I drive a large, four-wheel-drive vehicle. Does that mean I'm a bad person?
 You might think so, from all the sturm und drang we've heard lately from the Virtuous Ones who insist that America's fuel consumption -- indeed, our very style of life -- is somehow responsible for the enmity toward us in the Middle East, not to mention the rest of the world. A series of TV commercials put together by the columnist Arianna Huffington and Lawrence Bender, the Hollywood producer behind "Pulp Fiction," have even linked S.U.V.'s with Mideast terrorism. The idea is that the petrodollars transmigrate from the Gas 'n' Go to the oil sheiks to the hands of maniacs wielding AK-47's. 
 Leaving aside for the moment that this is trendy, illogical thinking -- and leaving aside also the odd sensation of being lectured on socially responsible behavior by the producer of "Pulp Fiction" -- isn't this really a backdoor way of blaming America for Sept. 11 and other crimes like it? Those who implicate Americans -- particularly our adventurous habits, offbeat choices and breathtaking freedoms, including the freedom to drive to a poetry reading followed by dinner at a French restaurant in the midst of a raging snowstorm -- validate the terrorists as essentially right.
Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are S.U.V.'s or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads. We also have had more than 70 inches of snow this winter. When the sun goes down and the melted snow re-freezes, the roads are covered with insidious stretches of black ice.
Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest. Yes, there is something vaguely obscene about driving solo to the supermarket in Beverly Hills to pick up a carton of milk in your two-ton Navigator. But not so much in Portland or Green Bay or Chicago. 
The well-publicized notion that S.U.V.'s are actually unsafe, based on their propensity to roll over, does not take into account personal responsibility. Rollover accidents tend to be something the driver has a substantial degree of control over. I choose not to whip around corners or to follow others so closely and at such high speeds that I have to make harrowing emergency stops. I drive so as not to roll over. 
However, if some drunken driver veers across the center divider -- a situation I have no control over -- I would prefer that my 9-year-old and I not be inside a Corolla. From the standpoint of a reasoned individualism, S.U.V.'s are safer in many situations than cars. I think a lot of intelligent people realize that.
Of course, S.U.V.'s use a lot of gas. This goes for my wife's all-wheel-drive Volvo as well as for my voracious mistress, my 1989 GMC. But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency. Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly. We tend to combine trips and to keep engines finely tuned and tires properly inflated. It all comes down to home economics.
What are we supposed to do now, turn our S.U.V.'s in? En masse? Only the independently wealthy can treat their cars purely as fashion items.
The S.U.V.-bashers' argument also falls apart on macro-economic grounds. Were we to somehow cut our national fuel consumption by 20 percent, would that deprive the terrorism sponsors of cash? Unfortunately, the world oil market is, well, a market. Even if America were energy independent, there is no guarantee that Exxon, Texaco and Getty -- or, for that matter, France, the Netherlands and Japan -- would cease buying oil from Middle Eastern states. 
My guess is that this campaign has less to do with politics and economics than with an American tendency to mind everybody else's business. So, busybodies, let me ask you a question: How big is your house? Ms. Huffington's is reported to be 9,000 square feet. We all know what it costs to heat and air-condition a joint like that. A couple of years ago I replaced the aging oil furnace in my 3,000-square-foot house with a new fuel-injected system. It saves me about 800 gallons of oil a year. Hey, that's almost precisely the yearly fuel consumption of my GMC. I think of that as progress, for me, as a world citizen. Maybe I'm not such a bad person after all.

HEADLINE: If the Rules Are Changed, Will Options Disappear? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WOULD a new accounting rule requiring companies to take a charge against earnings for option grants really make stock options an endangered species?
 Many corporate executives say it will. "If options are expensed," Elizabeth B. Robert, chief executive of the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, recently wrote to regulators, "I can tell you that a small company like V.T.B. will no longer grant them." Louis J. Lavigne Jr., chief financial officer of Genentech, the biotechnology company, said an accounting charge "would most likely eliminate broad-based stock option plans." 
 Many accounting experts, however, point out that companies already disclose their option grants to investors in footnotes to public documents and that mandating a change in the reporting of earnings would not affect companies' actual finances.
"I don't think it will make any difference," said Keith M. Howe, a finance professor at DePaul University in Chicago, "because there is no difference whatsoever in cash flows."
Companies fear that their stock values will fall as reported earnings decline because of the charge. But in a recent survey of finance professors, 38 percent said a new rule would have no effect on stock prices and 46 percent said it would have only a small effect. Towers Perrin, a consulting firm, found that the stocks of 103 companies that adopted an accounting charge voluntarily last year performed no differently after the announcements than did the market as a whole.
But a new charge could make options less popular even if it did not affect share prices, some pay experts say. Options are now the only form of pay that appears to be free on an earnings statement. Without options' preferential treatment, more companies may decide that other types of compensation, like profit sharing or outright stock grants, serve as more effective motivators of executive performance. 
Today, "companies are making a decision about compensation based on an accounting norm rather than on economics or employee relations," said Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif. "Once the playing field is leveled, companies can make much more rational decisions."
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to meet in March to consider the issue. DAVID LEONHARDT

HEADLINE: A Well-Kept Military Secret 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, when the ruling sheiks in the United Arab Emirates decided to expand the local economy after the gulf war, they turned to American military contractors like Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin for a helping hand.
 In return for buying military gear, the emirates pressed the contractors to spend millions of dollars to create jobs and to improve the lives of citizens in their desert outposts: financing a medical diagnostic center linked by satellite to the Mayo Clinic, building a shipyard that has created thousands of jobs, helping with oil-spill cleanups, starting a laser-printer recycling business and even bringing Berlitz schools to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. 
 In another era, these gifts might be considered bribes. Now they are called offsets. Bribes were outlawed under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which barred payments to foreign officials in exchange for business. But offsets, while little known, are a legal and, companies say, necessary part of the international arms trade not only in the emirates but around the globe. 
"Offsets are the equivalent of what we used to do when we bribed foreign officials," said Robert E. Scott, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington. "It's a tragedy, and it's a race to the bottom. The best way to avoid these kinds of competitive and disruptive games is to outlaw the practice." 
Instead, offsets are growing. For American and European arms makers, lavish packages have become the key to closing deals. The Czech Republic, for one, has said that when it next buys fighter jets, the offsets will be more important than the jets' price or performance.
"It's an essential part of doing business overseas," said Kent Kresa, chief executive of Northrop Grumman. "I'm not negative on it." 
Although the ramp-up to potential war with Iraq and President Bush's request for a record $380 billion Pentagon budget would suggest that military contractors have it easy, the contractors say they must scramble for overseas sales. The Pentagon has stockpiled so many F-18 and F-16 fighter jets and other weapons that it is only through overseas sales that many aging production lines are kept running.
If the public knows little about this corner of the military industry, that is by design. Most contractors refuse to talk about offsets. They disclose little about them to shareholders or regulators and grumble privately that they are a "necessary evil." Yet they have done little to halt the practice.
"One reason it is hard to get people to talk about this is that it encourages people to ask for more," said Pierre Chao, an industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Offsets can be any form of aid -- direct investments, agreements to help countries export their goods, pacts to use more foreign components in the weapons sold, even transferring subassembly jobs overseas.
American arms makers have helped the Dutch to export yarn and missile parts, the Finns to sell rail carriers and passenger ferries, the Swiss to sell machine tools and ball bearings, and the Norwegians to market power-generating equipment. Lockheed had to use British-made Rolls-Royce engines instead of ones made by General Electric to power Apache attack helicopters sold in Europe. And, in a sale of F-16's to Poland, Lockheed agreed to have the jets' engines built there.
Military contractors say they have been brokers for imported figs, tomato paste and wine; for years, McDonnell Douglas, now part of Lockheed, provided Christmas hams to its employees under a fighter-jet offset deal with Denmark.
"THE whole system is mad," said Kevin L. Kearns, president of the United States Business and Industrial Council, which represents small businesses, many of them military subcontractors. "Everything about offsets is totally counter to a free-trade philosophy. If we have the world's best armaments, other countries should buy them free and clear. The mice here are in charge of the cheese."
So complicated are offsets that most major contractors have entire departments to devise them and to twist the arms of suppliers into participating as well. Contractors usually agree to pay damages if they fail to deliver on a deal; in practice, though, offset agreements that run into trouble are often renegotiated.
Officially, the federal government frowns on offsets as economically inefficient and bars the use of taxpayer dollars to finance them. They are negotiated directly by American contractors with foreign governments, though the Commerce Department keeps data on them.
Those statistics show that more than 120 countries require offsets in military sales. In 1998, the last year of available figures, American contractors signed 41 agreements with 17 countries. From 1993 to 1998, they provided $21 billion in aid to foreign countries under 279 agreements. Lockheed has entered into more than 300 offset arrangements in more than 30 countries in the last two decades. New data, as yet unreleased, will show increases across the board, said Daniel O. Hill, director of the Commerce Department's office of strategic industries.
Aside from obvious distortions they cause in global trade, offsets have cost the United States thousands of precious manufacturing jobs, unions say. A 2001 presidential commission on offsets found that they led to an annual loss of 4,200 manufacturing jobs in the 1990's, mostly among subcontractors.
"The government does not know the full impact of these deals because there is such a lack of information," said Owen E. Herrnstadt, director of the international department of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. "It's a puzzle that policy makers have yet to put together, and the threat is growing. Workers are being sacrificed."
Contractors say privately that they are not happy, either. Many complain that they must spend a lot of time and money putting together offset deals -- an activity far from their core skills. Some fear that as American contractors send jobs and technology overseas, they are undercutting their own future.
Under a $3.3 billion agreement for the sale of 40 F-15K Strike Eagle jets to South Korea, Boeing will transfer jobs and skills to South Korea that will enable it to produce its own fighter jet by 2015. Korea will be given avionic, software and design technology that Boeing values at $1.5 billion, and while the plane's final assembly will be done by Boeing in St. Louis, the wings and front fuselage will be made in Korea.
Contractors say the leaders of many countries, particularly those in developing economies, need offsets as political cover to justify the billions spent on military goods. 
"From a general industry perspective, while we'd prefer that offsets did not exist, most companies would say that we are pretty good at them," said Michael Messina, chairman of the Defense Industry Offset Association, a group of military contractors. "If U.S. companies did not provide offsets, we would not have the business in the first place. Half a loaf is better than none."
In a survey of eight large contractors, the 2001 commission found that seven estimated that they would lose 50 to 90 percent of foreign sales without offsets, while one said eliminating them would have little or no effect.
While no contractor contacted for this article would comment, one leading arms maker did allow a senior vice president to be interviewed as long as neither he nor the company was identified. The executive, who oversees foreign sales, said the end of offsets would force many contractors to shut production lines; he specifically cited lines for the F-18 and F-15 jets (made by Boeing) and the C-130J transport aircraft (made by Lockheed). 
"If and when there is a multilateral agreement so that offsets would go away, we would be delighted," he said. "But until that day, let's not take the risk."
In Congress, Representative John F. Tierney, Democrat of Massachusetts, has tried for years to curb offsets. "This is a very serious problem," he said. "We tried to move on this issue, but we got no traction. I don't think the industry is as upset as it claims to be; otherwise there would be more done about it."
Some in the industry say as much. "We have the world's largest defense industry, companies and economy," said Joel J. Johnson, vice president at the Aerospace Industries Association. "We can do offsets no sweat and better than anyone. I'm not sure we want to get rid of them when we have a competitive advantage."
Offsets began after World War II, based on the theory that co-production agreements were needed to help European countries rebuild military-industrial bases and resist communism. Communism died, and European arms makers were back on their feet -- but offsets stayed. 
"Once the genie was let out of the bottle," said Mr. Chao, of Credit Suisse, "it was impossible to put it back in as nations figured out how they could use the offsets game."
According to government data, the biggest recipients of offsets are among the most sophisticated countries: Finland, Britain, Israel, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Switzerland's presence on the list irks some critics, who say that the country is so rich that it needs little help and that its policy of neutrality means no American security interests are at play.
Israel, too, raises eyebrows. It is one of two countries -- Egypt is the other -- that receive direct American military aid to buy American-made weaponry; but unlike Egypt, Israel insists on offsets.
In 1999, according to the Commerce Department, the United States gave Israel $1.86 billion in military aid, with the requirement that the bulk be spent on American goods. With this money, Israel has pitted American contractors against one another. Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas were once in an offset competition for a $2 billion fighter jet deal. Because of the technology it gained through these offsets, Israel has developed its own weapons systems and competes against American contractors for orders.
Critics have called Israel's actions double dipping, and the Commerce Department asked Congress to halt it in 1998, but the proposal had no political support.
THE United Arab Emirates, a federation the size of Maine at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, has one of the most sophisticated programs for offsets, important to its economic development. Since the country set up an office to attract offsets in 1992, it has received offsets totaling $680 million. Millions more are expected now that it has announced a $7 billion purchase of 80 F-16's from Lockheed. 
The French have also established a big presence in the emirates, pumping money into everything from a fish farm to a nursery with four million roses to a date-palm cloning operation. The French are also financing a huge air-conditioning project to cool the country's shopping malls and office towers.
To make life easier for the contractors, the emirates have even set up a $20 million venture capital fund, the Chescor Capital Offset fund. 
"We've come up with a pretty aggressive offset program," said Nasri Tehini, a partner in Chesco Capital. "Our country has been put on the map, and one of the reasons is offsets."
One centerpiece of the emirates' program is Abu Dhabi Ship Building, which makes warships and commercial vessels; Northrop Grummman owned 30 percent of the company before selling it in late 2002.
So eager was Northrop to make inroads there that it made this investment as a "pre offset" for future ship orders that never materialized. Northrop declined to comment, but American shipbuilders are fuming. 
"We view this as tantamount to war," said Cynthia Brown, president of the American Shipbuilding Association, a trade group. "The U.S. government should be insisting that foreign governments cease offset policies. They are killing our industry. It's like Pac-Man. It breeds industry cannibalism to the detriment of the U.S. taxpayer."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about military contractors' use of offsets -- assistance to foreign countries in exchange for the purchase of military equipment -- misidentified the company that acquired McDonnell Douglas, a contractor that engaged in the practice. It is Boeing, not Lockheed Martin.

HEADLINE: Option Math: Why So Many to So Few? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
AMONG corporate executives, there are wealth spreaders and wealth hoarders.
 The spreaders disperse millions of stock options among their employees, not just to top executives, allowing many to benefit when the company's stock rises. Spreaders remain very much in the minority, but their ranks include management at Walt Disney, many large technology companies like I.B.M. and Microsoft and drug makers like Johnson & Johnson. 
 The hoarders, meanwhile, concentrate option grants among a tiny group, sometimes even keeping 50 percent or more of all options in the hands of five senior executives. Circuit City Stores, Citigroup, Target and United States Steel are hoarders, according to an analysis done for Money & Business of filings by the country's 250 largest companies that award options. 
This may well be a year of reckoning for stock options, and the way they are distributed is driving much of the debate. The tax scandal that recently forced the resignations of Sprint's top two executives had its roots in their gains from an enormous pile of options, which towered over the holdings of most Sprint workers.
Last week, Ernst & Young became the first major accounting firm to lobby regulators in favor of requiring companies to take a charge against earnings for awarding options, as they must do for other forms of pay. Many executives aggressively oppose a rule change and are threatening to stop giving options to rank-and-file workers if the grants would reduce reported earnings.
But the actual distribution of options has received relatively little scrutiny. In reality, the use of options is far less democratic than many opponents of an earnings charge have claimed, and their concentration appears to be damaging many companies' performance, according to the analysis of company filings, which was done by Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse, management professors at Rutgers.
"The enormous variation in what boards of directors have done with their top five executives," Mr. Blasi said, "raises serious questions about corporate governance and the process that's used to divide the stock option pie."
The 250 biggest options-granting companies, which employ an average of 69,000 people, gave an average of 18.1 percent of options to just the top five executives during their 1999 through 2001 fiscal years. Many of the remaining options went to executives on the next few rungs of the corporate ladder, according to compensation consultants and other surveys. In 1999, about 1.7 percent of private-sector workers received options, according to the most recent government study.
"Broad-based employee options are not the norm," said Jannice M. Koors, a vice president at Pearl Meyer & Partners, a compensation consulting firm in New York. 
Yet, defying some traditional management theory -- which holds that options are best used to motivate only people with clear control over a company's stock price -- the spreaders have outperformed the hoarders over the last decade, posting an annual return that is almost nine percentage points better. (Options, which have become the dominant form of executive pay over the last decade largely because of the favorable accounting treatment, give their holders the right to buy shares at a fixed price, regardless of the current market price.)
 EVEN a glance at the list of companies that have recently given more than 20 percent of their options to their top five executives in a single year makes the point. Beside Sprint, it includes two targets of Securities and Exchange Commission investigations (Tyco International and Qwest Communications International), a company that agreed to reimburse its customers $400 million for improper billing (Providian Financial) and one subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid late last year (Tenet Healthcare).
Broad-based plans, while rare, do lie at the core of a management credo shared by most big companies in the technology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as a few others. 
"There's a management philosophy that leadership can be exhibited everywhere in the company," said David L. Shedlarz, the chief financial officer of Pfizer, which makes Rolaids, Sudafed and Viagra, among other products. "The stock-option program is meant to exhibit exactly that culture."
Individually, senior Pfizer executives still receive many times the number of options that other employees do. Together, though, the top five received about 4 percent of options from 1999 to 2001, according to Professors Blasi and Kruse, who are the authors, with Aaron Bernstein, a Business Week writer, of "In the Company of Owners: The Truth About Stock Options" (Basic Books, 2003, $27.50).
In a typical year, Pfizer gives options to about 15 percent of its employees, most of whom are managers and the rest of whom are rewarded for specific accomplishments. Robert W. Norton, the senior vice president for human resources, said he thought the grants had helped keep Pfizer's turnover "always in the single digits." 
Many technology companies go further in spreading around their equity. At Cisco Systems, 80 percent of options go to employees below the level of vice president, said Robyn Jenkins, a spokeswoman. Since 1994, Cisco employees outside of the top five executives have made an astonishing $19 billion exercising stock options -- or roughly $97,000 annually per employee, Professors Blasi and Kruse said.
Of course, the spreading of wealth could not insulate Cisco or any other company from the sharp downturn in technology spending. At the close of trading on Friday, Cisco's stock was more than 83 percent below its peak in 2000.
And there is a flip side to the company loyalty that option grants can promote: riches created by the stock market's technology bubble raised employee turnover by allowing many workers at Cisco and other Silicon Valley companies to retire early. 
As for the top five Cisco executives, they were taken care of. Each has made about $18 million annually, not including shares that were granted to them outright, rather than in the form of a stock option.
Intel, widely respected over the years as a well-managed company, is the most aggressive distributor of options on the Rutgers list. It was the only company to have awarded less than 1 percent of its option grants to the top five executives between 1999 and 2001.
(Most companies have not yet filed their annual proxy statements, which contain option information, for 2002.)
At the other end of the spectrum are many energy companies and old-line manufacturers. Baker Hughes, an oil and gas company based in Houston, ranked first, giving more than half of all options to its top five executives in 2001 and more than 90 percent in 1999, according to Professors Blasi and Kruse.
Conoco, another energy company based in Houston, offered a window into the way a management team that seems to be a generous spreader of options can in fact keep them concentrated. Early in 2001, Conoco gave 100 options to every one of its employees, the second time it had made such a grant in three years. The company, which has since become ConocoPhillips, made the announcement on its annual "Pie Day," a celebration of its commitment to sharing a piece of its financial pie with workers.
But compared with the 700,000 options that Archie W. Dunham, the chief executive, received in 2001, the employees' awards were crumbs. Conoco, eighth on the list, granted almost a quarter of all options to its top executives that year.
Mr. Dunham has said that Conoco gave options to employees primarily to make them interested in the stock price and that the options were not meant to serve as a significant portion of their pay. 
Some management experts call the hoarding of options a perfectly rational strategy for executives. Workers tend to view a stock option as less valuable than an outside investor would because they are usually prevented from trading it freely and because they are rightly wary of tying too much of their money to their employer. Many employees also have trouble seeing the connection between their own job and their company's stock price.
"The most effective incentives are those that reward people for things over which they have control," said Ms. Koors, the compensation consultant. "When you really get down to the number of people who have the ability to influence stock prices, it's not a big group."
In fact, there are many companies that have spread equity throughout their ranks and failed. WorldCom sits near Cisco and Intel on the Rutgers list, having given just 3 percent of options to its top five executives, while the unions at UAL, the parent of United Airlines, received more half of the company's stock in the 1990's. Both WorldCom and UAL filed for bankruptcy protection last year. 
THE list of 250 options-granting companies appears to confirm these anecdotes. The stocks of the 50 companies that have spread their options most widely fell 29.9 percent from Jan. 1, 1999 through Thursday, according to the RiskMetrics Group, a financial analysis company in New York. Stocks of the 50 that have concentrated them at the top fell 11.8 percent in the period.
The reason may well have little to do with compensation practices -- and much more to do with bigger economic trends, however. The last three years have been kind to energy companies and harsh to technology concerns. In fact, over long periods, companies that distribute options or stock to many workers tend to do better than those that do not, according to a number of academic studies. 
From 1993 to 2001, the one-quarter of companies that gave the smallest shares of options to top management gave their investors a 31.3 percent annual return, according to a study of 1,500 companies by Professors Blasi and Kruse. Shareholders of the one-quarter of companies that gave top executives the biggest slices of the options pie received only a 22.5 percent return. 
Controlling for industry trends -- so that the rise and fall of technology stocks do not account for differences, for example -- a study by Professors Blasi, Kruse and James Sesil of Rutgers and Maya Kroumova of the New York Institute of Technology found that companies with broad-based equity plans were 7 percent more productive than those without them.
Simply handing out options is not enough to make a difference, say many executives who do distribute options widely; companies must also treat employees as people with a stake in the business. 
Southwest Airlines, the only large carrier that is profitable today, gives less than 7 percent of options to the top five executives and roughly an additional 18 percent to other managers. The remainder go to customer service agents, dispatchers, flight instructors, mechanics and pilots, among other employees. The company also asks these workers to help shape its strategy, from its overhaul of boarding procedures after the Sept. 11 attacks to its recent switch of onboard coffee brands.
"Our approach is real simple: if it applies to management, we want it to apply to everyone," said Gary C. Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer. "We want all 35,000 Southwest employees acting in the best interest of Southwest as a whole. We think tying your wealth to Southwest's stock is the way to do that."

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with an article about the distribution of stock options at big companies misstated the average percentage of Citigroup's options received by its top five executives from 1999 to 2001. It was 12.9 percent, not 27.7. The analysis on which the chart was based miscalculated reload options -- those received by Citigroup executives as a replacement for options they exercise -- thus exaggerating the percentage.

HEADLINE: London's Big Gamble 

 BODY:
The irony is delicious. Tomorrow, Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London whose leftist politics once earned him the nickname "Red Ken," will put in place a traffic reduction policy that, he cheerfully concedes, was lifted directly from Milton Friedman, the doyen of free market economists. 
 The plan is a variation on "congestion pricing" -- applying market forces to traffic. People who drive into a 10-square-mile area of central London will have to pay the equivalent of $8 per day for the privilege. Apart from speeding things up, the mayor hopes to redistribute cash from the well-off, who drive, to the poor, who take subways and buses. He'll use the $300 million the plan is supposed to generate annually to improve public transportation. 
 Success depends partly on a monitoring system involving hundreds of cameras that will record license plates, then match the numbers against a computer database of paid-up drivers. Those who haven't paid will be fined. A bigger question is public acceptance. There is talk of civil disobedience, and Tory politicians say they'll use the issue against the mayor in next year's elections. 
The plan is more than a curiosity. Cities everywhere, including New York, are suffering from gridlock and its associated costs. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plans, however, seem tame by comparison. He wants to impose tolls on the East River bridges, rightly so. Higher tariffs at rush hour would also be welcome. Apart from their inherent wisdom, these steps would also be a noble gesture of mayoral solidarity.

HEADLINE: Peking Duct Tape 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
After a recent U.N. session on the Iraq crisis, I asked a Bush aide how China was behaving. "The Chinese?" the official said. "They don't think they have a dog in this fight."
 That certainly is how China is behaving -- as if this whole issue were for America to resolve. That is a deeply mistaken view, and it shows how little China (not to mention France and Russia) understands about the new world order. If I were explaining it to China's leaders, here's what I would say: 
 Friends, with every great world war has come a new security system. World War I gave birth to the League of Nations and an attempt to recreate a balance of power in Europe, which proved unstable. World War II gave birth to the U.N., NATO, the I.M.F. and the bipolar American-Soviet power structure, which proved to be quite stable until the end of the cold war. Now, 9/11 has set off World War III, and it, too, is defining a new international order.
The new world system is also bipolar, but instead of being divided between East and West, it is divided between the World of Order and the World of Disorder. The World of Order is built on four pillars: the U.S., E.U.-Russia, India and China, along with all the smaller powers around them. The World of Disorder comprises failed states (such as Liberia), rogue states (Iraq and North Korea), messy states -- states that are too big to fail but too messy to work (Pakistan, Colombia, Indonesia, many Arab and African states) -- and finally the terrorist and mafia networks that feed off the World of Disorder.
There has always been a World of Disorder, but what makes it more dangerous today is that in a networked universe, with widely diffused technologies, open borders and a highly integrated global financial and Internet system, very small groups of people can amass huge amounts of power to disrupt the World of Order. Individuals can become super-empowered. In many ways, 9/11 marked the first full-scale battle between a superpower and a small band of super-empowered angry men from the World of Disorder.
The job of the four pillars of the World of Order is to work together to help stabilize and lift up the World of Disorder. Unfortunately, China doesn't seem to realize that. You (like some Bushies) still have a lot of cold war reflexes. Indeed, some Chinese intellectuals, not to mention French and Russian, actually believe you all have more to fear from American power than from Osama, Kim or Saddam. That's nuts. If America has to manage the World of Disorder alone, the American people will quickly tire. And as Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins foreign policy expert, notes, "The real threat to world stability is not too much American power. It is too little American power." Too little American power will only lead to the World of Disorder expanding.
China has to think clearly. If there is just one more 9/11, or if North Korea lobs just one missile our way, it will lead to the end of the open society in America, as we know it, and also constrict globalization. Because we will tighten our borders, triple-check every ship that comes into port and restrict civil liberties as never before, and this will slow the whole global economy.
Now the last time I checked, China had decided to base its growth on manufacturing for the global market and in particular for the U.S. market, where you now send 40 percent of your exports -- 40 percent! -- and where you just racked up a $100 billion trade surplus. One more 9/11 and your growth strategy will be in real trouble (unless you plan on only exporting duct tape), which means the Chinese leadership will be in real trouble.
So, you still think you don't have a dog in this fight? You still think you can be free riders on an Iraq war? You still think you can leave us to carry the burden of North Korea? Well, guess again. You need to get serious. It is quite legitimate for China to oppose war in Iraq or North Korea. But why isn't China's foreign minister going to Baghdad and Pyongyang, slamming his fist on tables and demanding that their leaders start complying with the U.N. to avoid war? I understand you don't want us to be impulsive, but why are you so passive?
One more 9/11, one bad Iraq war that ties America down alone in the Middle East and saps its strength, well, that may go over well with the cold warriors in the People's Liberation Army, but in the real world -- in the world where your real threat is not American troops crossing your borders but American dollars fleeing from them -- you will be out of business.
Now which part of that sentence don't you understand?

HEADLINE: A State Vintage, By Way of Chile 

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY 

 BODY:
HAIGHT VINEYARD is the state's oldest winery, run by Sherman Haight, the man who pioneered the wine industry in Connecticut. The wine is bottled at the vineyard and many liquor stores display the wine with others produced in the state, the assumption being that it is wine coming from Connecticut soil.
But the grapes from which some of the wine is made aren't grown anywhere near the state. They are coming from Chile.
 In fact, Mr. Haight, 80, said his Merlot probably contains 90 to 95 percent Chilean concentrate, a strategy he said he uses to save money. It's a practice that other state winemakers shun and that the state attorney general said may be deceptive. The attorney general's office has begun an inquiry of the vineyard, and the State Liquor Control Commission said it will investigate. 
 State law allows the limited use of grapes from other regions, but it's the use of concentrate, which is considered inferior, and in such a high percentage, that is raising questions not just legally, but among wine critics.
"I don't think you can make good wine out of concentrate, and I don't know anyone else who does that in the state," said Stephen Vollweiler, president of the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association, a trade group, and owner of the Sharpe Hill Vineyard in Pomfret, a competitor of Mr. Haight's. "No one uses concentrate except for Sherman Haight, as far as I know."
Mr. Haight, who admitted to mislabeling some of his wines in 1997 and 1998 after a federal investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, also said his Riesling and Chardonnay contained Chilean concentrate, although he declined to say how much. Wayne Stitzer, the vineyard's former winemaker who quit in 1999, said that, at least for the last few years he worked there, those two wines were made mostly from concentrate.
Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, and the State Consumer Protection Department said they will review whether it's misleading that Mr. Haight's labels say his Merlot, Riesling, and Chardonnay are "premium" red or "premium" white and are "produced and bottled by Haight Vineyard, Litchfield, Connecticut." Nowhere do the labels say these wines are made in part from foreign concentrate or how much they contain.
"What we need to determine is whether the labels are deceptive by seeming to say that the wine is fully produced in Connecticut, which would very possibly lead the ordinary consumer to believe that the grapes are grown and processed here," Mr. Blumenthal said. "If the concentrate is in fact imported from a completely different country, there may well be a violation of our laws that prohibit deceptive labeling."
Connecticut law requires that the label not "belie its true contents" nor "in any manner tend to deceive the purchaser as to the real nature of the alcoholic beverage."
Mr. Haight said there is nothing wrong with the practice because concentrate is merely grape juice with water removed. He did not use concentrate when he first planted his vineyard in 1975 , two years after he retired as the fourth-generation head of his family's international textile business, A.S. Haight & Company of Manhattan. The winery produces about 6,000 cases of wine a year, he said, average output for Connecticut wineries.
"If I thought the wines were substandard, they wouldn't be here," Mr. Haight said. He said he uses concentrate to economize. It's "fair" to consumers not to label a wine as containing concentrate, he said. "It's a natural process. Why would you put on one of the processes in wine-making without putting them all on? It's not deceptive. Absolutely not."
Eugene Spaziani, president of the northeast regional chapter of Amenti del Vino, a wine appreciation society, said concentrates are used occasionally to extend or add a certain quality or color to a wine, but usually in small quantities, around 1 percent.
"An important point is that concentrates should never be used as the main ingredient in the wine-making process," he said. 
Kurt Cameron, owner of the New England Beverage Company, a liquor store in Torrington, said he sells a lot of Haight wine and that the use of concentrate doesn't bother him.
"I suppose there's an air of deception there, but if when questioned he comes clean about it, I suppose that's O.K.," he said. "Then let the consumers be the ultimate judge."
That may not be good enough for Mr. Blumenthal, who said he may also propose legislation during the current session of the General Assembly that would make the labeling laws "more precise for the benefit of consumers and the industry. Stating the contents more explicitly might well be a good idea."
Mr. Haight was once cited for mislabeling his wines. After an investigation, the A.T.F. found he had violated civil and criminal laws by mislabeling and selling more than 240,000 bottles of Riesling, Merlot, Chardonnay and other wines from March 1997 through October 1998. Some were labeled as "Premium American" vintages when they in fact were made in part from foreign concentrate.
The Merlot produced in that period was 90 percent to 95 percent concentrate, Mr. Haight said, about the same percentage as in his present Merlot. Bottles of the Riesling and Chardonnay "might easily have been" half or more than half concentrate, he said.
In April 2002, the A.T.F. accepted Haight's offer to settle the case by admitting the civil and criminal mislabeling violations and paying a $7,500 fine.
"I take responsibility for it, because the buck stops here," Mr. Haight said.
Some of the Chardonnay involved was sold under the name "A Connecticut Celebration of a Connecticut Vintage" and called a "Premium American Chardonnay," produced in conjunction with the launching of the U.S.S. Connecticut submarine in 1998 as a benefit for a Navy scholarship fund. That wine also may have contained 50 percent or more of foreign concentrate, Mr. Haight said.
Mr. Stitzer, the winery's winemaker and general manager from 1985 through May 1999, said the situation disturbed him.
"I thought it was so disgusting, and I couldn't live with the situation," he said.
So when the captain of the submarine came to the winery, Mr. Stitzer was reluctant to show him how the wine was made. "I refused to give the tour," he said. Mr. Stitzer resigned soon after and now is a wine consultant in Morris. The attorney general's office recently interviewed Mr. Stitzer about Haight's practices. 
Mr. Haight said the Navy was not deceived "because the Navy doesn't ask me how we make our wines. They expect us to provide them with wines that are up to standard, and we did that."
Mr. Blumenthal and the Consumer Protection Department have requested copies of the federal file and will investigate whether the findings, which the state said it was never told about, and Mr. Haight's admission are grounds for penalties for false advertising.
The State Liquor Control Commission will also investigate whether Haight has violated or is presently violating the Connecticut Farm Winery Act, which requires that at least 51 percent of a state winery's annual product derives from Connecticut-grown grapes. Some state wineries use grapes, not concentrate, from other regions to supplement their wines.
"If anything is found to be a violation of our statutes, the vineyard will be charged," Liquor Control Commission Administrator Jerry Langlais said. If so, Mr. Haight could lose his license. "The report will also be given to the fair trade practices investigators and attorneys, and they will review that."
Mr. Haight said he is not concerned. He said he complies with the Farm Winery Act and has "meticulous" records to support that.
Mr. Stitzer said he has doubts because minimal quantities of Riesling, Merlot, and Chardonnay grapes were harvested during his tenure. "During the time I worked there, we never harvested any Merlot that I know of," Mr. Stitzer said. "As far as Riesling and Chardonnay, a smattering of those grapes were picked, a couple of baskets, not enough to record as a varietal," a wine known by its grape's name. Mr. Haight said he had no comment on Mr. Stitzer's statement.
Mr. Haight said that over the last five years he has made frequent trips to Toronto to buy Chilean concentrate from a distributor, the Wine Village, an importer of concentrate.
"He comes here maybe eight times a year," Hiram Venegas, the owner, said in December . "He was here two weeks ago." Mr. Venegas said he also sells the concentrate to a handful of other wineries in the United States, including in New York and Michigan.
Mr. Haight said that starting this year, he would buy the concentrate from a California vineyard. That way, he said, he could have direct knowledge of the grapes and ensure their quality.
The Haight wines don't rate well with some critics. Two wine experts who recently tasted Haight's wines rated them as extremely disappointing and worth at best half their price tags. The Riesling sells for $9.98. The Merlot and Chardonnay each sell for $11.98.
Robert Chaplin, a wine critic and columnist who regularly tastes wines made from Connecticut's 15 vineyards, rates all three Haight wines as inferior. "It's pretty disgraceful. It's sad," he said, referring to both the use of concentrate and the quality of the wines.
The Riesling was "sweet without the acidity to balance it," Mr. Chaplin said. The Chardonnay was "bitter on the finish, a very unbalanced wine, not in the same league as other Chardonnays from Connecticut vineyards." The Merlot had a "metallic candy quality and a bitter finish."
Overall, Mr. Chaplin concluded, "These are incredibly low-end wines, not even generic wines."
Tad Drouet, a New York City wine consultant and Sommelier Society of America instructor and board member who tastes about 2,000 wines a year, also labeled Haight's wines as inferior. He described the Riesling as "fairly one-dimensional wine, the dimension being sweet. It's so sweet it's close to grape juice. I could pull three $8 to $10 German Rieslings that are far, far, far superior to this."
The Chardonnay was "fairly out of balance," Mr. Drouet said. "The acidity overwhelms everything else." The Merlot was "a very simple wine, a little more in balance than the other two, but it's short on the finish. The quality is pretty low," he said.
Mr. Chaplin attributed the problem largely to the use of concentrate. "You're never going to get the same qualities from a concentrate as you are from fresh grapes that are coming in, where the winemaker is selecting carefully through the grapes and is keeping an eye on things to get the optimum structure," Mr. Chaplin said. "That's the art of the winemaker."
The opinions of critics don't concern Mr. Haight. "They have wonderful palates. I agree with their findings, their comments, but they're so sophisticated that they represent a very small total of wine drinkers," he said. "I think the 800 people who come to our barrel tastings every year give us a far better feel for the wines that they like. And after all, they're our market." The tastings occur every spring and are scheduled for late March.
Mr. Drouet was troubled by the Haight labels.
"If the label says 'premium' wine and that it's produced and bottled by a Connecticut winery, and the grapes are from Chile, I personally find that deceptive," Mr. Drouet said, "especially if it makes no mention of this anywhere on the label."
Mr. Chaplin agreed. "Otherwise you're not being honest, really," he said. "You're pulling the wool over the public's eyes. Why are you saying you're a particular winery when this stuff could be made anywhere?"
Robert Parker Jr., publisher of The Wine Advocate, said label requirements should be toughened.
Revealing Mr. Haight's use of concentrate to make wines could negatively impact the reputations of other state wineries, Mr. Parker said. "It would have a very anti-quality effect," he said. "No wineries I have reviewed ever use concentrates. In European wine regions, it is illegal."
Mr. Vollweiler of the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association said he is also concerned about the state's reputation. 
"We're a young industry," he said, "and we don't need black and blue marks."

ON the corkboard above Beth Ann Bauman's desk, a washed-out photograph hangs from a tack: Ms. Bauman, age 2, stares out at the camera, her blue eyes stubborn and searching, her mouth pressed into a resolute line. "I love how stoic I look," she said, fingering the edge of the picture. 
 At 38, Ms. Bauman knows something of stoicism. Like so many young men and women over the years, she came to New York to be a writer. For the past decade, she has lived in a West Village studio and worked as an $11-an-hour temp to support herself, barely. She has watched her friends publish books, have babies, buy houses, get tenure. 
 She has spent her days sending faxes and watering plants for lawyers and junior vice presidents in the city's anonymous office towers, among them the World Trade Center, in a 105th-floor office of Cantor Fitzgerald where she worked until just a few days before the attack of Sept. 11. Her nights were spent at her desk working on draft after draft of stories about funny, smart young women, many of them New Yorkers, in various stages of life. 
Finally, those nights have paid off, and Ms. Bauman has become one of those few writers whose labors see daylight. Next month, her first book, a collection of stories titled "Beautiful Girls," will be published by MacAdam/Cage, a small San Francisco firm. The stories have been nearly 10 years in the making, a period in which Ms. Bauman has sacrificed much of her social and financial life. 
"I'm so consumed by this, by writing stories, by trying to arrive somewhere as a writer," she said. "Sometimes, when I look back on everything, on how long it took me to get where I am, I'm just overwhelmed."
In 1992, Ms. Bauman moved to New York to write a novel, armed with a master of fine arts degree, a dossier of stories praised by her professors and an unwavering belief in her own abilities. "I began temping because I don't have any skills," she explained. "Writing was it." 
A waiflike blonde, Ms. Bauman in person is rather like her stories. She moves around her little apartment like a slender cat, making cups of peppermint tea, laying out plates of cookies that she will not eat (refined sugar rarely passes her lips), pulling well-worn photographs from a carefully organized box of memorabilia. 
Outside her apartment, which is on Seventh Avenue near 14th Street, sirens wail and car horns blare. Ms. Bauman has learned to shut out the racket and enter the world of her stories, which she writes, at times, on her soft brown couch, a pad on her lap, clad in pajamas. 
Writing was the last thing her parents expected, or hoped, she would do to make a living. Ms. Bauman grew up in Metuchen, N.J.; her father was a police officer, her mother a secretary. A writing workshop at Richard Stockton College in southern New Jersey made her want to be a writer. After graduation, she moved back in with her parents, wrote stories and waited on tables. 
The following year, she entered Brooklyn College's master of fine arts program, didn't like it much and transferred to the University of Arizona. In 1992, after three years in Arizona, she moved to New York.
The novelistMary Elsie Robertson, Ms. Bauman's mentor at Arizona, had pegged her as one of the few who would make it. 
"At a place like Arizona, the students are all fairly talented," Ms. Robertson said, "but there was something really special about Beth's work. There was a quirky quality to it. But she also has that absolute persistence. She is a writer, she has to write and she will, at all costs."
Ms. Robertson didn't imagine, however, that it would be more than a dozen years before her prize student published a book. She assumed Ms. Bauman would follow the traditional route for M.F.A. graduates: publish stories in small literary magazines, land an agent, publish stories in glossy magazines, teach, publish a novel. 
Soon after Ms. Bauman's arrival in New York, that's the way things were headed. In 1994, she took a writing workshop with the novelist Michael Cunningham, a few years before "The Hours" propelled him to the upper echelons of literary fame. ("She clearly had a gift," Mr. Cunningham said recently of his student, "and she became a sort of monster of determination.") 
In class she met a Daily News reporter, Karen Avenoso, who was so taken with Ms. Bauman's work that she called an agent friend named Tina Bennett. Ms. Bennett, of Janklow & Nesbit Associates, later became famous for securing a $1 million advance for Malcolm Gladwell's book "The Tipping Point," but at the time she was pretty much of an unknown.
"I was just starting out then," Ms. Bennett recalled. "Karen said: 'There is this writer in the group who is just so much better than the others. You've got to take a look at her stuff.' Beth sent me her stories, and I loved them."
But short story collections are hard sells. Ms. Bennett told Ms. Bauman that she wasn't interested in taking on a collection, but asked her to send along the novel she was working on when it was done. 
"I called it 'the long thing,"' Ms. Bauman said with a laugh. "Tina would call and check in with me. She would say, 'How's that long thing coming?"'
The long thing never came to be. Ms. Bauman went back to writing stories, and author and agent mostly fell out of touch.

Poverty Becomes Less Cute
The years passed. Weeks and months blurred into one another: days at the office, nights at the computer. 
"Everyone around her was getting published first," said Alice Elliott Dark, the author of the much-praised story collection "In the Gloaming" and one of Ms. Bauman's teachers in a writing workshop. "I've seen this happen to a number of really talented people. It's very flukey."
Finally, in the spring of 2000, Ms. Bauman realized that she had enough new, strong stories for a collection. She called Ms. Bennett. "I didn't think she would want to see it," Ms. Bauman said, "but I thought she could put me in touch with someone who might. She surprised me. She said, 'Send it to me."' 
Ms. Bennett liked Ms. Bauman's stories as much as ever, but felt that the collection as a whole needed work: two of the stories didn't fit thematically with the rest. If the author would replace those stories, Ms. Bennett would try to sell the collection. 
Ms. Bauman got to work. Or tried to. At the time, she was working as a temp in the legal department of Cantor Fitzgerald. While she liked the job, temping was becoming increasingly draining, and she was finding it harder to write when she got home at night. She was 36. Poverty and instability no longer held quite the same charm. 
"When you're in your 20's and you're writing short stories, it's cool to be poor," said Sara Eckel, a freelance writer and a close friend of Ms. Bauman's. "Everyone's doing it. Then, at a certain point, people drop out. Because it's not much fun in your 30's. Suddenly your friends can go to dinner in nice restaurants and go skiing in Colorado. And poverty is just not cute anymore."
In the spring of 2001, while Ms. Bauman fretted over the new stories, Ms. Bennett sent Ms. Bauman's older stories to Bill Buford, then the fiction editor of The New Yorker, who was seeking stories for the magazine's debut fiction issue, devoted to previously unpublished writers. The stories made it to the fiercely competitive final rounds of the selection -- the short list of finalists had 200 names -- but didn't survive the final cut. 
Virtually all the chosen writers became superstars overnight, and for Ms. Bauman, the rejection was devastating. "I wanted it so badly," she admitted with a nervous laugh. "I had to really get over my disappointment, my damn disappointment." 
Ms. Bauman was still temping at Cantor Fitzgerald in August 2001 when an easygoing executive offered her a long-term assignment, working as his secretary. Ambivalent about making a commitment to something other than writing, she decided to finish her current assignment. The executive hired a temp to fill in. The temp did a great job. The executive decided to keep her on.
September 2001 found Ms. Bauman nearly broke and panicking. Her assignment at Cantor Fitzgerald was over, and the temp agency had nothing more for her. She e-mailed a friend at Cantor, telling him of her plight. You should come back and work for us, the friend replied. O.K., she said, O.K.
You know the end of this story: A few days later, the friend was killed, along with almost all the other co-workers in Ms. Bauman's department, including the woman who had accepted the job offered to her. 
"If I had taken that job, I would be dead," she said. "I knew so many people who died. I still can't wrap my brain around it. The sheer numbers. I think: Debby and Fred and Fran and Anna and Steve and Monique. The list goes on and on." 
As a long-term temp she found herself at once a part of the Cantor Fitzgerald family and an outsider, albeit one with a singular perspective on her co-workers' lives. 
"As a temp," she said, "you sit at people's desks and you take on their lives for a few days. You see their pictures. Anna had this 2-year-old boy. His photograph was her screen saver. I stared at it all day. I can still see it."

Heading West With $20
Before the Sept. 11 attack, Ms. Bauman had been awarded a fellowship allowing her to spend a month in a house in the tiny Minnesota town of New York Mills, where she could write in complete solitude. On Oct. 1, with $20 to her name, she got on a plane heading west.
The residents of New York Mills proved warm and friendly and interested, of course, in Ms. Bauman's experiences in New York. "She was just so quiet," said Heather Price, who runs the residency program. "My feeling was: 'Don't push, don't pry. This is someone who's very fragile."'
The break provided a brief respite. But back in New York, Ms. Bauman became overwhelmed, faced with the slowly recovering city, the sinking economy and her own tattered finances. In December, she went back to work as a temp at Cantor Fitzgerald in the firm's new office on Park Avenue.
She didn't have much choice. The market for temps had dried up after the attack. She took what she could get. Ms. Bauman avoided writing about Sept. 11 itself; yet her anger and sadness made her determined to finish those last two stories. She began writing and revising intensively, working around the clock. In March 2002, two full years after she had sent Ms. Bennett the collection and eight years after the two were initially in touch, she finished the new stories, titled the collection "Beautiful Girls" and sent them on. 
"Because I'd been working for so long in obscurity, when I sent her those last stories, I wasn't quite sure what she was going to think," Ms. Bauman said. "I wasn't quite sure what I thought. Two days later she called and said, 'We're ready to go."' 
Ms. Bennett sent the manuscript to a slew of editors, thinking that they would love Ms. Bauman's voice as much as she did. Editors did, in fact, love the book, but most were nervous about taking on a short story collection, no matter how charming and accessible. 
Toward the end of April, as the rejections piled up, Ms. Bauman's apartment was burglarized, and she lost, among other things, her laptop. Though she had copies of her stories, she didn't have renter's insurance, or money to replace her stolen belongings. 
The collection, she thought, had to sell soon. 
In August, the stories landed on the desk of Anika Streitfeld, a young editor at MacAdam/Cage, a hip San Francisco publishing house that was started five years ago as a showcase for literary fiction. It has made waves in the publishing world for its unusual business model: rather than handing out massive advances, the company spends up to $40,000 -- an extraordinary sum for a typical first-time author -- on marketing the book. 
The approach seems to work: A disproportionate number of the company's titles have been selected for Barnes & Noble's Discover series, Borders's Original Voices program and the prestigious BookSense 76, a list of recommendations from independent booksellers. Recent MacAdam/Cage hits include Mark Dunn's "Ella Minnow Pea," a lavishly praised epistolary novel, and Katherine Towler's "Snow Island," a novel set in New Hampshire during World War II.
Ms. Streitfeld said she read "Beautiful Girls" the day it arrived, proclaimed the stories "one little miracle after another," called Ms. Bennett and said, "I have to have this book." By Sept. 11, 2002, a deal had been worked out. Ms. Bauman grieved on the 11th, the anniversary of the attack, and celebrated two days later.

Hoping to Beat the Odds
Hundreds of short-story collections are published each year, and most sell, at best, only a few thousand copies. First efforts are especially risky. 
"I love short stories, but debut fiction tends to sell modestly in the first place, and debut collections tend to sell sub-modestly," said Michael Pietsch, publisher of Little Brown & Company. 
"Most readers are looking to settle into something deep," he added. "Usually what you -- the publisher, that is -- are selling is a story. You're persuading people that they're going to be drawn into this deep, complex narrative, in which they'll meet new and interesting chracters. It's much harder to do that when you're describing 12 discreet stories."
MacAdam/Cage is hoping that Ms. Bauman will beat the odds and that her book will appeal to the women who gobbled up "The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing," Melissa Bank's best-selling stories about a wisecracking young woman seeking love in the West Village. Ms. Bauman received only a modest $3,000 advance. But her publisher is planning a first printing of 16,000 copies of the book, whose cover features a slightly provocative photograph showing the legs of a young woman clad in slouchy, knee-high stockings. Sigrid Estrada, a star in the author-photograph firmament, took Ms. Bauman's picture. 
"We're putting more behind this book than any other book that we've ever published," said David Poindexter, MacAdam/Cage's publisher. "We're going to do anything and everything that makes any sense at all, short of standing on a street corner and screaming its praises."
Early response has been encouraging. Barnes & Noble placed a large order; women's magazines are calling about excerpts, and places like Barnes & Noble and the KGB Bar, the hip writers' outpost on East Fourth Street, have booked Ms. Bauman to read. The first advance review, from Kirkus Reviews, compared Ms. Bauman to Mary Robison and Grace Paley, calling "Beautiful Girls" a "powerful start." 
Most of the stories are about women 25 and under, slowly awakening to the world around them. In "Wash, Rinse, Spin," based loosely on the death of Ms. Bauman's father, a Manhattan lawyer makes daily treks from her pointless "no-job job" at an anonymous Midtown corporation to the New Jersey hospital where her father is dying of cancer, never quite finding the time to do her laundry. "Wildlife of America" follows an aging hipster who leaves her life in New York to "rehabilitate" at her sister's and brother-in-law's house in a suburban town, where she rides a bike, dates a local criminal and, ultimately, realizes she has to return to Manhattan, to her real life. 
"All of the characters are waiting for something," Ms. Bauman said. "They're all waiting for their lives to unfurl."
Which is, of course, exactly what she has been doing all these years.
"I have," she agreed eagerly. "I have been waiting, feeling trapped by my circumstances -- the day job, never having enough time to write, wanting something larger and more comfortable, a better life. Maybe not a better life, but just wanting to arrive somewhere."

EXCERPT
Village Girl
I either slept 12 to 14 hours a night or couldn't keep still. I couldn't bear to be in my apartment on Cherry Lane. I couldn't bear to sleep in my bed. I wrestled with the ancient two-ton sofa bed in my living room and finally managed to open it, but it had a powerful defective spring and sprang shut like a venus flytrap, capturing me in the mattress. I shimmied out, but every muscle in my body hurt for days.
I called in sick to work and bought stacks of magazines. I limped to Washington Square Park, furiously flipping pages but unable to concentrate. A pigeon flew up into my face, and I swatted it in the head with a copy of The Economist. I railed at Patty and Dean late at night, alone in my apartment. I handled the whole thing terribly; of course, terrible was my only option. Initially, I had our friend's sympathy but after a while I lost their company. Around the holidays a few friends told me I was a drag to be around. They told me I had to get over it already. "Easy for you to say," I spewed, feeling my words roil with something rank and foamy. "No one's saying its easy," they'd counter. Couldn't they see I'd been thrown to the ground and didn't know how to get up?

HEADLINE: The World: A Nation Unbuilt; 
Where Did All That Money in Bosnia Go?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina 

 BODY:
AS Western officials descended on Bosnia in 1996 to reconstruct a nation that was almost wiped off the map by its neighbors, the man in charge, Carl Bildt, withdrew $210,000 from a Brussels bank and carried the cash to Sarajevo in his briefcase to get started.
 Since then, billions of dollars have flowed into Bosnia, sustaining so many overlapping international missions that officials are unwilling to guess exactly how much has been spent to rebuild the economy. 
 Leaving aside the cost of stationing tens of thousands of NATO soldiers here over seven years (there are now fewer than than 20,000, perhaps 3,000 of them Americans), as well as humanitarian aid and the resettlement of a million refugees, the answer lies somewhere between an original World Bank target of $5.1 billion and about $15 billion, according to estimates by economists. How much came from Washington is unclear. 
If spent more effectively, critics of international reconstruction strategies argue, this money could have had a greater impact. But so many obstacles to development exist in Bosnia that few sustainable benefits can be seen yet, other than the absence of war and the gradual rebuilding of roads, power plants and other basics.
In the center of Sarajevo, which sustained a 43-month siege by Bosnian Serbs from 1992 to 1995, wartime scars are slowly disappearing, although more gutted homes are noticeable outside the city center.
But reconstruction consists of far more than rebuilding property, particularly in a country of smokestack industries and Communist central planning before its bloody separation from Yugoslavia ruined both of these mainstays of the economy.
Despite the return of many refugees to their prewar homes, Bosnia remains divided along its ethnic fault lines: split into two semi-autonomous halves by the Dayton peace accords, governed at all levels by unwieldy combinations of Muslim, Serb and Croat nationalists, and utterly reliant on international aid and oversight.
Paddy Ashdown, a British politician who last year became the fourth high representative of the international community -- effectively the Western powers' proconsul in Bosnia -- knows that his omnipotent office cannot be dismantled and the country left to fend for itself -- the ultimate goal -- without an overhaul of the economy. But with other missions to support, including the follow-up to a potential invasion of Iraq, international money and patience are running out.
"The whole economic recovery program that we're pushing through now is almost too late," Mr. Ashdown said. "We have three years to convert an aid-dependent economy into an export-driven one."
The strategy sounds straightforward: build a market economy based on the rule of law and privatize state assets to attract foreign investment that can create jobs. But in the words of Joseph Ingram, the World Bank's country director for Bosnia, "This is a tall order."
Having grown frustrated with the intransigence of elected local leaders, international officials now rely heavily on the high representative's powers to impose legislation. But this makes many reforms harder to carry out. Moreover, Bosnia has a heavy debt load and a ballooning trade deficit, making it hard for the government to become creditworthy by the end of the decade -- a target set by the international lending agencies on whom Bosnia now depends. "Unless they can attract new foreign investment at a rate of $250 to $300 million a year, then they're in trouble," Mr. Ingram said.
Retailers from neighboring Croatia and Slovenia have started to move into the Bosnian market. But investors from Western Europe see few incentives.
Given these drawbacks, many in Bosnia wonder what happened to all the money that poured in from countries eager to make amends for not intervening earlier to stop a war that claimed more than 200,000 lives.
"A lot of time and money has been wasted here on poorly coordinated projects that have done nothing to increase Bosnia's productive capacity," said Zarko Papic, an economist and prominent critic of international support strategies.
Aid often has its own agenda. Saudi Arabia, for example, has spent more than $500 million on humanitarian and religious projects. According to both Bosnian and foreign officials, the aim is to spread its rigid interpretation of Islam in a land where most Muslims are not conspicuously pious.
Meanwhile, international donors and lenders see no future in reviving rusting industrial works, unless private investors want to buy them. But without an influx of foreign capital, alternative sources of employment are difficult to find -- other than in what is euphemistically termed "the gray economy," which covers everything from smuggling electronics to not declaring employees to the tax authorities. Little wonder that young people line up outside Western embassies to seek a new life abroad.
There have been a few isolated successes, like an aluminum plant in Mostar that accounts for 25 percent of Bosnia's exports and keeps Mercedes-Benzes supplied with hubcaps. But other state-owned industries have been so neglected they can be sold only for a nominal fee.
HOPING to make inroads into an official unemployment rate of 40 percent, the World Bank and other international organizations are providing small loans to potential entrepreneurs. Yet even these recipients, who number more than 150,000, complain.
"The international community should have invested more in the factories," said Mehida Usanovic, a 46-year-old hair stylist who has taken out three loans, the biggest worth $5,000, to build up her Sarajevo salon. "Who's going to visit the hairdresser if they can't pay their utility bills?"
Mark Wheeler, who monitors Bosnia for the International Crisis Group, said: "We're really on the knife-edge now as to whether this experiment in putting a country back together will succeed or fail. As long as half the people here live in poverty, it will be difficult to deal with all the most intractable problems."

Some Dot-Coms Have Youth on Their Side

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The Internet bubble has burst, but survivors like eBay, Amazon and Yahoo may have reason to smile for years. They have done what retailers usually only dream of: build a base of young customers. 
 According to comScore Media Metrix, more than eight million Internet users ages 12 to 17 visited Yahoo sites in December, putting Yahoo in striking distance of AOL, the struggling Internet giant. Four million went to Google and 2.8 million to eBay. Even among children ages 2 to 11, those sites had heavy traffic, with a surprising 1.6 million going to eBay. 
Teenage Research Unlimited has found that teenagers use the Internet primarily for e-mail, but some also screen-shop. Thirty-nine percent like to look for things to buy and 12 percent have made purchases online. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Alta Journal; 
Mayor's Passion Is Protecting a Utah Ski Haven

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

DATELINE: ALTA, Utah 

 BODY:
He kept out the Olympics. He has kept out the snowboarders. And now, as the world seems increasingly full of uncertainty and doom, well, then, Bill Levitt will do his best to keep that out, too.
 Mr. Levitt is the mayor of this tiny silver-mining-turned-ski town -- population 400, skiing population 5,000 -- which sits above Salt Lake City at the highest reaches of Little Cottonwood Canyon, between the snowy pate of Mount Baldy and the imposing crag of Mount Superior. 
 Down in the Salt Lake Valley, the streets are named for their distance and direction from the Mormon temple. Up here, it is the Brooklyn-born Mr. Levitt who sets the compass. Because of its elevation, Alta gets more and fluffier snow than any ski area in the country, an average annual snowfall of 500 inches -- making it a developer's dream.
But in 33 years in office, Mr. Levitt has been the guiding force in keeping Alta Alta.
There are no high-rises here, almost no condominiums. What bars there are, in the town's five simple lodges, close by 11 p.m.; the only noise that bursts through the starry night comes from the guns shooting down avalanches. When the lift lines get too long, the operators slow the chairs to keep the 2,200 acres of slopes from becoming crowded. 
If all this runs counter to the economics of a faltering ski industry, it has earned Mr. Levitt the loyalty of local residents and generations of skiers who return here each year. And lately, Mr. Levitt, has been arguing that preserving Alta is not just about making a nice place to ski. It is about saving the kind of refuge the world could use more of.
"Lets face it, the world is going to hell in a handbasket," Mr. Levitt says, beginning a pitch he has made often over the last year or so. "So I tell people who come here: 'You're an Alta person now. When the world gets to be too much, you feel like you have to flee, you just come to the bottom of the canyon. We'll have your name on a list, we'll close the gates, we'll point the avalanche guns down the canyon. The bad guys won't come up after you.' "
He is joking, of course. But it is a sign of the national mood that people who hear this believe him, or want to. "My first thought was, 'Can our kids come?' " said Gayle Rothschild from Washington, D.C. With war looming, even Mr. Levitt says, "These days, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm prophetic."
And he is not joking about the importance of preserving this place of natural wonder, where Nabokov, according to legend, once discovered a kind of butterfly, where you can still spot ermine popping up from the snow.
Comfortably clear of the age to qualify for a free season ski pass, which is 80, Mr. Levitt has long defended Alta againstdevelopers. But he began thinking about the challenge differently after the attacks of Sept. 11, when a regular guest from New York called to cancel her annual Thanksgiving stay at the Alta Lodge, which Mr. Levitt bought in 1959. She had watched the towers collapse and could not bear to travel. She called again, two days before the holiday, to change her mind. Arriving, she pushed through the door of the lodge and collapsed in tears.
"That's when I started to realize, this is a haven for people," Mr. Levitt said. "It's important for people to have a place like this. This atmosphere gives people a chance to breathe -- in their minds, not just in their chests. When you wake up in the morning and there's fresh snow and the sun's coming out over Superior, it just makes you want to go out and yip," he said. "How many times in life can you do that?"
Alta opened as a ski resort in 1939. Mr. Levitt discovered it in 1954, in the way so many other people have. Someone suggested that if he really wanted to ski, he ski out west, and if he wanted to ski out west, the best snow was in Alta. "Where?" he asked, then, finding out, fell in love. 
Early in his tenure as mayor, he persuaded voters to reject a sewer system, which would have opened the town to development. Most decisions have followed in that vein: in the last decade, the town has cut the number of buses bringing skiers from the valley below to 5 a day from 50; it prohibited snowboarding, making Alta one of a handful of ski resorts that does so.
Before Salt Lake City could use tax money to bid for the 2002 Olympics, Mr. Levitt pushed for a state referendum that ensured no events would be held in this canyon or its twin, Big Cottonwood. And Alta has remained relatively affordable -- $40 a day compared with almost double that at other resorts.
"Alta is a a real local treasure, and there would be a huge uproar if it ever moved toward the classic ski resort development by out-of-staters," said Mayor Rocky Anderson of Salt Lake City. "We've got enough of those kind of places."
Mr. Levitt, too, has become something of a local treasure, blessed by Mormon leaders, honored by government associations across the state. He insists he will not step down until he spots a successor as passionate as he is about preserving Alta. "Everyone needs to escape from something, sometime," he said. "Even I do. But I'm a mayor."

HEADLINE: Economic Crisis and Vocal Opposition Test Bolivia's President 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia had to be smuggled out of the bullet-riddled presidential palace in an ambulance earlier this week as gunshots whizzed across the main square while looters rampaged through the historic heart of the administrative capital, La Paz. 
 By week's end, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada went on television to announce that "calm and peace have been restored throughout our national territory." 
 But as Bolivians took stock of the violence that gripped their nation -- 29 people killed, with government ministries and downtown businesses looted and set on fire in the main city, whose name means peace -- the fact is that Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's six-month-old presidency is in clear danger of collapse. 
The president's decision to withdraw plans for a tax increase, the ostensible spark for violent protests, only served to bring a tenuous peace. The roots of the problem, a deepening economic crisis and an energetic opposition, remain ever-present and signal more trouble for a leader who won the presidency with only 22.5 percent of the vote.
"He's got a big, serious problem," said Eduardo Gamarra, an expert on Bolivia at Miami's Florida International University who recently spoke with the president. "He has four and a half years left in his term. How is he going to last four and a half years?"
Indeed, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, 72, a former filmmaker and wealthy businessman who is known by the nickname Goni, is standing alone against an array of forces that makes governing nearly impossible.
On the left, he is dealing with the increasingly influential Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian and leader of a coca workers federation, who rails against free-market reforms while pushing for an end of American-backed eradication efforts of Bolivia's coca crops. To his right is the International Monetary Fund, which had called for belt-tightening measures that led Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's government to consider a tax that had little political support.
The president has had little room to maneuver, faced with trying to placate increasingly vocal and influential nationalists while trying to meet difficult requirements leveled on a poor country by international lenders. The situation was made even more combustible by an increasingly violent series of standoffs between the police and coca farmers in recent weeks that have led to several deaths.
Though Bolivia is isolated and poor, with just 8.3 million people, the ramifications are enormous if Mr. Sanchez de Lozada is forced out, because he is not the only president in Latin America facing politically destabilizing streets protests.
"I think this sets a very disturbing precedent," said Michael Shifter, who tracks Latin American politics for the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. "It is disturbing that when you have this kind of protest and violence that people can call for a president to step down. I don't think that's very helpful for democracy."
In Bolivia, though, there seems to be little sympathy for Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, who was the architect of the free-market reforms in the 1980's and was president from 1993 to 1997. Many there feel that those reforms, dictated from Washington, brought poverty, not prosperity.
"There has been an accumulation of frustration with the economic model," said Gustavo Luna, a researcher with a labor analysis group in La Paz. "They were left with no choice but to protest."
Meanwhile, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada faced politically difficult decisions after the International Monetary Fund called for the government to lower the country's deficit to 5.5 percent of its $8 billion-a-year gross domestic product from 8.6 percent. After failing to obtain the political support for a gasoline tax, the president then opted for an income tax. That move infuriated Bolivians, particularly the middle class, which is Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's only bloc of solid support.
To make matters worse, the country's police force had started to rebel because the government not only had failed to pay salaries in January, but had ignored demands for a 40 percent pay increase.
It still remains unclear what led to the violence that began Wednesday and rocked the country for two straight days. The government maintains that a conspiracy was at work. Many in Bolivia say it was simply a spontaneous outburst.
What is clear is that the violence, the worst since Bolivia's return to democracy in 1982, could not be contained. That raises questions about how the government could survive another outburst, which could well be brewing.
The president's opponents, including Mr. Morales, are demanding his resignation while some street protesters have resorted to demanding, "resign or die, those are your options."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Businesswomen Get Another Advocacy Group

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Linda McCabe learned that the two brothers who owned the auto glass company where she worked in Islip planned to dissolve the business. Having worked for others throughout her career, including the Long Island Association, where she marketed a health-insurance program for members, Ms. McCabe decided the time was right to go into business for herself.
 After the glass company closed, she opened a new company in the same location, handling the same work. She named the company American Patriot Glass, and she hired some of her old co-workers. Many customers probably never noticed the difference. Neither did bill collectors and lien holders, Ms. McCabe said, and they were not mollified when she told them she had no business connections to the old owners. 
 "I didn't realize there would be repercussions," she said. "Creditors were calling me, and people coming to me with liens all the time. People called me a carpetbagger. I had a hard time of it at first." 
She said that in hindsight, advice from a seasoned mentor would have prevented this misstep. Like her, other businesswomen have found that there is a shortage of role models and other women to turn to for advice. For this reason, Ms. McCabe was in Mineola last Tuesday for the announcement of the formation of the New York State affiliate of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. The Long Island chapter will be the first in the state. Ms. McCabe is the president of both the state affiliate and the Long Island chapter.
The state affiliate is the latest expansion of a national organization, which was formed in October 2001 by Margot Dorfman and Terry Williams, the publishers of a women's networking newspaper in Phoenix. The group, which is based in Washington and has eight state chapters, with about 1,500 members, is not connected with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The group seeks to bring successful women togetherand to encourage them to act as mentors to others. The chamber also helps its members to register their businesses as being owned by women, which paves the way for them to participate in certification programs aimed at expanding the number of women and minorities who bid on government and corporate contracts. 
Women's business organizations are nothing new on Long Island, of course. LIWomen.com, a Web site for professionals and entrepreneurs, lists more than a dozen such groups, including the Long Island Women's Agenda, which orchestrates the activities of the various groups to avoid redundancy and scheduling conflicts.
While a number of prominent women have agreed to serve as volunteers on the advisory board formed by Ms. McCabe, so far only three companies, including Ms. McCabe's, have joined as members.
The group's welcome may not be the warmest. "I don't know Linda McCabe, and I know everyone!" said Christine Sheahan, who publishes Networking Magazine from Westhampton Beach. It has about 23,000 subscribers, most of them women. 
Jane Gitlin, a founder of the Long Island Women's Agenda and a longtime advocate on women's issues, said of Ms. McCabe and her new group: "I wish her luck, but I see this as another way of fragmenting the women's market. Do we really need a women's chamber of commerce when we have organizations like the Women's Economic Developers of Long Island, the National Association of Women Business Owners, and the Long Island Center for Business and Professional Women, to name just a few?"
"The organization seems to lack a raison d'etre," said Ms. Gitlin, who published the Women's Business Record, in Greenvale, from 1975 to 1983. "It seems kind of superfluous."
Dana Friedman, the president of Women on the Job, an economic advocacy group in Port Washington, said that the region already had a number of organizations that seemed to address the same issues as the Women's Chamber of Commerce. "My hesitation is that we are already stepping on each other's toes trying to raise money," she said.
Ms. McCabe said that the Women's Chamber of Commerce was not interested in usurping the role of the region's well-established women's groups. "Everybody keeps asking me the same question, 'Why another women's business group?"' she said. "My question is, with all the chambers of commerce and all the business associations and all the women's groups, why are women still lagging behind when it comes to economic power and leadership influence and career advancement?" "We are not in competition with other groups," she added. "We want to bring people together and to leverage opportunities for women. Many members on our advisory board are active in all the other women's groups Ms. Friedman agreed that the issue of economic opportunities for women remains largely unresolved. For her, a particular area of concern is the paucity of women on corporate boards: among Long Island companies, the rate has held steady at about 4 percent for some years, she said. 
"That's very low, comparatively," she said. "At the level of the Fortune 500, the rate is almost 15 percent. In many ways Long Island is behind the times on the corporate level, in terms of awareness of issues that affect women."
"This is a very provincial environment in terms of human-resource policies, diversity and work-life balance," she continued. "That's a big part of the reason women go out and form businesses of their own. And women who are career-focused often leave the local work force and commute to Manhattan, which is far more progressive."
Despite the naysayers, othersbelieve that the Women's Chamber of Commerce will fill a niche. Mindy Ferrentino, the marketing director for Meyer, Suozzi, English & Klein, the Mineola law firm, and a board member of the Long Island Center of Business and Professional Women, said she joined Ms. McCabe's advisory board because the women's chamber serves unmet needs.
"The primary purpose of the Long Island Center for Business and Professional Women is to promote networking," she said. "The chamber is not a networking organization per se. Its function is to help businesswomen by focusing on the big issues, like finance, and becoming a leader in your field."
On a national level, the Women's Chamber of Commerce has focused on bringing in men as members and leaders, and the local affiliates are doing likewise, said Ms. Dorfman, the national group's co-founder and its chief executive.
Douglas Rowe, a partner in Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman,an East Meadow law firm, is a member of the Long Island chapter's advisory board. "I have a wife and two daughters, and any organization that promotes business skills for women is welcome from my perspective," he said. 
Lucy Rosen, a management consultant in Garden City who is also serving on the advisory board, said that Long Island can use a group like the Women's Chamber.
"If another park were being built, I don't think we would say, 'Does Long Island need another park?' said Ms. Rosen, who runs a Web group called Women on the Fast Track. "When a Thai restaurant opens, I don't think we ask if we need another Thai restaurant. If people use the park and go to the restaurant, that proves there is a need. I think there's a need for this group, too."

HEADLINE: Deals That Were Struck 

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
WHEN a company is offered benefits through Westchester County's Industrial Development Agency, public notice is given and a public hearing is held within 30 days. If the benefits are approved, the agency enters into an agreement with the company in which the firm leases the property to be bought to the agency and then the agency leases it back. This process enables sales tax and mortgage tax abatement, and also gives the agency a degree of control. The company signs an agreement to return certain benefits if it moves jobs out of the county during the period of the agreement. 
 County officials said that Texaco returned benefits it had receivedwhen it left Westchester in 2001 after merging with Chevron. 
 Here are some examples of companies and organizations that have worked with the Industrial Development Agency in the last few years, and the deals they have struck: 
Fortunoff was issued $70.95 million in taxable bonds by the agency for the purchase of the former Saks Fifth Avenue site in White Plains and the construction of 260,000 square feet of additional space. In addition, Fortunoff is eligible for up to $3.24 million in tax abatements. 
Fuji, in Mount Pleasant, was offered $540,000 in sales tax abatement over a period of five years. The company had been in Elmsford and was looking for new space in both New Jersey and Westchester. 
Datalan, an information technology company, was the first company to use the agency's small business benefit program, begun in 2001. It can receive $30,000 in sales tax abatement over the next five years.
Heineken USA received $250,000 in state and local sales tax relief for office equipment, furniture and fixtures after taking a new space in White Plains, instead of moving to Connecticut. 
The Masters School, a private school in Dobbs Ferry, was issued $17.65 million in bonds by the agency for construction of a science building, a gymnasium, dormitories and other renovations.
Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville was issued $4.5 million in bonds by the agency when it was created in 2000.

HEADLINE: Multiplication Problem 

BYLINE:  By CARIN RUBENSTEIN 

 BODY:
TO take advantage of every square inch of space, nearly all of the storage closets in the John Jay Middle School in Cross River have been converted to unventilated, windowless classrooms, where teachers disinfect surfaces daily with Lysol, to get rid of germs that have no way out. 
 In Irvington, 486 sixth, seventh and eighth graders are crammed into a middle school that was built in 1912 to hold about 300 students. The hallways are littered with notebooks, papers, broken pencils and backpacks that are too bulky to fit into the school's narrow, outdated lockers. Here, too, closets have been reinvented, and students buy school supplies out of a former storage closet for Spanish books, now a busy office that is 3 feet wide and 20 feet long. 
 And at the fortresslike Yonkers Middle and High School, which is almost as big as Bloomingdale's in White Plains, there is supremely synchronized chaos every 42 minutes, when all 1,900 students change classrooms. It is a process so complex, rehearsed and supervised that an assistant principal compares it to the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. 
This is Westchester County's largely unspoken secret: nearly every school district, large and small, well-financed or not, is struggling with the problem of seriously overcrowded schools. Many districts are responding to the crisis with expensive, locally financed construction projects, but the situation has taken on a new urgency since late January, when Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a state budget that would significantly reduce state building aid for schools.
During the last decade, 38 of the 40 Westchester school districts have had double-digit enrollment growth, according to figures collected by the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association. With the exception of the Greenburgh 7 and Tuckahoe school districts, average enrollment has risen 36 percent during this period, an increase not equaled since the early 1960's, much higher than the 6 percent that Westchester County grew between 1991 and 2001. "Most school districts in Westchester are experiencing overgrowth, growing faster than school facilities can accommodate," said Lloyd Bishop, an educational consultant who has been conducting demographic projections for school districts in the New York metropolitan area for more than 30 years. 
School enrollment is snowballing, he said, because of the baby boomlet of the 1980's, when the largest number of baby boomers began having children, and because Westchester's housing market attracts many families with young children. In addition, since Sept. 11, 2001, a small number of families has moved to Westchester from New York City, Mr. Bishop said.
As more families move to Westchester communities for the good schools, they add even more children to districts already burdened with too many students. In just about every district, where class size is negotiated as part of teacher contracts, more children mean more classrooms. So school boards have raised money to renovate old schools and build new ones, "since the residents are paying big taxes and quality education is the reason they moved there in the first place," Mr. Bishop said.
Indeed, school quality is a top priority for house hunters with families, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive officer of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. But although real estate agents always provide detailed information about test scores and class size, agents never provide information about overcrowding issues, he said.
Terrie Kaplan, office manager of Prudential Centennial Realty in Scarsdale, agreed that she never discusses school overcrowding with clients. 
"Scarsdale presells itself because of the reputation of the schools, and parents are predisposed to being very happy with it," she said. "In general, people feel that the Scarsdale schools are generally worth the taxes." What happens, though, when overcrowding leads to tax increases?
"There is building and bonding going on, and that has budgetary implications," Mr. Mercurio said.
There is no doubt that Governor Pataki's proposed budget to curtail education spending "will force school districts to raise taxes to meet students' needs," said Assemblyman Adam T. Bradley, a Democrat who represents the 89th District, which includes Katonah-Lewisboro, Harrison, White Plains, New Castle and Mount Kisco. Mr. Bradley, who characterized the proposed budget as "terrible on education," added that it unfairly shifts the taxpaying burden from New York State onto local school districts.
THAT prospect is enough to put rebellious thoughts into the minds of some taxpaying Westchester parents.
Eduardo Macial, 39, a systems manager for I.B.M., moved to Irvington with his wife and two children nine months ago, specifically because he had heard the schools were excellent. Paying more than $1,000 a month in school taxes, Mr. Macial said, "we don't live in a situation where we have endless pockets." If the school district can't figure out how to do more for less money, Mr. Macial said that he would consider moving to Greenwich, Conn. .
Other parents choose to stay put, but to send their children to private schools. "Our school district is getting alittle too overcrowded, making it difficult for children to get the individualized attention they should have," said Diana Harris, 48, an accountant in Goldens Bridge, who sent her 12-year-old daughter to the Harvey School in Katonah. Her 15-year-old son decided to stay in public school. Although the family pays $22,000 a year in taxes to the Katonah-Lewisboro School District, Mrs. Harris said it is worth the additional $18,000 in tuition for her daughter to learn in classes of no more than 10 or 12 children.
When school districts become overcrowded, communities usually vote to build and pay for new schools.
All 38 of Westchester's fast-growing school districts have applied recently for permits from New York State to renovate schools, to add portable classrooms or to begin new construction, based on records of the New York State Education Department's Office of Facility Planning. During the 2000-2001 fiscal year, local school districts spent $161.3 million on 76 such projects in Westchester County; in 2001-2002, the schools spent $291 million on 71 projects, according to Chuck Szuberla, coordinator of school operations in the New York State Education Department. School building projects hit a peak statewide last year, because New York State's building incentives were highest between 1998 and 2000, Mr. Szuberla said. Because it takes several years for approvals and contracts to be completed, there is a lag of several years, he explained.
The initiative to build in Irvington began five years ago, said Vincent T. Beni at the time he was named superintendent. Two years ago, Irvington residents passed a $47 million bond, and received 18 percent, or about $8.4 million, in building aid from New York State to be paid over 30 years. Although Irvington's first building aid payment from New York State is scheduled to begin this June, administrators expressed some doubt about whether it will happen, despite the fact that voter approval of the bond was based on the promise of state aid.
The district had no choice but to build, however.
"I've never seen school growth happen so fast, it's very scary," Mr. Beni said. The district's elementary school, which was originally built to hold 650 students, now houses 1,000 in kindergarten through fifth grade, making it the largest elementary school in the county, he said. Until the new middle school and the addition to the high school are completed -- expected to be this September -- elementary school students are being taught in nine portable classrooms. 
"Under Governor Pataki's proposal, there will be less money set aside for school construction," Mr. Szuberla acknowledged; he added, however, that the decrease should apply only to bonds approved by voters after July 1, 2003. 
Those with years of experience dealing with New York State education budgets remain skeptical about such promises. 
"I don't have a great deal of confidence in the state as a whole," said James Reese, the assistant superintendent for business in Irvington.
Although Briarcliff Manor voters approved a $36.8 million bond almost four years ago, Frances Wills, the schools superintendent, said that she expects to receive a cut of at least $300,000 a year in state aid for building costs, based on the proposed cutbacks. New York State had promised the Briarcliff Manor school district 40 percent building aid, or about $22 million, for the nearly completed additions to the elementary school and the middle/high school. But next year's school budget, she said, will probably have to allow for steep cuts by the state. 
Other districts, not as far ahead of the building curve, have received voter approval for a bond referendum, but have not yet begun construction. For them, building aid promised by the state is even more doubtful. 
In the Katonah-Lewisboro Union Free School District, for instance, voters passed a $29 million bond last June, on a second try, after being guaranteed 24 percent of the cost by the state. The plan assumes that the state will subsidize the district for about $7 million to expand the high school and the middle school, a project scheduled to begin this summer.
"There is limited money available for state aid for school construction projects, even those already approved by the public," said Robert Lichtenfeld, schools superintendent of Katonah-Lewisboro. "Our school district had a reputation as the hidden gem of Westchester County," he said of the 53-square-mile district. But even with all that open space and horse country splendor, the schools are bursting at the seams: Enrollment has grown 45 percent over the past 10 years, to 4,120 students.
That is why Gail Bergman teaches eight children in what used to be a storage closet for cleaning equipment. The room, which has no windows, has several fans "to get the air circulating, and we get some air if we leave our door open to the classroom next door," Mrs. Bergman said. Still, she said, "I'd rather have windows, because you need some air flow to perk things up." 
Because the Katonah-Lewisboro district approved a $44 million bond in 1995 to expand the schools, voters were distressed to find themselves asked to pay off yet another major loan only seven years later. The issue became so divisive that an attempt in February 2001 to pass a $50 million bond failed dramatically.
"People with grown children were quite angry, because they already pay a lot of money in taxes," said Mady Wengrover, 45, a Goldens Bridge mother of three who was a member of a school-sponsored bond-approval committee for the second bond attempt. "It took a lot of persuasion to make them see how desperately we need the extra space," she said.
IN the Scarsdale Union Free School District, which has grown 25 percent during the last decade, residents were faced with two large bond issues over a two-year period. In 1998, voters passed a bond for $18 million to build additions to several elementary schools, and in 2000, they passed another, for $59 million, to renovate the middle school and high school. At that time, the state promised the Scarsdale schools 24 percent, or $13.9 million in building aid over 20 years.
The new construction in Scarsdale, which is expected to be completed by fall of 2004, was essential, because "the front edge of the enrollment wave hit ninth grade this year, and we expect it to build over the next seven or eight years," said Dr. Michael V. McGill, the schools superintendent. But officials there said that they are uncertain about how much, if any, of the promised aid from the state will materialize.
There is no similar problem in the Rye City School District, because the superintendent did not include a provision for state aid on the $22 million bond issue passed last October.
"We did not count on any state aid, and we built in a reduction in aid to our budget for next year," said Edward J. Shine, the schools superintendent.
Most school districts in Westchester, however, do not have the luxury of dismissing the possibility of state aid. A few, like the Yonkers City School District and the Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns, have only now begun to consider the need for new construction. Such districts may have missed the best economic and political moment to reap state aid, said Paul Abramson, president of Stanton Leggett and Associates, an educational consulting firm in Mamaroneck. 
"New York State offered an extra 10 percent in building aid when Governor Pataki was campaigning to be re-elected," Mr. Abramson said. "But he doesn't have to run now, so this is the year our education governor is going to cut back on education." .
As a result, some school superintendents are reluctant to request community financing for school construction.
"Our schools have large hallways and are very, very crowded," said Angelo Petrone, interim superintendent in Yonkers, who noted that the average class size there is 28 or 29 children. The Yonkers school district has grown 39 percent over the last decade, and overcrowding has become a problem in many of its 42 schools.
Ideally, Mr. Petrone would build a new high school by next September, he said. But asking the city for a bond issue now is bad timing, he said. So the dream of a new school is on hold.
In Tarrytown, though, potential state cutbacks are not yet a deterrent.
"Right now, we're a month or two away from adopting a master plan to renovate and expand all of our school facilities," said Howard W. Smith, superintendent of the Public Schools of the Tarrytowns. This November, he will put a bond proposition up for a referendum, although he wouldn't estimate how much money the district will need.
Mr. Smith hopes that the state will provide aid for at least 17 percent of the cost of the new project, but even that will be "a far cry from large aid ratios in the past," he said. As an interim measure, the high school is switching to block scheduling next fall, and many students will take extended 90-minute classes, to accommodate increasing enrollment.
Ultimately, some of Westchester's school districts "are going to get left behind a bit further, because they don't have the political clout and they don't have the wealth," to build new schools, Mr. Abramson said. "This is not education, this is politics." 

How Tax Bills Vary
The amounts of school taxes that homeowners in Westchester County pay can vary considerably, depending on the assessed value of their homes, and most important, where they live. 
In Scarsdale, for example, the average annual school tax for a homeowner is about $12,600. But it ranges from a low of $3,700 to a high of about $83,700 a year, according to Nanette Albanese, the village assessor. 
In Bronxville, where school enrollment has increased 43 percent in the last decade, school taxes average about $16,700, but range from about $1,170 to $20,1000, according to Robert Fels, the village treasurer. 
Residents of Rye pay school taxes of $8,945 on average. But school taxesrange from a $3,350 to $40,200 a year, according to Robert Walsh, the assistant schools superintendent for the Rye City School District . 
I In the town of Ossining, the average school tax is $4,200, according to Gloria Fried, receiver of taxes for the town, but the tax ranges from $2,400 for newly built moderate-income housing to $97,800 a year for a 97-acre estate. CARIN RUBENSTEIN

The Art of the Lure

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
WHEN a company is considering a move to Westchester, the county's Industrial Development Agency will likely be deployed. Agency officials sit down with company officials, possibly the power company and others and hammer out financial packages designed to induce companies to relocate jobs here. The inducements can amount to any combination of millions of dollars in tax breaks, deals on energy, loans at low rates, help in applying for grants, good deals on public transportation for workers, bond financing and sales tax abatement on equipment. 
 Two weeks ago, the county offered the New York Life Insurance Company incentives worth $1.7 million to move 1,000 workers into the county. Last week, the company signed a tentative agreement to buy the 383,000-square-foot Mount Pleasant Executive Center in Mount Pleasant. 
 The list of companies that have received help from the Industrial Development Agency reads likes a who's who of big, medium and small local corporate residents, as well as nonprofit organizations. It includes Morgan Stanley, Allied Irish Bank, Heineken USA, the Pepsi Bottling Group, the Jacob Burns Film Center, the Winward School and Purchase College. The agency works to keep companies in the county too, working out deals that offer incentives for companies that are thinking of moving to stay put. 
The seven-member agency, based in the County Office Building in White Plains, is a county-sponsored public benefit corporation that was created by the State Legislature in 1977, and officials say it has been in high gear lately. They credit its fast pace of incentive-giving for the county's low unemployment rate. Not so long ago, they point out, the county was overly reliant on several large corporations, like I.B.M. and Texaco. 
"The I.D.A. has been very aggressive and the incentives have been a tremendous factor in turning around the economy," said County Executive Andrew J. Spano, referring to Westchester's low unemployment rate. "We've maximized benefits for a lot of companies with sales tax breaks for equipment, energy savings and help with bonds. It has created more jobs locally."
Deals like those with New York Life and Morgan Stanley, which, with agency help, recently agreed to buy the former Texaco world headquarters in Harrison and move 2,000 jobs there "have been the events," said the agency's executive director, Theresa G. Waivada, "but we also do a lot with smaller companies that bring in 50 to 100 jobs." 
But in an age of constricted budgets and high residential property taxes, critics complain that the process of offering incentives to business is wasteful and biased toward the powerful. "Some call it economic development," said State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky. "It's also called a handout." 
Mr. Brodsky added that incentives, the effects of which were impossible to measure, usually go to the richest and most powerful companies, those with the clout to demand it. "It's corporate socialism at a time when we are begrudging a welfare mother adequate care," he said. 
Mr. Brodsky is also critical of what he sees as the arms-race nature of such inducements. Westchester has an industrial development agency, but so do most localities. "These incentives pit city against city, state against state and region against region," he said. "It's geographic blackmail, and no one has the courage to stop the cycle." 
But Mr. Spano waves away such criticism. "Critics say it's corporate welfare," he said, "but we get jobs out of it." 
When the county attracts batches of new workers, said Mrs. Waivada, the benefits are immeasurable. "Think of all that shopping, the lunches, right down to the newspapers they buy," she said. "They are always paying sales tax, which is distributed to the municipalities and schools." She also pointed to the benefit of increased local job opportunities for working parents, who might prefer working closer to home than in New York City and also observed that the housing market stands to gain when a portion of the workers transferred to Westchester look for houses nearby. 
Mrs. Waivada said that when an office building sits vacant, its tax assessment goes down, meaning residents ultimately have to pay more, a thought echoed by Kevin Barry, a computer network consultant who lives in Somers. "When an I.B.M. and Texaco leave, my taxes go way up," he said. Nevertheless, Mr. Barry added, "it all has to be done carefully," so as not to be wasteful. 
Mrs. Waivada said that almost all the companies the county loses are ones that merge or are acquired, as in the cases of Texaco and Prodigy. 
Not all companies look to the county when they are considering a move. When the Entergy Corporation was considering buying the Indian Point nuclear plant, "there was discussion of going to the I.D.A. as a mechanism to set up tax agreements," said Jim Steets, a company spokesman. But the company instead went straight to the municipalities and school districts to cut deals, which entailed larger tax payments upfront that would dwindle as time went on. "We came in and, of course, had to figure out what to do about taxes," Mr. Steets said. "There are a lot of ways to do it, but it mostly boils down to negotiating what your taxes should be." 
"In the end this is all about competition," said Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University. "States are in competition with each other, cities are in competition with each other and counties are in competition with each other. Is it worth it to pay a dolloar to have a big company stay? Yes. Is it worth it paying $10 billion? Probably not. Somewhere between $1 and $1 billion is the answer, so you better have smart officials."
But is all this competition beneficial? That is totally dependent on the deal that is cut, Mr. White said. Those done to attract sports teams, for example, have not worked. "Sports teams are not tourist magnets," Mr. White said, "so they attract revenue but just at the expense of the local movie theater or local restaurant. It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul." 
Plenty of other deals are a net gain, he added, bringing in jobs and filling the streets with workers who throw off many times the cash the government offered up front.

A New Yankee Remembers a Legend

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
When Roger Clemens leaves the Yankee Stadium bullpen after warming up before a start, it is part of his ritual to rub Babe Ruth's plaque for good luck. Clemens and Ruth have much in common -- as former Red Sox, after all -- but Ruth died years before Clemens was born.
 One new Yankee does not have to imagine a man on a monument. Chris Hammond was a friend of Joe DiMaggio's, which might say a lot about Hammond. DiMaggio, the Hall of Famer and one of five Yankees with a monument in his honor, was famously reclusive and guarded. 
 Hammond, who replaces Mike Stanton as the Yankees' primary left-handed reliever, was able to break through. When Hammond pitched for the Florida Marlins, he volunteered at the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. He impressed DiMaggio with his unassuming, regular-guy manner, and the two became friends. 
"When I walk into a room, I don't make it known that I play baseball," Hammond said. "I'm quiet. I think he kind of liked that. I don't know -- I didn't do anything to make him dislike me."
Before he met DiMaggio on a visit to the hospital, Hammond had been warned to be careful around him. But a mutual friend introduced them, and DiMaggio warmed to Hammond instantly. Hammond and his wife, Lynne, spoke easily with DiMaggio, "just like we were friends, not like I was asking him a thousand questions," he said.
Hammond pitched for the Marlins from 1993 to 1996 and again in 1998, the year before DiMaggio's death. The two had gone to dinners, and Hammond has a keepsake of their relationship. On a signed photo of the two of them, DiMaggio thanked Hammond for their time together.
Now Hammond is playing for DiMaggio's team, the latest stop in a baseball career that seemed finished a few years ago. He thought about the connection before signing his two-year, $4.8 million deal.
"I think it'll mean a lot more once the season starts, when I can get out there and see the things that he's done and the plaques," Hammond said.
The Yankees gave Hammond that chance based on what their scouts saw last season, when he turned in one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a reliever. Pitching for the Atlanta Braves, Hammond did not allow a run after June 28. In 63 games over all, he went 7-2 with an 0.95 earned run average. He became just the third pitcher since 1900 to have a sub-1.00 E.R.A. while pitching at least 70 innings.
The Yankees evaluated several relievers for Stanton's spot, including the former Met Mark Guthrie and Stanton himself. They presented the pitchers with the same offer, which Guthrie and Stanton turned down. Hammond accepted.
"We liked all three, and it kind of came down to an economic deal," said Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president who was instrumental in the signing. "Of course, this guy had the best year of all three."
It was a dream season for Hammond, 37, especially considering what preceded it: a year in the minors and two full years, 1999 and 2000, out of baseball.
Hammond had undergone elbow surgery in 1997, when he pitched for Boston, and with his velocity waning, he struggled the next season. When the Marlins sent him to Class AAA, Hammond took the rest of the year off to be with his wife, who was pregnant.
Another baby came the next year, and Hammond decided that was it for baseball. He retired to his 220-acre farm in Wedowee, Ala., the Southpaw Ranch, and enjoyed life.
"At some point, you feel you've had all you want, and he kind of reached that point: he'd had all he wanted," said Sammy Dunn, Hammond's coach at Vestavia Hills high school in Birmingham, Ala. "He had started a family, and the baseball life had just gotten old. He'd made enough money to have a good life, not an elaborate one.
"When he came back, everybody thought it was for money. It wasn't about that. He just missed it so much, and he told me he wanted his kids to see him play."
It was like something from the movie "The Rookie." Hammond went two years without picking up a baseball before starting to throw in the fall of 2000. He had stuffed all his old gear in a box in his attic, and his three children -- all born since 1996 -- had no memories of his career. When Cleveland signed him to a minor league deal in March 2001, their lives changed.
"I've been at home with them their whole lives," Hammond said. "They're like, 'What are you doing, Dad? Where are you going?' "
Hammond was going places. He split the year between Buffalo and Richmond -- in the Braves' system -- and struck out more than one hitter an inning despite a fastball that never touched 90 miles an hour. The reason was simple: Hammond has a killer changeup.
Hammond has thrown the pitch since he was 10. It got him to the majors with Cincinnati in 1990, and brought him back a decade later.
"Very few pitchers really want to throw the changeup," Hammond said. "I was talking to John Rocker a few years ago about it: 'If I were you, I would sit down and that's all I'd do in the off-season, work on my changeup.' And he goes, 'I can't. If I'm going to get beat, I don't want to get beat on my changeup.' "
Hammond was incredulous at that logic. For him, the changeup is a devastating weapon, evaluated at a score of 80 -- the highest possible -- by the Yankee scouts. 
"It has different action on it," Newman said. "He has great arm speed and command of it. The funny term people use for it is the 'Bugs Bunny change,' because it's like it stops in midair. It's so good he throws it to left-handers and right-handers."
Hammond held right-handers to a .206 average last year, and left-handers were more helpless, batting .174. He delivers his changeup awkwardly, stomping hard on the mound with his right foot and then releasing it. The harder he stomps, the more he is concentrating. 
"It looks funny," Newman said, "but more importantly, hitters think it looks funny."
The Yankees' bullpen is stuffed with hard throwers -- Mariano Rivera, Steve Karsay, Antonio Osuna -- and Hammond gives them a different look. As it is with all newcomers, he must prove he can handle the pressure of being a Yankee. But wherever he is, Hammond said, he will always be nervous. 
"I get nervous every game, no matter where we're at," he said. "If you don't get nervous, if you don't get butterflies, you shouldn't pitch. If you're not waiting for that phone to ring, you might as well retire."
Hammond retired once, but it did not take. When the call comes for him this season, he will exit toward the Yankee Stadium field through Monument Park. If Hammond is superstitious, he can always call on an old friend for good luck.

INSIDE PITCH
Reliever STEVE KARSAY, who had back surgery in November, threw off a mound for the first time on Saturday and felt no stiffness. He said he was not concerned about being ready for opening day. "The way my body feels now, no," Karsay said. . . . If JOSE CONTRERAS seems ahead of the other pitchers, he has a reason. "I've been throwing for three months," he said through an interpreter. "I'm ready for games right now." Contreras, a Cuban defector, has an unusual style of warming up. Before throwing his fastball, slider and splitter, he practices each with a softball and a weighted baseball. Throwing with a softball, Contreras said, makes a baseball feel smaller. Throwing with the heavy ball -- which weighs 12 ounces, more than twice the weight of a regular baseball -- makes it feel lighter. But catchers must beware. "If that ball hits their shin, it'll break their bone," he said.

HEADLINE: Fees, as Surely as Taxes, Will Rob the State of Jobs, Critics of Pataki Budget Say 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
In a letter accompanying the budget plan he released last month, Gov. George E. Pataki upheld the importance of jobs and vowed his proposal "preserves promised tax cuts and avoids job-killing tax increases," so that businesses will stay in New York and flourish.
 But after reading the fine print, some lobbyists, lawmakers and labor and business leaders said they have found a contradiction: the budget is less business friendly than it may first appear. 
 While the governor has avoided calling for across-the-board corporate or income tax increases, he does propose $1.4 billion in new fees and surcharges that would hit the insurance and health care industries hard, and affect other businesses like tire sales and nuclear power. Advocates for those industries, and some lawmakers, said it would raise the cost of doing business here, perhaps resulting in job loss or even the flight of businesses from the state. 
The complaints are part of the negotiation process that goes on after a governor's budget is introduced and the Legislature is about to put its stamp on the annual spending plan. But the fees are the biggest boost of new revenue in a budget proposed to close a cumulative $11.5 billion gap.
A large chunk, or about $400 million worth, are levied on the insurance industry, with the governor proposing, among other things, a $52 million to $117 million increase in surcharges on policies for auto insurers; a $35 million increase in assessments on state insurers to pay for an increase in the state's Insurance Department budget, and millions more in increases on the surcharges that health plans must pay.
"Despite his facile rhetoric condemning job-killing taxes, the governor's budget adds over $400 million in taxes, assessments, fees and mandates on insurers of all types," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan who is the insurance committee chairman. "As sure as night follows day, insurers will pass these new costs on to consumers."
Mr. Pataki's proposed menu of surcharges also includes a $400,000 increase in the annual fee paid by nuclear plant operators; that is estimated to raise $2.4 million for the state. Another proposal would add a $2.25 fee for every new tire sold, raising $45 million.
As for the health care industry, the budget not only cuts Medicaid, which reimburses providers of medical services for the poor, it also temporarily reinstates charges on hospital revenues, to raise $192.2 million, and on home care services, to raise $17 million. Each would be reduced by 25 percent annually and phased out by 2007, according to the plan.
"I am not going to say to you that it is the budget I would have crafted," said Mark P. Alesse, director of the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 1.3 million small businesses in New York. "If I had drafted it, it would have cut spending more dramatically and I would not have included anything that would have increased the cost of insurance."
In proposing a $90.8 billion spending plan that slightly shrinks the size of state government, the governor has pledged to fight against efforts to "tax our way back to fiscal health." In a series of speeches made in the week before the budget was released last month, he repeatedly said that raising taxes to balance the state's books would cause businesses to flee New York. In fact, he vowed to cut taxes further to attract businesses.
The governor's goal, said past and current advisers, is to create a fiscal climate in New York that allows business to flourish, thus pulling the state from the economic doldrums that created the budget gap. The actions Mr. Pataki is proposing for the next fiscal year, which begins April 1, will enable the state to spend on programs later, the advisers said.
Further, they said, the governor's budget includes a sweetener for the insurance companies, even as it seeks more money from them. The governor has offered an additional $125 million in tax credits for insurance companies that provide funding for new small companies in the tech and biotech fields, officials said.
But officials in the health care and insurance industries say they are the economic engines of the state, accounting for some one million jobs in the state's work tforce of eight million, according to the latest statistics available from the state's Labor Department. Driving up their costs will further depress the economy by forcing them to lay off workers and pass costs on to consumers, they argue.
For the health care industry, the combined impact of increased fees and $500 million in Medicaid cuts would have a devastating economic impact, industry representatives said.
"It is safe to say that these cuts would close hospitals," said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
Craig M. Burridge, the executive director of the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York, said that the budget cuts would cause 1,500 independent pharmacies to close and prompt the loss of 12,600 jobs in the field, mostly in New York City.
An analysis by aides to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver found that the cuts to Medicaid would lead to the loss of 38,000 jobs overall in health care.
"The budget is not business friendly in the context of the health care industry, which is the largest industry in the state, in terms of jobs," Mr. Raske said.
"I think that the governor is totally sincere in his mind about the need to grow jobs," he said. But, he added, the government funding formulas for health care are so complicated that the impact of Mr. Pataki's budget proposals is more severe. 
Some in the insurance industry are withholding their criticism, hoping to negotiate a deal with the governor and Legislature to spare the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in new fees.
Still, Thomas E. Workman, the president of the Life Insurance Council of New York, a nonprofit trade association, said he was perplexed by the budget.
"We really do believe it was not thought through to fully understand how it would impact us, especially the companies based here in New York," he said. 
"Some of our larger members are household words or household names," he said. "They are gems for this state and we want to foster their success; we want to encourage their success, not unintentionally impair their success." He added: "I have tried not to say that we are going to pick up our marbles and go away. That is not what you say when you are looking for relief or some more reasonable proposal."

A Fountain of Youth Between the Lines

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The first week of last month was eventful for Major League Baseball's seniors class. On the same day, David Cone and Edgar Martinez turned 40. Within the next few days, Jeff Fassero and Norm Charlton joined them.
 When Cone celebrated his baseball-significant birthday, he had no idea he would be in spring training. He is certainly not alone. In fact, he and his birthday mates are not close to being the oldest players in the major leagues. 
 That distinction belongs to Jesse Orosco, who was six months away from his 30th birthday when he struck out Marty Barrett for the last out of the 1986 World Series. Sixteen years later, he is still striking out hitters (22 in 27 innings last season). 
Orosco, a left-hander, is 45 but will turn 46 as a member of the San Diego Padres bullpen when the coming season is 3 weeks old. The next-oldest player under contract is named Franco, but is his first name John or Julio?
John, the Mets' relief pitcher, is 42. Julio, who is back with the Atlanta Braves after batting .284 in 125 games last season, is 41 or 44, depending on which book you believe. Players, especially those from the Dominican Republic, have been known to make themselves younger before they begin playing professionally, but Julio Franco seems to have made himself younger after he began playing in the majors.
The Philadelphia Phillies' 1982 media guide lists Franco's birth date as Aug. 23, 1958. He was traded to Cleveland after that season, his first, and when the 1983 season began, the Indians' guide listed his birth date as Aug. 23, 1961. Just like that, Franco was 3 years younger.
The guides of the teams he has since played for have maintained the younger age, but baseball encyclopedias list him as the older Franco.
Rickey Henderson is 44, but he is also unsigned. Although no one seems inclined to sign him, he has been unemployed before and has wound up with a job. Mike Morgan, 43, also continues to unsuccessfully seek employment.
Next on the list of employed seniors are Andres Galarraga and Dan Plesac, who are 41. Galarragawill be in the San Francisco Giants' spring camp with a minor-league contract, but Plesac began his spring training Friday as a Phillies relief pitcher with a $2 million salary.
The Seattle Mariners have three 40-year-olds, two of whom will play critical roles. They retained Jamie Moyer, one of their most effective starting pitchers, with a three-year, $15.5 million contract, and Martinez, their most valuable hitter, with a one-year deal that will pay him $4 million in salary and possibly another $4 million in bonuses.
They also brought back Norm Charlton, a left-handed reliever, with a minor-league contract.
The Yankees' Roger Clemens, who turned 40 last August, then signed a $10.1 million contract, needs 7 victories to become a 300-game winner. Cone, who last week signed a minor-league contract with the Mets, will try to win the job as their fifth starter and needs 7 victories for 200. 
Fassero is another of those left-handed relievers who seemingly have lifetime jobs; he will work for St. Louis under a $1.5 million salary.
Randy Hendricks said his 40-year-old client, Chuck Finley, "fully intends to play in 2003," but he has not signed to pitch with anyone. Pat Rooney said his 40-year-old client, Dennis Cook, a longtime reliever, would like to play, but he continues to rehabilitate his left shoulder and work on resolving a family issue. 
"But I'm trying to get a job for Paul Assenmacher," Rooney said, referring to the left-handed reliever, who has not played the last two years. At 42, Assenmacher is almost a youngster compared with Orosco.
Orosco is nearly 5 years older than the man who gave him an $800,000 salary for this year. Why did Kevin Towers do that?
"I hadn't had much of an opportunity to see him pitch when he was with Baltimore," the Padres general manager said, referring to the stretch Orosco did with the Orioles from age 38 through 42. "You look at his age and say no interest, but when he pitched for the Dodgers, I saw why people kept giving him a chance to pitch. He kept getting major league hitters out." 
Towers said he never liked to see Orosco enter a game in the late innings if the Padres had one of their left-handed hitters, Ryan Klesko or Mark Kotsay, coming up.
"It would be difficult to get the big hit we needed," he said.
The key to Orosco's effectiveness, Towers said, is using him correctly. Last year he pitched only 27 innings in 56 games for Los Angeles, meaning he averaged slightly less than one and a half outs each appearance. The last time his innings pitched was a higher number than his games pitched was 1990. 
"He's a true situational lefty you use for a couple left-handers, then get him out of the game," Towers said. "We don't look to use him more than an inning. We'll bring him in to face Shawn Green or Luis Gonzalez or Larry Walker. With his experience and the angle of his pitches and his ability to locate, we felt we needed a guy like that."
His condition has enabled Orosco to continue pitching well into his 40's.
"He's probably in as good shape as guys 10, 15 years younger," Towers said. "He's been in San Diego going through our off-season conditioning program. He was the first to arrive and the last to leave. He's in tremendous shape."

Just Hanging On
David Cone is one of 72 players who have played for both the Mets and the Yankees. If he wins a job with the Mets, he will become the first to play for one of the New York teams, then the other, then go back and play for the first team.
In agreeing to play for $550,000 if he makes the team, Cone is also an example of the players who have earned a lot of money in their careers and now put their egos aside to continue playing. 
Terry Mulholland signed for $500,000, Roberto Hernandez and Wil Cordero for $600,000 each.
Among other players who have agreed to minor-league contracts, Lee Stevens, Pete Harnisch and Pat Mahomes would each have a $400,000 salary; Andres Galarraga, John Valentin, Dave Burba, Mike Fetters, Norm Charlton, Ron Villone, Rickey Bottalico, Mike Jackson, Charles Nagy, Carlos Baerga and Keith Lockhart $500,000 each; Jay Bell and John Vander Wal $550,000 each; James Baldwin $575,000; and Julio Franco, Alex Ochoa and Ruben Sierra $600,000 each.
"There are guys who would walk away, but others love it enough where at this stage in their lives it's not about economics; it's about showing they can still play and enjoy the game and stay young," the agent Arn Tellem said. "They can make decisions based on their desires and what they want to do with their lives."

It's the Pitching, of Course
When teams change managers, it is not always because the next guy can do it better, though that is the explanation given.
For example, commenting last week on his replacement of Jerry Narron with Buck Showalter, the Texas Rangers' owner, Tom Hicks, said, "The culture in the clubhouse for the last three years hasn't been good."
If Hicks was watching closely, he would have seen that it was the Rangers' pitching that was not good. Pitching, not culture, wins games. 
In 2000, the Rangers had the worst pitching staff in the league, but Hicks that off-season spent a lot of his money on Alex Rodriguez, and the next season the Rangers again had the league's worst pitching, this time with an even higher earned run average. The pitching improved to No. 12 last season, but the staff earned run average still exceeded 5.00.
No amount of culture will overcome those performances, no matter who the manager is.
In the clubhouse of an even worse team, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Lou Piniella has replaced Hal McRae as manager and, on the first day of spring training promised that the team would play hard and aggressively, as if the Devil Rays had played lethargically under McRae.
McRae was one of the most aggressive, intense players of his era. He did not become soft when he became a manager.
The Devil Rays lost under McRae for the same reason they lost under their first manager, Larry Rothschild: they have been a bad team.
They will continue to be a bad team under Piniella because they have been constructed poorly, changing plans two or three times in their five-year existence. The only difference between Piniella and McRae will be their salaries. The Devil Rays are paying Piniella a lot more to lose than they paid McRae.

HEADLINE: Doctors Plan Rally Over Malpractice Bills 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON 

 BODY:
DR. HENRY E. JACOBS is a desperate man. He is desperate enough to make a house call to the State Capitol on March 26, dressed in his white lab coat, along with hundreds of his colleagues. He is asking for reforms that may reduce his soaring malpractice insurance rates.
 The Connecticut State Medical Society is calling the event its "White Coat Rally," the first of various moves that will put doctors in a place they have long struggled to avoid: the spotlight. But now the spotlight has begun to look like just the thing they need. 
 The event is not a walkout, not a strike, medical society spokesmen throughout the state say, carefully avoiding the terminology used in recent physician work stoppages in West Virginia, New Jersey and Quebec. Indeed, while the doctors gathering in Hartford that day won't be working, other doctors are expected to fill in for them.
The state medical society has held a Doctors' Day for years at the State Capitol, and doctors have trickled in to testify before the General Assembly's committees. The past several years have often seen them sitting before committees on insurance and real estate, public health, and the judiciary, asking for tort reform for medical malpractice. This year, they want more than a chat.
The Fairfield County Medical Association expects about 500 of its doctors to attend. Hartford and New Haven County were still waiting for attendance figures from their doctors. "Your participation in this event is critical," says a message to members on the Web site of the Connecticut State Medical Society
The society said that malpractice insurance premiums have risen 30 percent for obstetricians over the last year, to $125,000 a year; 72 percent for neurologists, to $30,000; 30 percent for neurosurgeons, to $125,000, and 55 percent for family doctors and those in internal medicine, to $21,400.
The society is seeking legislation that caps pain and suffering awards in malpractice lawsuits. The issue has been misrepresented to the public, said Tim Norbeck, the executive director of the medical society. The group does not want limits on economic damages such as lost wages, medical expenses for the present and future, home health care and other costs. "But the pain and suffering part, that has to be capped," Mr. Norbeck said. "The cap will arrest the growth of premiums and stabilize the system. The floor and the ceiling have come together here and doctors are being crushed."
Many hospitals, including Yale-New Haven, Bridgeport and Hartford, said that emergency rooms would be fully staffed on March 26 and that doctors were arranging for coverage in their offices for Doctor's Day. 
"We neither condone nor condemn this action," said Lee Monroe, a spokeswoman at Hartford Hospital. "We are sure patient care will not be disrupted, and the E.R. will be fully staffed."
Bridgeport Hospital and Yale-New Haven were still trying to determine if Doctors' Day would prove a popular event for their doctors. "We are adding extra emergency department staff to handle any possible increase in volume," said John Cappiello of Bridgeport Hospital. "It could be a huge problem, or it might not be a problem at all." 
"We don't expect any impacts on patient care here," said Mark D'Antonio of Yale-New Haven. "But it's a month away."
Physicians such as Dr. Jacobs will look to colleagues to fill their shoes for the day. Dr. Jacobs is what is termed a "solo practitioner" in Hartford, and he is angry over the malpractice insurance issue. He is getting by this year, he said, and he may get by the next, but after that, he isn't so sure. He said many doctors are just quitting.
"These are desperate times and the public is underestimating it," he said. "This will be a major access issue for them. You think middle-class women are going to want to line up at the clinic and take a number and wait all day long? That's not the way our society works.
"I simply cannot afford to stay in practice and not make a living," he said. "Unlike municipal work, there's no pension plan waiting for me at the end of the road. The stock market decimated what savings I had, and nobody's been able to save anything for the past several years because of the economics of medicine."
The average obstetrician earns about $150,000 in Hartford County and works about 80 to 90 hours a week, said Dr. Jacobs, who is president of the Hartford County Medical Association; primary-care physicians earn under $100,000 per year.
"They're working their butts off," he said, "and to me, and I'm not speaking for the medical association here, I think it's pathetic that we passively accept that Michael Jordan makes $60,000 a minute bouncing a ball, and we tell a doctor who's making $100,000 he's a fat cat and he should be hammered down. Michael Jordan will never hold your life in the palm of his hand."
The public doesn't understand the magnitude of the problem, doctors said. But they may soon enough, because the medical society's next move is to broadcast its case on billboards -- an unusual move for publicity-shy doctors and evidence of the level of their alarm. "As doctors, we have always been victims of our own dignity," said Dr. Ed Volpintesta, who has run his family practice for 27 years from the same office at 165 Greenwood Avenue in Bethel. He switched his insurance company this year after his malpractice premiums almost doubled to $14,000.
"We were never trained to be politicians," he said. "But this has been smoldering for a long time, and doctors are desperate. We don't seem to be getting anywhere and our dilemma is, how do we balance that individual patient who obviously deserves compensation with the greater needs of the health-care system?"

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET; 
Nonprofit Groups Face Cuts and Hard Choices

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
IT has been a winter of mood swings for directors of nonprofit organizations as politicians in the county and state have wrangled over a particularly difficult budget. They have been worried, cautiously optimistic, disappointed and, finally, resigned. They attended countless budget meetings and lobbied hard for their special cases over coffee and lunch. 
 With the county budget passed this week, they say, their causes will suffer --from sheltering abused women to low-income housing development to teaching children about Hudson River ecology. The county government will reduce its aid to all the nonprofit organizations it helps to support by 20 percent. 
 Some of them fear going out of business; some expect to cut existing programs; others talk about laying off staff members. 
The county's original 2003 budget, passed in December with the assumption that the State Legislature would allow a one-cent sales tax increase, was scratched last week because Westchester's delegation in Albany, led by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, opposed the sales tax proposal. 
The budget that was finally passed raises county property taxes by about 15 percent and sheds an extra $15 million in spending. The cuts made to the nonprofit groups will mean $3 million to $4 million in savings for the county. The total budget for the year is $1.38 billion.
The county will lay off administrators, assistant district attorneys and accountants, according to the budget made public on Tuesday. It will also shrink its travel and equipment accounts and freeze salaries for most county employees. 
"These are extremely difficult choices," said Lois T. Bronz, chairwoman of the county Board of Legislators. 
Now it is the turn of the directors of the nonprofit agencies to make the decisions about what to cut.
Victoria Lutz, who runs the Pace Women's Justice Center, was at a loss. A former law professor who helped build the legal aid organization, Ms. Lutz receives 65 percent of her annual operating budget, around $400,000, from the county. The center, which provides legal assistance to the poor in six languages --English, Spanish, French, Mandarin, Gujarati and Italian --runs a legal hot line for housing, Medicaid and divorce issues and offers emergency assistance around the clock.
"Now what do I cut?" asked Ms. Lutz. "Do we cut one-fifth of the year and stop working in October? Which attorney do I let go? The one speaking Spanish? The one speaking Mandarin?"
The Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, which displays paintings of the Hudson River School and demonstrates the ecology of the river, will decrease the number of its educational programs for schoolchildren and arts programs for the elderly, said Dennis Power, a director there.
My Sister's Place, which provides shelter and legal and psychological counseling to battered women, will need to eliminate three or four front-line workers, said Julie Domonkos, its executive director.
Women's Enterprise Development Center, which provides five 15-week programs on how to start a business for women going off welfare, single mothers and immigrants every year, will reduce classes, said Anne Janiak, its executive director. 
Many were bitter and questioned why nonprofit organizations had been asked to shoulder the deepest cuts at 20 percent, more than any government agency. 
"We are willing to take some cuts and help the county out at this difficult time," said Barbara Finkelstein, executive director of Westchester/Putnam Legal Services, "but not 20 percent."
Ms. Lutz said she thought the county should raise its share of the property tax by one or two more percentage points than the proposed 15 percent. Since the county takes 20 percent of the total property tax, and the median property tax for a single family house in Westchester is slightly more than $8,000, according to 2000 Census figures, one or two more percentage points would mean $16 or $32 a year.
"In tough times, the first items to cut are the luxuries," Ms. Lutz said, "but helping the poor is not a luxury."
Deputy County Executive Larry Schwartz said the county government had already been "cut to the bone." Raising property taxes, on the other hand, is always unpopular and has scuttled political careers.
Andrew J. Spano, the county executive who had ridden to an impressive re-election with 72 percent of the vote partly because of his ability to keep down property tax, had hoped to keep the county property tax constant by raising the sales tax, but Mr. Brodsky, the Democrat who heads the county delegation in the State Assembly, led the opposition against the sales tax bill in Albany. Mr. Spano and Mr. Brodsky have long been political adversaries. 
"We have to give our state delegation the benefit of doubt and believe that they deliberated long and hard" about the sales tax proposal, said Richard G. Wishnie, chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee of the county Board of Legislators. "Whatever the reason, we need to put it behind us and continue to work with them."
But Alan Gordon, the deputy director for Housing Actions Council, an organization that helps develop affordable housing, said he did not believe that the deep budget cuts can be easily put behind by the nonprofit groups. 
In times of economic hardship, he said, the number of poor people grows and more people need help. He said he was concerned that the cuts would wipe out entire nonprofit groups. "If they do," he warned, "it would take a tremendous amount of effort to resurrect these groups."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DOMESTIC SECURITY; 
Balancing Act For Washington In Terror Alerts

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Shortly before 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. every day, video cameras and banks of television monitors flicker to life at the White House and in small studios at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security and a handful of the other agencies responsible for trying to track down terrorists who might strike on American soil.
 In these twice-daily supersecret videoconferences, begun shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the agencies are expected to share their latest intelligence on the whereabouts of terrorists of Al Qaeda and their possible plans for attack. 
 Administration officials say the intelligence about Al Qaeda in the 17 months since the attacks has often been alarming. But this month the evidence became "downright terrifying," a senior law enforcement official said. He said interrogations of captured terrorists and other intelligence suggested an imminent terrorist attack that might even involve chemical, biological or radioactive "dirty bombs" aimed at lightly guarded targets like hotels or apartment buildings. 
Two weeks ago, officials said, the intelligence was so frightening and so specific -- some information pointed to attacks that were timed to coincide with the end of the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage that concluded Thursday -- that they decided the public had to be notified.
That conclusion set in motion a sequence of events that by late this week had led millions of people to stock up on duct tape and plastic sheeting, with some parents pulling their children out of school and topping off their gas tanks to be ready for a quick evacuation -- an expression of public anxiety not seen since the first days after the Sept. 11 attacks and rarely seen since the height of the cold war.
On Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge tried to calm the public, saying that there was no new intelligence to suggest the need to raise the alarm any further.
But even as he suggested that some people had overreacted -- "We do not want individuals or families to start sealing their doors," he said -- Mr. Ridge insisted that the administration was pleased by how its new color-coded public-warning system was working.
"The federal government, the state and local authorities and the private sector have all taken very important steps to ramp up protective measures to do whatever they can to prevent a terrorist attack," Mr. Ridge said.
The administration's critics, including private security specialists, see the events of the last two weeks very differently, arguing that the government's system for analyzing terrorist threats and sharing the information with the public is not making the public any safer. The critics say it is only frightening them.
"The public is being scared, unnecessarily," said Michael Cherkasky, the president of the private security agency Kroll Inc., who said he had spent much of the this week trying to calm his frightened corporate clients. "These draconian announcements from the government are taking away any perspective that people should have about their lives."
Within the administration, even supporters of what is known as the Homeland Security Advisory System admit that the system is more art than science -- much more -- and that the analysis of often scant intelligence and decisions about whether to alert the public to its contents must often be subject to hunch.
If not handled properly, they concede, the system can lead to unnecessary panic, or to public complacency that could be equally dangerous. And they acknowledge that the much ridiculed color-coded system may have added to the confusion, with few people understanding the difference between a warning level of yellow ("elevated") and orange ("high").
"Every day we see information that suggests that terrorists are going to hit some American target," said a senior law enforcement official. "But is it worth creating panic if the intelligence is sketchy, or if there is no real way for people to protect themselves?"
Officials say that whatever the criticism, the new procedures for analyzing threats and making the information public have brought order to the slapdash process that existed in the first days after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the administration issued a series of vague terror alerts without offering the public any substantive guidance about how to respond, apart from a repeated call for "vigilance."
The decision to raise the public's alarm this month can be traced to the discussions held in the twice-daily intelligence video conferences in the first days of February, when intelligence analysts reported a sudden burst of evidence that Al Qaeda was nearing an attack.
George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, testified to Congress this week that the intelligence was "the most specific we have seen" since Sept. 11. He pointed to "plots that could include the use of a radiological dispersal device, as well as poisons and chemicals."
Administration officials said that by Feb. 6, the evidence had grownso alarming that it was the subject of an urgent White House meeting that afternoon of the No. 2 officials from most of the nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Those officials urged that there be a special meeting the next day of the Homeland Security Council, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Ridge, Mr. Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft, to decide how to notify the public.
The council, which was established six days after the attacks as a domestic counterpart to the National Security Council, met the next morning at 9, with Mr. Cheney included by video conference from outside the White House.
Officials said the conversation in the White House situation room, a vaultlike suite of wood-paneled offices beneath the West Wing that effectively serves as a war room, was straightforward. "It wasn't a brief meeting, but the principals were pretty unanimous on their feeling," said an administration official.
After the meeting, Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Ridge walked to the Oval Office to recommend to the president that the national alert level be raised from "elevated" to "high," a move that would lead to a significant tightening of security precautions across the federal government. Officials say Mr. Bush quickly agreed.
The alert level had been raised only once before, for two weeks last year around the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Administration officials said one element of the discussions on Feb. 7 was the impact the alert would have on industries that would also be expected to step up security. Many companies have complained that, especially in the midst of a difficult economy, it is expensive to fortify themselves against a hidden enemy.
Within hours, Mr. Ridge had organized a conference call with 66 chief executives. Aides say they were urged to step up security in the lobbies of their buildings, to limit access to uninvited visitors, and to monitor ventilation systems.
Mr. Ridge and Mr. Ashcroft went before television cameras at 12:30 p.m. to notify the public. "We are not recommending that events be canceled or travel or other plans be changed," Mr. Ridge said. "But we do recommend that individuals and families in the days ahead take some time to prepare for an emergency."

HEADLINE: Plum Island Nears A Crossroads 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
PEOPLE on the North Fork have long been ambivalent about the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, the high-security Agriculture Department laboratory one and a half miles off Orient Point that is closed to all but its 200 employees and the occasional invited guest.
 Elected officials and local residents are quick to point out that the island laboratory, now nearly 50 years old, has become a fixture and a source of steady jobs on the front lines of protecting domestic herds worth billions to the national economy. "Plum Island provides jobs for a lot of people out here and it has been part of the scenery for as long as I can remember," said Linton Duell, the owner of the Orient Country Store, who described himself as "one of those people who feels it is important for our national defense." 
 David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport, said jobs at the island were precisely the kind needed to retain working families who risked being priced off the North Fork. 
Yet the proximity of the laboratory, where scientists do research on some of the most virulent and highly infectious animal diseases in the world, also gnaws at some residents and second-home owners who worry about accidents and wish the laboratory would just go away.Now it appears their wish could come true. A senior federal official asserted last week that Plum Island "is now on track to be closed within five years" and reported that the lab's animal disease research would be transferred to more welcoming locations elsewhere, possibly at an Agriculture Department laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
Government officials have also said that when the Department of Homeland Security takes over Plum Island in June, the work there could be expanded to research infectious agents that could be used against the country's civilian population. The senior federal official, who insisted that he not be identified, reported that until new laboratories come online, Plum Island would fill a Department of Homeland Security need for a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory for bioterrorism research. The official said that Homeland Security "will want to expand the menu of diseases" studied at the laboratory to include "potential biological weapons agents like anthrax, plague and tularemia -- but not smallpox." The official said that for the immediate future only Plum Island had "the available Biosafety Level 3 space to fill this gap in national security, which is why the president decided to transfer this facility from the U.S.D.A. to the Department of Homeland Security."
The official speculated that "the patriotic citizens of New York and Connecticut will support solutions to national security needs for all Americans, but in return demand that D.H.S. immediately resolve many longstanding and troubling issues at the facility."
The issues involve a series of recent incidents including power losses, a lengthy labor strike leading to the use of replacement workers in key positions and the growing perception among elected officials and some residents that the government is skimping on laboratory security.
The official stressed that he had no knowledge of any official decision on the future of Plum Island, but rather was concerned because of the evidence he has seen to date.
If the official's information is an accurate reflection of Bush administration intentions, safety concerns would be likely to grow on Long Island and Connecticut, which is eight miles from the laboratory. For the more immediate area on the North Fork, it would mean potentially greater risk in the short term followed by the loss of the laboratory and its jobs within five years.
"It's a disaster if we lose Plum Island, a real disaster," Mr. Kapell said. Alluding to the strikers on the picket line, he added: "It means that people like my neighbors who are spending the winter in that horrible tent alongside the Main Road in Orient are going to be obsolete on the North Fork. Those jobs on Plum Island are a lifeline for future opportunities for working families to live on the North Fork."
The Southold Town supervisor, Joshua Horton, also said keeping the lab was vital. "It provides a lot of stimulus to the local economy," he said. "There is a broad understanding in Southold of the cutting-edge research that takes place on Plum Island. It has vast implications locally, nationally and globally, and I think people recognize that."
But the possibility that the Department of Homeland Security would use the laboratory for research on bioterrorism agents brought pause. "Patriotism is great, but if you feel you have become a bull's-eye at some point common sense takes over," said Joseph L. Townsend, the owner of an insurance company in Greenport. "It's sortof a vulnerable spot." 
The disclosures about Plum Island came just as local concern about safety and security at the laboratory was at a peak, fueled by two electrical outages in December that many here believe are a result of the bitter six-month strike by 76 laboratory workers who are members of the International Union of Operating Engineers. 
The strikers, many of them local residents, have charged that LB&B Associates, a Maryland-based company that holds a maintenance contract at the laboratory, has brought in replacement workers who are unqualified, raising the risk of serious accidents.
They have received powerful backing from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has agreed with them that LB&B had treated them unfairly in negotiations and expressed bewilderment that the Agriculture Department has allowed the strike to continue. The department has said the issue is between the contractor and the union. 
Last Sunday, the depth of local concern was evident when more than 500 residents filled the auditorium of the Mattituck-Cutchogue High School for a public forum on Plum Island convened by Mrs. Clinton and the East End's new congressman, Timothy Bishop.
Mr. Bishop, a Southampton Democrat, was loudly applauded when he said that "as citizens of this community we have a right to be satisfied that the island is operated at a level of safety appropriate for the work that goes on there."
Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Bishop mentioned a possible future closing of the laboratory, but both 
said they expect that a new mission for the Plum Island laboratory is likely once it is transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. Mrs. Clinton said they were meeting resistance in trying to learn the details. Mrs. Clinton said it was unusual that Plum Island was the only Agriculture Department laboratory to be shifted to Homeland Security. "It strikes me that this is a facility that some in the government may have other plans for, and we will do everything we can to prevent that," she told reporters after the meeting. The transfer decision, she said, "certainly leads back to the White House."
In the public forum, she said she had originally believed that the Agriculture Department would "continue to control the research and the Department of Homeland Security would basically protect the facility."
"Now we learn through the administration's budget that the U.S.D.A. will control only half the research funds, which means that the Department of Homeland Security will have a significant amount of control over the direction of the work done at Plum Island," she said.
In a remark that drew sustained applause, Mrs. Clinton then added, "There may be a reason why, given the security challenges we face, we have to change the kind of research and the level of biohazard associated with that research that is done at Plum Island. But that is not a decision that should be made in secret. That is not a decision at should be made without fully informing the community that is involved with the future of the island." 
She also suggested that the return of the strikers to their jobs was important for safety now and in the near future. 
"These are highly trained people who have done an important job for a long time," Mrs. Clinton said. "If we believe what we hear coming out of Washington about a higher threat level and increased chatter about potential targets, why would we not want to have the very best on the front lines?"
She blasted LB&B for not sending a representative to the meeting and said the company and the Agriculture Department had been unresponsive. 
Edward Brandon, an LB&B vice president, said Mrs. Clinton had no basis for assuming that the replacement workers were unqualified. "She hasn't interviewed any of these employees," he said. "How can she make such statements? It's pretty obvious she is running for president in 2004 and she is looking for the union vote and will say anything in the world to get it."
Mr. Brandon said the company had a contractual obligation at Plum Island that left no recourse but to hire replacement workers when union members walked off the job on Aug. 13. The replacement workers, he said, were "people equal to or better qualified than the people who were there before."
The strikers adamantly disagree. "You have people out there who have no experience running the place," said Ronald Grilli, a striking maintenance worker from Greenport. "When the generators didn't work, they put duct tape on the animal rooms. Are you kidding me? These are supposed to be airtight doors. What good is duct tape?"
Asked why workers were not able to start three emergency generators during a three-hour power interruption on Dec. 15, Mr. Brandon seemed to imply that the equipment was the problem. "I don't want to get into that because it is our customer's equipment," he said.
At the Sunday forum, volunteer fire department officials pointed out those strikers who served as firefighting volunteers at Plum Island had not been replaced. Edward Hanus Jr., the chief of the Mattituck volunteer fire department, said five departments on the North Fork had passed resolutions not to respond to fires at Plum Island. "We don't know what's there," Mr. Hanus said. He said volunteers had no training in fighting a fire at the high-security laboratory. "As for an evacuation plan, there is none," he added.
David Huxsoll, the laboratory director, defended the laboratory's firefighting capability. "We are adding more volunteers all the time," he said. "We are doing our best." 
Paul Connor III, the chief executive officer of Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, said the hospital would be relied on to treat people in the event of an accident at the island but had received no money for emergency preparedness. He said communicating with laboratory officials was difficult. "It's hard to get their attention," he said.
Mr. Bishop said he would try to arrange a meeting between local fire and health officials and Plum Island officials to develop emergency response plans.
In a letter dated Feb. 11 to Tom Ridge, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bishop asked for a meeting to discuss "the safety and security of the facility as well as the ability of the surrounding communities to respond to an emergency situation." 
"This situation needs immediate attention, even before ownership of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center is transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, to ensure the safety and security of the facility, the surrounding community, agriculture, and this country at large," the letter said.

New German Unity At Old Dividing Line

BYLINE:  NYT 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
There are few more powerful symbols of German unity than the Brandenburg Gate, at the meeting point of east and west Berlin. It was here in 1989 that Germans celebrated the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. It was also here, after Sept. 11, that Germans gathered to show solidarity with the United States. 
 On this cold afternoon, however, the monument stood for German unity of a different kind, as hundreds of thousands of people peacefully marched here to protest the likelihood of an American-led war in Iraq. 
 "Old Europe" peace stickers and antiwar balloons distributed by the organizers set the general tone. Many marchers also displayed their viewpoints in homemade signs written on cardboard or spray-painted on cloth. "No War for Oil," was one popular slogan. "Warmonger Go Home!" read another, displaying a picture of President Bush. 
Henrik Buchhorn, 20, a student who traveled seven hours by bus with his classmates to take part in the rally, said he was here to protest the war, not the United States. "I'm not anti-American," he said. "I'm against the way the Bush administration has handled Iraq." 
Starting around midday, the protesters formed two giant processions from separate staging areas in east and west Berlin. The marchers gradually approached the Brandenburg Gate from opposite directions and converged in the early afternoon. 
The police estimated that about 500,000 people took part in the demonstration -- which would make it the largest in Germany since World War II.
"What happens in the end should be up to the taxpayer," said Freimut Schwarzkopf, 47, an employee of Volkswagen in Braunschweig, who came to march with 25 co-workers. "A war in Iraq is going to cost lives and damage the world economy." 
Participants who were alive during World War II expressed concern about the collateral effects of an attack on Iraq. "I lived through the bombing of Germany as a child," said Gisela Baumann, 68, a retired veterinarian. "America has never experienced that. It's the civilian population, not Saddam, who will suffer." 
Along the Unter den Linden, the avenue leading to the Brandenburg Gate from the east, the atmosphere was calm and police control was sparse. The entrance to the nearby American Embassy, however, was fortified with barricades, a row of police vans and a tank.
Lutz Meyer, 50, a psychologist who grew up in the former East Germany, said he was taking part in his first protest since German reunification. "When we were growing up, we always looked to America as a sign of hope, and I'm very depressed to be demonstrating against the United States," he said. "But there is this arrogance and missionary zeal about Iraq right now that makes no sense to me."

HEADLINE: Your Taxes; 
Shelters Can Turn Perilous

BYLINE:  By CHARLES DELAFUENTE 

 BODY:
WHEN William T. Esrey, the departing chief executive of Sprint, disclosed this month that he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service for using a tax shelter created by the accounting firm Ernst & Young -- and said he could be ruined financially if the I.R.S. ruled against him -- many other Americans wondered about the tax advice they were getting. 
 The 1990's boom gave many people big and sometimes unexpected gains, prompting some to seek ways to avoid taxes, and perhaps to consider tax shelters. Following are questions and answers about some of the basic issues.

Q. Are tax shelters illegal?

A. Not per se. But different people use the term to mean different things. Broadly speaking, a shelter is anything that lets a taxpayer defer or avoid tax on some amount of current income. Anyone of even modest means can have what might be considered a benign shelter, like a mortgaged house or municipal bonds. The law specifically allows a shelter, in the form of tax credits, for restoring historic structures and investing in low-income housing.
 But "tax shelter" has commonly come to mean an arrangement or procedure that lets very wealthy people avoid tax on all or most of their income. The Internal Revenue Service calls many of the strategies used, especially by the wealthy, "abusive tax shelters."

Q. In what sense is the I.R.S. using the word "abusive"?

A. The I.R.S. says on www.irs.gov, its Web site: "Abusive tax shelters exist solely to reduce taxes unrealistically. Abusive tax shelters are often marketed by promising a larger write-off than the amount invested. These schemes involve transactions with little or no economic foundation." However, it acknowledges, "There is no hard and fast definition of abusive tax shelter arrangements."

Q. How do the arrangements work?

A. Many tax shelters involve an investment that creates deductions or involves transactions intended to shield income from taxation. The seller of an investment or the architect of the plan to move assets around is considered the promoter and usually earns a hefty fee.

Q. What did Ernst & Young promote?

A. One of the strategies involved taking millions of dollars in profits from stock options and delaying taxes for 30 years by passing money to family members.

Q. How could I figure out whether a shelter is abusive?

A. Remember the old adage that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. A more precise way would be to ask an accountant or a lawyer who specializes in tax issues for an opinion. But no one can offer an ironclad guarantee. And if a promoter insists that the details of the shelter not be shared with advisers, that might well be a red flag.

Q. How would the I.R.S. know if I had a shelter?

A. It might find out in one of several ways. If the shelter created deductions disproportionate to your income, that imbalance might lead to an audit. Very wealthy taxpayers' returns might be scrutinized every year. And because many shelters involve partnerships or other joint enterprises, if one participant is spotted, the I.R.S. might look at anyone else involved.

Q. What happens if someone has followed a promoter's advice and the I.R.S. says the shelter is abusive?

A. If the I.R.S. can prevail, then, in its words, "investors in abusive tax shelters whose returns are examined may be required to pay more tax, plus penalties and interest."

Q. Should I go ahead if I like the idea?

A. The answer depends in part on risk tolerance. Some people like living on the edge. But for someone who is going to lose sleep every night over a questionable shelter, the emotional price is probably too high. A potential investor could seek a ruling in advance from the I.R.S., but many shelter investors fear the answer, and are in part playing the odds that their shelter will escape notice.
For a middle-income taxpayer, the savings might not justify the fees involved in buying a shelter, and sophisticated shelters may require the investment of a significant amount of cash to create the promised deductions.

Q. Will the I.R.S. always prevail?

A. If a taxpayer who is challenged does not agree to pay, and there is enough money at stake, the case could well wind up in court. Many shelters exist on a frontier where three parties -- Congress, which writes the tax laws; the I.R.S.; and some accountants and lawyers, who look for loopholes -- are engaged in a constant border war.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes; 
Too Many Pennies From Heaven?

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THIS time around, even many Republicans are gasping for breath. As President Bush campaigns for his second big tax-cutting package in two years, he has sent out a barrage of proposals that are more sweeping than anything that even Ronald Reagan might have contemplated.
 First, Mr. Bush came out with an "economic growth package" that, with a projected cost of $674 billion over 10 years, was twice as big as either supporters or opponents had expected. 
 It would speed up rate cuts now scheduled to phase in over several years, accelerate relief from the so-called marriage penalty, send parents a $400 check for each of their children and, at a cost of more than $300 billion over 10 years, eliminate most taxes on stock dividends. 
The plan would help set record budget deficits this year and next, and the administration now projects that instead of enjoying a huge surplus, the nation will have a 10-year budget deficit of $1.3 trillion. 
But that was only the beginning. Mr. Bush's latest budget also calls for new "financial incentives" to promote charitable contributions, solar energy, insurance companies and even the value of leftover food.
More startling, Mr. Bush unveiled a radical plan to revamp retirement plans and expand tax breaks with new Lifetime Savings Accounts and Retirement Savings Accounts. In essence, the new savings accounts would allow many people to shield almost all investment income from taxation -- profits from capital gains, interest on bank deposits and corporate bonds, profits from real estate investment trusts. 
"I can't really take seriously all the proposals he has put out there," said Bruce Bartlett, an ardent believer in supply-side tax cuts who worked in Congress during the Reagan era and later in the first Bush administration. "I can't believe he really wants all of those things right now, so I'm frankly quite curious to see what his real bottom line is."
Taken together, Mr. Bush's proposals would radically transform the way people invest in stocks, think about taxes and save. Critics and supporters alike say this is simply the first installment in a plan to overhaul the tax system from one that taxes income to one that taxes consumption.
But can he get what he wants? Mr. Bush has an exceptionally strong track record in that regard: he won approval for his first round of tax cuts in 2001, keeping Republicans solidly behind him and persuading Democrats to break ranks. Now the Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate and a virtual lock on the House. Even so, lawmakers and political analysts say Mr. Bush is trying to juggle too many explosive issues at once and will face opposition. 
"It doesn't look to me like the complete set of proposals has much chance of enactment," said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "If he had put forward a less bold proposal, I think it would have gone through quickly."
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned bluntly last week about a trend toward uncontrollable deficits and disparaged as premature the White House arguments that the economy needs a fiscal stimulus.
Beyond the tax cuts, Mr. Bush is also pushing for a radical overhaul of Medicare -- and has run into so much opposition from Congressional Republicans that the White House is struggling to refine the plan.
House Republicans also complain privately that they were not consulted in advance on the new tax plans and say they are skeptical about many of the details.
Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has emphasized his intention to discuss alternatives to eliminating taxes on most stock dividends, and he has studiously avoided talking about the plan for the new savings accounts. After-tax money would go into the accounts, but earnings on the accounts would be tax-free.
Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and an architect of other legislation on retirement accounts, was stunned by the administration's proposal and suggested that it might be too much to tackle any time soon.
The Senate could be even tougher. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, has pledged his support for the president but remains worried about his ability to push the dividend plan through a closely divided Senate. He continues to plead quietly for flexibility from the White House because some moderate Republicans are openly resistant to the plan, while no Democrats have yet shown any willingness to break ranks. In contrast, 12 Senate Democrats supported Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax package in 2001. 
At a hearing last week, Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, one of those who voted for the tax cuts two years ago, said, "Frankly, I am appalled at the president's recklessness in proposing a massive tax cut for the rich." 
Administration officials are dispatching cabinet officials and others to sell the tax plan nationwide. "We're in a marathon here," said John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary. "The question is who gets across the finish line, not who's ahead in the first mile."
The $674 billion "economic growth package" comprises three main elements: an acceleration of the rate reductions passed in 2001 and scheduled to be phased in over the next several years, the elimination of taxes on most stock dividends, and an expansion of tax breaks for small businesses.
The rate reductions would lower taxes for virtually all taxpayers, but the biggest benefits would flow to the rich. CCH Inc., a provider of tax information and software, estimates that a sample family of four with an adjusted gross income of $100,000 would see its federal tax drop to $9,820 from $12,162, a savings of $2,342. A family of four with an income of $300,000, and with higher levels of deductions, would see its taxes drop by $8,840, to $60,767 from $69,607.
The Bush administration has estimated that 92 million taxpayers would receive an average tax cut of nearly $1,100 in 2003. But average is not the same thing as typical. Millions of taxpayers in the bottom half of income earners pay little or no federal income tax, so many would receive tax cuts of $100 or less. In contrast, people with incomes of more than $1 million a year could save about $90,000.
But many people may not care. Millions of middle-income families would receive more under the Bush plan than under the leading Democratic alternative, which would provide a $300 one-time rebate to every family in the country.
WHEN Mr. Bush's other proposals are added to the "growth package," the costs total more than $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years. And the president has yet to estimate the full impact of what could be the biggest proposal: the overhaul and expansion of tax-favored accounts for retirement and education savings.
Under the proposals, a married couple with two children would be able to set aside up to $45,000 a year for new savings accounts. Their contributions would be taxed, but the investment income would be tax-free. That tax relief would not really hit the Treasury until 10 or 20 years from now, when people withdrew the money, but it could add up to even more than Mr. Bush's proposal to quit taxing corporate dividends.
"The ultimate budget cost could be massive, with much of the damage occurring in the same period that the baby-boomer generation will be retiring in large numbers," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington research group. 
Republican Congressional leaders are likely to handle these proposals separately. Representative Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he planned to hold hearings on the growth package in March and hoped to get a bill to the House floor in April. But he and others plan to move much more slowly on the retirement and savings proposals. 
Even within the "growth package," Republicans are debating quietly which proposals are crucial and which might well be trimmed.
The biggest single proposal, costing the Treasury about $385 billion over 10 years, would end taxes on most dividends. Proponents of that plan contend that corporate profits are now taxed twice, first at the corporate level and then at the shareholder level. The proposal has won praise from many tax experts, but it is complex and costly; most benefits would flow to 5 percent of income earners. 
The second-biggest change, worth about $260 billion over 10 years, is to accelerate rate reductions and other tax breaks for individuals that are currently scheduled to be phased in through 2010. A third change, worth about $15 billion, would triple the amount of money, $24,000 for 2002, that a small business could deduct as an immediate expense for the purchase of new equipment, as opposed to depreciating it over several years. 
Even enthusiastic Republican tax-cutters are weighing the importance of faster rate cuts versus the dividend proposal.
Martin Anderson, a former policy adviser to President Reagan and an adviser to George W. Bush in his election campaign, said the top priority must be on speeding up individual rate reductions. "Sure, we should reduce the tax on dividends," said Mr. Anderson, now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford. "My first choice by a long fat margin would be to reduce those marginal tax rates, to do it now and make it retroactive."
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Budget Committee, suggested a similar willingness to cut back on the dividend proposal. "If we don't get the whole loaf on dividend repeal, we could go for a 50 percent exclusion," Mr. Nickles said. "There are lots of different things you can do." 
The question now is what Mr. Bush is willing to do.

There's a Futures Contract for Everything (Even Iraq's Fate)

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FEW people would disagree with the forecast that stocks would drop if war started tomorrow in Iraq. But two Stanford economics professors, Eric Zitzewitz and Justin Wolfers, go further, predicting that the market would drop 5 percent. 
 Academics rarely make precise short-term market predictions. The professors arrived at theirs by using standard econometric analysis and an unusual derivative that trades at www.tradesports.com, based in Dublin. At this Web site, you can bet on whether Duke will win the N.C.A.A. basketball title, whether "Chicago" will win the Oscar for best picture or where the Dow Jones industrials will end 2003. According to John Delaney, the site's chief executive, most of its active users are traders from Wall Street or Chicago futures exchanges. 
 The derivative on which the professors base their unpublished research is indeed unconventional: a futures contract on Saddam Hussein's presidency. The contract, which was trading at $7.50 on Friday, will pay $10 if Mr. Hussein is not Iraq's president on June 30; otherwise it will pay nothing. Because the professors assume that Mr. Hussein won't step down voluntarily, they argue that the contract reflects traders' assessment of the probability of a war resulting in his ouster. The contract's current price suggests that the market assesses this probability as 75 percent between now and midyear.
The professors acknowledge that the contract may seem too bizarre to be the basis of serious research. They further concede that its trading volume is low, just over $140,000 over the last five months. Yet, for a variety of reasons, they say its price accurately gauges the probability of an Iraqi war. 
To counter concerns about the contract's volume, the professors point out that it is still higher than that of the Iowa Electronic Market, a real-money futures exchange administered by the University of Iowa that allows speculating on the American presidential election. Despite trading volume that has averaged just $108,000 an election, these Iowa contracts have had an excellent track record. Their average forecast error for the popular vote in the last four presidential contests has been 1.37 percentage points, about half the average error of nine major polling organizations, according a study by four professors at the university. 
Professors Zitzewitz and Wolfers say they believe that markets in general reflect more wisdom than any single person can possibly have, and thus do a better job of assessing probabilities. That holds true not only for large markets, they say, but also for small and unconventional ones.
The professors concede that Web-based futures, which are largely unregulated, could be skewed by someone willing and able to place sizable buy or sell orders well above or below the current price. But they doubt that this is the case for the contract on Mr. Hussein's ouster, believing that no one has an obvious motive to do so. 
Once the professors were satisfied that this contract was a legitimate basis for research, arriving at their conclusion was straightforward. First, they measured how much the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell, on average, when the price of the contract increased, and vice versa. These measurements let them estimate how low the S.& P. 500 would drop if the contract approached $10, which they believe would be likely on the day a war breaks out. They also calculated how high it would go if the contract fell to zero, reflecting zero probability. Their study, conducted with the assistance of Andrew Leigh, a Harvard graduate student, is at http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu
/zitzewitz/Research/iraq.pdf.
THEIR analysis projects a 20 percent difference in the S.& P. 500's level at the contract's two price extremes. From this, they concluded that on the day a war begins, the cumulative effect of the buildup to war would be a 20 percent drop in the S.& P. 
With the $10 contract trading at $7.50, the professors believe that 75 percent of the overall 20 percent drop has already occurred. That implies that when a war begins, the market would drop no more than an additional 5 percent.
If their forecasts prove accurate, the professors will overcome at least some of the concerns about the Saddam Hussein futures contract. In any case, with a proliferation of such unconventional trading instruments, we should anticipate more analyses like theirs in coming years.

HEADLINE: A Bad Element 

BYLINE:  By Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

 BODY:
Here's why the environmental community isn't ecstatic over President Bush's call to spend more than $1 billion over five years to develop a hydrogen-powered car to wean us from our addiction to Middle East oil. 
 Certainly, fuel cells that use renewable resources like wind and solar power to extract hydrogen from water promise America a safe, clean energy solution. However, in a sop to the energy industry, the White House wants to extract hydrogen instead from coal and natural gas (without controlling carbon emissions), thereby increasing global warming and fouling our landscape. Worse, the president wants to build a new generation of nuclear power plants specifically for hydrogen production. 
 The president's hydrogen plan will further reduce our national commitment to renewables by cutting our already anemic financing for research into wind, solar and other energy-saving technologies.
Fuel cells offer bright prospects but it will be 10 to 20 years before economical hydrogen vehicles are on the road. Meanwhile, Americans are buying 17 million new cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s a year -- vehicles that could be much more fuel efficient. It's no secret that right now we have the technology to make cars that get better mileage and pollute less. But the administration has repeatedly scuttled efforts to put these innovations in place, fighting tougher fuel economy standards for all vehicles, refusing to compel S.U.V.'s to meet the same mileage standards as cars and creating tax incentives for Americans to buy the largest gas guzzlers. Last week, in an astonishing move, government lawyers joined General Motors and DaimlerChrysler in a federal lawsuit challenging a California law that rewards carmakers for selling low-emission, gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles.
Hybrids are just one of the proven technologies that could start saving oil right now. They can increase fuel economy 50 percent, and never need plugging in. Other technologies that can lift fuel economy include moreadvanced transmissions; improved engine and valve train design; and tires that promote fuel-efficiency. Available now, these solutions won't be widely used until Washington gets serious about the arithmetic of oil security: we use a quarter of the world's oil, yet we have only 3 percent of the known reserves. 
Requiring cars to average 40 miles per gallon by 2012 would save nearly 2 million barrels a day; that's more than we imported from Saudi Arabia last year, and three times our Iraq imports. Raise that to 55 miles per gallon by 2020, and daily savings grow to nearly 5 million barrels, almost twice our current Persian Gulf imports.
We have an oil security problem and we have an air pollution problem. We also have the technology to fix these problems -- if only we would have the will to use it.

Bargain-HuntingSnaps a Losing Streak

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
Thanks to a rally on Friday, all three major stock market gauges rose for the first week in the last five.
 Worries about war and a weak economy drove the markets lower most of the week, but a bit of bargain-hunting began late Thursday. 
 On Friday, the technology sector led stocks up. Dell Computer shares climbed 11 percent on positive earnings and an upbeat forecast. The chip maker Nvidia jumped 22 percent after its earnings exceeded analysts' expectations by a plump margin.
 In addition to corporate reports like these, testimony by Hans Blix, the top United Nations weapons inspector, gave the markets some comfort. He indicated that he believed some progress had been made in inspections in Iraq, bolstering the view that a United States attack on Iraq might not be near.
 On Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.1 percent, its biggest daily gain since Jan. 6. For the week, the index rose 5.2 points, closing at 834.89, a gain of 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 44.57 points last week, closing at 7,908.80, also up 0.6 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, however, advanced by 2.2 percent, or 27.27 points, closing at 1,310.17. JEFF SOMMER

What Is Patriotism Without Sacrifice?

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. KENNEDY; David M. Kennedy, a professor of history at Stanford University, is the author of "Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War 1929-1945."

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH may believe that a war against Iraq can be waged without disrupting home-front business as usual. But the gods of war have always demanded sacrifice.
 From time out of mind, warriors have been asked to lay down their bodies on the martial altar. Modern wars have also visited agonies of deprivation on civilian populations, immolating countless noncombatants as well. 
 But sacrifice is about more than death and mayhem. The word itself literally means "to make holy," a reminder that sacrifice has a spiritual and symbolic rationale more venerable than its military one. 
In a total war like World War II, the lines between battlefront and home front blurred, compelling far-reaching economic mobilizations and requiring civilian moral and material support -- not to mention political approval -- to maintain a fighting force in the field.
War leaders have long understood the utility of nurturing the feeling that "we're all in this together," combatant and noncombatant alike, whether the privations on the home front were truly necessary or not. The sentiment of shared sacrifice binds soldier to civilian. For better or worse, that sentiment is what has made modern warfare -- industrialized and full throttle -- possible.
Woodrow Wilson took America into its first modern war in 1917 with a blizzard of propaganda about the need for citizens to conserve food with "meatless Tuesdays" and "wheatless Wednesdays." But Wilson's studied refusal to require rationing suggested that his real aims had as much to do with stimulating patriotic fervor and a sense of citizen involvement as with conserving food. 
In World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration elevated the spirit of sacrifice to a high art. Some 405,000 American soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and merchant mariners, along with a handful of civilians, made the ultimate sacrifice to defeat Germany, Japan and Italy. Yet after the short-lived post-Pearl Harbor panic, residents of the continental United States had virtually nothing to fear from enemy malice. But to sustain the martial spirit -- and sanctify the dead -- Americans safe at home nonetheless needed to feel they, too, were making sacrifices in the pursuit of victory. 
ROOSEVELT'S Treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau Jr., recognized that necessity, organizing a mammoth campaign to urge Americans to curtail consumer spending and buy war bonds instead. The bonds helped pay for the war, of course, and also soaked up income that might have fueled inflation. But Morgenthau admitted that "60 percent of the reason" for the bond drive was "to give the people an opportunity to do something," and "make the country war-minded." He would use the bonds, he explained, to "sell the war, rather than vice versa." 
The government soon removed some items altogether from the stream of commerce. Home construction was sharply restricted, for example, conserving lumber and skilled labor alike for military uses. The manufacture of new cars was prohibited. 
But other efforts made more psychological than strictly economic sense. Boy Scouts trundled little wagons through their neighborhoods, collecting empty tin cans, wads of used foil and old toothpaste tubes made from zinc. None of those metals proved to be in critically short supply, but the scouts got the satisfaction of doing their duty.
Then on April 27, 1942, President Roosevelt announced a seven-point program for economic mobilization. It included bond sales, heavier taxation, controls on wages, prices and credit, and the rationing of "all essential commodities which are scarce." Roosevelt explained in a fireside chat that for homebodies denied "the privilege of fighting our enemies in distant parts of the world," rationing would offer the chance for "equality of sacrifice."
Within weeks, every man, woman and child in America received a little cardboard-bound ration book, containing coupons that had to be presented for the purchase of specified items -- including canned goods, meat, butter, sugar, shoes and, notoriously, coffee (ostensibly because of its demands on ocean shipping). 
A separate system restricted gasoline sales. Gasoline was not in scarce supply, but fuel rationing curbed driving and thereby saved rubber, which was, thanks to the Japanese seizure of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia. 
For the most part, Americans did not chafe under the restrictions. Many cheerfully gave up tinned foods and hoed their way to more healthful diets by raising fresh fruits and vegetables in Victory Gardens.
The rationing system itself was designed along free-market lines. Like latter-day weight-control programs, it gave individuals considerable freedom in using their monthly allocation of 48 ration points -- to allow splurging, for example, on things like steak, footwear or caffeine. Black markets everywhere provided additional goods. If this was sacrifice, it was almost painlessly borne.
What's more, the World War II production miracle ultimately rendered both the scrap drives and rationing economically irrelevant. The United States managed to lift its civilian standard of living even while fielding a multimillion-man fighting force and supplying its allies with prodigious stocks of munitions.
While the war shredded the economies and drastically depressed the living standards of all other belligerents, the American civilian sector grew by nearly 15 percent -- a uniquely American achievement.
That was some kind of miracle, indeed, and it suggests that for the stateside members of the greatest generation, their sacrifices amounted to sentimental gestures rather than genuine hardships.
But they mattered nonetheless. During the Vietnam War, the Johnson administration scarcely dared ask the affluence-intoxicated American public to share even a modicum of the afflictions endured by the troops in Asia.
The contrast between the country's sorry experience in Vietnam and its achievement in World War II suggest that some measure of civilian sacrifice, illusory or not, may be necessary to sustain the will to go the bitter distance.

Putin's Daunting Choice: Which West to Join

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
ONE has to wonder whether Vladimir V. Putin finds this moment bittersweet, or simply sweet.
 As a young foreign operative of the K.G.B. in the 1980's, Mr. Putin labored in East Germany for an organization whose raison d'etre was to sow discord in the Western alliance, to scrutinize every nuclear-winter protest and anti-American march for cracks in the democratic wall. It failed utterly. 
 Fast-forward 20 years. Mr. Putin is Russia's president, a junior member of that alliance, trying doggedly for full entry to the club. But instead of sealing friendships, he must choose sides in a feud that appears to be splitting the West at the seams.
This is the simple explanation for Russia's labored back and forth in the global debate over war against Iraq: it is waiting to see whether the West can stitch itself back together. For most of a month the Kremlin has finessed its approach to disarming Saddam Hussein, joining France and Germany in a dovish call for more inspections and negotiations; joining Washington in a hawkish warning that if jawboning fails, it may back the use of force.
But while the Iraq crisis will presumably pass, Russia's dilemma may not. Under Mr. Putin's whip, Russia has opted for the West's vaunted security and shared values. What it has gotten is a place sandwiched between a globally pre-eminent but increasingly despised United States and a Europe with vast economic potential and a worldview troublingly centered on its umbilicus. 
For Mr. Putin, the question now is whether he can keep the Atlantic rift from swallowing his dream of a Russia anchored in the West -- or, better yet, exploit the schism to speed up the process.
"They're going to be forced to choose," said Michael McFaul, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. "But they're going to be forced by both sides. I'd say that gives them more flexibility."
Mr. Putin surely cannot afford to permanently alienate either side in what could become a fundamental split between trans-Atlantic powers. Russia's economic and political future is bound to Europe: the bulk of trade and foreign investment comes from there, and cultural ties are strong.
But Russia needs the United States -- not only for trade, but because the two nations are often reluctant political partners in the Koreas, Central and South Asia, the Middle East and virtually everywhere else Moscow claims a strategic interest. An American partnership gives Russia much of its global effectiveness.
Russian-American relations have been strained in recent months by anxiety in Russia over American aims in Iraq, where Russian oil companies have a huge stake, and by the Kremlin's open concern that a war in the Arab world will only worsen terrorism, an obsession here.
For their part, American officials have privately said they are disappointed by Mr. Putin's public show of solidarity with Germany and France against the use of force in Iraq, especially given President Bush's long courtship of the Russian leader.
But while the Americans have been brutally critical of Germany and France, they have been publicly silent on Russia. In part, that may be because the United States has placed a long-term bet on a Russian alliance. In part, it is because Mr. Putin has conspicuously left open the prospect that Russia will change its mind on Iraq. And it is partly because Moscow is waiting to see which position on an Iraqi invasion is most advantageous for the Russian government.
"I think that for now, Mr. Putin tries maneuvering," said Sergei Markov, a political analyst who heads the Civic Council of International Affairs, based in Moscow. "His problem, as is the problem with all Russian diplomacy, is specifics. What, specifically, does Russia get from this alliance?"
Mr. Putin has ridiculed the idea that Russia's assent for an Iraq war rests on guarantees of oil rights in Iraq or equally crass trade-offs, and American officials agree. But Russia has to place its bets -- and in supporting or opposing an invasion of Iraq, the calculus is surely whether alliance with an American colossus is outweighed by the bad blood spawned by endorsing war.
In the first years of Mr. Putin's presidency, France barely acknowledged Russia except to castigate its disregard for atrocities against civilians in Chechnya. In the last three months, French diplomats have all but run a shuttle to Moscow, and French officials have made media spectacles of alleged Chechen-led plots to attack Russian interests in Paris.
In Washington, the United States is preparing to label several Chechen militant groups as terrorist organizations, and has pointedly accused Iraq of ties to Chechen rebels involved in terrorism.
American officials express confidence that, sooner or later, Mr. Putin will come around to the White House's view, and many experts abroad agree. 
"He's on the American track," said Alexander Rahr, a Russia expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. Still, Mr. Rahr added, Mr. Putin also "wants to leave the door open so that if something happens to the United States, he can return to cooperating with Europe." 
It is a vintage Putin ploy -- keeping all options open until the final moment. In the case of Iraq, it has spawned unrestrained speculation as to whether Russia will prove to be anti-European or anti-American. The answer is neither: first and foremost, Mr. Putin is pro-Russian.

HEADLINE: Voodoo vs. 'Rubinomics' 

 BODY:
Large deficits matter. Those three words sum up Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress last week, testimony that will make it more difficult for the White House to get its proposed tax cuts enacted. That such an incontrovertible statement of basic economic thought could roil Washington and create problems for the Bush administration is an indication of how surreal, and cynical, budgetary politics have become. 
 During the 1980 battle for the Republican presidential nomination, George Bush called Ronald Reagan's belief that you could dramatically increase military spending and cut taxes, while preserving fiscal discipline, "voodoo economics." Mr. Bush proved prescient, though he could hardly boast about it from his vice-presidential office. 
 Now Mr. Bush's son is practicing voodoo economics, and it is Mr. Greenspan who has, however delicately, called him on it. Even without factoring in the cost of his latest round of proposed tax cuts or a war with Iraq, President Bush's budget for the next fiscal year would result in a $307 billion deficit -- a worrisome 3 percent of gross domestic product. And his administration concedes that deficits are back to stay. 
But the White House line is that they don't matter. To worry about the impact of deficits on the economy, administration officials are fond of saying, is to engage in "Rubinomics." It's a mystery why they would think it disparages a view to associate it with Robert Rubin, President Clinton's widely admired Treasury secretary, whose policies were rooted in mainstream economics. It's equally bizarre to see conservatives in Congress embrace large deficits as an antidote for government spending. It's a theory that goes back to Reagan days, and it surfaces only when there are Republican deficits that need explaining away. To the unenlightened, it sounds like telling a compulsive shopper to solve his problem by maxing out on his credit cards.
The deficits have not, in fact, persuaded the Republican majority to stop spending. Last week they were right in there with the Democrats, stuffing more cash into the already bloated farm aid program and into obsolete weapons systems. 
The fact that both parties have their own pork barrels and budgetary sacred cows is not new. But the idea that politicians now believe they can embrace ballooning deficits as a sign of fiscal conservatism is downright dangerous. That is why it was so refreshing to hear Mr. Greenspan recite a tenet of Rubinomics 101 when pressed about the significance of the deficit: "Contrary to what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates and it does have an impact on the economy." The Fed chairman also questioned the need for any stimulus package, given that the economy's war jitters may be the only impediment to a solid recovery.
Mr. Greenspan's endorsement of the first round of Bush tax cuts in the spring of 2001 helped get them enacted. His wariness this time may persuade moderate Republicans to oppose the president's reckless plan, even though on the second day of his testimony Mr. Greenspan's qualms were more muted. He may have felt his history with the Bush family weighing upon him. The first President Bush's economic team has argued that the Fed's failure to cut interest rates more aggressively in early 1992 contributed to Bill Clinton's election. With that in mind, it cannot be easy for Mr. Greenspan to be perceived as criticizing this White House, even when he states the obvious.

HEADLINE: In Hawaii, Ship Line Gets Exclusive Rights 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
A provision in the federal spending bill approved by Congress this week seeks to revive Hawaii's moribund interisland cruise industry by giving one company, Norwegian Cruise Line, the right to sail foreign-built luxury liners entirely within the state.
 The provision, initiated by Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, exempts ships owned by Norwegian, a Malaysian-owned company, from a federal law that prohibits foreign-built ships from sailing exclusively among United States ports. It requires the company to pay United States taxes, and to hire an entirely American crew and abide by American labor and other laws. 
 "This is going to create good jobs, great jobs, wonderful jobs for Hawaii," said Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat who represents Honolulu. "We're going to hire people from all the different islands. It's going to be a huge infusion of dollars staying in the economy as opposed to just being extracted out of it."
Hawaii depends on tourism for a quarter of its economy, and since the terrorist attacks of 2001 the industry has suffered. While many other ships sail between the islands -- including two of Norwegian's -- they are all foreign-flagged, and are therefore required by United States law to touch down in a foreign port during an American itinerary. Norwegian stops at Fanning Island in Kiribati, about 600 miles south of Hawaii.
Under the provision, Norwegian would become the only company allowed to sail exclusively among the islands without a foreign stop, a service previously provided only by American Classic Voyages, an American company that went bankrupt a few weeks after the terrorist attacks.
"The advantage these have is to do interisland cruising without foreign ports of call, and we want to make useof that advantage," said Colin Veitch, Norwegian's chief executive. "This is going to be a substantial business for us."
A study commissioned by Norwegian from the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that roughly 10,000 jobs on the ships and ashore will be created once all three ships are operating.
Opponents of the exemption, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, complained that it gave Norwegian Cruise Line a de facto monopoly on the Hawaii market.
"We had sought an amendment to that provision saying if there is a benefit to be conferred upon one cruise line member, then others should have the same opportunity," said Michael Crye, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the 16 major international cruise lines, including Norwegian. "We feel that the market, the American consumer, benefits from competition and the way this amendment is written there would be only a single cruise line operator that would have that benefit."
When American Classic Voyages ceased operations, it left the Federal Maritime Administration with $185 million in loan guarantees. That money will not be recovered, but supporters said getting the ships into service at least keeps the money already spent from going to waste.
"The redemption factor is getting these ships built and back into service," said Jennifer Goto Sabas, Hawaii chief of staff for Senator Inouye.

HEADLINE: Florida Ponders Fate of Historic 2000 Ballots 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The contested 2000 presidential election has largely faded into people's hazy memories of pre-9/11 America. But the Florida ballots are still there, nearly six million punch cards and their chads, stowed in boxes, stacked on pallets, wrapped in plastic.
 The state has kept them for two years, as federal law requires. Now that the time is up, a pressing question for state officials here is: What do we do with these things? 
 "How about a bonfire?" said Theresa LePore, the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections, who designed the butterfly ballots that led many Al Gore supporters to vote for Pat Buchanan.
For now, torching is not an option for Ms. LePore and her counterparts throughout the state. The local elections offices are responsible for storing ballots from their districts, but it is up to Florida's Division of Library and Information Services to determine which public records must be retained and for how long.
At a loss for what to do, the agency has extended the 22-month deadline for preserving ballots until June 30. Now the secretary of state's office is calling on Florida's lawmakers to step in and settle the matter when they meet next month.
Historians, lawyers and political science buffs are calling for Florida to preserve the ballots and other election materials indefinitely.
"This is the most controversial presidential election in modern history -- an election that was viewed by the world for 36 days and ultimately decided by the Supreme Court," said Julian Pleasants, a history professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "It's an important series of events that should be saved for future generations."
Mr. Pleasants would also keep all election-related e-mail, copies of instructions from supervisors to poll workers, absentee ballots, records of canvassing board meetings and legal briefs.
Arguments like these are enough to make Ms. LePore and other elections officials shudder. They say they simply do not have the space to indefinitely retain the immense amount of paper generated by the 2000 election. If state lawmakers ultimately decide to preserve the documents, the officials say, they are welcome to them.
"We as well as other larger counties are tight on space, and they do take up an awful lot of room," Ms. LePore said.
Generally, ballots and other public documents are kept for about two years and then sent to a paper processing company for shredding. Florida and other states do at times retain public records for much longer, just as the state did in recent years with documents related to lawsuits brought by smokers against tobacco companies.
"For the most part, ballots don't have historical value, but obviously 2000 was a bit different," said Ken Detzner, Florida's acting secretary of state. "We find it appropriate that the Legislature weigh the question of whether these records should be kept." Jenny Nash, a spokeswoman for Mr. Detzner, said his office was drafting correspondence to formally ask the Legislature to intervene.
Yet some state legislators have already said they have other priorities. The subject of the ballots "hasn't come up on our radar screen," said Mike Hogan, a Republican state representative from Jacksonville who is chairman of the House subcommittee on ethics and elections.
As a result, the June 30 deadline may well pass with no action by lawmakers, leaving the state's 67 supervisors of election, the official custodians of the ballots, to decide what should become of them.
The options include sending the ballots to the paper processor to be shredded, preserving a representative sampling, and preserving all of them. That third choice, however, would require even more decision making by state officials.
They would have to decide whether to leave the documents spread across the state in the custody of local elections offices, transfer them to the state archives department for safekeeping in a huge storage facility, or donate them.
By law, the ballots cannot be donated after the expiration date for retaining them, so even if the Florida lawmakers wanted to give some or all of them to the Smithsonian Institution or a law school, such a move would require action by the Legislature, said Barratt Wilkins, who sent the letter to the elections officials ordering the extended deadline before he retired in January as director of the state's Division of Library and Information services. The ballots cannot be sold, however, so one place they are not likely to end up is on eBay, state officials say.
Mr. Barratt, whose job for more than 25 years was to keep up with public documents, said he saw little value in retaining the ballots. "We heard from historians around the country," he said. "My own feeling is the record has been compromised simply because they have been handled so many times and the chads have fallen out."
Mr. Pleasants, the history professor, served on a committee appointed by the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections last year to discuss what to do with records. The committee did not come up with a definitive solution. 
The secretary of state's office estimates that it will cost $250,000 to move and store the documents and $100,000 annually after that.
"I understand both the space and economic cost," Mr. Pleasants said. "I can see it will be a burden in a time of economic downturn. But from a historical perspective, to be able to understand the history of the state, people who study this in the future would need these documents."
The president's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, was noncommittal. "We're still studying the matter," said Alia Faraj, a spokeswoman for the governor. "We're trying to evaluate the historical value of the ballots and weigh that in with the cost of keeping them. We may seek to engage the Legislature in this issue."
And what does Katherine Harris think? Ms. Harris, the secretary of state who declared George W. Bush the winner of Florida's 25 decisive electoral votes, and who was later elected to the House of Representatives, is staying out of this one. She issued a statement through a spokesman: 
"Congresswoman Harris considered this matter while she was still serving as secretary of state. She determined that the Florida Legislature was best suited to strike the balance between the historic value of these ballots and the financial cost of their retention. Thus, she directed the Department of State's Bureau of Archives and Records Management to extend the mandatory retention period for these ballots to give the Legislature sufficient time to consider this issue during its 2003 session."

Even in G.O.P. Territory, the Road to War Is a Two-Way Street

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: FISHKILL, N.Y. 

 BODY:
FIVE months ago, this Hudson Valley village was an outpost of the vast mushy middle.
 With two-thirds of Americans telling pollsters that they supported military action to oust Saddam Hussein, you would have thought Fishkill, in staunchly Republican Dutchess County, was a good place to find a chorus of war cries. Instead, waffling and unease came through in interview after interview. 
 On a return visit last week, with two-thirds of the country still supporting war as an option, the middle had all but vanished. People have taken sides -- so much so, that if war is imminent, it appears we'll march into it with one leg dragging the other. 
It starts at the White House, a bar on Main Street where the boss, Michael Hayden, is a Republican. He thinks the boss at the other White House is overly eager for war. "I don't think there's enough to go on," Mr. Hayden said.
Plenty of his customers disagree. "I was in the Marine Corps," said John Beska, an engineering student. "I'm for whatever the commander in chief says."
At the Italian restaurant next door, the owner, Bill Sohan, is a Republican and a Vietnam veteran, but not a "my county right or wrong" type. He said the country's division over the war "reminds you a lot of Vietnam," but without the bitterness, and he's wary of an unpopular war.
Last fall, Mr. Sohan was undecided, saying, "I want to see more proof." But he's become a reluctant hawk, persuaded by Colin Powell and convinced that the economic slowdown, which has hurt his business, is largely fear-induced. "We have to do something," he said.
Mr. Sohan was curious about how Noel R. Schetter, the insurance agent across the street, now viewed the war. Mr. Schetter, skeptical in September, is now incredulous. "What are we on, an ego trip?" he asked.
Frankly, Mr. Schetter said, "I have something else on my mind." It's the economy, stupid. "You know what my 401(k) is today?" It's $39,000, he said, down from over $400,000, thanks to a portfolio of horrors like WorldCom and Lucent. "What can we gain by war?" he asks.
The war drumbeat has resembled a political campaign, and the undecided vote is shrinking as the day of reckoning nears. But the divide is striking when you consider the resolve it takes to wage a war.
Perhaps across the river at West Point, unease has given way to unanimity in the Army's company town of Highland Falls.
Not quite. A sign outside a florist shop that last September said "We Will Always Remember" now reads, "Don't Forget Your Valentine," but inside, Rose Pozo, who opposed war in September, is unchanged, except, "I'm more scared."
And at one West Point gate, a National Guard soldier, armed and wearing camouflage, said: "I'd vote against it. It's better if we don't stick our nose into things."
But inside the West Point visitors' center, Nick Johnson, a lawyer from West Virginia, was looking at a memorial poster ofthe twin towers. He said that although international resistance to war gives him pause, he feels that America needs to attack. "If we bring home the troops and don't do anything, we'd look like cowards," he said.
The divide is evident everywhere, even at the monthly meeting of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars back here in Fishkill.
In September, most of the men in the small V.F.W. post unequivocally backed attacking Iraq. Others, like John Caulfield, a Korean War veteran, said "I hate war." But now, even Mr. Caulfield has decided that "we should go in there and knock him out."
THE veterans know that part of the country's unease stems from the feeling that attacking Iraq would be a pre-emptive strike. They are not as troubled by it as others.
Well, most of them aren't. One exception is the most famous member of V.F.W. Post 1286, Pete Seeger, the lefty folk singer and World War II veteran. At Thursday night's meeting, the 83-year-old bard made suggestions for the local Memorial Day Parade, and afterward told fellow veterans of his plans to perform at yesterday's antiwar rally in New York. "I've been a peacenik all my life," Mr. Seeger said.
Division over the war is reminiscent of Vietnam, he said, which reminded him of a song that he began to sing: "If you love your Uncle Sam, bring them home, bring them home."
None of his pro-war buddies took issue with him. But neither did they hum along.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MILITARY PLANNING; 
Iraq Strategy Is Seen as Delay and Urban Battle

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Iraq's strategy to thwart a United States-led attack calls for slowing advances by American troops toward Baghdad and then confronting them with the prospect of a bloody street battle in the Iraqi capital, according to American intelligence.
 To impede American and allied forces, Saddam Hussein's administration has developed plans to blow up dams, destroy bridges and ignite its oil fields, United States Defense Department officials say. They say Iraq may also deny food to Iraqi civilians in the southern parts of the country to try to create a crisis that would saddle advancing allied forces with the responsibility of caring for millions of desperate Iraqi civilians. 
 Once American and allied forces approach Baghdad, they will encounter two defensive rings of elite Republican Guard forces, the Defense Department officials say. Many of the Republican Guard forces are now dispersed, a move that is intended to help them survive the airstrikes that would open the allied campaign. But as allied ground forces approach Baghdad, the Iraqis are expected to rush to fighting positions that have already been stocked with ammunition and supplies. 
Some Republican Guard units are equipped with chemical protective gear, as are Special Republican Guard units and some intelligence and security forces inside Baghdad, according to intelligence reports. This is one of several signs that have led American officials to conclude that Iraq will try to use poison gas or germ weapons against the American and allied forces.
American intelligence officials have also concluded that it is likely that Iraq will try to strike Israel with Scud missiles, which they said could be armed with poison gas or germ warheads. "We have indications that their goal is to delay, impede and deny U.S. forces a clear and quick victory," a defense official said. "The basic strategy can be summed up as disperse, absorb and move to military operations in urban terrain."
As the United States, Britain, Australia and other members of President Bush's "coalition of the willing" prepare for military action to topple Mr. Hussein, American intelligence is working hard to figure out Iraq's intentions. American officials say Iraq's deployments and even statements by Mr. Hussein provide an indication of Baghdad's strategy.
Senior American military officials say they are aware of Iraq's options and are still confident of achieving a decisive victory and of avoiding a prolonged war. Allied ground forces are far better trained and equipped than Iraqi troops, and allied air forces already command the skies.
Iraq's army is about a third the size it was during the Persian Gulf war of 1991. There are mounting indications that the morale within Iraq's regular army and even some of the Republican Guard forces is low. Mr. Hussein faces multiple threats: one from the American-led invasion force and another from a restive Shiite population and perhaps some elements of his armed forces that would rather try a coup than see the United States invade and occupy the country. "At the end of the day, if called on, win we will," said Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the head of the United States Central Command, said in an interview.
Iraq, however, is striving to take a weak hand and make the best of it. Its objective is much different than it was in the 1991 conflict. During that war, Iraq's goal was to hold on to Kuwait, and it positioned the bulk of its ground forces far from its capital.
But this time, Mr. Hussein has one overriding goal: survival. His aim seems to be to force the Bush administration to seek a political compromise that stops short of toppling his administration by spurring fears of extensive allied casualties, dragging out the war and raising concern around the world over the fate of Iraqi civilians.
"There is no victory option for Iraq," said Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, a retired marine and former chief of the United States Central Command. "The question for Iraq is how to prolong the conflict. For Saddam, the goal is to inflict casualties and allow the Arab news networks to broadcast pictures of civilians dying. He will try to gather international support and try to find a place in history."
An American defense official said: "What lessons have they learned from the last war? They have learned that the possession of weapons of mass destruction is a force multiplier even if they are not used. And they have learned that they should not deploy forces out in the open but disperse them and then move into urban terrain and intermingle with the civilian population."

Slowing the Allied Advance
Drawing on its experience during the gulf war, Iraq is not mounting a major defense of its borders. But it is taking several steps to try to bog down American and allied forces as they try to advance to Baghdad. Defense Department officials said Iraq had shipped rail cars full of ammunition and demolition equipment to its oil fields. That spurred concerns that Iraq planned to blow them up to hamper the invasion and portray it as an economic and environmental catastrophe.
United States officials said Iraq had also considered plans to destroy dams and flood the Euphrates River, a move that could make it more difficult for forces to cross the river, slowing an offensive. Iraq's 11th Infantry Division has been stationed near the city of Nasiriya, where it can try to put down a Shiite rebellion in the city and guard the crossing points over the river. Iraq has also moved some light infantry and artillery south to the Basra area.
"If hostilities begin, Saddam is likely to employ a 'scorched earth' strategy, destroying food, transportation, energy and other infrastructures, attempting to create a humanitarian disaster significant enough to stop a military advance," Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Congress this week. He said the Iraqis would try to blame American forces for the damage.
Iraq is also positioning surface-to-surface missiles. Iraq has placed Al Samoud missiles north and west of Baghdad. American intelligence believes that the missile can travel much farther than the 90-mile range that is allowed by the United Nations. Iraq has also placed Ababil-50 and Ababil-100 missiles and Soviet-designed Frog rockets north of the capital. Defense Department officials say the missiles have been put in place both to strengthen Iraq's defenses in the north and to threaten population centers like Kirkuk and Mosul if they fall into the hands of American or Kurdish forces. 
To threaten Kuwait and American forces there, Iraq has also deployed mobile missile systems in the south near Basra. On Tuesday, American and British planes attacked an Ababil-100 mobile missile system there, and on Wednesday they hit another. Those missile deployments, as well as the deployment of an antiship missile launcher near Basra that was attacked last month, showed an escalation in Iraqi preparations.
American intelligence reports that Mr. Hussein has authorized his commanders to use chemical and perhaps biological weapons. It is difficult for intelligence experts to determine if the munitions being sent to Iraqi forces have chemical or conventional warheads. But American intelligence has noted that protective gear against chemical attack has been given to Special Republican Guard forces as well as intelligence and security personnel charged with defending Baghdad and other cities. It has been given to some Republican Guard units outside Baghdad as well.
United States intelligence agencies have concluded that Iraq will try to use chemical weapons against American forces. The intelligence agencies believe that Iraq has a small covert supply of long-range Scud missiles, which can be equipped with chemical or biological warheads. The intelligence agencies believe it is likely that Iraq will try to fire them at Israel in an effort to portray the war as a battle with an American and Israeli coalition and build support in the Arab world.

Defending Baghdad
It is in Baghdad, however, where Mr. Hussein's administration is expected to make its last stand. A city of 4.5 million, it is a potential urban battleground where Iraq has its best command and control and most loyal forces. The Pentagon has received reports that the city is stockpiling food, apparently preparing for a long siege. The approaches to Baghdad are protected by three Republican Guard divisions: the Medina to the south, Al Nida to the east and the Hammurabi to the west. The Republican Guard is considered Iraq's most capable and loyal force.
Mr. Hussein has kept regular army forces far from Baghdad, because he does not trust their loyalty and they are not deemed to be very effective. A brigade from the Third Armored Division, however, has been stationed for months at Ramadi, on a western approach to the capital.
To defend Baghdad, the Republican Guard units are establishing two defensive rings: the first is about 50 miles from Baghdad, and the second is on the outskirts of the capital. The use of defensive rings is part of a long-established Iraqi strategy, one that Iraq employed to protect Basra during its war with Iran and that Mr. Hussein talked about in a January speech to top military commanders.
Defense Department officials say that Iraq's defenses consist of fortified fighting positions, including dug-in emplacements for tanks and other heavy equipment. Iraq is not constructing long defensive lines or trenches as it did during the 1991 war. This appears to be part of Iraq's plan to ride out the American and allied airstrikes.
Having experienced 43 days of bombing leading up to the 1991 gulf war and four days of day and night bombing during the 1998 campaign ordered by the Clinton administration, Iraqi forces have considerable experience with American air power. Because of that, Iraq has dispersed its tanks and other heavy weapons. Some military equipment is also positioned near schools and mosques in an effort to shield them from attack.
Iraq's strategy seems to be to absorb the initial round of American airstrikes and then rush its forces to their fighting positions outside Baghdad before allied forces arrive. In terms of air defense, many batteries of antiaircraft artillery have been placed in Baghdad. The Iraqi military is constantly moving its mobile surface-to-air missile systems in an effort to elude American attack.

Fighting in the Streets
A central question, however, is whether Mr. Hussein will pull the Republican Guard divisions inside Baghdad as the Americans and their allies close in. Traditionally, only the Special Republican Guard and Iraq's intelligence and security services are allowed inside the capital, a precaution against coup attempts. 
"To fight effectively in the city, he will have to pull important elements of the Republican Guard inside," a defense official said. "But he will be extremely reluctant to do so until the last moment, since they can be as much a threat to him."
Perhaps the main factor is not the number of Iraqi troops nor their specific tactics: it may come down to the Iraqi military's will to fight against a technologically superior and better trained adversary. American intelligence officials believe that the morale of Iraq's regular army forces is low and on the decline. Even the morale of some Republican Guard units is suffering, officials say. 
Much will depend on whether Iraq's generals conclude that Mr. Hussein is going to fall, on how they assess their chances of surviving the fighting, and on what place they might secure in a postwar Iraq.
"We expect some resistance from the Republican Guard," a Defense Department official said. "From the regular army, we expect very little."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Iraqi Ground Forces Arrayed in Defense"American intelligence officials say that Iraq's strategy to defend against a possible American attack is to confront the U.S. with the prospect of a bloody urban battle in Baghdad. The capital is surrounded by three of the six divisions of the Republican Guard, a better-equipped and more loyal force than the regular army. The army's 17 divisions are mainly tasked with controlling the northern part of the country, near the Kurdish area, and suppressing uprisings in the Shiitedominated south.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Advice: Eat, Drink and Don't Worry 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
It was a tale of two New Yorks yesterday as an upbeat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg greeted tourists in Times Square while thousands of protesters rallied against a possible war with Iraq and the threat it could pose to a city already on edge over fears of terrorism.
 At the TKTS ticket booth, a casually dressed, sneaker-wearing Mr. Bloomberg shook hands, shared small talk and even recommended a few shows: "Les Miserables," "Hairspray," "The Lion King." 
 He said he was delivering a personal thanks to tourists and to New Yorkers, but also demonstrating his faith in the city's safety. "There's been some reports of people being afraid to go out to restaurants and canceling their reservations," he told reporters. "But it doesn't seem like that's happening. The city's safe and people should go out and enjoy themselves."
Tourism experts and officials at several New York City hotels concurred with Mr. Bloomberg, saying that worry over the latest federal terror alert did not appear to have had much impact on business.
"We've had some guests who want to be reassured," said Kathleen Duffy, a spokeswoman for the Marriott hotels, which has 12 hotels in New York City and nearby. "But we haven't as a result seen any kind of increase in guests calling to cancel or to say that they're afraid to come to New York City. Those who have called, all say they're not worried."
The president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, Tim Tompkins, said an informal survey of theater owners and hotel operators revealed no major problem. "Sure, we've seen some pretty dramatic pictures of officers on the streets with guns, but the reality is that the city and Times Square are safer than ever."
It is a message that the mayor, a man known for spending his weekends privately, appeared determined to drive home yesterday, despite a biting chill in the air and the swarm of reporters and photographers who made his orchestrated time on the town seem all the more awkward.
"Hi. Mike Bloomberg. What are you going to see?" he asked again and again of visitors from Staten Island to San Diego. Most of them welcomed the chance to shake Mr. Bloomberg's hand, to exchange a hug and, in some cases, to thank him.
"Mayor, been here a week and loving it!" a man from Ohio shouted.
"Tell people back home," Mr. Bloomberg replied.
He made a similar request of a Portland, Ore., resident who said he was born in New York City. "Come back," Mr. Bloomberg implored. "We need the taxes."
Several times during his hourlong meet-and-greet, the mayor conceded that his job had not been easy lately.
As one man in the crowd remarked about having had the opportunity to meet former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Bloomberg smiled, then said: "He's a tough act to follow. But he left the city in good shape."

HEADLINE: Trade Center Developer Objects to City's Insurance Talks 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who controls the World Trade Center lease, claims that his effort to get the largest possible insurance settlement to rebuild Lower Manhattan is being undermined by city officials.
 With public officials on the verge of adopting a development proposal for the site, Mr. Silverstein has complained in recent weeks that despite his legal obligation to rebuild the trade center he has been shut out of the planning process. At the same time, he said he has been undermined in his negotiations with the 23 insurance companies that provided coverage for the trade center. 
 Mr. Silverstein is battling the insurers in court, claiming that there were two separate attacks on two buildings at the trade center, entitling him to a double payment of nearly $7 billion that he would use for rebuilding.
In what one participant described as a confrontational meeting at City Hall on Thursday, Mr. Silverstein told Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg that the city's plan to take control of the 16-acre site and billions of dollars in insurance proceeds was unrealistic, according to people on both sides who were there.
According to an executive who had been briefed on the City Hall meeting, Mr. Silverstein also objected to contact between the insurance companies and City Hall that he said undermined his efforts. That was a reference to what Mr. Silverstein believes were secret negotiations between Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, and Jacques E. Dubois, chairman of Swiss Re America, the largest of the insurers, over a possible insurance settlement, said the executive who had been briefed.
Mr. Doctoroff, who attended the City Hall meeting, acknowledged that he had met with Mr. Dubois, but said the discussions were for informational purposes and did not constitute secret settlement negotiations.
"I have met with Jacques," Mr. Doctoroff said on Friday, "just as I've met with every party in this thing, to understand the issues."
Mr. Silverstein was on his yacht over the weekend and unavailable for comment. Michael McNamara, a spokesman for Swiss Re, said: "We have meetings with many officials, both public and private. We don't comment on those meetings. We intend to be a good corporate citizen."
Mr. Doctoroff has met Mr. Dubois before, over the city's Olympic bid. In December 2001, Swiss Re pledged to contribute at least $100,000 to NYC2012, a group founded by Mr. Doctoroff to promote the city's bid to be the host of the 2012 Olympic Games. Mr. Doctoroff resigned from the group after he became deputy mayor.
Mr. Bloomberg has outlined a vision for Lower Manhattan that is at odds with Mr. Silverstein's. The mayor has proposed that the city take over the trade center site in a land swap with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which currently owns the land. Under this plan, the city would buy out Mr. Silverstein and get the insurance proceeds, which could be spent on housing, transportation and other things both off and on the site. The mayor's plan envisioned negotiating a $5 billion insurance settlement. Mr. Doctoroff said that the number was merely an estimate and not the result of discussions with Swiss Re. 
But Mr. Silverstein told the mayor that the city's plan was not feasible.
Six weeks before the terrorist attack on the trade center, Mr. Silverstein completed a deal with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey valued at $3.2 billion to lease the twin towers for 99 years. His partner, Westfield America, leased the 450,000-square-foot underground mall.
Mr. Silverstein said that under his lease, he is obligated to rebuild the 10 million square feet of office space that once stood at the trade center. But the two rebuilding proposals currently under consideration depict far less commercial space on the site. Mr. Silverstein contends that anything less than 10 million plays into the hands of the insurance companies, because they pay correspondingly less money.
"They're going to have to be tweaked to get up to 10 million square feet," Mr. Silverstein said of the proposals.
His legal battles with the insurance companies have involved months of litigation and a host of claims and counterclaims, mostly expressed in dry legal terms. But Swiss Re has been unusually personal and vitriolic, describing Mr. Silverstein as a rapacious developer whose insurance claims are "extortionate" and a "self-motivated hoax."
Last August, Mr. Dubois of Swiss Re expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Doctoroff's land swap proposal. "I think it's an opportunity for the city to take charge of the site," he said, adding, "We'd be much more amenable in our negotiations if we thought the beneficiaries were the people of New York, rather than someone claiming a huge windfall."
The remarks prompted one lawyer to wonder how an insurance company could offer two different settlements depending not on the insurance contract, but on the identity of the recipient.
The Silverstein camp expressed outrage, suggesting that Mr. Doctoroff was doing the work of the insurance companies, an industry with which he was familiar during his career as an investment banker.

U.S. Seeks Final Tests On Iraqi Disarmament
Seeking more persuasive evidence that Iraq continues to defy United Nations weapons inspectors, the Bush administration plans to work with the inspectors to demand a set of final specific tests of Saddam Hussein's willingness to disarm in the next two weeks, administration officials said. 1

Iraq's strategy to thwart a United States-led attack calls for slowing American troops' advance toward Baghdad and then confronting them with the prospect of a bloody street battle in the Iraq capital. There are several signs poison gas or germ weapons will be used against the American forces, officials say. 1

Israeli Tank Destroyed
Four Israeli soldiers were killed when a bomb destroyed a tank in the Gaza Strip. The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility as a retaliation for a clash earlier in the week. 4

Bolivian President in Crisis
A deepening economic crisis and an energetic opposition threaten the presidency of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia. Violence has gripped the nation, with 29 people killed, and government ministries and downtown businesses looted and set on fire. 3

An Art and Balance In Issuing Terror Alerts
Even as Tom Ridge, the Homeland Security secretary, suggested that some people had overreacted to warnings about terrorism, he insisted that the administration was pleased by how its new color-coded public-warning system was working. 1

The Astronauts' Families
The families left behind by the Columbia disaster have been moving in two worlds: one defined by the international spectacle surrounding the loss of the shuttle, and the other, a more private one. 1

Lawsuit Against Wal-Mart
A discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest employer, accuses it of favoring men in promotions and pay. 22

Florida has kept the ballots from the 2000 presidential election for two years, as federal law requires. The time is up, and state officials must decide what to do with them. 22

Bill on Cruise Industry
A provision in the spending bill approved by Congress seeks to revive Hawaii's cruise industry by giving one company the right to sail luxury liners entirely within the state. 31

Huge Crowd in New York Rallies Against War in Iraq
Amid heavy security, a huge crowd rallied within sight of the United Nations. They raised banners of patriotism and dissent, sounded the hymns of a broad new antiwar movement and heard speakers denounce what they called President Bush's rush to war, while offering no sympathy for Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein. 1

In cities throughout the United States, protesters opposed to war with Iraq used traditional and some unique ways to make their voices heard. 21

In European cities, 1.5 million people marched in a huge protest against possible war in Iraq. 20

A Choice of Custody or Care
Parents of some severely mentally ill children are being urged to give up custody of their children and turn them over to New York State's child welfare agencies for mental health care that they otherwise cannot afford or gain access to. Repeatedly, these parents say, they are told that giving up their children is the only way to help them. 35

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: OVERVIEW; 
From New York To Melbourne, Cries for Peace

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Confronting America's countdown to war, throngs of chanting, placard-waving demonstrators converged on New York and scores of cities across the United States, Europe and Asia yesterday in a global daisy chain of largely peaceful protests against the Bush administration's threatened invasion of Iraq.
 Three years after vast crowds turned out around the world to celebrate the new millennium, millions gathered again yesterday in a darker mood of impending conflict, forming a patchwork of demonstrations that together, organizers said, made up the largest, most diverse peace protest since the Vietnam War. 
 On a wintry day in New York, huge crowds, prohibited by a court order from marching, rallied within sight of the United Nations amid heavy security. They raised banners of patriotism and dissent, sounded the hymns of a broad new antiwar movement and heard speakers denounce what they called President Bush's rush to war, while offering no sympathy for Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein.
"The World Says No to War," proclaimed a huge banner over a stage on First Avenue near 51st Street, the focal point of crowds that filled the avenue from 49th Street to 72nd Street and spilled over into side streets and to Second, Third and Lexington Avenues, where thousands more were halted at police barricades, far from the sights and sounds of the demonstration. 
Crowd estimates are often little more than politically tinged guesses. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, put the crowd at about 100,000, while the organizers said 400,000 people attended. Given the sea of faces extending more than a mile up First Avenue and the ancillary crowds that were prevented from joining them, it seemed that somethingin between was probable.
There were similar though smaller demonstrations in Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, San Diego, Sacramento, Miami, Detroit, Milwaukee and scores of other American cities, organized under the umbrella of United for Peace and Justice, a coalition of 120 organizations.
In London, 500,000 to 750,000 people rallied in Hyde Park, while 200,000 gathered at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and hundreds of thousands more protested in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Barcelona, Rome, Melbourne, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Auckland, Seoul, Tokyo and Manila. Many contended that America's interest in Iraq had more to do with oil than with disarming a dangerous tyrant. Page 20. 
Protests unfolded in more than 350 cities around the world -- some drawing hundreds of thousands, others only a few hundred -- and for the most part the dissents were peaceful. The police in Athens fired tear gas and clashed with demonstrators who threw a gasoline bomb, but no serious injuries were reported.
In New York, the police reported at least 295 arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct, and said that a deputy inspector had been assaulted and taken to a hospital and that two horses were hurt. But at day's end, Commissioner Kelly said: "I think it went well. For the number of people here, it was orderly. The vast majority of people were cooperative."
The demonstrations were the culmination of a global campaign that has been building for weeks in opposition to the growing threat of war, with thousands marching, rallying, signing petitions, raising money, publishing articles and using the Internet to enlist a diverse coalition of citizens and celebrities.
Unlike the stereotypically scruffy, pot-smoking, flag-burning anarchists of the Vietnam era, yesterday's protesters came from a wide range of the political spectrum: college students, middle-aged couples, families with small children, older people who had marched for civil rights, and groups representing labor, the environment and religious, business and civic organizations.
President Bush was the chief villain, a casualty of what some called an obsession with his father's Persian Gulf War in 1991 and its failure to oust Saddam Hussein. Other targets were Vice President Dick Cheney; Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
"I came to go to the rally and be a part of a global voice against going to war against Iraq again," said Mary Baxter, 31, employed by a software company in Cambridge, Mass., and whose quiet solemnity seemed typical. "I feel the current administration has been escalating and destabilizing things. I'm disappointed that Colin Powell is going along with Bush, Cheney and the rest of them."
Angela Tsang, 21, a Barnard College student who was part of a contingent called the Columbia University Antiwar Coalition, said her group believed that an American attack on Iraq would achieve nothing but death and injustice.
"We see the war against Iraq as unjust," she said. "We don't believe Bush's rhetoric. I think he's not acting in the best interest of the American people. We're risking the lives of hundreds of American soldiers and an untold number of lives in the Middle East, and a war will not solve the problem of terrorism. It disgusts me. I can't accept that."
Beyond criticizing Mr. Bush and his lieutenants, many protesters offered nuanced arguments about the conflict, agreeing that President Hussein should not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction, but insisting that pre-emptive military strikes were morally bankrupt and would harm the economy, deepen the divisions between America and the Arab world and undermine United States alliances in Europe and Asia.
It was a hard day for a rally in New York. The ground was frozen and the protesters were buttoned to the neck against the 25-degree cold and an icy wind that scythed off the East River and scorched the face. But the crowd was enthusiastic: cheering speakers, chanting antiwar slogans and raising banners that promoted other agendas as well, including "Free Palestine" and "Free Medical Marijuana."
They were joined by several celebrities, including Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, the folk singer Pete Seeger and the actors Danny Glover, Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte. American flags and other symbols of patriotism waved in the crowds.
Children from Public School 3 brought a 15-foot balloon of the earth. It was punctured going under a bridge, but they patched it with duct tape. "We're trying to fix the world," 10-year-old Sonia Santzoord deadpanned.
The singer Richie Havens led off the proceedings with a rendition of "Freedom," the song he performed 34 years ago on Max Yasgur's farm for the Woodstock Festival.
"Peace! Peace! Peace!" Bishop Tutu, the 71-year-old veteran of the peace movement, declared. "Let America listen to the rest of the world -- and the rest of the world is saying, 'Give the inspectors time.' "
Martin Luther King III told the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, "Just because you have the biggest gun does not mean you must use it."
One face in the crowd belonged to Michael Callandrillo, 53, a teacher from Dover, N.J. "I've been to demonstrations and rallies all over the country, and some have had a nasty feel to them," he said. "Others have had a lackluster feeling. But this one feels just right. People are informed, people are passionate. People don't want trouble. They just want to be heard."
All morning, trains and buses had converged on Midtown Manhattan, disgorging groups from New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland and other states. Walking crosstown to the rally, tens of thousands of would-be protesters encountered a maze of barricades and a huge police presence blocking their way. Banging drums, chanting "Whose streets? Our streets," the surging crowds spilled off sidewalks onto jammed streets and avenues on the East Side. Some occasionally clashed with police officers.
Under a federal court order, the demonstrators in New York were prohibited from staging a march, which city officials had said might be dangerous to the protesters, a notion that drew scoffs from the imperiled. Instead, they were limited to a rally behind barricades, a more pacific, less powerful expression of protest, but one that made matters easier for the police.
The police had set up a series of blocklong pens along the mile of First Avenue set aside for the rally. The pens were filled by noon when the rally began, and thousands of demonstrators were caught behind barricades on East Side avenues and streets and were either delayed or unable to reach the rally.
Frustrations grew and tempers flared. Dozens were arrested on disorderly conduct charges when they tried to breach the police lines at Second Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets, where many in the crowd were waving Palestinian flags and chanting "Free Palestine."
At Third Avenue and 52nd Street, a rearing horse threw a mounted police officer when a demonstrator set off firecrackers. No one was hurt, but several demonstrators were swiftly wrestled to the ground and arrested.
The arrests led to bitter complaints last night that some of those being detained were kept waiting for hours in buses before being charged.
"People are sitting in vans out in the cold with no food and no bathrooms," said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
"People are being subjected to confinement under harsh conditions."
Police officials said some of the detainees were still awaiting processing early today, but denied that anyone had been mistreated.
Detective Robert Price, a police spokesman, said all of those under arrest were confined to heated buses and provided with food and access to bathrooms.
The police did not disclose details of their security operation, but did say that 5,000 officers were involved. It appeared that the police had not anticipated such a large crowd. At 1:45 p.m., Chief Joseph J. Esposito, the highest-ranking uniformed officer, ordered the department's highest mobilization, a rare measure that brought 1,000 officers from precincts and other commands around town. The alert was last used in November 2001, when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in the Rockaways.

HEADLINE: Bush Loyalist's New Role Is 'Facilitator' in House 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
United States Representative Rob Portman is President Bush's man in the House.
 "We listen to him closely," said Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, the chief salesman for Mr. Bush's economic plan. 
 Mr. Portman has known Mr. Bush for 15 years, worked in his father's White House and is devoted to the president. "He has a clear sense of what makes this country great," Mr. Portman said of Mr. Bush. "It makes it worthwhile being here to be with someone who has that passion." 
In his sixth term representing a district that includes parts of Cincinnati and its suburbs, Mr. Portman is also a trusted adviser to the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert. This week, Mr. Hastert formally appointed him to preside over meetings of the House Republican leadership and to be the leaders' official liaison to the White House.
Mr. Portman said he saw himself "as a facilitator, as someone who can take proposals from the White House and help to formulate them so they can make it through the Congressional process, hopefully making them better."
Given all that, it was striking this week when Mr. Portman declared in an interview that he was opposed to an important feature of the president's tax plan -- new tax-favored savings accounts. He said that he was "a champion of the rest of the tax plan" but that the new savings accounts would actually discourage workers from setting aside money for their retirement and reduce incentives for owners of small businesses to establish retirement plans for their employees.
Mr. Evans, who had breakfast with Mr. Portman on Thursday and heard his objections, said that the White House had not given up on the savings accounts but that "they aren't central to the president's economic growth package."
Mr. Portman, 47, sits on the Ways and Means and Budget committees and is a rare breed in the House. More than shaking hands or making speeches, he said, what he enjoys most in politics is mastering complicated issues. "I love legislating," he said. "I love solving hard problems."
He is also one of the few Republicans who regularly form alliances with important Democrats to get legislation enacted. 
He made a name for himself early in his career in the House when he joined with John Glenn, then a Democratic senator from Ohio, to write legislation that tried to limit the ability of Washington to compel states to take action without providing enough money to do the job.
For the last several years, he and Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, have co-sponsored bills that would increase the maximum tax-deductible contribution workers could make to their 401(k) accounts and individual retirement accounts and raise the age at which retirees must start withdrawing money. If the president's proposed savings accounts are rejected, the Portman-Cardin measure is a likely substitute.
In an interview, Mr. Cardin said of Mr. Portman: "He's one of the most intense individuals I've ever met. On a lot of issues, he's been able to get to the goal line. That's not something you can say of a lot of members."
In fact, in interviews around the Capitol this week, no one could be found who would say anything unfavorable about Mr. Portman. The closest was a Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee who insisted on not being identified and then said in almost a whisper that Mr. Portman's pleasant manner masked an extremely conservative philosophy. But even this Democrat said he admired Mr. Portman's ability to master tough topics and have friendly relationships across party lines.
Mr. Portman is an archetype of an older generation of Republican politician. He is a descendant of Quaker abolitionists whose father started a business from scratch and did well enough to send him to an exclusive private day school and Dartmouth College.
Right out of college, Mr. Portman worked as an advance man for the Republican vice president, George Bush. By the time Mr. Bush ran for president in 1988, Mr. Portman had a law degree from the University of Michigan and had worked several years for a Washington lobbying firm. He worked on the Bush campaign and, after the election, went to work in the White House, first in the White House counsel's office and then as the president's chief lobbyist. 
After two years in the White House, he returned to Cincinnati to practice law. When the veteran Republican congressman from the district where he had grown up, Willis D. Gradison, retired, Mr. Portman ran for the seat in a special election in 1993 and won.
He was an early supporter of George W. Bush's presidential campaign, stumped in New Hampshire for him in January 2000 and played the roles of Al Gore and Joseph I. Lieberman when Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney practiced for the debates.
While Mr. Portman's pedigree is that of a Main Street Republican, he has adapted easily to the social conservatism of the modern party. 
Before he joined the White House staff in 1989, he said, he had not thought much about abortion as a policy issue. "But I became exposed to the pro-life position when I was in the White House," he said, "so when I went back to run for Congress, I felt very comfortable running as a pro-life Republican."
He said he had also not thought much about gay rights and had never been pressed on the issue by a constituent. But he said he had "a strong faith" as a Methodist and accepted "this notion that a man and a woman as found in the Bible come together and have children, and that is sort of a basic building block."
Mr. Portman said he expected to spend most of the rest of this year working as a bridge between the White House and the House Republican leadership to facilitate enactment of all the parts of the president's tax plan except the new savings accounts.
"I know a lot of people at the White House," he said the other evening, sitting in his office across the street from the Capitol. "And I know a lot of people up here, and having worked at the White House and having worked here, I know how the process works.
"And I'm very, very enthusiastic about George W. Bush. I feel he has the right vision for where we ought to go as a country."

A Wall Street Tribute to a Mayor (And Criticism of a Governor)

BYLINE:  By Patrick McGeehan (COMPILED BY MARK A. STEIN) 

 BODY:
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York spoke at a dinner in his honor last Monday, he was so careful not to blame state officials for the city's financial predicament that guests might have thought Gov. George E. Pataki was in the room. 
 But when Felix G. Rohatyn followed the mayor, it was clear that the governor was absent. Mr. Rohatyn, an investment banker who helped guide the city through its financial crisis in the 1970's, felt free to blast the Albany crowd for failing to lend a hand. 
 "I have a very negative view with respect to the economy and what the state is doing to the city or is not doing for the city," Mr. Rohatyn said in an interview on Friday.
He said his remarks on Monday were in the spirit of the event, which was sponsored by the Yale School of Management and held in the trustees room at the New York Public Library. Billed as a tribute to the mayor for what Yale said was his "distinguished leadership in global capital markets," the event seemed more like a rehearsal for "Wall Street Week"
Among the few dozen powerful people seated alphabetically around a quadrangle of tables were Nobuyuki Idei, the chairman and chief executive of Sony; Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico; Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of the News Corporation; Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive of American Express; and Nancy B. Peretsman, managing director of Allen & Company. Patrick McGeehan

HEADLINE: The Man In Our Memory 

BYLINE:  By Doris Kearns Goodwin; Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of "No Ordinary Time, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II," is writing a history of Abraham Lincoln's White House.

DATELINE: CONCORD, Mass. 

 BODY:
Carved on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial are these words: "In this Temple, as in the hearts of the people, for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."
 As we celebrate Lincoln on this President's Day, nearly two centuries after his birth, his memory is clearly "enshrined forever" in our hearts. Yet, for Lincoln, the inscription marks the fulfillment of a lifelong dream that through much of his life he feared would never be realized -- the desire to achieve, through his own acts, what the Greeks called kleos, the glory that won lasting remembrance in the minds of his fellow citizens. 
 Politics established an early hold on Lincoln. At age 23, after residing for only six months in the small town of New Salem, Ill., he decided to run for the state legislature. The statement he published to announce his candidacy revealed both his fierce ambition -- and his doubts. 
"Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition," he wrote. "I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition, is yet to be developed." Should he lose, he confessed, he had "been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined." And, not surprisingly, when the votes were tallied, the little-known Lincoln found that he had lost. 
He ran again two years later, and this time, he won, beginning the first of four successive terms in the state Legislature. But the era did not seem ripe for memorable deeds. In a speech delivered to the Young Men's Lyceum in Springfield, Ill., when he was 28, he lamented that his generation did not face the same historic challenges that had confronted the founding fathers -- that "forest of giant oaks," he called them, who had built "a political edifice of liberty and equal rights," and had thus become immortalized, "their names . . . revered and sung, and toasted through all time." He feared that since the "field of glory" had already been "harvested," only small ambitions beckoned to his generation.
Lincoln still felt this way three years later, when, at the age of 31, he fell into a crippling depression. The situation was so serious that his friends, fearing he was suicidal, watched over him and took the razors, knives and sharp items from his room. "I am now the most miserable man living," he confessed. "Whether I shall ever be better I can not tell; I awfully forebode I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better."
The immediate event that set off Lincoln's depression, most historians agree, was his broken engagement to Mary Todd. The episode left him devastated, not only because he had hurt Mary, but also because he had long considered his ability to keep his word "the chief gem of his character." Now he could no longer trust himself in that regard.
But in that melancholy winter, he was suffering from the failure of ambition as well as love. Throughout his career in the state legislature, he had championed government support for a series of public projects to construct bridges, roads and harbors so that people living in isolated rural areas could bring produce to market. He believed, as he said later, that the "leading object" of government was to "lift artificial weights from all shoulders . . . to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life." But when a sustained recession hit the state in the late 1830's, his beloved projects were stopped in midstream, and the state itself fell into bankruptcy. As a major proponent of the costly system that had contributed to Illinois's travails, Lincoln received a significant share of the blame. Now, beyond his sadness over a lost love, he carried the added burden of a damaged reputation, and forlorn hopes for the future.
As Lincoln's spirits continued to sink, his best friend, Joshua Speed, went to his side and, in a conversation both men would remember as long as they lived, warned Lincoln that if he did not rally, he would most certainly die. Lincoln replied that he was more than willing to die, except that "he had done nothing to make any human being remember that he had lived."
Even in this moment of despair, it was Lincoln's ambition to accomplish something that would leave the world "a little better for my having lived in it" that carried him forward. It wasn't simply a desire for power or popularity. It was something more profound -- the yearning to establish an admirable reputation on earth. 
Despite Lincoln's deepening belief in an all-powerful God as he grew older, he was not free from doubt about the existence of an afterlife. It was this uncertainty, Robert V. Bruce argues in his essay "The Riddle of Death," that further fueled Lincoln's passion to live on in the minds of others. Though Lincoln could include an ambiguous reference to life after death in a comforting letter to his dying father, there is no clear evidence in his vast public and private writings that he himself believed in heavenly rest. 
These doubts may have been planted by his mother, who died when Lincoln was nine. Bidding her son farewell, she made no promise of a heavenly reunion. As Lincoln later told Speed, she simply said, "I am going away from you, Abraham; I shall never see you again." The firm look on her face, Lincoln said, "haunted" him for years to come. 
Lincoln revealed his own inability to take comfort in the afterlife when his first love, 22-year-old Ann Rutledge, died from what was probably typhoid in 1835. He responded to a friend who asked him whether he believed in a future realm: "I'm afraid there isn't. It isn't a pleasant thing to think that when we die that is the last of us." 
Determined to accomplish something so worthy that when he died, his memory, at least, would live on, Lincoln spent the winter of 1841 gradually recovering from the depression that followed his breakup with Mary. The silent resolve that had given him strength for so many years reasserted itself once more. He returned to his law practice, resumed his duties in the legislature and, less than two years later, finally married Mary Todd. In 1846, Lincoln was elected to Congress, but his single term was uneventful and, when he returned to Springfield, he admitted he "was losing interest in politics." 
But in the mid-1850's, the wheel of history turned. The rising intensity of the antislavery movement led to the creation of the Republican Party. As the sectional divide became more and more combustible, Lincoln's unparalleled skills as a politician and orator propelled him to the White House and presidential greatness. 
Not long after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, his old friend, Joshua Speed, visited him at the White House. Lincoln reminded him of their talks during his depression 20 years earlier. "I believe that in this measure," Lincoln said, referring to the proclamation, "my fondest hopes will be realized." And so they were.
Before Sept. 11, many of us might have felt, as young Lincoln did when he was young, that the "field of glory" had been harvested by previous generations -- that the times seemed somehow trivial. But then the wheel of history turned again. With the war against terror, and the anxieties provoked by warnings of future attacks on American soil, our generation has been provided with its own historic challenge. While our worries are great, even greater opportunities exist for leaders and citizens alike to win the lasting glory. Let us hope that we, and those who lead us, will, like Lincoln, be inspired by the noble ambition to accomplish reputable deeds worthy of remembrance.

To the Editor:
Re "A Crush of Applicants," by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 10): 
 Starting in December, information sessions have been held in Chicago for a training and hiring initiative to link residents to jobs at the new Chicago Manufacturing Campus, which comprises suppliers of automotive parts to a major auto manufacturer. 
Hiring for the jobs, which start at $10 an hour with a few reaching nearly $100,000 a year, begins this spring and continues through 2004. All told, about 1,000 people will be employed. 
 Yet rumors and misinformation on the Internet that the auto company itself would be hiring on the spot at the sessions were too tantalizing for many people not to believe. Despite the city's efforts to counter the false information, many people lined up anyway, hoping for a chance at immediate employment.
The lesson is that the Bush administration's proposed cuts in the budget for work force development are unconscionable when so many people need work.

HEADLINE: South Korea, in Deal With Chile, Signs Its First Free-Trade Pact 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Chile and South Korea signed a free-trade agreement on Saturday that could set a precedent for similar deals for Korea with other Pacific Rim countries.
 Despite protests from Korean farmers who see themselves as victims of globalization, the agreement would remove tariffs on two-thirds of Korean products, notably cars and electronic items, including semiconductors, as well as a wide range of farm products. Tariffs would be removed on virtually all Chilean manufactured goods and on a range of farm products. 
 In signing the pact, the two countries overcame some of the same problems that cast a pall over efforts of the World Trade Organization to cut tariffs on agricultural products this weekend in Tokyo. That meeting concluded today without an agreement.
Yonhap, the semiofficial South Korean news agency, said the signing of a free-trade agreement, Korea's first, "means a new start in trade policy for South Korea." The news agency said South Korea was looking for similar deals with Japan, Mexico and Singapore and is studying the possibility of free-trade agreements with other Southeast Asian countries.
The agreement was also seen as opening the gates of South Korea, a country that continues to present barriers, often in the form of regulations and subsidies, to increased foreign competition. 
While Chile recently reached a free-trade agreement with the United States and has agreements with the European Union, Canada and Mexico, Korea has shunned them for fear of adverse reaction from manufacturers as well as farmers.
Indicative of the importance of the agreement was that President Kim Dae Jung and Chile's president, Ricardo Lagos, attended the signing ceremony.
President-elect Roh Moo Hyun, who succeeds Mr. Kim on Feb. 25, also met with the Chilean leader. Mr. Roh promised to press South Korea's National Assembly to approve the agreement, which would take effect 30 days after ratification by both countries.
For Mr. Roh to support such an agreement means that he is willing to risk losing the support of thousands of farmers, whose votes are needed in elections for National Assembly members in April 2004. Those elections are unusually important since Mr. Roh is hoping that his Millennium Democratic Party, which holds a minority in the assembly, will finally win a majority.
Several thousand farmers demonstrated on Friday and Saturday in Seoul, protesting that easy access for competitive products would destroy their livelihoods. The protests were relatively small since the agreement does not remove barriers to the import of rice, the most important Korean agricultural product. 
But the issue of rice may hamper negotiations for a free-trade agreement with Japan, which continues to assiduously protect its farmers against rice grown in other countries.
Korean officials said they expected that the sale of Korean cars in Chile would surpass that of Japan as a result of the agreement. Korean cars last year captured 26 percent of the motor vehicle market in Chile, which spent a total of $409 million in 2002 on imports from Korea. 
Chile, in turn, earned $715 million from exports to Korea, most notably copper.

HEADLINE: 2 Phone Giants in Court to Fight Turkish Family 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
After more than a year of pretrial maneuvering, an effort by two of the world's largest phone equipment companies, Motorola and Nokia, to paint themselves as victims of a huge fraud by a secretive Turkish family is scheduled to go to trial tomorrow in a federal court in New York.
 The two phone giants are trying to recover as much as possible of the $2.8 billion they lent Telsim, a Turkish cellular start-up controlled by the Uzan family, to buy equipment and enter the fast-growing Turkish market. 
 The battle is being waged on multiple fronts, including courts in Britain and Turkey, and in Washington, where Motorola has sought the support of the Bush administration. On Thursday, operating under a British court order, Motorola seized one of the Uzans' private jets when it landed in Germany.
Meanwhile, Motorola and several of its top executives are facing a growing number of shareholder lawsuits complaining that the company inflated its stock price in 2000 and 2001 by announcing the sale of more than $1.5 billion in equipment to Telsim without disclosing that it had provided even more than that in loans to finance the sales. Motorola says the suits are without merit. 
The Uzans, who were not available for interviews and whose representatives declined to speak on the record, have argued in interviews and in court that the entire conflict reflects their suppliers' unwillingness to face up to the losses stemming from the global crash in the telecommunications markets, recession in Turkey and a large devaluation of the Turkish lira. They say the main issue is whether Telsim's problems were beyond their control and that the terms of the agreements call for arbitration of such issues in Switzerland. 
But the Uzans are being sued in New York under state fraud laws and the federal racketeering law originally designed to attack organized crime. If Motorola and Nokia win, they will ask that the damages be tripled, as the racketeering law allows. The problem, they say, is not one of contract interpretation but of deliberate deception, manipulation of the Turkish courts and financial skulduggery.
Although American courts tend to support arbitration clauses strongly in business contracts, Federal District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan has ruled that Telsim's contracts do not apply because the suits are against the people who control Telsim and not the company itself. 
Judge Rakoff also ruled that the contract allowed the suppliers to go to court rather than arbitration. The trial is expected to end quickly and decisively in the companies' favor. Last May, when Judge Rakoff froze the Uzans' New York assets, including eight apartments, he said that "every preliminary indication" pointed to "repeated acts of fraud and chicanery" adding up to "a rather massive swindle."
Since then, the Uzans have defied additional orders by Judge Rakoff. They have obtained a Turkish court ruling ordering that the New York suit be halted. None of the defendants or their lawyers plan to attend the trial. Judge Rakoff last fall imposed contempt fines starting at $100 million a month and doubling each month, but that ruling was stayed on appeal. 
The family has similarly ignored orders entered by a British court, leading to 15-month jail terms being imposed on Kemal Uzan, the family patriarch, and Murat Hakan Uzan and Cem Cengiz Uzan, his two sons. The court imposed a four-month sentence on Aysegul Akay, their sister. But there has been no move to extradite any of the family from Turkey.
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., argues that it is owed more than $2 billion by Telsim, while Nokia, based in Finland, is seeking $700 million. Both have written off the entire value of the loans. 
They are confronting one of the world's wealthiest families, according to Forbes, which estimated the Uzans' net worth last year at $1.3 billion. The Uzans' far-flung business empire comprises well over 100 companies, including the construction company that Kemal Uzan started in the 1950's, power and communications businesses, banks and media properties. 
Back when the Turkish government awarded Telsim a license to compete with Turkcell, the country's first provider of digital cellular service, Motorola saw a golden opportunity. Motorola, which had previously sold small amounts of analog cellular equipment to Telsim, signed a supply agreement early in 1998 and also provided $200 million to help Telsim acquire its licenses.
"Telsim had 400,000 out of about 1.2 million cellular subscribers in Turkey when we made the first loan," said Scott Wyman, a spokesman for Motorola. "By late 2000, it had 4.8 million out of about 14.4 million. And with 65 million people in Turkey, there was plenty of room for more penetration. Obviously, we were right about the opportunity."
But the growth was not producing profits. Indeed, it was creating demands for more equipment, and frequent amendments to the supply agreement raised the total that Telsim had been loaned to $1.9 billion, not counting interest payments. 
Meanwhile, Telsim also began borrowing from Nokia to buy the company's equipment. Telsim began defaulting on payments late in 2000. The obvious way out was to sell the company to a large foreign carrier, but deals that the Uzans kept suggesting were imminent never occurred. A chance meeting of executives of the two equipment companies in Turkey the following January raised suspicions that they were being lied to and played against each other. 
Motorola took comfort in the fact that nearly two-thirds of Telsim's stock had been pledged to it as collateral. And Nokia had similar rights to nearly 8 percent more. But that security evaporated in April of 2001 when the Uzans, without telling Motorola or Nokia, held a Telsim shareholders meeting that tripled the outstanding shares. Suddenly, the equipment companies had no chance of forcing a Telsim sale by taking control. Then the telecom crash hit, sending the value of the company plunging.
The Uzans have also countered the attack in American and British courts with lawsuits filed in Turkey. They have arranged for criminal charges to be filed against Motorola and Nokia executives, who they say threatened to injure them physically. The companies say the accusations are a form of harassment and are fighting them in Turkish courts. Another set of actions has resulted in a ruling that they claim makes it impossible for them to obey Judge Rakoff's orders to transfer Telsim stock to the court in New York.
American and Turkish business executives are watching the battle closely, said Lincoln McCurdy, president of the American-Turkish Council, a nonprofit business group based in Washington that supports relations between the two countries. The results so far underscore the need for reform of Turkey's legal system, Mr. McCurdy said. But he added that many executives fault Motorola for becoming so involved with the Uzans, who have been in frequent legal battles at home.
"A lot of business executives are asking how stupid Motorola could have been to enter such arrangements," Mr. McCurdy said. "The Uzans never had a blue-chip reputation."
Perhaps the single most important evidence before Judge Rakoff tomorrow will be a report completed last month by Motorola and Nokia's accounting expert, Antony B. Samuel of PricewaterhouseCoopers in London.
The 133-page report, supplemented by lengthy appendices, concludes that the Uzans diverted at least $583 million and perhaps as much as $1.135 billion from Telsim and other companies for personal or unexplained uses from 1999 through 2001. 
In 2000, three companies based in Curacao, an island in the Netherlands Antilles, paid $82.9 million received from Telsim into accounts controlled by Hakan or Cem Uzan, including $1.6 million toward charges on Hakan Uzan's American Express card. The next year, the companies paid $3.7 million more to the brothers, including $1.3 million to Hakan Uzan's American Express account. Telsim did not disclose the payments in its audited financial reports, according to Mr. Samuel's report.
Two of the offshore companies paid another $23.8 million over those two years to other individuals and companies associated with the Uzans, according to the report. The investigation concluded that the money flowing through the companies was used to buy or maintain four yachts, two planes, seven luxury apartments in the Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan and a helicopter, as well as property in London, a publishing company, jewelry and art. 
Telsim was not the only Uzan company being raided for assets, according to the report. Mr. Samuel concluded that the offshore companies received and disbursed $107.1 million from other Uzan businesses from April 1998 to 2001.
Mr. Samuel also expressed suspicion about the accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars that Telsim disclosed as payments to Uzan-controlled companies. For instance, Telsim provided $283 million to Mavi Reklam, an Uzan-controlled advertising company, and $122 million to Rumeli Telekom, a telecommunications company, in 1999 and 2000 without any evidence that the money was in payment for goods or services of value to Telsim.
In addition, the report said, Telsim reported that it had $725 million in "selling expenses" in 2000, far in excess of its planned spending or the amounts spent by Turkcell, its much larger rival. Mr. Samuel concluded that $300 million to $350 million of the total was "suspicious."
"The overall operation demonstrates characteristics frequently used by money launderers," the report said.
The report concluded that most of the diversions occurred well before the economic troubles and currency devaluation in Turkey that, according to the Uzans, created the conditions that made it impossible to meet the repayment terms of the loans from Motorola and Nokia. But Mr. Samuel added that Telsim had refused to supply audited 2001 financial statements despite promises that they would be completed by May 2002 and that evidence of further diversions might appear.

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Diary 

BYLINE:  By Joe Rogers

 BODY:
DEAR DIARY:
 Not too long ago, I was showing the sights in Manhattan to a friend visiting from Norway. We came upon a booth in Times Square with a big sign that read "Computer Analysis of Your Personality, $2." Behind the counter was a man running not a computer, but an old card-sorting machine, the type that once was used to sort computer punch cards. 
 Customers were signing their names, which the man put into the machine, and were given a stack of cards that supposedly listed their personality traits. My friend, a mathematician by training, loudly announced to the crowd: "This is not a computer, it is only a card sorter. It's a rip-off."
The man replied, "O.K., my friend, you're right, but tell me, what is this here?" as he pointed to the cash register.
"Anybody knows that," my friend replied. "It's a cash register."
"That's right," the man said. "You got the brains and I got the bucks."
 James B. Sullivan

Dear Diary:
I recently called the office of a colleague in South Carolina. When informed that he was out, I requested that upon his return he telephone me in my office on Long Island in New York State. The following conversation ensued.
Secretary: "Oh, what perfect timing. I was just trying to find out the ZIP code for Long Island.
Me: "You mean area code, don't you?"
Secretary: "No, ZIP code, I need to send a letter to Long Island."
Me: "What town on Long Island?"
Secretary: "You mean there is more than one town on the Island?"
Me: "How many people do you think live on Long Island?"
Secretary: "Oh, about 200 to 300."
Later that day as my wife and I crawled along on the Long Island Expressway, I realized that all 200 to 300 people were in cars in my lane in front of me. Dr. H. Barry Waldman

Dear Diary:
In 2000, my husband and I moved from New York City to Columbus, Ohio, where I found the people exceedingly kind and very agreeable. I soon realized, however, that this quality also had a downside. It seemed that strong differences of opinion were perceived as rude and somewhat disruptive.
Missing New York, I traveled back and forth frequently, and it was on one of those trips that I encountered a woman who, so beautifully, captured the difference between the two cities.
Not 15 minutes after I arrived on one trip to New York, I boarded an elevator, and noticed that a very well-coiffed older woman was staring at my black sneakers.
"Do you like your shoes?" she asked.
I paused, not sure what to make of her comment. "My shoes?"
"Yes," she said. "Do you like them, because I think they re horrible."
"Well, they're very comfortable," I said, squirming.
The woman softened, then leaned forward and said: "The reason I'm asking is that my brother wanted me to buy him those shoes for Christmas, so I did, but I just think they're the ugliest things! I'm glad to know they're comfortable, though." 
I looked at her feet and said, "You know, your shoes aren't so hot, either." We both smiled.

HOW RARE
The last of its species in the shop,
the most multihued orchid
bearing a bonanza of blooms,
wide-eyed and freckled
abundantly marvelous,
befitting how rare you are,
how I see you.
On the snow-slushy subway
I hold what's growing in my bare hands
numb from not trusting mittens
to touch what's so precious,
defending its dear vulnerability,
cellophane and ribbons an inadequate helmet
from lethally oblivious elbows.
Those who notice
give me silent smiles of gratitude for
this gift glimpse of
the sublime 
underground.

Dear Diary:
While traveling on a bus in Queens, my Aunt Bella had the misfortune of sitting beside a young woman who was carrying on a rather loud and long conversation on her cellphone. After quite a few minutes, my aunt began to read her book aloud.
She was several sentences into the book when the woman turned to her and said, "Do you have to do that?"
My aunt replied, "Yes, I do, it's sort of like talking on a cellphone."
The phone conversation stopped and my aunt continued to read her book -- this time silently.

Alan Olshan, a copywriter, collects verbal near-misses that he hears. They are not bons mots, he figures; maybe mauvais mots. Or almots as in not quite:
"It's the powers of the bee."
"They pulled the plug out from under me."
"You threw me for a curve."
"Sometimes you get too big for your bridges."
"I'm not sure that should have passed the mustard."

Dear Diary:
My fiance, Len Zimmerman, recently pointed out a peculiar New York phenomenon concerning Christmas tree disposal. It was already well past the holiday season -- the last week of January -- and much to our amusement, every day on our way to work we were still seeing many discarded trees on the sidewalk.
I wondered out loud whether this was indicative of an extreme love of Christmas or just plain laziness.
Len had a better theory on why so many New Yorkers could not bear to part with their trees this year. By holding onto them for six weeks, he explained, a $25 Christmas tree winds up costing only 60 cents a day. And especially during these tough economic times, New Yorkers just cannot resist a bargain! Karen Zipern

Dear Diary:
Riding to the city on the Long Island Rail Road, I was challenged by the conductor concerning my senior ticket. Of course I felt flattered.
"Is 74 old enough?" I asked.
"Well," he said, "I've got to test you."
"You want my birth year?"
"No, I'm too dumb to figure that out. Let's see -- uh -- what shaving cream company used to advertise by placing poems on small signs along the road?"
"Burma Shave," I said.
"O.K., you pass."
"Every Sheba wants a sheik," I went on from memory, "strong of arm and clean of cheek. Burma Shave."
Not quite right, as it turned out, but close enough to impress the conductor.
"Ah, you're too much for me," he said, and moved on.
I do not always enjoy my trips on the L.I.R.R., but this time I did. Richard Lettis

PERSON: David E. Feller 

HEADLINE: David E. Feller, 86; Lawyer Who Argued Key Labor Cases 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
David E. Feller, a lawyer and law professor who researched and argued important civil rights and labor cases, including more than a dozen that went to the Supreme Court, died on Monday in Oakland, Calif. He was 86 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
 In the 1950's, Mr. Feller was on a panel of lawyers who advised and assisted Thurgood Marshall, who was then general counsel for the N.A.A.C.P., in preparing legal action against the racial segregation of schools. Mr. Feller was involved in drafting friend-of-the-court briefs in Brown v. Board of Education and other crucial civil rights cases. 
 Mr. Feller was general counsel for the United Steelworkers of America from 1960 to 1965. He also held that post with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s industrial union department and for other labor unions. 
As the steelworkers' general counsel, Mr. Feller was involved in what has become known as the Steelworkers' Trilogy, three cases decided by the Supreme Court on June 20, 1960.
William B. Gould IV, a former member of the United Auto Workers staff who is now emeritus professor of law at Stanford University, said that in those cases, "The broad issue was whether the courts would involve themselves in the interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements or labor contracts, or whether they would foster the role of arbitrators in interpreting such agreements."
"Feller argued that the courts should do the latter," Mr. Gould said, "that they should foster and promote the arbitration process, and that is what the Supreme Court did."
The steelworkers' current general counsel, Paul Whitehead, said those three decisions had established the institution of labor arbitration under United States labor law and gave labor and management a way of resolving disputes in a forum that is fairer, quicker and less expensive than the court system.
As a relatively young lawyer, Mr. Feller wrote briefs in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer. The case was brought by a number of steel companies against Charles Sawyer, President Harry S. Truman's secretary of commerce, and was decided by the Supreme Court in 1952. The court ruled that President Truman had exceeded his presidential powers when he took control of the country's steel industry after the steelworkers had threatened to strike.
Mr. Feller was John H. Boalt professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law until he retired from that post in 1987. He was on the school's faculty for more than 35 years.
Mr. Feller also worked as an arbitrator and was a past president of the National Academy of Arbitrators.
A native of New York City, David Edward Feller received bachelor's and law degrees, both magna cum laude, from Harvard and was an editor of the law review.
Later Mr. Feller was a lecturer at the University of Chicago on law and economics and served in the Army, winning the Bronze Star. He worked for the Department of Justice and clerked for Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson.
Mr. Feller is survived by his wife of 55 years, Gilda; four sons, Fred, of Berkeley, Daniel, of Albuquerque, Joseph, of Phoenix, and Jonathan, of Mill Valley, Calif.; a brother, Oscar, of Palm Desert, Calif.; and four granddaughters.

HEADLINE: World Trade Talks in Japan Falter After Three Days 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
After three days of meetings here, ministers from nearly two dozen countries seemed farther apart than ever on how to lower agricultural tariffs, provide developing nations access to cheaper drugs and other issues crucial to the World Trade Organization Doha talks.
 The inability to come up with a framework for solving those issues jeopardizes the entire round of negotiations that began in November 2001 and is to end in January 2005. The 145-member organization will hold a midterm meeting in September in Cancun, Mexico, and must iron out differences on cutting tariffs and subsidies and opening markets by March 31. 
 The Tokyo meetings were nonbinding and limited in size in an effort to prompt members to iron out differences. Instead of conceding ground, though, the main participants appeared to have hardened their stances. A proposal by Stuart Harbinson, the chairman of the trade organization's agricultural committee, to cut agricultural tariffs and other steps was widely criticized as either too soft or too tough. In the end, ministers agreed only that it was a "catalyst" for discussion.
"There was a huge divergence of views, which was expected from the beginning," said Yoriko Kawaguchi, Japan's foreign minister, who led the talks. The Harbinson proposal "successfully helped crystallize our thoughts."
The divergence is immense. The United States and other exporting nations want agricultural tariffs cut for all categories and limits on access dropped. Developing nations with large farming populations want barriers kept in place, while the European Union, Japan and other developed countries want nontrade issues like food safety and the environment considered.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, echoing his counterparts from Australia and other agricultural exporters, opposed efforts to treat agriculture separately from discussions on products and services. Japan and the European Union, he said, benefit with the United States when tariffs on manufactured goods are lowered, yet insist that their farm goods should be exempt.
"Rice-producing countries can't sell their produce in Japan but Japan can sell its cars in other countries," he said. "Is that fair? Japan needs to face reality."
Representatives from the European Union and Japan were no more subtle. 
Tadamori Oshima, Japan's minister of agriculture, said proposals to almost halve his country's 490 percent tariff on rice were "difficult to accept" and rejected calls to raise the amount of rice that can enter Japan.
Mr. Oshima's stance won praise from politically influential farmers who make up just 2.2 percent of the population yet fret that more than 60 percent of the food consumed in Japan is imported.
"I understand Japan's national prosperity owes to trade, but manufactured goods and agricultural products cannot be judged by the same measure," said Toshio Yamada, executive director of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives. If proposals to slash tariffs are adopted, it "will be devastating for rice farmers," he said.
Franz Fischler, representing the European Commission's agriculture committee, was equally adamant. "We don't do reforms on the invitation of someone else," he said.
Regardless of who does the inviting, all sides need to reach an agreement in six weeks for the talks to continue. If the tone and posture of the talks this weekend are any indication, though, progress appears uncertain.
"If Europe and Japan are not prepared to play a constructive role," said Mark Vaile, Australia's trade minister, "the round could be headed for trouble."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Kidnapping of 3 as Shift by Colombia Rebels 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The three Americans believed kidnapped by Colombian rebels could be held as war booty by a guerrilla group that is believed to be making a major change in tactics to bring about an aggressive confrontation with Colombia and its main backer, the United States, political analysts and former rebels said today.
 The three were most likely taken captive by a battle-hardened unit of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, after their United States government plane crash landed on Thursday as a result of engine failure. They have been identified by American officials in Washington as Defense Department contractors and are believed to have been moved far from the jungle region where the plane went down. 
 Today an estimated 2,000 Colombian troops searched a swath of southern Colombia, along with American rescue experts equipped with high-tech radiogear and guided by reconnaissance aircraft. 
At the same time, questions were being raised about what the rebel group would do with the Americans and how the United States would react.
"This probably does draw the United States in," said Adam Isacson, a senior associate who closely follows the military strategy in Colombia for the Washington-based Center for International Policy. "Probably the change you'll see if the FARC adopts a belligerent strategy on the United States is that the United States will be more willing to put its personnel in situations there where there is combat."
For American and Colombian military officials, the big unknown as the search progresses is what the unpredictable rebels are trying to accomplish. In addition to kidnapping the three men, the rebels are believed to have killed a fourth American and a Colombian army sergeant who had also been on the plane. It was a first for a group that had never before harmed or taken prisoner a United States government employee.
What is clear is that the rebel secretariat, particularly the group's aging leader, Manuel Marulanda, is obsessed with pressuring President Alvaro Uribe to agree to a prisoner exchange. The guerrillas want to trade the 23 politicians and 45 soldiers and policemen they have been holding in jungle camps for hundreds of rebels in government prisons. The Americans, who dropped into the guerrilla's lair unexpectedly, become potentially valuable leverage for the rebels.
The rebels' shifting strategy clouds the situation. The group's leading military tactician, Jorge Briceno, gave a hint of what was to come 19 months ago, saying that the group would one day take its war from the countryside into the cities. 
His warning became a reality on Feb. 7, when a car bomb killed 33 people at an exclusive Bogota club. Then on Friday, a second explosion attributed to the group killed 18 people in a working-class neighborhood in the city of Neiva.
"This is a much more defiant attitude," said Luis Fernando Ramirez, a former defense minister who predicts a heightened confrontation.
Political experts in Colombia and the United States say the group may be bristling at the deepening American involvement in Colombia. The United States has provided $2 billion in aid, mostly military, since 1997, which has helped denude much of southern Colombia of coca crops -- cutting into the rebels' revenue.
In northeast Colombia, American Special Forces are training Colombian soldiers in counterinsurgency warfare to combat rebels, who have made a habit of blowing up an oil pipeline crucial to Colombia's economy.
"I think this is all a result of the increased intervention of the United States in the Colombian conflict," said Gustavo Petro, a Congressman and former rebel from the disbanded M-19 guerrilla group. "They have taken them as war prisoners, and it is because they are part of the conflict and that is how the FARC sees them."
Blindsided by the attacks, and now the killing and kidnapping of American officials, the Colombian government has been pressing for renewed international interest and assistance. Government officials have argued that the bombings showed that the rebels have the help of international terrorist groups, while military officials here have repeatedly said the American and Colombian killed at the site of the crashed plane were shot execution style -- though American officials have refused to confirm that report.
For the men in the hands of the rebels, the shifting tactics and new climate are worrisome. The rebels could decide to hold the men for weeks or months or could perhaps try to improve their image by releasing them as a good-will gesture.
Little appears to be known about the captives' whereabouts. Some analysts said they could have been taken deeper into the jungle or high into the Andes, where kidnap victims are often held.
"Those guys are not in that area anymore," said a senior congressional aide in Washington who helps shape Colombia policy. "Those guys are somewhere in the mountains. That's going to be tough, because the rebels move them quick."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: INTELLIGENCE; 
Ridge Says Warning Levels Might Be Lowered in Days

BYLINE:  By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The country's domestic security chief said today that the heightened alert level warning of possible terrorist attacks might be lowered in coming days depending on assessments of threats received by the government.
 "Today, as we speak, because we review the information and our intelligence on a day-to-day basis, we maintain it at the orange level, but that could change within 24 to 48 hours," Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security, said on the CNN program "Late Edition." Mr. Ridge added, "Although some may have faded in terms of accuracy or relevance, there is still enough out there for today for us to remain on an orange level." 
 The threat level was raised on Feb. 7 to the second-highest category in response to what senior officials described as a pattern of intelligence reports suggesting that Al Qaeda might be plotting attacks in the United States or overseas for the middle of February. The exact place and nature of the threatened attacks was never certain, but officials said the reports were credible. 
Officials said they were concerned about possible threats to New York and the Washington area, where terrorists struck in September 2001. Officials expressed concern about the possibility that terrorists might use chemical, radiological or biological weapons, although they said there was no evidence that Al Qaeda had obtained such weapons.
Mr. Ridge's comments suggested that the fear of imminent attack may have subsided as the weekend drew to a close without incident. Several officials said discussions were under way to lower the alert level, possibly in a few days if the analysis of intelligence warranted it.
Some officials have said that lowering the alert level would help calm people who have been frightened by the repeated warnings from top officials in the Bush administration. Others have suggested that it might be better to lower the alert level soon to enable the administration to raise it again if the United States commenced hostilities against Iraq.
But some counterintelligence officials said it might be necessary to keep the threat level heightened as the country prepared for possible military action if credible threats continued.
While most intelligence officials agreed that the United States has faced an increased threat in recent days, some officials said the homeland security agency might have overstated the danger posed to the public by advising people to consider buying emergency supplies. The advice, officials said, offered little additional security and increased fear without providing any guidance about the nature or location of a possible attack.
Today, Mr. Ridge said any decisions about the alert level would be based on the pattern of intelligence received by the country's security agencies.
"I believe that on a day-to-day basis, it's incumbent upon this country and the intelligence community to assess all sources of information," Mr. Ridge said in an interview on ABC's "This Week."
"And as we continue to prosecute the war more successfully, we have access to more and more information," he added. "And I need to remind America on a day-to-day basis that that's exactly how we review the intelligence. Multiple sources, both foreign and domestic, all kinds of ways we aggregate information. And literally hour by hour they review it."
Mr. Ridge suggested that the threat of attack was much less outside of Washington and New York. He said the Bush administration might create a regional terrorism threat indicator that reflected the risks in the two cities that are regarded as prime targets because of their economic and political importance and Qaeda's practice of trying to attack areas they have struck before.
Among the intelligence reports received in recent days was one citing threats to a Senate office building, one senior government official said. Time magazine reports in this week's issue that several lawmakers may have been assassination targets. But the government official said it was not clear whether the threats were genuine.
Government officials have said that information about the possible attacks had been obtained from various sources, like intercepted communications between suspected terrorists and interviews with detainees. Today, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said the heightened anxiety in recent days had stemmed in part from increased discussions of attacks timed to coincide with the end of the hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage period, which ended late last week.
"There has been a lot of chatter about the period of time, and there was some concern that the terrorists might try to use the end of the hajj in this way," Ms. Rice said on the NBC program "Meet the Press."

HEADLINE: Service Groups Struggle As City's Payments Lag 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
In Brooklyn, a group of workers who help low-income women deliver healthy babies are facing dismissal. In Staten Island, a nonprofit organization that tries to reunite foster children with their families has been dipping into a credit line for the better part of a year. And in the Bronx, a settlement house has spent much of its reserve fund.
 All of these groups provide crucial services for the city. And all of them, as well as dozens like them, routinely carry out their mission even though the city chronically lags in paying them. 
 Over the years, that has discouraged organizations from doing business with the city, experts say, and has cost thousands of dollars to many of those that do. It is a problem so entrenched that the Fund for the City of New York, a private foundation, created a loan program to help providers stay afloat while their paperwork wound its way through the city's mammoth bureaucracy.
There is broad consensus that the system by which the city pays for new buildings and electronic equipment or the delivery of meals to homebound elderly people is in desperate need of change. It is "too constricted, expensive and antiquated," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said recently.
But there is little agreement about precisely how it should be done. Mr. Bloomberg has recently floated the idea of putting procurement reform on the ballot this year as a charter revision referendum. Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. has suggested imposing strict timetables and charging the city penalties for failure to meet them.
City Council leaders have come up with a host of other ideas, from simplifying the process for purchases that cost less than a certain amount to introducing an eBay type of model for buying supplies.
Despite the disagreement over a solution, the heightened attention to a matter that elicits glazed stares among even the most punctilious bureaucrats is a welcome development to those hoping for change. "Everybody has a beef about the procurement process, and maybe that's part of why it's so difficult to fix," said Cynthia S. Searcy, a research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission. "It's been a longstanding problem."
Those who have waded into the system warn that fixing it will take the sort of long-term effort that few politicians have had the will to sustain. Part of the reason is sheer size: the city spends about $8 billion each year on goods and services, more than the gross national products of many countries. There is a seemingly infinite variety of procurement requirements, depending on the method used, the amount of money being spent and the type of goods or service being bought.
"Public procurement doesn't have efficiency at its heart," said one city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's more about fairness and competition."
And the pervasive fear of corruption. The process, which has been a work in progress for years, is suffused with procedures meant to avoid "bad moments in contracting," in the words of the city official.
After the bribery scandal in the mid-1980's at the Parking Violations Bureau, for example, new business procedures were layered in, and the whole system was further amended after the Board of Estimate was dissolved and the Procurement Policy Board created to set the rules.
At the same time, the city has increasingly moved toward contracting out certain functions, hiring technology consultants and using outside companies to find jobs for welfare recipients. And it is in the area of helping the needy, experts say, that the results of late contracts are the most problematic.
Seeking to fulfill their missions, organizations often borrow money against their contracts and then have to pay fees and interest that are not reimbursed by the city, said Jillynn Stevens, director of policy, advocacy and research at the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. Such groups, often working on extremely tight budgets, absorb the costs by laying off employees or postponing technological upgrades that would allow them to function more efficiently, Ms. Stevens said.
"You have so little money to do these things anyway," said Gerard McCaffery, president of the Seamen's Society for Children and Families, which recently received the final paperwork for a foster care program it had been operating for the past several months. "We have been squeezed over the last couple of years with funding, and we don't have a lot of people running around to do this stuff over and over again."
But city officials, while emphasizing that they are struggling to solve the problem, say that some delays result from the city's budgeting cycle. Funds, especially for programs in specific neighborhoods, are not appropriated until June, when the City Council approves the budget. For contracts scheduled to start in January, that does not always leave enough time for the organizations to meet the city's complex requirements, officials say.
Nonetheless, Bloomberg officials have already made some changes and will seek to have some procurement requirements lifted. They are simplifying the intricate forms that prospective contractors must fill out and are planning to merge the Procurement Policy Board with the Mayor's Office of Contracts. They are also considering more autonomy for agencies that can show efficiency in their procurement process.
The City Council, meanwhile, has instituted a number of changes of its own, like raising the dollar limits on small purchases, thus freeing them from the byzantine procedures required for larger ones. They also reduced the number of hearings required for some contracts.
Council officials have also released a report detailing ways to use the Internet to buy goods at lower prices. One such method, already used in other cities, for example, is the reverse auction, where the government puts out a request and then waits for bids.
At the same time, officials in the Bloomberg administration complain, the Council has approved new requirements that are choking an already clogged system. Council leaders have frequently spoken of these measures as ways of simply leveraging the city's enormous purchasing power to enforce social policies.
For example, the Council approved a measure last year that prohibits financial institutions that issue predatory loans from doing business with the city. The Council is currently considering a bill that would require contractors to use only lumber from renewable sources, as well as one that would require companies to certify whether they or their affiliates had any involvement in the slave trade in America.
Meanwhile, organizations continue to struggle. "It's very disheartening," said the Rev. Denise Hylton, chief operating officer of the Caribbean Women's Health Association in Brooklyn, which has a four-year agreement to administer the federal Healthy Start program to reduce infant mortality rates. Ms. Hylton said that the group had been working for nine months without a contract. As a result, she said, it may have to lay off five workers and suspend part of the program.
"We're having our own difficulties managing our programs due to fiscal cutbacks," she said, "and this adds more frustration. It just ties us up and has crippled us from being able to achieve the goals of the program."

HEADLINE: Gap Between Pay Of Men and Women Smallest on Record 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Most American families can thank the woman of the house for nearly all of the pay gains they have received over the last year.
 While men's wages have failed to keep up with even the low rate of inflation, women's earnings have continued to grow, giving an important lift to many families and helping sustain consumer spending. 
 The raises have closed the gap between men's and women's wages to the narrowest on record, resuming a trend that had stagnated for almost a decade, government figures show. 
Women's pay still lags men's in virtually every sector of the economy. Full-time female workers made 77.5 percent of what their male counterparts did last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the previous eight years, the inequality worsened slightly, to 76 percent in 2001 from 77.1 percent in 1993. 
"The wage trends for men are unequivocally bad," said Jared Bernstein, an author of an annual study of the work force and an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington. "The fact that we're deep into a jobless recovery and women's wages are still growing is good news."
The median full-time female worker received a 5 percent raise in her weekly pay last year, while the median pay for men -- half made more, half made less -- rose only 1.3 percent, to $692. The inflation rate was about 2 percent.
Women have benefited from an acceleration in the economy's shift toward the services sector during the last two years of economic weakness. Millions of women work in government and health care, two of the only sections of the economy that have added workers since 2001, while men dominate industries like manufacturing and technology that have been hit hard by layoffs and pay cuts. 
A recent rise in the number of women who belong to unions, even as the total number of unionized workers continues to fall, may also be helping them receive salary increases, economists say.
The pay gap in the United States is slightly larger than it is in most other leading economies, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Australia, Denmark and Spain have some of the smallest differences in the world, with women making roughly 90 percent of what men do.
Over all, the gaps are bigger than the official numbers suggest because in many countries women are more likely to work part time.
American women made the largest relative gains last year at the low and middle parts of the salary scale. Although the current downturn has cut across all income groups, layoffs have remained most common among lower-paid workers in male-dominated industries, hurting the bargaining power of other workers there. The economy's weakness has also led to a shortening of the workweek for many manufacturers.
High-earning men and women have both received raises that outpaced inflation over the last year, but women's increases were slightly larger than men's, according to the Economic Policy Institute. 
"It's difficult to know how much we should make of one year's experience," said Francine D. Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University who studies the wage gap. "It's an interesting jump in a year, however. It's a lot."
In St. Louis, for example, executives at BJC HealthCare, a hospital system that employs 26,000 people, noticed last summer that they were struggling to hire enough nurses, technicians and pharmacists, among others. So to compete with other growing health care companies, the executives increased wages for about 5,100 employees -- 4,500 of whom were women -- by 3 to 5 percent, Only six months later, the executives decided they needed to raise pay again, by a similar amount. 
"The market moved," said Lincoln C. Scott, vice president for human resources at BJC, whose network includes Barnes-Jewish Hospital.
Lynn B. Johnson, a nurse at Barnes, still does not make as much as her husband, who is an electrician, but her hourly wage has risen to $28, from $26, while his has not moved in the last year. Mrs. Johnson, who is 44 and works in the intensive-care unit, called the raises a welcome reward for the increasing difficulty of her job. "We have the ability to do more things to help people, so we take a lot of sicker people who used to die outside the hospital," she said. "It is great to have a job you love and finally start to receive financial recognition for what we do."
For decades after World War II, women made little progress in closing the wage gap, with full-time female workers earning about three-fifths of men's pay. (Economists noted a Scriptural connection: in the Book of Leviticus, the value of a man's life was put at 50 shekels and a woman's at 30 shekels.) 
By the early 1980's, though, more women than men were attending college, and female graduates were no longer overwhelmingly entering lower-paying fields. Nearly half of women graduating from college in 1960 became teachers; in 1990, less than 1 in 10 did. "There was a huge switch in college majors for women, leaning more toward what we would call the more masculine fields," said Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard, citing business, engineering and the sciences.
Civil rights laws that were passed in the 1960's and 70's and the sheer increase of women in the work force appear to have reduced discrimination, economists say. The 1980's were also a harsh decade in many of the well-paid blue-collar fields where women rarely worked.
By 1991 -- with women's pay rising and men's falling after adjustment for inflation -- the wage ratio among full-time workers rose to 74.2 percent from 62.5 percent in 1979. 
"The 1980's were kind of a golden period for the narrowing of the pay gap," Ms. Blau said.
But as the economy began growing quickly in the mid-1990's, women's relative progress largely stopped. They were no longer making the rapid educational gains compared with men that they had in earlier years, and the portion of them working was not growing rapidly anymore. The welfare reform bill passed in 1996 may have played a small role in holding back the progress of women by causing a surge in the number of women available for low-paid work, researchers say.
Men also tend to benefit from economic expansions because they are often more willing to take professional risks, said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. In the 1990's, many of those risks, like joining start-up technology companies, were well rewarded.
"Women don't gain as much in a boom," Ms. Hartmann said, "but don't lose as much in a recession."
Government agencies, which are typically a source of steady if unspectacular salary increases and employ three women for every two men, are a big reason for that phenomenon. While the median worker across all industries received a raise roughly equal to the inflation rate over the last year, the average pay of federal employees rose 4.6 percent, to $54,656 a year, according to government figures. In San Jose, Calif., which has the highest unemployment rate of any large metropolitan area in the country, city employees received increases of 5 to 7 percent last year, a city spokesman, Tom Manheim, said.
Government employment will do less to help women whenever the economy begins growing fast enough again to create large numbers of new private sector jobs, but few analysts expect the pay gap to widen in future years. After previous economic downturns ended, women held onto the relative gains they had made.
The rising portion of unionized workers who are female -- about 42 percent, up from 39 percent in 1995, according to the Labor Department -- may also help bolster women's wages. Organized labor has lost members in heavily male manufacturing industries that have been shifting work overseas, while nurses in Buffalo and Miami, janitors in Los Angeles and on Long Island and other service-sector employees have voted to join unions in recent years. 
Unionized workers earn an average of 23 percent more a week than other workers, according to the Labor Department. Some of the difference stems not from collective bargaining but from the concentration of union members in metropolitan areas and big companies, where wages are usually higher.
Economists say the two biggest reasons that the pay gap is unlikely to wither completely are discrimination, which is difficult to measure, and the dominant share of housework and child care done by women, which reduces their outside job experience and causes them often to take more flexible, lower-paid positions. 
"I'm optimistic that momentum is going to continue," Ms. Hartmann said of the shrinking pay gap. "It's just going to take a while."

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING; 
Betting Late Bloomer In Run for the Roses

BYLINE:  By Joe Drape

 BODY:
Just as the start of spring training brings seam-heads joy and lets some of them dream of the impossible, the February prep races for 3-year-olds can make us horse enthusiasts giddy and sometimes silly. Our equivalent of "The Cubs are going to contend" is "I'm not taking my horse to the Kentucky Derby unless he has a chance to win."
 Both are sincere sentiments, but when May 3 rolls around, even money says at least half the horses in the expected field of 20 at Churchill Downs will have little hope of taking home the blanket of roses. Still, now is the time to dream, and with a record 446 early nominations to the Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes, there are plenty of owners, trainers and horseplayers up at night with thoughts of the Big Horse galloping through their heads. 
 The wise guys, or betting public, say, "With good reason." In Round 1 of the Kentucky Derby future wager, which closed last night after four days, the mutuel field was made a 2-1 favorite. In betting parlance, this is called a "stand against" the 23 colts that were listed as individual wagering entities. Essentially, bettors are saying that the winner of the 129th Kentucky Derby has yet to distinguish himself enough to make this early list of 23.
Fair enough -- in two of the four previous initial pools, bettors were correct, as Charismatic in 1999 and War Emblem last year were not yet on the radar. Twice, however, they were wrong, and Fusaichi Pegasus (2000) and Monarchos (2001) rewarded the February confidence of their backers with a lucrative afternoon on the first Saturday in May. Admittedly, it is folly to hang your hat on a 3-year-old colt in the dead of winter and expect riches in the spring, but owners, trainers and, yes, bettors do it all the time. 
This is a game of preparation and study, hunches and luck. Even if you find the most talented 3-year-old ofa lifetime, there is no guarantee that the colt or filly will stay healthy. Ask Bob Baffert. Two weeks ago, his undefeated 2-year-old champion, Vindication, strained a suspensory ligament in his left front leg and will miss the Triple Crown races.
"This is our version of TV's 'Survivor,' " said Baffert, whose horses have won the Derby three times. "Anything can happen, most of it bad."
But a hunch here says the eventual Derby winner is going to emerge from one of those 23 horses in the first pool. Two highly regarded colts, Kafwain and Domestic Dispute, represent Baffert there. Three more distinguished themselves over the weekend -- Trust N Luck, Lion Tamer and Badge of Silver.
Trust N Luck went gate to wire to win the Fountain of Youth by more than five lengths on Saturday at Gulfstream Park in Florida. The performance brought tears to the eyes of his trainer, as well as a prediction. 
"This is the one who is going to make it," said Ralph Ziadie, a veteran of the Florida circuit who has yet to train a Derby horse.
Perhaps he will make it to Kentucky, but the colt is battling racing history -- only 4 of 56 Fountain of Youth winners have won the Derby. Trust N Luck also has a front-running style that plays well on the fast tracks of Florida, but not necessarily at Churchill Downs, War Emblem's gate-to-wire victory notwithstanding. 
Earlier on Saturday at Gulfstream, another contender emerged when the lightly raced Lion Tamer ran away with the Hutcheson Stakes by six lengths. Granted, it was only a seven-furlong sprint, but Lion Tamer is the son of Will's Way, a first-year sire who won the 1996 Travers Stakes at the Derby distance of a mile and a quarter. Only 2 of 49 Hutcheson winners have captured the Derby, but Lion Tamer, a winner of three of four races, showed enough ability to be purchased privately for a price far above the $100,000 his previous owners paid for him as a yearling.
If nothing else, Baffert's 11th-hour purchase of War Emblem on behalf of Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia reminded horseplayers that it is never a bad idea to follow the money. In this case, the money is that of Lion Tamer's new owner, Michael Tabor, who won the 1995 Derby with Thunder Gulch.
"The thing that Lion Tamer's got to prove down the road is whether or not he can get the two turns in a mile and an eighth or a mile and a quarter," said Todd Pletcher, his trainer. "So far he's been very impressive in what he's done. But they've just been at sprint distances."
But Pletcher saw the hopes of another one of his charges set back in the Risen Star Stakes yesterday at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, when the late-running Indy Dancer finished a well-beaten seventh. Badge of Silver, who ran his record to a perfect 3 for 3, won by 10 lengths.
Like 12 of the 23 horses in this future pool, Badge of Silver, a son of Silver Deputy, has raced four times or fewer, which often means that the chances of improvement outweigh the risk of being run down. In the case of Badge of Silver, though, the colt broke a bone in his lower leg last spring, only to rebound. His trainer, the up-and-coming Ronny Werner, has yet to train a Derby horse.
Among the 23 are two lightly raced colts trained by recent Derby-winning trainers: Sky Mesa, trained by John Ward, and Ministers Wild Cat, handled by Neil Drysdale.
Sky Mesa has yet to put his 3-for-3 record on the line this year after slightly spraining an ankle last October. Still, he is working resolutely, and as Ward proved with Monarchos, he knows how to point a colt to the big race. The same can be said for Drysdale, whose Ministers Wild Cat is bred for the Derby distance and is 2 for 3, winning the Golden Gate Mile impressively in Northern California on Feb. 9. Like Ward, Drysdale took his time bringing Fusaichi Pegasus to the Derby, where the colt turned in the best performance of his lifetime.
You see a pattern -- first pool, lightly raced, winning trainer? It's silly, but irresistible: Sky Mesa, Ministers Wild Cat, Lion Tamer or one of the Baffert horses will win the Derby. And, yes, the Cubs will contend.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
U.S. Planning Sanctions Against North Korea

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is developing plans for sanctions against North Korea, that would include halting its weapons shipments and cutting off money sent there by Koreans living in Japan, in the event that North Korea continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons, senior administration officials say.
 The officials said late last week the administration had no plans to push for the sanctions soon, since the United States' Pacific allies still oppose the idea and the United Nations Security Council is likely to remain focused on Iraq for weeks. 
 But the Pentagon and State Department are developing detailed plans for sanctions, and perhaps other actions, so that the United States has a forceful response ready in case North Korea takes aggressive new steps toward developing nuclear weapons, senior officials said.
Many administration officials believe that it is just a matter of time before North Korea resumes testing long-range missiles, for example, or starts reprocessing nuclear fuel for weapons production. Many officials also worry that if the United States attacks Iraq, North Korea will use the opportunity to push forward with weapons production. 
"If they start to dismantle their weapons programs, then we can talk about incentives," a senior administration official said. "But if they torque up the pressure, you're looking at the other direction. That's when sanctions become much more likely."
The officials said the possibility of sanctions would be part of a broader diplomatic campaign intended to get North Korea to step back from its nuclear programs. The first step will be to urge the Security Council, perhaps in the next two weeks, to condemn North Korea's recent steps toward nuclear weaponry, which have included withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a mothballed reactor at Yongbyon that can produce weapons-grade plutonium. 
The United States will also continue pressing Russia and China, major trading partners and providers of foreign aid to North Korea, to take a more active role in pressuring North Korea to dismantle its programs, the officials said. 
Both countries have said they will not support sanctions yet, contending that less confrontational approaches should be given more time. North Korea has said it would consider sanctions an act of war.
Precisely because Russia and China, as well as South Korea and Japan, have been unwilling to support cutting off trade with North Korea, the United States is looking at more tailored sanctions that will focus on banned activities like smuggling drugs or proliferating weapons of mass destruction, officials said.
For instance, Pentagon planners are looking closely at using American military forces to stop, turn back or seize ships and aircraft from North Korea that are suspected of carrying missiles or nuclear weapons materials, officials said. The sale of missile technology to Iran, Iraq and other countries has been a major source of foreign currency for the impoverished North Korea, American officials contend. 
In December, Spanish warships working with American military and intelligence officials stopped a North Korean freighter that was found to be carrying 15 Scud missiles bound for Yemen. 
But the Bush administration, at the urging of Yemen's government, determined that it had no legal right to seize the cargo and ordered the freighter released.
To prevent a similar situation, administration officials say that they will need Security Council authorization to seize or turn back weapons shipments from North Korea. 
At a Senate hearing last week, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld hinted at that strategy, advocating revamping international rules to allow steps to halt North Korea's weapons exports and calling North Korea "the world's greatest proliferator of missile technology" and a threat for selling fissile material to terrorists or rogue nations.
"I see North Korea as a threat as a proliferator more than I see them as a nuclear threat on the peninsula," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "Unless the world wakes up and says this is a dangerous thing and creates a set of regimes that will in fact get cooperation to stop those weapons, we'regoing to be facing a very serious situation in the next five years."
The sanctions package would also probably include measures intended to cut off remittances to North Korea from Korean-owned gambling parlors in Japan and allow the interdiction of drug trafficking from North Korea. North Korean groups, some linked to the government, run a thriving trade in illegal methamphetamines in northern Asia, Western officials say.
American officials contend that profits from those ventures support North Korea's military and enrich its Communist Party leaders. Constricting them, they contend, will not worsen the already dire plight of North Korea's general population, which has suffered through years of famine.
But the administration is also contemplating measures that could affect North Korean civilians. It is, for instance, likely to reduce American food shipments to North Korea this year from last year's total of 230,000 tons. The administration, which had been among the largest providers of food and fuel to North Korea, last year cut off shipments of heavy fuel oil to North Korea after learning that it had a covert nuclear weapons program. 
The administration contends it will not use food aid for political purposes. But officials said last week that food aid to North Korea would almost certainly decline this year for three reasons: the World Food Program, which runs an aid distribution network in North Korea, is requesting less food this year; the United States has concerns that American food is feeding soldiers instead of civilians; and the great demand for American aid in other countries.
But Democratic officials and some aid groups assert that the assistance is being reduced to ratchet up pressure on the North Korean government. 
Some Korean experts and hawkish lawmakers in Congress are also urging the administration to press China to reduce aid to North Korea until it begins dismantling its weapons programs. China provides well over half of North Korea's food and fuel imports and is widely thought by American officials to have the most leverage over North Korea.
James R. Lilley, a former ambassador to South Korea and China, said the Chinese remained deeply ambivalent about squeezing North Korea, fearful that it will collapse and send millions of impoverished refugees into northeastern China. 
But he also noted that the Chinese were concerned about North Korea's nuclear programs and had been willing at least twice in the past decade to reduce food and fuel shipments to North Korea in apparent efforts to pressure North Korea to freeze its weapons programs.
"The Chinese are coming on board," Mr. Lilley said. "But you've got to get high-level summitry to kick start it."
Such high-level diplomacy could begin in April, when Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to visit Beijing to discuss North Korea, administration officials said. 
Despite the administration's efforts to devise more forceful approaches to North Korea, many Democrats contend that the administration still lacks a clear and coherent policy. They contend that sanctions will only work in conjunction with a more aggressive effort by the United States to open direct talks with North Korea. The administration has resisted one-on-one talks, saying it wants to meet North Korea in a multilateral setting. 
"Direct talks are an indispensable ingredient of a solution here," said Ashton B. Carter, a former Pentagon official who is now a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "The issue is only when and what to say. Once we figure that out, we can begin the experiment of seeing whether or not North Korea can be talked out of going nuclear."

HEADLINE: Germans Near Air Base Don't Hate U.S., Just the Noise 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: NEU-ISENBURG, Germany, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
For some angry lawmakers in Congress, the best punishment for Germany's refusal to back a war against Iraq would be to scale back the number of American troops stationed here. The Pentagon, they were told recently, is weighing the idea.
 Ask the residents of this German town what they think, and they say it cannot happen soon enough. 
 Neu-Isenburg, a well-kept community of 36,000, is carved out of the majestic forest south of Frankfurt. It lies next to the Rhein-Main Air Base, which was once a landing site for dirigibles, including the ill-starred Hindenburg, and is now a major hub for the United States Air Force. 
Since November 2001, the night sky over Neu-Isenburg has reverberated with the roar of C-5 Galaxy cargo planes and other aircraft ferrying troops and supplies to Afghanistan. With a new war in the Persian Gulf looming, Rhein-Main is gearing up for another wave of flights.
"To be honest, I would be very happy if they left," said Kerstin Harms, a sleep-deprived mother of two young girls. "When these Galaxy planes pass by, the windows vibrate, the whole house shakes."
Horst Muller, a retired pharmaceutical worker who has campaigned against the flights, said some pilots were "cowboys" who reved their engines with little regard for the sleeping world below. "When a Galaxy takes off at 3 a.m.," he said, "all of Neu-Isenburg falls out of bed."
Like most people here, Mr. Muller and Mrs. Harms insist that they do not resent the American military presence in Germany. For Mr. Muller, 69, the soldiers stir memories of his first chocolate bar, given to him when he was 11 by an arriving G.I., or his first cigarette, cadged from a soldier and smoked furtively in the woods near his home.
But the incessant noise is testing their patience. And the discontent is not confined to this town. People who live near the much larger Ramstein Air Base in southwestern Germany also complain about the racket. A United States Army training ground in the Bavarian town of Auerbach has drawn the ire of residents who say the sound of exploding artillery shells keeps them awake.
"It's not just Afghanistan," said the mayor of Neu-Isenburg, Dirk-Oliver Quilling. "It's every crisis -- Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo. This isn't a problem with Americans. It's a problem with military flights."
Once viewed as a potent symbol of cold war vigilance -- eagles standing against the Soviet bear -- the American soldiers in Germany are now seen by some people here as something approaching a nuisance.
At the Pentagon, some view them as a relic. The new commander for American forces in Europe, Gen. James L. Jones, has floated the idea of scaling back the 71,000 troops based in Germany in favor of lighter, more mobile units that could jump from country to country on short notice.
The plans, which are in an early stage, are part of a longstanding effort to rethink the deployment of United States troops in Europe since the end of the cold war. Despite the barbed comments in Congress, military officials say the plans did not grow out of the recent rift between Berlin and Washington.
The strained relations, however, are coloring the debate on both sides. Antiwar protesters plan to demonstrate in front of the Rhein-Main base in the coming week, while Mr. Muller and other people here said they regretted the anti-American position taken by Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder.
The commander of the base, Col. Christine D. Prewitt, said some local officials had even apologized to her. "I tell them I appreciate the support, but I can't really do anything with it," she said.
Colonel Prewitt is, however, trying to address the complaints about noise. She noted that the Air Force had begun using more C-17 planes at Rhein-Main, which are quieter than the C-5's. She disciplined a pilot who veered off his landing path a year ago and flew low over the town. And she meets regularly with local officials to brief them on the missions being planned.
Among her frustrations is the stubborn belief among townspeople that the planes are carrying bombs or other weapons. She said the base was not equipped to load or unload munitions.
Colonel Prewitt also said cargo planes bound for Afghanistan had to take off in the middle of the night in order to land there in daylight. The need to supply troops in Iraq may require further night flights. 
"We can't ever promise a community that we won't fly over them," she said. "The planes have to go somewhere."
Despite these irritants, Colonel Prewitt said relations between Rhein-Main and its neighbors were decent. She recalls being stationed as a young pilot at the Clark Air Base in the Philippines from 1985 to 1988. That base was eventually closed after anti-American protests.
"In the Philippines, you got the distinct feeling it was 'Yankee Go Home' time," she said. "You don't get that feeling here. The circumstances are different, the people are different."
She said Rhein-Main had been downsized in 1995, reducing its population from about 8,000 to under 2,000. With fewer Air Force troops, there are fewer links between the base and the surrounding towns.
Neu-Isenburg used to have an auto dealership and a pub that catered to American troops. Both are gone. Unlike some German towns, Neu-Isenburg does not depend on the base for economic sustenance.
Indeed, the Air Force plans to close Rhein-Main at the end of 2005, transferring its last operations to Ramstein. The move, however, is contingent on adding a runway and upgrading technology there. Given the Pentagon's other obligations these days, residents doubt that it will meet that deadline.
Rhein-Main shares runways and taxiways with Frankfurt's mammoth international airport, which is just north of the base. Airport officials already have plans to convert the base into a new terminal building. Mayor Quilling said his town might end up trading the roar of the C-5's for more car traffic.
"There is a German expression," he said as he watched a Lufthansa 747 ascend into the azure sky outside his office. "We look at it with one eye crying and one eye laughing."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ECONOMY; 
In Military Towns, Contractors' Windfall Is Not Doing Much Trickling Down

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: TUCSON 

 BODY:
Velma Maxson works 15 hours of overtime a week at Raytheon's four-square-mile complex here, molding fiberglass components for radar-packed air-to-air missiles. At Don Martin's precision machine shop, Competitive Engineering, bad memories of the dot-com crash have faded with orders trickling in from Raytheon, Honeywell and Boeing.
 But Steven Dreher had to shut down his Tucson butcher shop and deli in December. A few days after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, guards at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base here turned away Mr. Dreher's truck, with 1,400 pounds of sausage for a pilots' cookout, and after that the catered-party business dried up. 
 Outside the base, Mark Aldulaimi's used-car lot has no shoppers. "Everybody's scared," Mr. Aldulaimi said. "Nobody wants to spend their money." 
In Washington and on Wall Street, the experts are speculating about what a war with Iraq might do to the nation's economy. But the effects are already being felt in cities where military bases and weapons plants are economic mainstays, and the news is grim.
A wartime economy might be good for merchants of missiles and rockets, but it is putting a damper on everything else.
Local businesses remain in the doldrums, with many fearing that war and the continuing threat of terrorism will only make things worse.
In Tucson, for example, and in other military towns large and small, the march to battle has kept military contractors humming, but their windfall has not been widely shared. They are doing more without hiring many workers or spending more money locally. 
The military base and contractors in Tucson, with a population of 514,000, are busy cranking up. But they are islands in a sea of worry and indecision. The word for the Tucson economy, said Marshall J. Vest, the director of economic research at the University of Arizona's business school here, "is 'hesitation.' "
Unemployment, normally about 3 percent here, is close to 5 percent. Shopping has fallen off, and with it the city's sales tax collections. The roads need work. Tucson's sunny and dry high season is well under way, but tourism -- as vital a part of the economy as the base and the military contractors -- is down.
"They're all struggling -- premium restaurants, hotels, resorts," said Mayor Robert E. Walkup, a former aerospace executive.
Mayor Walkup and local economists like Mr. Vest have been expecting some recovery in other areas this year, but anything other than a lightning-strike war lasting just days or weeks unravels their calculations. 
"My attitude without a war is very positive," Mayor Walkup said. "We'd see growth of 3 percent this year. My attitude with a war is concerned. We would see a falloff of zero to minus 2 percent."
Apart from the weapons makers, only residential real estate seems immune to war jitters. With the rout of the stock market, said Susie Hall, a real estate agent, house buyers are sending more money her way. Her firm sold a record $1.5 billion in houses last year, and she sees the same this year.
Tucson's military industry is recovering from a decade of contraction, consolidation and reduced spending after the Persian Gulf war. The Raytheon plant now employs 10,300 workers. When it took over the missile building business from Hughes Aircraft six years ago, Raytheon had 6,600 employees. 
In the late 1990's, Raytheon and the other contractors began cost-cutting and efficiency programs that are paying off. Though stung by recent Securities and Exchange Commission investigations, the parent Raytheon Company, in Lexington, Mass., reported last month that with rising military sales, its loss for the fourth quarter last year had dropped to $15 million from $162 million in 2001. Its sales for all of last year reached $16.8 billion, up from $16 billion in 2001.
In Tucson, officers of Raytheon's missiles systems business, which accounts for $3 billion of the company's sales, say orders are up for submarine and ship-launched Tomahawk missiles; the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or Amraam; and air-to-ground, laser-guided Paveway bombs. 
The Paveway comes in a three-part kit. Raytheon makes an electronics-packed front end and the fin assembly for the back. Preparing for an attack, the Navy puts a bomb in between and hangs it under the wing of a fighter.
Jon Jones, the company's vice president for strike weapons, said, "We have stepped up production of those kits since Sept. 11 from a trickle, all for international customers, to well over 1,000 a month." 
But with more efficient production, big employers like Raytheon have met the increase in military spending with few new jobs to bolster the economy. 
Raytheon has spawned a vast local industry of subcontractors to assure it immediate access to parts and supplies. In mid-January, Raytheon called in the whole supply chain of missile component companies to prepare them to bid on a new classified missile. 
One supplier is the seven-year-old Tucson plant of Lourdes industries, with 14 workers. It assembles bunches of wire and cable harnesses solely for Raytheon. The plant, near the airport outside Raytheon's fence, is "real close to Raytheon" in all respects, said Ronald D. Orr, the Lourdes manufacturing manager. 
The Breault Research Organization, an optical engineering and software company, makes a part for the Tomahawk. Promoting Tucson as the site of an "Optics Valley" sibling of Silicon Valley, the company's chairman, Robert P. Breault, leads an association that has drawn scores of optical engineering companies to town. 
A few years ago, Mr. Breault said, one of his officers bid $500,000 below the $2 million he should have offered to win a Raytheon contract. Promptly, Breault Research was losing money. "Raytheon then pulled me through it," Mr. Breault said. "They let me rebid the contract. They didn't want to lose us. They have an attitude that if they can, they will develop a local industry."
From Raytheon on down, the city's military manufacturing industry is a century removed from classic textile mills or automobile factories. "This is a high-tech, low-volume industry," said Mr. Martin, the owner of Competitive Engineering. As such, he said, it will be the last of the nation's receding manufacturing industries to move production abroad. 
Competitive Engineering, which has 75 employees, is just across a road from Raytheon's new engineering group building. At the plant, soundproofed, van-size red and green boxes house machines that bore, mill, carve and turn steel and aluminum castings into parts for missiles, airplanes and computers.
Raytheon and most of these plants are craft and engineering shops. Assemblers, inspectors, testers and processors work in cells and cubicles, not on production lines, performing multiple tasks, not one. Ventilation systems stir most of the noise. The plants have only two customers, the Pentagon and the person -- soldier, sailor, pilot -- the industry calls the warfighter.
It is the warfighter who the industry's workers say inspires them most, whatever their politics or thoughts about Iraq. "I don't want to go to war," said Ms. Maxson, the Raytheon employee. "I understand we make missiles. I know they're going to be used on something. I prefer to think they're going to be used for testing." But however they're used, she said, "they need them to work perfectly."
Like warfighter, surge is a term that peppers the conversations of military-related workers. "We haven't had a surge of any significant amount," said Louis Chavez, general manager of the Honeywell plant. Military orders have been climbing 2 to 5 percent for a couple of years, Mr. Chavez said, but lately "we've had surge-capability requests from the Department of Defense" to report how fast the plant can respond to surges in orders.
Workers at these companies, though they earn relatively good wages -- typically $19 an hour at Raytheon -- seem as hesitant as everyone else about their spending. 
Lelia Mejia was sitting at a bench at Competitive Engineering, scraping metal burrs from a newly machined palm-sized part for Honeywell, with a scalpel-like knife. "I'm trying to pay off all the credit we had -- the car, the Visa," Ms. Mejia said.
The fortunes of the Air Force base here, Arizona's largest with 8,300 members of the military and 1,600 civilians, could be darkening. It does not make anything, so it spurs the economy much less than Raytheon does. Still, in an economic impact analysis for September 2001, the base said it disbursed $375 million in wages a year and spent $251 million locally for housing, asphalt, cement, lumber and various services.
Those figures, which Mr. Vest says account for 2 percent of Tucson's economy, could shrivel starting in 2005, when the base could become a target of the government's Base Realignment and Closure Commission, known as BRAC. 
War or no war, said Lt. Col. Joe Whaley, the officer assigned to manage the base's defense against closing, "BRAC is coming."

HEADLINE: The Right Resolution 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The menace of Saddam has driven a wedge in the world, with Paris-Berlin-Moscow-Beijing on the side of unending delay, and with the great majority of democratic nations with Washington and London-led Europe on the side of action.
 But an even greater divide -- a glaring inconsistency in argument that exposes a weakness in principle -- exists within the camp that opposes the U.S. 
 For the past year, the central message that Saddam's protectors have been sending to the U.S. is: Do not "go it alone." On the contrary, take the multilateral route. Seek the world's support through U.N. consensus. 
But when it comes to the weaponry menace on the other side of the world, the message of Paris-Berlin-Moscow-Beijing is exactly the opposite. 
The clear message that the coalition of the unwilling sends Washington about North Korea, which confessed its secret nuclear buildup, then ejected U.N. inspectors just as Saddam did four years ago, is this: Go it alone, America. Korea's nukes and long-range missiles are your problem, not the world's. Hold bilateral talks as the Koreans insist, pay them off as you tried to do before and forget all we have been saying about multilateralism. You work it out with them alone; we'll hold your coat. 
That is no minor inconsistency. Different regions may require different strategies, as President Bush has noted, but not different basic principles. It's either collective security or selective security.
U.N. nuclear inspectors who want another year or so to play hide-and-seek in Iraq cannot profess similar ignorance about North Korea. Caught red-handed by U.S. intelligence, Pyongyang's leaders kicked out inspectors, tore up a nonproliferation treaty and threatened the whole world with war if anyone dared impose economic consequences.
Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency voted 31 to 0 (with Russia abstaining, calling it "premature") to cite North Korea for ignoring nuclear safeguards and tossed the ticking nuclear time bomb to the Security Council.
Where it sits. Because nobody wants to touch it, Council members point to the U.S. to pay another round of ransom. But the foot-dragging four don't want to get involved in helping the U.S. disarm North Korea while they are busy drawing up another resolution stopping a U.S.-led coalition from disarming Iraq.
One way to solve a problem is to spread it out. Instead of staying on the defensive within the Security Council on Iraq, fiddling with the wording of another final-final, we-really-mean-it scrap of paper, Colin Powell should promptly present a resolution on North Korea.
No threat of economic sanctions yet. Just an unequivocal statement by the world body that North Korea is in material breach of its treaty obligations, with chapter and verse of what the I.A.E.A. reported. Our resolution should call on North Korea to meet with its neighbors most immediately concerned -- South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, the Philippines and the U.S. -- to negotiate a solution to a threat to peace. 
Would France cast its veto? Unlikely; it left Asia at Dien Bien Phu. Would Russia abstain? Probably; as the Saddam issue has shown, President Putin's soul is not what President Bush thought it was. Would Britain be with us? Yes. Among the five permanent members, that leaves China. 
China may well veto even such a toothless resolution because the U.N. would be asserting a truth that North Korea denies: the nuclear threat posed by Pyongyang would best be met by a multilateral response. But the need to decide would focus China's new leadership on the downside of a veto and the foolishness of its current let-Uncle-Sam-do-it policy. 
Beijing knows that Japan's defense minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has already called for consideration of a Japanese missile defense, presaging quick work on Tokyo's nuclear deterrent. Taiwan would do the same, also presenting the independent-minded on that island with a potent equalizer to Beijing's military superiority.
Is that fallout what China wants, as well as the erosion of its huge trade surplus with the U.S.? Better to lean on its Communist neighbor, hegemonist heads in Beijing will say, than to invite international sanctions that would drive masses of hungry Koreans into China, or cause those cowboys in Washington to assert their strength one day in Asia as they surely will in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Helping Poor Countries 

 BODY:
In his budget this year, President Bush is proposing to both increase and overhaul foreign aid spending. While the proposal begins too slowly, Mr. Bush is reinvigorating one of the most necessary and unjustly reviled federal programs. 
 America ranks dead last among wealthy countries in foreign aid as a percentage of the economy. The new program helps, but the ranking remains unchanged. Foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the budget, and most of it goes to military or economic support for strategically important, but not particularly needy, friends -- mainly Israel, Egypt, Colombia and Jordan. This furthers American interests but should not be confused with development aid. 
 The additional funds will start slowly, with only $1.3 billion budgeted for next year -- less than promised. The program is designed to provide aid only to countries well-governed enough to use it correctly and to induce others to institute reforms. This is good as long as the program remains an addition to programs that help people living under less enlightened leadership. Washington must be careful not to let the new program become a substitute for helping the most miserable. The most worrisome aspect of the plan is that after the first two years, nations with incomes of nearly $3,000 per capita qualify. This means allies like Russia and Egypt -- rather than needier countries like Bangladesh and Mali -- would suck up most of the money.
The other new criteria make sense. High percentages of national budgets must be spent on education and health, and a set proportion of the population must get basic vaccinations. Deficits and inflation must be kept under control, and a short startup time for new businesses is required. 
Mr. Bush's other foreign aid initiative, announced in his State of the Union address, is $10 billion in new money to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean over five years. But his budget falls short of that promise. He is proposing only a $550 million increase over the global AIDS money in this year's spending bill now in Congress. Since the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria would be an effective channel for the aid, there is no excuse for the initiative's leisurely start. Mr. Bush's 2004 budget for the Global Fund, $200 million, actually cuts in half what Congress is likely to do in 2003.
Mr. Bush has also found part of the money for his AIDS programs by cutting nearly $500 million from child health, including vaccine programs. Child survival is the biggest loser in the foreign aid budget -- a scandalous way to finance AIDS initiatives. With the budget dominated by defense spending and huge tax cuts for the wealthy, the White House should not be forcing the babies of Africa to pay for their parents' AIDS drugs.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ALLIANCE; 
NATO SETTLES RIFT OVER AID TO TURKS IN CASE OF A WAR

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN with STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Resolving a bitter dispute that pitted the United States against France and Germany over military plans on Iraq, NATO agreed tonight to an American request to supply Turkey with equipment to defend itself in the event of a war to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
 The settlement was reached at NATO headquarters in Brussels after several days of tough negotiations amid mounting concern that the alliance might rupture on the eve of a possible war. 
 Some officials said they hoped that the NATO agreement could pave the way for resolving the much more contentious dispute over authorizing the use of force against Iraq at the United Nations Security Council. But for now, European and American officials were pleased that one of the nastier disputes in NATO's history had been patched up.
"Alliance solidarity has prevailed," said George Robertson, the NATO secretary general. 
But in a sign of possible fraying of support for the United States in the Middle East, a meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo broke up today after failing to reach agreement calling for an emergency Arab summit meeting to press Mr. Hussein to comply with the United Nations disarmament demands.
The NATO decision brought widespread relief throughout the alliance.
The United States is "very pleased" by the agreement "to come to the defense of Turkey," said R. Nicholas Burns, the American ambassador to NATO. "We worked very hard to make sure that our core alliance responsibility of reaching out to an ally in a time of crisis was secured." 
The dispute was resolved when it was agreed to have the military staff of the NATO Defense Planning Council, which does not include France, make plans for Turkey's defense, specifically by sending Awacs air reconnaissance planes, Patriot missiles and chemical and biological warfare defense teams to Turkey.
France had objected to such a step on the grounds that the Security Council had not yet authorized the use of force against Iraq. Shifting the decision to the planning council rather than NATO itself was a way of circumventing French opposition.
Germany went along with the compromise, and the last holdout, Belgium, agreed to go along under pressure from other NATO members. Belgium dropping its long-held demand that any NATO decision be linked to authorization of force by the Security Council. 
After the announcement tonight, France, Germany and Belgium issued a joint statement reiterating their opposition to military action unless authorized by the Council.
Despite the NATO breakthrough, there were no signs today that the Council dispute was closer to being resolved. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, once again warned that the Bush administration wanted the Council to authorize the use of force within "weeks, not months" if Iraq continued to fail to comply on weapons inspections.
With millions of demonstrators in major cities in Europe and the United States protesting plans for a war, the Bush administration has shown no signs of abandoning that position. Ms. Rice said that it was "fine to protest" but that the demonstrators were ignoring the threat posed by Iraq.
In addition, in what appeared to be a reflection of the administration's growing impatience over its dispute with the allies, Ms. Rice warned that the rift between the United States and its Council allies was "playing into the hands" of Mr. Hussein and coming across as similar to the "appeasement" of Hitler in the 1930's.
But Ms. Rice also said the United States would continue trying to persuade the Europeans of the need for quick action on Iraq.
It was possible, she said, that France and others might be persuaded to act if Iraq defies the United Nations in the next few weeks on inspectors' demands to interview scientists freely and carry out unimpeded flights over Iraq. 
Ms. Rice's comments were on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" and "Fox News Sunday." 
Administration officials said over the weekend that the current plan for the United States is to set the "benchmarks" for Iraq in the next two weeks to test its willingness to disarm. Britain and the United States also plan to introduce a new resolution in the Security Council, as early as Tuesday, declaring Iraq to be in defiance of its obligations and to declare that it must now face "serious consequences" -- code words for military force.
Aides to President Bush acknowledge that with France, Germany, Russia, China and other nations oppose such a resolution, there are not enough votes now to pass it. But the administration hopes that if Iraq fails the new tests, those countries might recognize the situation and at least not veto a resolution with "serious consequences" in it.
It takes 9 of 15 votes to pass a Security Council resolution, and France, Russia, China, the United States and Britain have veto power. 
The NATO accord settled a dispute that administration officials had said was more about symbolism than substance.
In December, Washington asked the alliance to supply Patriot missiles, Awacs planes and chemical and biological warfare defense systems to Turkey. The package was intended as an incentive to persuade Turkey to authorize its own troops to take part in an Iraqi invasion and to allow American forces to use it as a base.
The administration was also hoping that help from NATO would bolster the Turkish government's political standing in the face of widespread popular opposition to a war. 
NATO, which was established in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union, has a tradition of responding to many such requests by consensus, so that if any one nation objects, the decision is held up.
France and Germany, joined by Belgium, argued that the equipment should be supplied informally by individual alliance members but not by a formal decision of NATO. Indeed, although Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany has adamantly opposed the American stand on Iraq, he also allowed Patriot missiles to be loaned to the Netherlands, which would then ship them to Turkey.
From the European point of view, the United States demand of NATO was intended to serve as a political gesture for Turkey. Indeed, a senior administration official said a week ago that the primary objective was to "send a signal of resolve" to Mr. Hussein in Baghdad.
Some NATO officials said France was the main obstacle in the impasse, and that as soon as it was decided to shift the decision to the planning council, to which France does not belong, it took only a short time to authorize what Turkey needed. France won praise from some officials for agreeing to let the decision be made in this way.
Despite the NATO move, there continued to be signs today of difficulty in enlisting Turkey in support of a war against Iraq. Turkey was to vote on Tuesday on allowing American troops to use the country as a base of attack. But senior Turkish officials, apparently unhappy with American offers of economic aid, indicated today that they might postpone the vote. 
The Turkish foreign minister, Yasir Yakis, had come to Washington to negotiate the package. Last month, some administration officials said Turkey would be offered a $4 billion aid package, but other reports have put the figure much higher. A Turkish official said in Ankara that Mr. Yakis's talks had not gone well.
Administration officials nonetheless expressed confidence that Turkey would eventually back an American-led war against Iraq. Defense Secretary Donald D. Rumsfeld and Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary, have invested much time and effort to court the Ankara government.
In another arena in the Middle East, there were signs that the Arab coalition that the United States has sought to enlist in the war was also becoming shaky.
The Arab foreign ministers in Cairo decided not to call an emergency meeting of Arab leaders to press Iraq to comply with United Nations disarmament demands, after Syria argued that the pressure should be placed on the United States instead.
The foreign ministers issued acommunique saying Arab nations should deny support for a military action against Iraq. But several crucial Arab states, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are already cooperating with the United States in building up forces against Iraq.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Des Moines; 
A City of Agriculture and Insurance

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN; This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

 BODY:
With its rich soil, Iowa was almost created for agriculture. The businesses in Des Moines, its capital, reflect this. Pioneer Hi-Bred, the seed company, is one of its biggest employers, and many other farm suppliers have their headquarters in the city.
 But Des Moines is also a major insurance center. Almost 60 life, health and casualty companies employ more than 20,000 people, according to the Greater Des Moines Partnership, a business development group. The largest is the Principal Financial Group, a Fortune 500 company that sells life and health insurance as well as annuities. 
 Another major employer is the Meredith Corporation, which owns 11 television stations and publishes 16 magazines, including Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal. In nearby Pella, the Pella Corporation makes windows and doors.

AIRPORT
In the last five years, the DES MOINES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT has remodeled its terminal, added 40,000 square feet of baggage-claim area and built two parking garages. Arthur J. Slusark, a vice president at Meredith, called it "extremely hassle-free." There are short lines inside and little traffic outside, he said, and "the on-site rental cars are 30 seconds from the check-in desks."
There are some drawbacks to being a small airport, however. Claiming baggage, for example, can be slow, especially in the evenings. "I've waited as long as 30 minutes for my bag," Mr. Slusark said.
Added security has not had a significant effect, travelers say. "We still have the luxury of having a very efficient system," said Thomas G. West, vice president for government affairs at Pioneer Hi-Bred.
Remodeling improved the airport's amenities, but they are still sparse. There is only one restaurant and bar, though both have branches inside and outside the security cordon.

HOTELS
The SUITES OF 800 LOCUST (515-288-5800, $149 to $199) is a boutique-style hotel with about 100 rooms -- each with multiple phone lines and computer links, and about one-third of them with fireplaces. "The lobby is a great place to meet people," Mr. West said.
HOTEL FORT DES MOINES (515-243-1161, $79 to $119), which opened in 1919, has an impressive period lobby, an indoor pool and 240 rooms, including 55 suites, each with computer links.
HOTEL SAVERY (515-244-2151, $109 to $249), the closet hotel to the civic center, is another restored historic property, a red-brick cube that has been modernized with dual telephone lines and computer links.

RESTAURANTS
801 STEAK AND CHOP HOUSE (515-288-6000, $150 for dinner for two, including wine and tip), at 801 Grand Avenue, on the ground floor of the Principal Group's headquarters building, has long been the first choice to entertain important clients, local executives say. Its bar is welcoming -- all dark wood and cut-glass windows -- but sometimes thick with cigar smoke.
Just west of downtown, in the close-in suburb of Clive, COSI CUCINA ITALIAN GRILL (515-278-8148, $70) has "excellent" Italian food "and great bread," Mr. West said.
A-DONG (515-284-5632, $30) and THAI FLAVORS (515-262-4658, $30) are two of many good Asian restaurants started by Vietnamese refugees two decades ago. "If you are on a tight T.& E. budget, these are excellent choices," Mr. Slusark said. "Your biggest challenge will be finding a cab. Have the concierge get you one, and arrange in advance a time for the driver to pick you up."
For the closest thing to a power breakfast in Iowa, there is the DRAKE DINER (515-277-1111, $20 for two) near Drake University. "Every town has the place to go for breakfast," Mr. West said. "In Des Moines, this is it."

HEADLINE: Bank Deals May Be Ahead At Citigroup 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
A thirst for deposits could soon send Citigroup shopping for other banks.
 The company's consumer business has been among its most profitable, and expansion is a priority. 
 Competitors, though, are pushing aggressively into its home turf in New York with attractive promotions. And the company's consumer banking profits are being squeezed by low interest rates.
Citibank, Citigroup's consumer banking unit, does not want to raise its rates on savings accounts and engage in a pricing war that will hurt profits. The alternative seems apparent. 
Doing deals "is a core competency of Citigroup," said Marjorie Magner, chief operating officer of Citigroup's consumer business, though she did not identify any specific targets.
Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chief executive, has said he wants the bank to expand. Analysts say Citigroup may be interested in deals outside New York, including New England and California, where it controls less than 10 percent of deposits. 
"In the U.S., we feel good about the concept of growing our branch system," Mr. Weill said in a conference call with stock analysts last month. "We are very interested in what we can do to enhance our position in Hispanic banking on this side of the border." That could include deals in Texas, where the bank does not have any branches. 
Ms. Magner said last week that "with the exception of Texas, we are pretty much in the markets where we want to be, but we are way, way underrepresented." 
Even after acquiring Golden State Bancorp last year, Citigroup has just 5.7 percent of deposits in California, up from 1.6 percent before the deal wasannounced, according to SNL Financial.
Citigroup has remained focused, in geography and demographics, throughout its expansion. The bank has branches in just 9 states, compared with 21 for the Bank of America Corporation, the nation's largest consumer bank, which has more than twice the deposits of Citigroup.
But Citibank has a presence in the states that account for 25 percent of the nation's deposits, Ms. Magner said. It controls 26 percent of the deposits in the New York metropolitan area, second only to Chase, which has 30 percent, according to SNL.
"They don't need to be everywhere," said Richard Strauss, a stock analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The customers they target tend to be wealthier and not as price-sensitive."
Though many banks are vying for new business by offering free checking accounts, or higher rates on certificates of deposit or money market accounts, Citibank has shied away from such promotions. It tends to rank in the middle on consumer rates and has yet to introduce a free checking account.
"We'd rather compete based on the breadth of our product offerings," said Maura Markus, president of Citibank's United States branch network, adding that banks offering rates far higher than the average "can wind up attracting hot money," or deposits that do not remain long term. 
Citibank emphasizes that as part of a financial conglomerate, it can offer other services, like access to its brokerage subsidiary, Smith Barney, and one of the most sophisticated online banking systems.
The average Citibank customer has close to four different links to the bank, Ms. Markus said. For example, one customer could have a checking account, a savings account and a mortgage.
Mr. Strauss, the bank analyst, said that sales of other products sold by Citigroup to the bank's customers account for 20 percent of the consumer bank's revenues.
Two years ago, Citibank began an advertising campaign with the tag line of "live richly." Its message is that the bank can offer the tools for customers to achieve a high quality of life.
But some consumers have more modest aspirations or are more attuned to the rates on their savings accounts and their home loans.
Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in Manhattan, recently contacted Citibank to request a higher rate for a 54-year-old customer with $400,000 in a money market account paying 0.74 percent annual interest. Mr. Schatsky said a representative at his client's branch in Scarsdale "said there was nothing they could do," while a customer service representative referred Mr. Schatsky to the brokerage division.
Mr. Schatsky plans to close the Citibank account and open one for his client at another bank offering higher rates.
Citibank may have decided it is too risky to compete on price, said H. Jay Sarles, a vice chairman of FleetBoston Financial who oversees operations in the New York area, because a sudden offer of better rates on some accounts might push existing customers to swap for the better deals.
Citibank's reticence creates an opportunity for banks like Fleet, which is based in Boston. "We don't have a large, existing customer base to undercut," Mr. Sarles said.
So far, Citibank's market share in the New York area has held up, rising to 26.5 percent from 15.06 percent in 1998, according to SNL.
The consumer bank's profit growth has also been strong. Although Citigroup's retail banking division contributes around 20 percent of the bank's profits, its earnings have been growing faster compared with most of the company's divisions. Last quarter, the division's profits increased 25 percent, helped by the acquisition of Golden State.
Like most banks, Citibank has found that the drop in the stock market has caused consumers to put their money in the bank, despite low interest rates on savings and money market accounts. Mr. Weill's emphasis on controlling costs has helped pretax profit margins increase to 37 percent from 11 percent since the Travelers Group, run by Mr. Weill, merged with Citicorp in 1998.
But analysts worry that the consumer banking business will find it hard to sustain that level of profitability, especially once the stock market recovers and consumers again seek higher returns on their investments.
"Going forward, it is inevitable that the consumer banking business will slow," said Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. Profits are also being squeezed by the most recent rate cuts, as banks are making less on the difference between the interest they pay consumers and their cost of raising money. Deposit accounts already pay so little that banks have little room to cut those rates further.
To keep profits growing, Citigroup will probably turn to acquisitions, Mr. McVey said. Since Citigroup was formed in 1998, many of its acquisitions have been in the consumer banking business: the European American Bank was acquired for $1.6 billion in 2001; Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, Mexico's second-largest bank, for $12.5 billion in 2001; and Golden State, parent of California Federal Bank, the nation's third-largest savings and loan in assets, for about $6 billion.
Given that Citigroup has less than 10 percent of deposits in most markets outside the New York area, "it's a no-brainer that they will continue to do deals," said Robert Albertson, chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.
Some of these deals could also enable Citigroup to reach a broader customer base. The company hopes to sell credit cards and other products heavily to Hispanic customers, for example. Its emphasis since the Banamex and Golden State acquisitions has "basically been on savings products" for these customers, said Luis Pena, director of Hispanic markets at the bank.
Even though the Citigroup stock price has fallen 19 percent over the last year, shareholders would probably not be bothered if Mr. Weill announced a bank deal. Citigroup's latest acquisitions have paid off for shareholders fairly quickly.
"They have proven to be exceptionally good at doing acquisitions that are shareholder friendly," Mr. Albertson said.

HEADLINE: A List Some Carmakers Don't Covet 

BYLINE:  ByDANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Automakers are obsessed with ratings, from customer satisfaction to how many hours it takes workers to assemble a car. But there is at least one list many do not like to talk about.
 The Environmental Protection Agency rates every vehicle according to the amount of pollutants coming out of the tailpipe that contribute to smog, which can worsen asthma and lead to cancer and lung damage. Many popular sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rank at the bottom on the 0-to-10 scale. Among them are a number of recently introduced -- and highly profitable -- models. 
 Vehicles with ratings from 0 to 4 include four pickup trucks -- the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram and GMC Sierra -- as well as sport utilities, including the Mercedes M class, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon and Lincoln Navigator. 
Toyota, which has been praised by environmentalists for its fuel-efficient hybrid car, the Prius, also sells three sport utility vehicles that receive low ratings: the Sequoia, the Land Cruiser and the LX 470 from its Lexus division. 
The low ratings mean that these vehicles emit at best 21 pounds of pollutants for every 15,000 miles driven, the E.P.A. says, and have 2 to 10 times the emissions of most Honda Civics. (The ratings are posted at epa.gov/greenvehicles.) 
Carmakers point out that even for the lowest-rated vehicles, emissions of smog-forming pollutants -- chemicals like hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide as well as soot -- are substantially lower than in the past. And by the end of the decade, regulations will be phased out that currently allow medium and large sport utilities and pickups to have greater emissions of airborne pollutants than do cars. 
"By next year, 2004, cars and trucks will run 99 percent cleaner than they did in the 60's," William Clay Ford Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said in a speech last month. 
Even so, environmentalists say the air would be far cleaner were it not for the growing popularity of large vehicles. A recent study by one group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, showed that the average light truck -- a category that includes sport utilities, minivans and pickups -- emits nearly 2.5 times the smog-forming pollutants of the average car and nearly 1.5 times the global-warming gases. 
The critics say that automakers could do more to reduce emissions right away, pointing to small sport utilities like the Honda Element and the Volvo XC 90 that score higher in the E.P.A. ratings. The improvement can be accomplished by adding or upgrading various technologies, including the catalytic converter, or by improving fuel economy. 
Honda performed the best over all in the study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, in part because it makes fewer large vehicles than its competitors. A push by Ford to reduce the emissions of its vehicles ahead of the regulatory deadlines made it the highest rated of the Big Three. 
Of greatest concern to environmental groups is that vehicles with low scores on the E.P.A. scale also consume the most gasoline and, therefore, emit larger amounts of carbon dioxide, which many scientists consider a major contributor to global warming. While filtration and engine technology have sharply reduced emissions of smog-forming pollutants, there are no filters for carbon. 
"We are making progress in controlling health-threatening air pollution, the stuff that causes respiratory problems," said John M. DeCicco, a senior fellow at Environmental Defense, which monitors vehicle emissions. "For greenhouse pollution, it's completely different. We're not cutting it at all, and it's growing as fast as driving is growing."
Faster, possibly, because of the popularity of bigger sport utilities and pickups. 
Japan's Big Three -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- are in the midst of an aggressive push into those categories, once the exclusive domain of the domestic Big Three. Even European automakers that made their names selling performance cars, like Porsche and BMW, view the sport utility as a staple of their American showrooms. The competition has in many ways improved these vehicles, and it has made them more affordable, as well. That has only helped sales of these most environmentally troublesome vehicles.
While growth of the very largest sport utilities has stalled, over all sport utilities continue to gain market share at the expense of passenger cars and minivans. On the E.P.A. scale, small and midsize sport utilities tend to score in the 2 to 5 range and cars in the 6 to 7 range. The highest ratings are earned by cars that are the most fuel efficient, particularly those made by Honda. But small sport utilities with sophisticated engines and catalytic converters can do well, like the Honda Element, which scores 6 to 8. 
The bottom of the E.P.A.'s chart is dominated by the largest vehicles, though some of the giants do better than others because of different emissions control technologies. The Hummer H2 by General Motors gets a 2, while the scores for the BMW X5 sport utility range from 1 to 4. The high-performance version of the Mercedes-Benz M-Class gets a 0 rating, while all other versions score 1; that means they produce at least twice as much in smog-forming pollutants as the Ford Explorer, a 4 on the E.P.A. scale. 
The same vehicle can get more than one grade depending on which of several certification standards is used -- California guidelines, federal standards, or more stringent federal clean-vehicle standards for certain regions with more pollution -- and low-sulfur gasoline in California reduces emissions. So the grading system is best not taken as gospel, experts say.
But the ranges into which vehicles fall give an idea of their relative contribution to pollution that can cause smog.
The ratings make clear the extent to which Asian automakers -- whose showrooms long were filled with smaller, cleaner, more fuel efficient cars -- have jumped into the market for large sport utilities and pickups.
Toyota already sells a full line of light trucks and derives nearly half of its sales in the United States from them, a balance not too different from G.M.'s. Earlier this month Toyota said it would increase truck production with a new pickup plant in San Antonio. The company has also said it was planning two sport utilities that will use hybrid power, which saves gas by supplementing the internal combustion engine with electric power. 
Nissan plans to sell its first full-size pickup, the Titan, this year, and announced last Thursday that its first full-size S.U.V., the Pathfinder Armada, would come out in the fall. Honda, which has been building more sport utilities, is said to be considering adding a small pickup truck to its lineup.
Last month, the top executive of Hyundai, the Korean automaker that made its name in small cars, said the company would probably sell its first full-size sport utility by 2007 and was considering a pickup truck as well. 
In 1980, light trucks made up only a fifth of American auto sales. In 2001, they crept past half of the industry's sales and last year grew to 52 percent. 
There were 51 sport utilities on the market last September, according to George Peterson, president of AutoPacific, a market research company that conducts focus groups and surveys. He expects the number to rise to at least 85 by 2006 or 2007.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Light Truck Market"Sales of light trucks sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans rose to 52 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States last year, from 48 percent in 1998.

Great-West Lifeco Offers $4.7 Billion for Canada Life
Great-West Lifeco has agreed to acquire Canada Life Financial for almost $4.7 billion in cash and stock, topping an earlier bid by Manulife Financial. If completed, the deal would create Canada's biggest insurance company. Canada Life had earlier rejected Manulife's offer as inadequate.
 The battle for Canada Life comes after a series of mergers and acquisitions by life insurers. The trend has been reinforced in recent years by the conversion to shareholder ownership from mutual ownership of four of the five biggest companies, including Manulife and Canada Life. Page C4. 

6 Charged in Mannesmann Takeover
German prosecutors investigating bonus and severance payments made to managers and directors of Mannesmann as Vodafone was taking over the company over in 2000 said that they had charged six executives. News agencies said the six included Mannesmann's former chief executive, Klaus Esser, and Josef Ackermann, the head of Deutsche Bank. C5.

HEADLINE: In Pursuit of Perks, Buyers Are Returning To Store Credit Cards 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
Store credit cards, considered the poor cousins of major credit cards, are staging a revival, thanks to some aggressive promotions and perks offered by retailers.
 In September, Bloomingdale's began giving shoppers who charge five pairs of shoes on store cards an additional 25 percent, or $25, off a sixth pair. Pier 1 Imports cardholders who spend at least $1,000 a year receive free local deliveries. Neiman Marcus members who collect 100,000 points can upgrade their Hertz car rentals. Target card customers can donate 1 percent of what they spend to whichever nonprofit school -- public or private -- they select. 
 In the past, most stores gave discounts only on first purchases. Now they are adopting more creative and expansive rewards programs to compete with offerings like airline miles and hotel stays. 
As a result, many consumers have ended up with wallets full of sometimes forgotten store cards. 
"I pulled my credit report from the Internet, and I saw every one of my store accounts still open -- even though they've been paid down to zero," said John Hanig, 48, a registered nurse from Charlotte, N.C. "The end result is 15 cards with God knows how much available credit."
Though consumer debt on major credit cards is seven times that on store cards, the retailers' efforts are starting to pay off. In 2001, spending on store cards rose 4 percent, to $125 billion, after an 18 percent surge in 2000, according to the Nilson Report, a publication based in Oxnard, Calif., that tracks payment systems. And those figures are not counting the store-branded MasterCard and Visa cards that many retailers now offer.
"Folks have been writing the obituary for store cards for quite some time, and they've been wrong," said John Grund, a partner at First Annapolis Consulting in Annapolis, Md. "Store cards are still very important to America's middle class. They do offer very unique benefits."
The cards also carry risks, however, for both the consumer and the retailer. Store cards charge interest rates that typically top 20 percent and at times are double the rates of general-purpose cards.
As the efforts by retailers to attract cardholders increase, so, too, do the chances for delinquent accounts. In October of last year, Sears, Roebuck stunned investors by announcing that it would have to allot an additional $222 million to coverunpaid credit card debts in the third quarter. A year earlier, the Spiegel Group blamed credit card delinquencies for a $12.3 million quarterly loss. 
"We're essentially allowing riskier customers to hold these accounts," said David Kratoville, vice president for client services at Alliance Data Systems, which administers credit card programs for the Limited stores, Abercrombie & Fitch and about 50 other large retailers. As a consequence, Mr. Kratoville said, "Over the years, we have actually seen loss rates trend upwards." 
Store credit departments are not the large internal operations they once were. Only about two dozen store chains, including Sears, Roebuck, and Federated Department Stores, still run their own programs. Over the last decade, many others have either moved their credit card operations to financial companies like GE Capital, a unit of General Electric, or have begun issuing co-branded cards with Visa or Mastercard.
Analysts described the last year as a breakthrough for co-branded cards in particular, as several large retailers, including T. J. Maxx, the Walt Disney Company and Amazon.com, began issuing their own MasterCard and Visa cards, and others like Target and Circuit City Stores strengthened existing card programs.
Store chains with internal card operations own the balances due on their cards -- and any fees and interest paid on them -- but the stores also bear the full cost if customers default. Retailers that outsource their credit divisions negotiate terms with their contractor; sometimes they collect a small percentage of each transaction and sometimes they actually pay a fee. 
No matter how they are managed, store cards allow retailers to track the buying habits of their customers and in most cases to save the cost of transaction fees imposed by outside credit cards -- compelling incentives to recapture market share from the bank cards. 
The decline in store cards began decades ago but accelerated in the 1980's and 1990's, as more and more retailers accepted outside credit cards and shoppers abandoned store cards. Stores compensated by giving credit to younger consumers. General-purpose cards soon copied that tactic and also offered lower interest rates and better rewards programs. Although the number of store credit cards grew during the 1990's, their share of credit card balances shrank -- to 13 percent in 2002 from 22 percent a decade earlier, according to the Nilson Report. 
In fact, little more than a third of those cards were considered active, and outstanding balances on the accounts were less than a seventh of those on all-purpose credit cards. Bargain hunters had opened accounts to take advantage of one-time promotions, retailers complained, then forgot about the cards.
So over the last year and a half, many more retailers have worked to entice existing cardholders to use their credit lines more consistently. In 2002 alone, about a dozen large store chains, including Linens 'n Things and BJ's Wholesale Club, introduced credit card loyalty programs. Cardholders receive points for every dollar or so they spend and periodically accumulate enough points to receive a gift card or certificate. 
Sears allows its card customers to make returns without receipts, and Brooks Brothers, a unit of Retail Brand Alliance, pays for shipping if cardholders want to return items they bought online. Card members of Belk department stores pay nothing for basic alterations.
At high-end retailers, special events for cardholders are coming into vogue. In October, Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, treated 5,000 of its cardholders to a night of Broadway actors performing in its Manhattan store. Lane Bryant, a unit of Charming Shoppes Inc., invites its members to apply to be "test models" and occasionally pays off a card account drawn in its PayOff Sweepstakes. 
Hunter Blankenberger, a 30-year-old New Yorker who described himself as "not a big fan of credit cards," said he nonetheless used a Banana Republic card because he liked receiving $15 gift certificates for every $350 he spent. 
He said that he even persuaded his fiancee and her relatives to apply for their own retail cards, both at Banana Republic and its sister store, the Gap.
"We went to her family's Hanukkah party, and I think every box there was from Banana Republic or Gap," he said. "I seriously got everyone signed up on these cards."
Store card debts have caught the attention of consumer advocates, especially because of the high interest rates on the cards. Consumers, they said, are spending store credit without knowing their cards' terms.
"When you buy a blender, you look at the directions and see how it works; with credit cards, it's the same thing -- they come with instructions," said Steve Rhode, president of Myvesta, a nonprofit financial management group based in Rockville, Md. "People need to pay attention." 
United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat whose district includes Brooklyn and Queens, said, "Right now the stores are benefiting from a presumption in the marketplace that their rates are coming down." Mr. Weiner plans to introduce legislation requiring stores to display their cards' terms at cash registers.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is asking the Federal Trade Commission for a similar measure.
Despite all the store-card perks and promotions, some shoppers remain unimpressed. Mary Jean Wyatt, a New York public relations consultant, said she had credit lines at Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, but never used those cards, even when pushed by cashiers. 
"I always say, 'No, I'll use my Visa for the miles,' " she said, referring to one of the most popular loyalty programs of the bank cards. "I don't know why a department store can't offer the miles."

HEADLINE: The Snowmobile as a Hot Rod: More Thrills, and More Worries 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN 

DATELINE: EDINBURG, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Beyond the thick stands of hemlock and pine, the Great Sacandaga Lake glinted like an icy straightaway, its expanse coated with a patchy layer of snow as white and crisp as an eggshell. Plunging onto it from the wooded trail, Jim Bogert, 60, a retired math teacher, revved his Yamaha sled, reaching 70 miles per hour in white-knuckle spurts. 
 "If we had a little more snow we could really get it going," he shouted through his helmet, over the roar of his snowmobile's two-stroke engine. 
 This has been a good year for the Sacandaga Snowmobile Club, of which Mr. Bogert is a member. Three years ago the club had 90 members; this year it has 350. After several bone-dry, unseasonably warm winters, the club's riders are plowing through thigh-deep snowpacks and skidding over lakes capped with ice slabs two feet thick. 
It has also been a great time for the snowmobile industry. After years of lagging sales, manufacturers have designed more comfortable and bigger machines capable of reaching 120 miles per hour. These powerful new snowmobiles have attracted hundreds of thousands of thrill-seeking new riders. Nationwide, more than 1.6 million people registered snowmobiles last year, according to industry statistics.
But in many ways, it has also been a bad year for snowmobile riders. Officials estimate that 19 people have died so far this season in snowmobile accidents in New York State, compared to 13 in all of last season. The company that wrote insurance policies for snowmobile clubs declined to renew many liability policies early this season, prompting some clubs to shut down trails in New York's 9,000-mile network. It took the intervention of Gov. George E. Pataki and other officials to persuade the company to issue new policies.
Apart from safety concerns, environmentalists, who despise the machines and the buzzing engines that spew noxious fumes and dump toxic oil and gas into the wilderness, are waging an ever-fiercer, ultimately losing battle to restrict the places where people can ride. 
"These machines are gross polluters," said Scott Kovarovics, director of the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition. "There is noise pollution, air pollution, and studies show they damage vegetation and may harm wildlife."
And though they are called trails, the snowmobile routes that the state pays clubs to maintain are really more like snowy highways through the woods, environmental groups say; some trails are up to 12 feet wide to accommodate high-speed two-way traffic.
Yet despite these concerns, the snowmobile is king in upstate New York. "Snowmobiles remain extremely popular," Mr. Kovarovics said. "Their lobbyists have been very effective in making sure their access to the wilderness is not curtailed." Nationwide, there are more than twice as many miles of snowmobile trails than there are of interstate highways.
Snowmobile manufacturers say they have made significant changes that have reduced pollution -- adding fuel injection systems, for instance. They also say that the industry is moving toward four-stroke engines, similar to those used in cars. 
"The new machines are very clean and very quiet," said Ed Klim, president of the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association. 
Regardless of the safety and environmental concerns that swirl around them, snowmobiles, or sleds, as their owners euphemistically call them, are wildly popular. And because they are the lifeblood of towns and villages across a wide swath of New York, pumping a quarter of a billion dollars into the upstate economy when summer cabin owners pack up for the season, they are also politically untouchable. Politicians who criticize snowmobiling run the risk of being called indifferent to the concerns of upstate communities. 
"We would go out of business if it wasn't for snowmobiles," said Kyle McGovern, whose family has owned the Inn at Speculator, a tavern in the Adirondack Park that has a large snowmobile parking area around back that is almost full on a Friday night. "In the winter we would have to pack up and leave." 
But critics say snowmobiles take a heavy toll on their riders, the environment and those who wish to enjoy nature without the buzz of engines in their ears. 
"These were once simply back-country transportation machines," said Neil Woodworth, a lawyer for the Adirondack Mountain Club. "But over the years they have become bigger, faster, louder. Now they aren't transportation. They are thrill machines."
The snowmobiles that first made the sport popular in the 1960's and 1970's were uncomfortable, unreliable and slow. Most had engines no more powerful than that of a lawnmower. They broke down frequently, requiring riders to carry a pocketful of spark plugs and a toolbox on every ride. 
In the mid-1990's, snowmobile manufacturers realized that thrill-seekers would pay as much as $10,000 for a comfortable machine with serious power, so they made their sleds bigger, faster and more plush. Today, the typical snowmobile has a sophisticated suspension system, as well as seat, hand and even foot warmers. And most important, it has a big engine.
The new machines turned an enthusiasts' sport that required mechanical knowledge and a willingness to be cold and uncomfortable into a hobby for virtually anyone with the money to pay for a new sled and a sleek insulated suit. As a result, snowmobile sales soared. In 1992 only 81,000 sleds were sold. But as that opulent decade wore on, manufacturers more than doubled their sales, moving 170,000 sleds in 1997.
But all that power in the hands of riders who are not required to get any training before taking off into the woods has proved deadly. Speed is almost always a factor in fatal accidents, state statistics show. Alcohol and snowmobiles are a particularly horrific combination. The state estimates that alcohol plays a role in 55 percent of all fatal accidents. Despite this, there is little taboo about drinking and snowmobiling. 
"The trails lead from bar to bar to bar," said one resident of Speculator, who asked that his name not be used. "You see them lined up next to these taverns, and inside they are drinking away, and no one says a thing about it. Under those conditions, what do you expect? People get drunk, and they have accidents." 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that 110 people across the country are killed in snowmobile accidents each year, and that the machines account for 13,400 emergency room visits annually. 
In more than two decades as an emergency room nurse at Nathan Littauer Hospital and Nursing Home in Gloversville, N.Y., Marie Born has seen a good deal of the carnage that snowmobile accidents can cause. The hospital draws patients from Fulton and Hamilton Counties -- which contain hundreds of miles of snowmobile trails -- and the Great Sacandaga Lake, an artificial reservoir 29 miles long. With its two frozen fingers reaching deep into the Adirondack foothills, the reservoir is a seductive draw for snowmobile riders. Every year, Ms. Born sees riders whose sleds have rammed into tree stumps hidden in the snow, or who have flown off ledges created by shifting ice on the reservoir.
She said she saw her first grisly accident about 20 years ago. A man riding a snowmobile in the dark ran into a barbed-wire fence. 
"It took us two and a half hours to stitch his scalp back on," she said. "That is when I realized these machines can be very dangerous." 
As the sleds have become faster and more powerful, the injuries have grown ever more gruesome. "Now these machines go so fast, and once alcohol gets involved, forget it," Ms. Born said. She has seen dozens of people maimed or killed -- a litany of broken vertebrae, fractured skulls, snapped spinal cords. 
Despite the dangers, there is no statewide speed limit, simply an admonishment to travel at a safe and prudent speed. No training is required for adults, though children ages 10 through 17 must take a safety course. In December, a 5-year-old boy was killed in Clinton after the 140-pound miniature snowmobile he was riding toppled onto him. 
Those who ride in clubs are far less likely to get into serious accidents, said Bernadette Castro, the state commissioner of parks, recreation and historic preservation, and the state encourages them to join. 
"When you have fatalities, it is usually someone who is not a member of a snowmobile club," she said. "They have been off a designated trail or are riding at night. Maybe they don't know the trail, or have been drinking, or have no knowledge of how a snowmobile works." 
Ms. Castro also noted that while the number of fatal accidents appears to have increased, it has not been at the same rate as the number of snowmobiles on the trails. That number reached 153,000 last year, up from about 100,000 in 1997.
The Sacandaga Snowmobile Club, like the dozens of other clubs around the state, tries to educate new riders about safety, and to discourage drinking and riding, said Jeff Gray, the club's president. At each meeting, club members report on trail conditions and warn each other of dangerous spots on the lake. 
"Club riders know safety," he said. "It is the other guys, the ones who get wasted and ride, or ride too fast, or just don't care about hurting people, who give us all a bad name."

HEADLINE: Clinging to Beverly Hills Lifestyle, via a Pawnshop 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Some may not realize that in these murky and difficult days, the rich and the artificially beautiful are suffering, too.
 Take the case of one Beverly Hills socialite. She has no money, because her soon-to-be-ex-husband controls their investment portfolio and bank account. Nevertheless, a divorce lawyer requires a cash retainer, and so the woman with nowhere else to turn takes her four-carat engagement diamond to a pawnshop. 
 There is just one little problem: unknown to her, the diamond is a fake.
"The poor lady," said Jean Zimmelman, owner of the Beverly Loan Company near the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. "She was better off without him." 
Please do not call it a pawnshop, not in a neighborhood where appearance is two-thirds of the way to fabulous. Refer to it instead as an establishment of collateral lending. 
"I tell people I'm a jeweler and a lender," Ms. Zimmelman said. "Pawnbroker doesn't fit me, but people always figure it out."
There are at least a half-dozen such businesses in Beverly Hills, ranging from the mangy to the urbane. The oldest and arguably the most elegant belongs to Ms. Zimmelman. 
Hers is not a storefront, but on the third floor of a bank skinned with green glass. There are no guitars or chain saws or leather jackets hanging on the walls. Rather the shop is adorned with Picassos and Warhols. There is no silver in the jewelry cases, strictly gold and precious stones. 
Today, Beverly Loan celebrated 65 years of business. In these uncertain economic times the company is doing quite well, Ms. Zimmelman is happy to report.
"In this town, image is everything," she said. "In this economy, I find that people are overextended and nervous. They're waiting to get paid or they're worried about cash flow and war. That's where I come in."
A steady and predictable category of people files through her door these days.
There are the dot-comers who are realizing how much they liked the taste of money. "I work with a lot of new-economy types with worthless stock options," Ms. Zimmelman said.
There are the overextended. "It takes a lot to have a Beverly Hills address," Ms. Zimmelman said. "People don't want to go to the bank and tell them they need a little something to get them through the month. They wish to keep such matters private and undocumented."
There are those with incurable tastes. "Plastic surgeons like to be paid up front," Ms. Zimmelman said matter-of-factly. "We get a lot of big-chested women."
There is the saddest group of the lot, the divorced and separated women. They are the bread and butter of Ms. Zimmelman's business, and they are a study on human nature. 
"If a woman hates a man, she may sell her ring," Ms. Zimmelman said. "But most times, hope springs eternal, and she just borrows on it thinking maybe things will turn around."
Ms. Zimmelman will accept almost anything of value. For instance, an actress once brought in a bra of rubies and diamonds in exchange for a $10,000 loan. Ms. Zimmelman has handled $600,000 diamonds, sports cars, even a gold dental bridge from someone's dead grandmother. Her clients include a Saudi Arabian princess, doctors, lawyers, producers, even working girls. Ms. Zimmelman demurs when asked to list her clients, past or present.
"Discretion is our business," she said. 
And though she does occasionally cater to down-in-the-heels celebrities, Oscar, that 24-karat bookend, has never adorned her shelves.
"Technically, Oscar belongs to the academy," she said. "Oscar cannot be legally bought and sold."
A pawnshop works on a percentage basis. A customer brings in goods and has four months to pay back a loan, plus interest, or to extend it for another four months. Items valued at more than $2,500 are charged 4 percent a month and lesser items at a higher rate. If after four months the borrower does not pay the bill, a notice is sent warning of forfeit. If the borrower still does not redeem the property, it belongs to the pawnbroker, who then sells it.
The business is not as easy as it may seem. Consider the way Ms. Zimmelman came into it. In 1987, the store's security guard was fast asleep when a customer walked into the store and shot Ms. Zimmelman's uncle and cousin dead. The uncle and Ms. Zimmelman's father, Louis, were partners in the pawnshop, and soon after, Ms. Zimmelman, then a housewife, became her father's partner. 
Life in Beverly Hills is tough for some people these days, Ms. Zimmelman said. The markets are weak, people are between checks, between a rock and a hard place, and still have an image to maintain.
"The blondes, they love to come in here and show off their new busts," she said, motioning to a customer who had just arrived to pawn some jewelry. 
It seemed that the blonde was in town working for a couple of weeks and had as yet failed to meet Richie Rich. 
"Isn't that something?" Ms. Zimmelman said. "Appearances are expensive, you know."

European Union Warns Iraq, But With Reservations
The leaders of the 15 members of the European Union warned Iraq that it must disarm "immediately and fully," but said that Europe wants to achieve this disarmament peacefully and war should only be envisaged as a last resort. A statement issued by the group appeared to represent an effort to paper over trans-Atlantic differences through firm demands while maintaining a distinct European position dedicated to a peaceful outcome. A1

Diplomats from the United States and Britain worked on a new resolution designed to present a short-term ultimatum to Iraq and to enlist maximum possible support on the United Nations Security Council for military action against Iraq. Weapons inspectors reported that, for the first time since inspections were resumed in Iraq, the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flew over the country to provide intelligence for inspectors. A11

Officials Discuss Iraq Risks
Senior Bush administration officials are for the first time openly discussing what could go wrong in Iraq not only during an attack, but also in the aftermath of an invasion. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has a four- to five-page, typewritten catalog of risks he refers to constantly. A1

Critical Point for Turkey Deal
Turkish leaders ruled out a deal to allow American combat troops to use their country as a base against Iraq without agreement first on a multibillion dollar economic aid package. A senior Turkish official said a final proposal would be presented to American diplomats last night. A12

Israel's New Wall Tangles Lives
Israel is having difficulty untangling the knotted populations, and their intertwined political and religious traditions, as it builds a new barrier fence in the West Bank through the northern outskirts of Bethlehem. A3

Israel pressed its campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, using undercover troops to surprise and kill one militant and sending an armored detachment to level the family home of another. During the second operation, Israeli soldiers shot dead two Palestinians in a clash with gunmen. A3

Oil Production In Venezuela
The state-owned oil company in Venezuela, though hamstrung by a 78-day strike by oil workers, could be producing 2.8 million barrels a day within a month, Venezuela's quota as set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the president of the company said. The announcement was quickly rebutted by dissident oil executives who say that reaching 2.8 million a day will take many more months. A9

Reporters In U.S. Combat Units
On a scale never before seen in the American military, journalists covering any United States attack on Iraq will have prearranged slots with combat and support units and accompany them throughout any war. The media mobilization involves at least 500 journalists. A12

Chicago Stampede Kills 21 At Illegally Open Club
At least 21 people were killed and 50 more injured in a terrifying stampede that, officials said, erupted at a nightclub after security guards used mace and pepper spray to halt a fistfight between two women. The second-story club was open in violation of a court order. A1

NASA Vision Tends to Red Tape
NASA is dominated not by scientists and engineers who think big but by technical managers who rely largely on outside contractors who have themselves been rocked by consolidations, layoffs and lean economic times. As a result, researchers are producing fewer patents, and there has been a falloff in papers, too. A1

Testing the Federal Shovels
Washington does not need President's Day as a reason to shut down. It needs just an inch or two of snow. Blanket it with a monster snowstorm and people start asking: How long will it take the most powerful city in the most powerful nation on earth to dig out? A1

Son of Rebels Braces for War
When Joseph K. Goodwin graduated from Harvard, his ideas about where he was going did not include war. But now an Army lieutenant, he ascended the stage at the Army's Air Defense Artillery School graduation ceremony picked by his commanders as among the best to lead his fellow soldiers in battle. A13

Not Quite Sotheby's
Some may not realize that in these murky and difficult days, the rich and the artificially beautiful are suffering too. Enter Jean Zimmelman, the owner of the Beverly Loan Company, a pawnshop near the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. A14

Court Expands Patients' Rights
A federal appeals court has expanded patients' rights, ruling that consumers can sue a health insurance company for injuries resulting from the company's refusal to authorize medically necessary treatment. A14

Support for Affirmative Action
More than 300 organizations announced they would file briefs in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies. A14

Medicare Savings Viable
About 30 percent of Medicare costs could be eliminated without harming the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. A14

Problems at Fuel Tank Plant
The NASA plant where the insulating foam implicated in the Columbia disaster was applied to the shuttle's fuel tanks was described as a work environment where shortcuts were occasionally taken because of pressure to meet production deadlines or please upper management. A17

Biggest Blizzard Since '96 Blankets the Northeast
The biggest blizzard in seven years buried the New York region and much of the Northeast in one to two feet of snow, disrupting air and highway travel and raising chest-high drifts on the wintry landscapes of 10 states. But for millions home on Presidents' Day it offered a holiday break, not hardships. A1

Weighing the Value of Pain
In a well-appointed conference room with wraparound windows, high above the streets of Manhattan, one judge presides over what some families say is a singularly sad, deeply intimidating institution: the unofficial Supreme Court for the families of Sept. 11 victims who are in line to receive financial awards.

Traffic Rules for Space
After decades of relatively ungoverned exploration and exploitation, rules of the road may be coming to the final frontier. In Vienna, a panel of scientists from space agencies around the world will submit to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs recommendations for designing and flying space vehicles to reduce the amount of debris they produce and cut their chances of colliding with one another.

New Attention for Painter
For many painters, exile from Hitler's Germany offered the only hope of surviving as artists. Klee, Kandinsky, and Max Beckmann were among those who fled. Otto Dix did not. It was a decision that would delay his postwar recognition as a major German artist of the inter-war years. Now new attention is being paid to Mr. Dix as a show of his drawings opens at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris. E1

Debate Over Economic Plan
President Bush has said that if his economic proposal passes, the economy will flourish and deficits will shrink. But if the plan fails, the government will be handcuffed by trillions of dollars in shortfalls. The administration's notions that changes in the tax code would increase the rate of saving and that the accumulation of enough capital would, by itself, lead to innovation are disputed among economists.

Citigroup Considers Acquisitions
Citibank has been one of Citigroup's most profitable businesses. But with lower profits from retail banking overall and competitors pushing into its home turf in New York, Citigroup's executives are looking at acquisitions to keep the bank's share of deposits growing.

Bid to Buy Canada Life
Great-West Lifeco, a Canadian insurer, agreed to acquire Canada Life Financial trumping an earlier bid by Manulife Financial. If completed, the deal would create Canada's biggest insurance company while expanding the interests of the Desmarais family of Montreal, one of Canada's most powerfulbusiness dynasties.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE; 
Bureaucrats Stifled Spirit of Adventure, NASA's Critics Say

BYLINE:  This article was reported by James Glanz, Edward Wong and William J. Broad and was written by Mr. Glanz. 

 BODY:
In the early morning hours of Feb. 1, 1958, William Pickering, director of the laboratory that had assembled America's answer to Sputnik, was waiting for word from a tracking station in California that the craft, the nation's first satellite, had gone around the Earth exactly once.
 Two scientists waited with him in a Pentagon office -- Wernher von Braun, the former chief rocketeer for the Nazis who had become a leading American rocket innovator, and James Van Allen, a brilliant young astronomer. It had taken them just three months to match the Soviet Union's shocking achievement by firing a four-stage rocket jammed with sensing equipment into space. 
 When the word finally came -- "It is in orbit," Dr. Pickering said -- the men were rushed to Washington, where they greeted reporters by lifting a model of the rocket over their heads like a trophy. 
The nation was electrified, the space race had begun, and Dr. Van Allen's instruments would revolutionize scientific understanding of Earth and the solar system. Within months, Congress declared that the space effort would be led by a new federal entity, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It was the kind of triumph that, many scientists say, today's NASA -- with a declining technical base, an eroding pool of scientific and engineering talent and ever fewer patents and notable research papers -- would not be able to match. 
For more than three decades, NASA defied all reasonable odds as it grew into a multibillion-dollar bureaucracy with tens of thousands of managers, scientists, engineers and technicians, yet somehow remained true to the intoxicating audacity and technical mastery that gave it life.
NASA's young innovators did not just land men on the moon and explore the solar system, dropping probes onto Venus, Mars and Jupiter and visiting all the outer planets but Pluto. Together, they assembled and maintained a remarkable repository of technical and scientific talent.
Today, though, NASA is dominated not by scientists and engineers who think big but by technical managers who rely largely on outside contractors who have themselves been rocked by consolidation, layoffs and lean economic times.
As a result, NASA researchers are producing vastly fewer patents than they did in earlier years, and there has been a recent falloff in papers as well. Other scientists, many of whom questioned the value of the shuttle program from the start, are now surprised at the lack of scientific sophistication displayed by the NASA engineers charged with explaining the Columbia disaster publicly.

A Changed Culture
In interviews, a cross-section of scientists, engineers and historians of technology universally expressed admiration for the efforts of NASA engineers and officials to determine what caused the Columbia disaster and take steps to fix problems. But they also unanimously voiced another thought: with a few important exceptions, NASA has lost its status as a technical powerhouse.
"There's been a steady decay in the competence and the feeling that you're really dealing with scientific peers," said Dr. Van Allen, who with his group at the University of Iowa has sent instruments on mission after mission with NASA over the decades.
Reliance on outside contractors has left personnel at NASA centers like the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., with little hands-on expertise. "They don't really know what's going on," Dr. Van Allen said. "They do what they are supposed to, in a very narrow sense, on a day-to-day basis."
Devastating assessments come not just from scientists who were present at the program's creation, and who still carry a special pride for the inspired daring of those early days. Daniel Baker, who led a space sciences laboratory at Goddard from 1987 to 1994, said that in the 1990's, when NASA cut some of the last in-house programs that let young engineers and scientists build satellites themselves, the technical decline slid from steady to precipitous.
"I think that's disastrous," Dr. Baker, now director of the University of Colorado's laboratory for atmospheric and space physics, said. "NASA has lost some of its nerve, maybe some of its sense of purpose."
Scientists said that the agency's original sense of mission and can-do spirit had largely given way to a civil-service culture, with a maze of bureaucratic rules, overlaid by a risk-averse approach that permeated NASA after the Challenger explosion in 1986. As a result, these experts said, it was difficult to attract ambitious young talent.
"The aging leaders of NASA today came into this enterprise with stars in their eyes," said Bruce C. Murray, a planetary geologist at the California Institute of Technology who directed NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., from 1976 to 1982. "That's not the case now."

Rise of the Contractors
Some seeds of NASA's technical decline were probably sown much earlier than anyone could have then realized. Lacking a national political constituency, NASA in the early 1960's began to rely on contractors scattered in Congressional districts around the country, said Howard McCurdy, a professor at American University who has extensively studied NASA's history and internal culture.
NASA's other stated purpose in farming out technical and manufacturing work was to improve the capabilities of American industry, Dr. McCurdy said. But the move met immediate resistance from the NASA engineers and scientists who continued their string of successes by putting John Glenn into orbit in 1962 and ramping up for the Apollo manned space program.
In an often-told story, Dr. von Braun, who was the director of the Marshall Space Flight Center,once stomped into the office of James Webb, the NASA administrator, brandishing an oily rag. "This is what we find in these rockets that the contractors make!" said Dr. von Braun, who believed that technical managers could not do their jobs without hands-on experience.
The decision to farm out manufacturing had little negative impact immediately, since NASA had no trouble keeping the technically proficient managers who had started the program and could oversee the work.
But as spending at the agency plummeted from $5.9 billion in 1966 to $3.3 billion in 1974 at the end of the Apollo program, NASA began a "reduction in force" program that fundamentally changed its character. "They were basically letting their good people go," Dr. McCurdy said.
After the Challenger exploded, Dr. McCurdy asked 700 NASA engineers, scientists and administrators if they agreed or disagreed with two statements: "Since I came to work for the agency, NASA has lost much of its in-house technical capability," and "NASA has turned over too much of its basic engineering and science work to contractors."
The first statement drew agreement from 63 percent of the employees; 78 percent agreed with the second. Numerous management changes were instituted at the agency as a result of the Challenger inquiry, but there is wide agreement that those two concerns received little attention.
Allan J. McDonald is a former vice president for advanced programs and technology at Thiokol, a successor company to Morton Thiokol, which made the booster rockets whose failure doomed the Challenger. He said that while NASA increasingly outsourced its operations in the 1990's, those contractors were themselves enduring a "mass exodus" of talent in corporate consolidations and payroll cutbacks.
Managers "didn't have the background and knowledge" to do great engineering, said Mr. McDonald, who was one of two Thiokol engineers who had argued that the Challenger should not be launched on the day it was destroyed.
By the 1990's, though, privatization had become a potent buzzword. Dr. Baker at the University of Colorado said that the hands-on satellite program, called Explorer, that he directed at Goddard gave more experienced NASA engineers a way to convey their deep understanding of the trade to their younger colleagues. Most satellite building moved to universities and contractors after he left the agency in 1994, he said.
In 1995, two major NASA contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, formed a consortium called the United Space Alliance, and NASA gave it wide responsibility for day-to-day operations of the shuttle program. The USA consortium plays a similar role with the International Space Station.
A NASA-financed study of the shuttle program completed last December found that 92 percent of the money spent on the shuttle now goes to contractors.
"NASA has found itself in a position of retaining management jobs and an aging work force, while being restricted in its ability to attract, train and retain younger engineers," the study found. "Creating USA and transferring key jobs has made it difficult for NASA to bring engineers 'up through the ranks.' " 
But NASA's contractors have their own problems. For example, at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, owned by NASA and operated by Lockheed, most employees have more than 20 years' experience, while a few others have been hired more recently. Workers say there is an age gap -- 15 years or more -- between the older workers and the youngest ones because many employees who would have been between the two groups in age had lost their jobs in waves of layoffs.
The plant plays a critical role in the space shuttle program. It produces the giant external tank that holds fuel the shuttle needs to reach orbit. Since the Columbia disaster, more than a dozen NASA investigators have closed down parts of the plant and are looking into whether insulating foam produced at the plant could have damaged the Columbia's left wing after flying off the external tank during liftoff.
Before the Challenger disaster in January 1986, Michoud employed 4,800 workers. By December 1986, it had laid off 1,000 employees. Last year, it eliminated 15 percent of its work force of 2,400 workers, after NASA said it would take six external tanks a year rather than eight.
"The whole of NASA as an entity has a lot of people who want to retire from there," said James Lemann, 44, a former sheet-metal worker at Michoud. "If you're steadily laying off the new hires and you keep the older ones who will retire, then you'll come to a point where you've got no people left who can do the stuff."
One 27-year-old former worker said that after the initial certification courses, he received little additional training. Workers were given procedural booklets for every step of the assembly, but they could be hard to understand, both he and Mr. Lemann said.
"If the guy who was working there for 10 years doesn't explain it to you, you're lost," said the former employee, who worked in the plant for three years.
A Lockheed spokesman, Marion LaNasa, said the company had several programs for helping to develop a handful of junior employees each year. But Mr. LaNasa acknowledged that because of cutbacks, the number of workers with less than five years of experience was "underrepresented from where we would like it to be."

Measuring Competence
Budget squeezes at NASA and its aerospace contractors are far from the only explanation for the graying and decline in technical competence of the space program. 
The end of the cold war left the space program without the allure of competing with the Soviet Union, the rivalry that fueled the American drive into space in the first place. And few scientists outside NASA have anything good to say about the shuttle program, which they say siphons money from research that could be done more cheaply with expendable rockets.
"There isn't any science on there that can begin to justify the cost," said Robert L. Park, a University of Maryland physicist and an official at the American Physical Society, a group of 42,000 physicists.
Dr. Park noted that NASA's combined budget for the shuttle and the space station was more than the $5 billion budget of the National Science Foundation, which finances about 20,000 research grants every year, resulting in tens of thousands of research reports published in scientific journals. By contrast, science on the shuttle produces a spare handful of publications in areas like crystal growth and embryonic development, which happen to work best in a weightless environment.
Advocates for the shuttle program believe that the challenge of human space flight justifies the cost. But the shuttle is now used mostly to ferry building materials and other supplies to the space station, a mission many young scientists find less than compelling.
When the United States chose the shuttle over continued exploration in space, NASA lost much of its appeal for young researchers, said George Gleghorn, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a former chief engineer in the space division of TRW, an aerospace contractor.
"The product you turn out, in a sense, is what you set your goals for," said Dr. Gleghorn, who until last year was a member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. "I don't think we measure up to the Van Allens and the von Karmans," he said, referring to Theodore von Karman, the path-breaking engineer who led NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to prominence.
That lack of appeal is reflected in the age profile at NASA and the aerospace industry as a whole. The average age of workers at the United Space Alliance consortium has risen to 45.3 from 44.5 since it was formed in 1996, and the percentage of workers younger than 35 at NASA has fallen to 11 percent from 28 percent since 1993. In the aerospace industry as a whole, the ratio of workers older than 35 to those younger than 35 rose to 4.9 in 2001 from 2.2 in 1992.
The implications are painful, say experts who point to an erosion of NASA's technical skills. For instance, the Institute for Scientific Information, a Philadelphia company that tracks scientific publications and trends, recently did a study that showed NASA's world share of research papers had been declining for a decade. In recent years, the raw number of papers produced by the agency's scientists has also dropped.
"If you're producing fewer papers, and your world share is going down, you might want to pause and ask yourself why," said David A. Pendlebury, a senior analyst at the institute.
The same trend is seen in NASA patents, a measure of technical inventiveness. CHI Research of Haddon Heights, N.J., which tracks science trends, said NASA patents had declined steadily in the last decade.
NASA was awarded 155 patents in 1992, and 89 in 2002, CHI said. In contrast, it noted, I.B.M. received 3,334 patents last year.
The shift in the technical ambience that those numbers imply is not subtle, said Seymour C. Himmel, a retired NASA official who recently left the agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.
Dr. Himmel recalled a visit the safety panel made to a NASA center, where employees described their work. "All the presenters talked about was contracts and bucks," he said. "I got so mad. I said, 'Your job is knowledge!' "

Technical Innovation
Scientists who deal with NASA seem to find galling the evidence that some agency affiliates retain their technical edge, suggesting that decay is not inevitable.
Many point to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is affiliated with Caltech, as a place where innovation lives on. But Dr. Pickering, who greeted the press in triumph after the first successful launching, said the laboratory's decision to maintain its university ties had caused friction.
"Everything else was civil service, and the NASA bureaucracy didn't quite know how to handle this," he recalled. "There was a little bit of division of culture."
Though the laboratory lost two of its Mars probes in the late 1990's -- technical errors by a contractor were the cause -- it also navigated relatively inexpensive probes to circle and land on the planet. The laboratory remains a center of excellence in areas ranging from futuristic propulsion concepts to deep space communication.
"From my observing it all these years," said Charles Barth, an emeritus professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado, "I think they have done very well in continuing to be innovative and developing technical ideas."
And when NASA works closely with the free-thinking minds of academia in other areas, the results can be uplifting. Just a few days ago, a NASA satellite called the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, developed in close cooperation with Princeton University, returned the earliest pictures yet of the infant universe, data that will form the basis for many areas of cosmology and astrophysics for years to come.
David Spergel, a Princeton physicist who worked with a team at Goddard on the project, said there were still centers of excellence that could serve as models for the agency. "In some areas," he said, "the people at Goddard and J.P.L. are the best in the world -- the kind of people that universities and industry would love to have."

HEADLINE: A Slow, Deliberate Process of Judging 9/11 Victim Awards 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In a well-appointed conference room with wraparound windows, high above the streets of Manhattan, one judge presides over what some families say is a singularly sad, deeply intimidating institution: the unofficial Supreme Court for the families of Sept. 11 victims who are in line to receive financial awards.
 There are no gavels or robes, no jurors or bailiffs. Sometimes, only one relative shows up for a businesslike proceeding that can be as brief as 15 minutes. Sometimes, though, there can be an entire battalion of relatives, lawyers and forensic experts who fold heartbreaking videos and head-hurting statistical presentations into two-and-a-half-hour crucibles during which even foreign-language interpreters have been moved to tears. 
 The judge is Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master overseeing the multibillion-dollar federal Victim Compensation Fund, and what unfolds in that conference room are the last desperate appeals by families to have their awards increased. 
Mr. Feinberg, they say, you have undervalued our loss, your cold calculations have come up short.
For many families, Mr. Feinberg's improvised courtroom is the final station in an unwanted journey from devastation to dollars. It is not every day, after all, that one has the awkward, awesome opportunity to confront the man who has the power to make irreversible decisions worth millions of dollars.
"He's like the Wizard of Oz," said Herbert E. Nass, a lawyer representing a family. "Here's a powerful guy who's pulling the strings, behind the curtains, and all you know about him is that he's a name, a picture in the paper."
The appeals began in October. They are not open to the public. But according to Mr. Feinberg and the families, the main disagreements have concerned his formulas, his decisions about what benefits -- life insurance, for instance -- should be deducted from an award and how the award should be split among feuding relatives.
So far, 19 families -- or about 15 percent of those who have been offered awards -- have exercised their right to a formal appeal. A half-dozen or so people who were injured but were ruled ineligible for the fund have also appealed. 
By the time Mr. Feinberg finishes handling all the appeals, in 2004 or perhaps beyond, the number could well total in the hundreds.
Last month, Mr. Nass, who represents the parents of an unmarried woman who died on Sept. 11, Ingeborg Lariby, invited a reporter to attend one such appeal. Although the Laribys, who live in Spain, did not want to comment on the case, they authorized Mr. Nass to share details of their daughter's life in hopes of keeping Mr. Feinberg accountable and informing the public about the process.
In 2001, Ms. Lariby, an office manager at Regus Business Centre Corporation, was scheduled to earn a salary of $80,908 and a bonus of $14,556. Factoring in a company contribution of 4 percent of her salary to her 401(k), and $1,886 in health benefits, her annual compensation package amounted to about $100,000.
Ms. Lariby, 42, did not leave a will, but she did have a life insurance policy that paid $161,816 to her older sister, Alexandra, who lives in Brussels. Her parents, Claude and Bettina Lariby, also received $50,000 in workers' compensation from New York State.
In November, about eight months after the Laribys first applied, Mr. Feinberg informed them that they were entitled to receive a gross award of $976,915 -- $726,915 in economic loss and a flat rate of $250,000 for pain and suffering. After deducting $211,816 for the life insurance and workers' compensation payments, the net award was $765,099.
To Mr. and Mrs. Lariby, the calculations seemed fair but for one thing: the life insurance deduction. This was money that had been paid to Alexandra, not to them. And while they would have preferred to resolve the issue via e-mail, phone or fax, Mr. Nass said, the program provided no alternative but to appeal.
"This is not about the money for them, because it's such sad money," said Mr. Nass, who normally handles estates and wills, but was so moved by the Sept. 11 disaster that he offered to represent the Laribys free. "This is about the principle of fundamental fairness."
On Jan. 21, Mr. Nass finally had his chance to appeal. It was the first time that he had met or even talked to Mr. Feinberg.
Inside Mr. Feinberg's New York office, Mr. Nass and a young associate, Aaron Devaney, sat on one side of an oblong conference table. On the other was Mr. Feinberg, who was glancing at a few documents. At the far end of the table was a stenographer, monitoring a laptop computer.
Mr. Nass began by relating a personal anecdote about how Mr. Lariby had received a phone call from his daughter on the morning of Sept. 11, reassuring him that she was fine because it was the other tower that had been attacked. Then Mr. Nass cited both the New York State wrongful-death laws and the fund's own regulations in arguing that it was unfair to deduct for the life insurance payment because Alexandra and the parents are financially independent of one another.
Several times during the 30-minute appeal, Mr. Feinberg asked Mr. Nass to elaborate on a few facts. His attitude was professional, his demeanor empathetic.
Encouraged, Mr. Nass asked, "Do you ever rule from the bench?"
Mr. Feinberg replied: "No, we never rule from the bench, but let me just say, you make a good argument we have heard before and accepted before in appropriate cases. It is really a question of my evaluation of the relevant evidence."
Mr. Feinberg ended the appeal by saying that he intended to respond to the family's claim within two weeks. As of yesterday, the Laribys had not yet received word of his decision.
Still, other families who have appealed, whether in New York or, in smaller numbers, in Washington, say that Mr. Feinberg has generally been fair. (In a few instances, because of scheduling difficulties, Mr. Feinberg has designated a colleague to handle the hearing, but he still makes the final decisions on awards.) The families also say Mr. Feinberg works better in smaller settings, rather than in town-hall family meetings in which he sometimes comes across as arrogant and insensitive.
One family member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that at first he felt uncomfortable in even challenging the award for on behalf of his dead sister. "You feel you're trying to get money for somebody you're never going to see again," he said.
Mr. Feinberg was kind and humane, in person and over the phone, he said, and ultimately the award was increased 20 percent.
"He was a good man," the family member said. "He treated me right, and he upped the award."
For his part, Mr. Nass said Mr. Feinberg impressed him as "a down-to-earth lawyer who's a really smart guy."
In any case, the process does not seem likely to get any easier as the application deadline of Dec. 21 draws near. About two-thirds of all families have not even filed preliminary paperwork because of procrastination and reservations about the fund's fairness. So far, most claims have been fairly straightforward, and some of the toughest cases -- the likeliest candidates for legal objections and appeals -- have not yet been aired.
Then there is the controversial matter of injury claims. To qualify for compensation, injured victims had to have been hospitalized for at least 24 hours within 72 hours of the attack. Mr. Feinberg has enormous discretion to make exceptions, like extending the 72-hour rule to ground zero workers.
Dennis Sirjuesingh is among the hundreds who were injured. He is a 37-year-old immigrant from England. He used to be a sales manager for Frost & Sullivan, an international marketing firm at 90 West Street.
On Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Sirjuesingh was struck by falling debris. He did not seek medical treatment immediately, he said, because he did not want to burden the hospital system. Eventually, the injuries became more serious, according to medical records: chronic neck pain, numbness in the hands, three herniated discs. He had to take 16 painkillers a day, but eventually the pain cost him his $80,000-a-year job.
On Oct. 31, 2002, Mr. Feinberg told Mr. Sirjuesingh that he was ineligible for compensation. Mr. Sirjuesingh appealed because, he said, "I don't want to be called a liar and a fraud."
Now, he has one more chance: a March 6 hearing with Mr. Feinberg.
"This is it -- this is the Supreme Court," he said. "It just blows me away -- he's judge and jury. But I hope he'll do right by me. I don't care how much money it is. I just want fairness."

 BODY:
 Japan's central bank kept its view of the economy unchanged for the fourth consecutive month in a report yesterday that said growth was hampered by weak domestic consumption and wobbly exports. The anemic recovery in America and Europe limited Japan's hopes for an export-led recovery, the Bank of Japan said. One bright spot was employment, with the number of new job offers showing an increase. That was outweighed by a continuing decline in wages.

Global Markets Gain on Optimism That Iraq War Can Be Avoided

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Major stock indexes gained around the world yesterday on speculation that a war with Iraq might be delayed or averted.
 Stocks extended a rally that began Friday after Hans Blix, the co-chief weapons inspector for the United Nations, said more time was needed to determine any wrongdoing, weakening the United States' case for a military strike before the Security Council meets. 
 "The Blix comments were certainly a catalyst" for share price gains, said Gerd Kirsten, who manages 4 billion euros ($4.29 billion) at Deka Investment in Frankfurt. "Money has flown into the market. We have to wait and see if it holds." 
Optimism that war could be avoided might help to restore consumer and business confidence around the world.
"The likelihood of a peaceful resolution has grown," said Gerald Fritz, who manages 220 million euros ($235 million) at SEB Invest in Frankfurt. "I don't think there will be a war. Both sides have nothing to gain from it."
European stocks also advanced as a report that increased worldwide sales of chip-making equipment in December bolstered optimism about the outlook for companies like Infineon Technologies and STMicroelectronics, the region's two biggest chip makers.
Samsung of South Korea and Sony of Japan led gains by stocks in Asia amid optimism their sales in the United States would increase after a report on Friday that American industrial production rose in January.
Benchmarks rose in all 17 of the Western European markets. The FTSE 100-stock index advanced 2.2 percent in Britain, the CAC 40 Index in France added 1.9 percent and the DAX in Germany climbed 1.3 percent.
Shares of Infineon rose 7.2 percent. Global chip equipment sales in December rose 14 percent, to $1.82 billion, compared with figures in the month a year earlier, the Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan said. STMicroelectronics, Europe's largest chip maker, added 6.4 percent. 
The Kospi index in South Korea gained 4.6 percent, its biggest gain in 11 months. The TWSE in Taiwan advanced 4.7 percent and the Nikkei 225-stock index in Japan climbed 0.8 percent, to 8,771.89.
Industrial production in the United States, the biggest trading partner for Japan and South Korea, climbed 0.7 percent in January, the most in six months, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. Economists had expected a rise of 0.3 percent.
Samsung, which generates about a fifth of its sales in the United States, where it supplies companies like Dell Computer, jumped 6.4 percent. Sony, the giant consumer-electronics maker, added 1.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Says Oil Industry To Rebound Soon From Strike 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
The state-owned oil company in Venezuela, though hobbled by a faltering 78-day strike by oil workers, could be producing 2.8 million barrels per day within a month, Venezuela's quota as set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the president of the company said today.
 Reaching 2.8 million barrels per day would be a milestone for the state-owned company, Petroleos de Venezuela, once the world's second-largest oil company and a major supplier of petroleum to the United States. The company used to produce 3.1 million barrels a day until an antigovernment strike paralyzed production, devastating Venezuela's economy and severely testing the leftist government of President Hugo Chavez. 
 The announcement by Ali Rodriguez, president of the company, was quickly challenged by dissident oil executives who on Dec. 2 led a walkout of thousands of workers that continues to this day. The walkout was part of a nationwide general action, but the strike in the other sectors fizzled out earlier this month.
The government and the opposition agreed today to an eight-point resolution to reduce tensions, the first development in three months of talks guided by the Organization of American States, Reuters reported, quoting a source close to the talks as saying, however, that a deal to end the conflict seemed no closer.
The striking oil executives say that production stands at 1.4 million barrels per day, and that reaching 2.8 million per day will take many more months because Petroleos de Venezuela lacks the managers and technicians to reactivate the industry quickly and properly. Mr. Chavez has fired nearly 13,000 striking workers, many of them senior executives and highly trained engineers.
"Without these people what will Pdvsa do?" Jose Toro Hardy, an oil analyst and former company board member, said in a recent interview, using the name by which the company is widely known. "Instead of producing 3.1 million, it could produce 1.5 to 1.8 million."
Indeed, oil analysts outside Venezuela say Petroleos de Venezuela would probably never again be the same giant itonce was because it has been so hobbled by the loss of qualified workers, the damage to its reputation caused by the strike and financial losses estimated at $3 billion.
But Mr. Chavez's government has touted its efforts to restart the oil industry, saying the company is now producing more than two million barrels each day as blue collar workers returned to their jobs. Today, Mr. Rodriguez also announced that the company would soon be meeting domestic demand for gasoline.
Mr. Rodriguez, and other managers at Petroleos de Venezuela, are going through with a restructuring of the company that they say will see it split in two. The plan is to cut jobs and streamline operations, which has prompted speculation that the company's refineries in the United States could be sold.
Today, Mr. Rodriguez denied that the government was considering selling those refineries, operated by Citgo, but he did say that Petroleos de Venezuela was reviewing all of its worldwide assets to determine if any should be sold. "At the moment, we are in the process of a review of all of Pdvsa's businesses, domestic and international," he said. "Once that review has been completed, once we have a new business plan set out, which is being drawn up, then we will make the decisions about businesses at home and abroad."

The Tumultuous Republic of California Is Still Different, Only More So

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ 

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company's decision to open a new amusement park here two years ago with a California theme -- Disney's California Adventure -- was an exercise in redundancy. In many ways, Americans have long treated the whole state as a theme park -- if not a roller-coaster ride that provides exhilarating highs and gut-wrenching drops.
 From the Gold Rush in the mid-19th century to the recent dot-com craze anchored in Silicon Valley, Americans have alternatively looked at California with exaggerated hope and disillusionment. We have never allowed it to become just another state -- claiming it, rather, as a state of mind, one conjured up by dated rhapsodies about the last frontier or about the strangeness of the place where America runs out of continent. 
 In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, this is clearly a period of disillusionment with California -- its economy stalled, its public finances a disaster, its leadership, political and corporate, incapable of providing any initiative for a national turnaround. 
Washington, for its part, can't seem to muster much sympathy for California's travails. The Bush administration refused to come to the state's aid during the 2001 energy crisis, and it recently ordered that California stop exceeding its allotment of water from the Colorado River. President Bush, who lost California in the 2000 election by 12 points, didn't do all this by himself. But to Californians, who see him going out of his way to curry favor with, say, West Virginia, he might as well have. 
California's marginalization represents quite a change from the late 1990's, when the country seemed transfixed by Silicon Valley's inventiveness. Even stodgy New York banks and law firms began emulating California's liberating casual dress codes, and companies everywhere tore down office walls to put up egalitarian cubicles because that was how business was conducted "out there."
Politicians loved the place. No Californian has come close to being on a national ticket since Ronald Reagan ran for re-election in 1984; still, Bill Clinton visited the state so many times -- an average of seven times a year while in office -- that it seemed he wanted people to think that he actually hailed from there. But that was then. Few people now look at California as the nation's bellwether state. Texas would seem to have a stronger claim.
It's worth remembering, though, that California's past is littered with similarly abrupt boom-and-bust cycles. In 1962 the state won positive press when it overtook New York as the most populous -- a milestone celebrated as the triumph of the future over the past, of sunny optimism over dreariness, and so forth. Within three years, Los Angeles was engulfed in race riots. The triumphant 1990's themselves started amid the state's most severe postwar recession. 
Moreover, California's decline can easily be overstated.After all, if it were a separate nation, California and its 35 million people would boast the world's fifth- or sixth-largest economy, either slightly ahead or behind France, depending on the strength of the dollar. 
Still, regardless of whether it's up or down, California does appear to be straying further away from the American mainstream. It's getting harder to argue, as Wallace Stegner once did, that the state is just like the rest of the country, only more so. Indeed, if left to its own devices as a separate nation, California might well join France in resisting war with Iraq. It would surely sign on to global environmental initiatives that Washington has opposed. 
Meanwhile the state's politics have become more progressive, even as the nation's have moved rightward. This is essentially a matter of demographics. Once, transplanted Midwesterners made this an indispensable state for Republican presidential candidates. But in recent years California's growth has been driven by foreign immigrants and native-born residents. Since 2001, Latino babies have accounted for a majority of all births in the state.
"The result is, you will see California's electorate continue to differentiate itself, championing a different set of priorities from the rest of the country," says Mark Baldassare, the director of the Public Policy Institute of California. The surge in Latino voters, he adds, will undermine the state's traditional fiscal conservatism, since Latinos tend to favor a bigger role for government in society. 
Disney's California Adventure offers a sanitized history of the state, including a fake Hollywood streetscape. But for genuine nostalgia, one need look no further than the Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan presidential libraries. These are monuments -- memorials, really -- to a period of Republican hegemony, a time when an entire political party looked to California for its leadership. Now, state Republicans are so desperate they are looking to Arnold Schwarzenegger for salvation. 
Of course, the state isn't producing any Democratic presidential hopefuls either. Indeed, there hasn't been a semi-serious contender since Jerry Brown. For now, the state that millions of Americans once regarded as their trend-setter seems quite content to do its own thing.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Liberal Problem 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The big problem with liberals in international affairs is that ever since Woodrow Wilson, they've been too idealistic. 
 Liberals hamstrung the C.I.A. (thus impairing intelligence collection), scorned the military (undermining a humanitarian force in places like Bosnia and Afghanistan), campaigned against sweatshops in Bangladesh and Cambodia (forcing teenage girls out of manufacturing jobs and into the sex industry), and imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar (destroying the middle class and propping up military dictators). 
 Now, alas, President Bush is also trying to be a foreign policy idealist -- from the right -- and is showing the same cavalier obtuseness to practical consequences. 
Mr. Bush is, for example, outraged at the way the Chinese government sometimes forces peasants to have abortions. Fair enough. But his solution was to cut off all $34 million in U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, leading to the cancellation of programs in Africa to train midwives, fight AIDS and help pregnant women. The upshot is that women and babies are dying in Africa because of Mr. Bush's idealism. 
Many conservatives are deeply sincere in their revulsion for abortion. But they have blindly pursued moralistic policies -- like cutting funds for family planning, undermining sex education and stigmatizing condoms -- that lead to more abortions. The U.N. estimates that cutting the money for the Population Fund will lead to 800,000 more abortions per year. 
Then came North Korea, the place where President Bush has muffed up most dangerously, albeit for the noblest of reasons. Instead of devising a policy toward North Korea, Mr. Bush devised an epithet: "the axis of evil." It's the conservative version of liberal shibboleths like "Make love, not war" -- and equally hollow.
Mr. Bush has refused to talk to the North Koreans, because of a highly principled -- and entirely impractical -- policy that we will not reward bad behavior. The predictable result was that North Korea started up its plutonium assembly line, and in a few years it will be capable of turning out 60 nuclear warheads per year. 
Then there's the Middle East. Mr. Bush has a perfectly realistic view of Yasir Arafat -- an incompetentleader who dabbles in terrorism -- but it's a catastrophic mistake to then wash our hands and walk away. A Middle East peace now seems further away than ever.
Finally, Iraq. Mr. Bush and his aides, like Bobby Kennedy, dream things that never were and say why not. Mr. Bush imagines the transformative effect that a democratic, stable and prospering Iraq would have on the entire Arab world.
Maybe. But it would be helpful if he also had nightmares of things that never were, to understand how policies can go wrong. It seems equally possible that invading Iraq will trigger precisely the scenario we fear -- Saddam handing out anthrax or even smallpox to terrorists -- and that our invasion will lead thousands of young Arabs to join Al Qaeda. Instead of becoming safer, we could be in a more perilous state than ever.
There's a macabre sign of what's ahead in Iraq. The federal government publishes notices of contracts awarded, and recent listings include announcements from the Defense Personnel Support Center for a total of more than $400,000 for the likes of "Pouch, human remains, type II. Nylon; chloropene."
The irony is that some on the right seem to be sinking into ineffectual idealism just as the left has shown signs of growing out of it. President Clinton moved away from his early demagogic Republican-bashing on China (coddling dictators) and came to appreciate the need to engage China's leaders and bring about change through engagement. 
The model in this respect is Jimmy Carter, who first made human rights an essential part of American foreign policy; he stands for ideals but does not let them trample real people. In his travels to third-world hot spots, staring down dictators and fighting disease, Mr. Carter recognizes that what matters most to Nigerian women or North Korean peasants isn't whether the White House mouths pious slogans on their behalf, but whether their children survive. 
So let's hope President Bush learns from liberal mistakes and worries less about ideals and more about practical results. The world may not be able to afford much more of his idealism.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KOREAN PENINSULA; 
North Koreans Give Voice To Deep Anti-U.S. Feelings

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: HAEKUMGANG, North Korea, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
From a white pavilion, the view offered a timeless tableau of Northeast Asian tranquillity: a frozen lake, a shoreline of fir trees, and an ornamental pagoda perched on a snow dusted island. But the strident voice of a park guide grated with this image of peace.
 "If the United States attacks, and if there are U.S. troops in South Korea, they should be attacked," Kim Hwang Hyok, a 30-year-old guide in a black parka, told a knot of South Korean reporters here today. "If there are U.S. troops in Japan, they should be attacked." 
 North Koreans are notoriously shrill about their animosity toward the United States. But random interviews today with 10 North Koreans -- a composer, a band director and his assistant, a tourism director, and half a dozen park guides -- underlined how pervasive and deeply held anti-Americanism is in "the hermit nation."
As North Korea's government presides over a failed economy, the poorest in the region, the United States serves as a scapegoat. It also serves to motivate what is probably the world's most militarized society, with 1.1 million men and women in arms, the fifth-largest army in the world.
This is the backdrop of officially sponsored hostility against which the United States must determine its response to what seems to have been a decision to produce nuclear weapons. The policy options being debated in the Bush administration include negotiations and sanctions.
Chun Moon Il, a 44-year-old composer from Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, was watching a brass band performance when a South Korean broached the topic of the United States, noting that the United States has rivaled South Korea in food donations to the North.
"We can live without it," Mr. Chun, a member of the Pyongyang elite, snapped dismissively. "The United States showed its true colors during the Korean War, by making North Korea a victim. 
"The Korean War was started by the U.S., and today the U.S. continues to threaten us with the nuclear issue," continued Mr. Chun. "We have a lot of monuments about atrocities committed by the U.S. during the war. We don't have nuclear weapons, but our nuclear weapon is our strong unity among ourselves." 
In reality, it was a 16-country United Nations force that battled on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea's People's Army launched a surprise invasion of South Korea. But every year, a million North Koreans, about 5 percent of the population, go through the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang, where exhibits indicate that the United States attacked North Korea.
At the 82-room museum, visitors are taught that American troops committed worse atrocities than Nazi soldiers did in World War II, dropping germ and chemical bombs on northern villages.
Another popular spot is the Pueblo, a Navy spy ship captured in 1968 by North Korea and never returned. A videocassette describes American negotiations for the return of the 83-member crew, saying the "enemy knelt down before the Korean people, as the myth and might of the United States crumbled before the will of the Korean people."
Films, art work, television documentaries and newspaper articles relentlessly portray Americans as bloodthirsty aggressors. One new poster given wide distribution last month shows a People's Army soldier thrusting missiles toward a shredding American flag and an exploding United States Capitol.
"All servicemen of the Korea People's Army should always be on the alert," the newspaper Rodong Shinmun warned in an editorial today, the birthday of the nation's leader, Kim Jong Il. "All party members and workers must burn with hatred and hostility in their hearts toward U.S. imperialists."
Indoctrination here is so deep that when five Japanese citizens returned to Japan last fall, 25 years after they had been kidnapped by North Korea, the Japanese government had to resort to a cult deprogrammer to get them to abandon plans to return to Pyongyang.
The depth of this anti-Americanism hampers any initiative from Washington.
"North Korea is the only socialist country left in the world; why does the United States want to get rid of it?" said Li Ok Hwa, a 27-year-old guide. "But the United States is not attacking us, because we are strong militarily."
In a system where might makes right, several guides told interpreters that they thought that the United States' reluctance to attack North Korea showed a national weakness.
Ri Jo Won, a 23-year-old guide, said: "I don't think the United States is particularly strong. If they are so strong, why haven't they engaged us in war already?"
Ms. Kim, the woman in the black parka, predicted, "The United States will probably attack Iraq, but not North Korea because North Korea maintains a strong military and is much stronger." 
Any nuclear bombs that Pyongyang may be producing, several people said, are to protect North Korea. 
"We don't want war, but we are not afraid of war against the United States," Chang Myung Ae, a 21-year-old guide. Referring to the atom bomb attacks that ended the war with Japan in 1945, she said: "The United States used nuclear bombs to invade other countries. But we just want to use them for our survival."
Kim Chong Duk, a North Korean band manager, argued here today with South Koreans that the sole obstacle for uniting the two Koreas into a nation of 63 million people was the presence of American troops on the peninsula. "The South must expel that presence," he said. "Only then will it be possible to unify."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MILITARY; 
War Planners Begin to Speak Of War's Risks

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Senior Bush administration officials are for the first time openly discussing a subject they have sidestepped during the buildup of forces around Iraq: what could go wrong, and not only during an attack but also in the aftermath of an invasion.
 Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has a four- to five-page, typewritten catalog of risks that senior aides say he keeps in his desk drawer. He refers to it constantly, updating it with his own ideas and suggestions from senior military commanders, and discussing it with President Bush. 
 His list includes a "concern about Saddam Hussein using weapons of mass destruction against his own people and blaming it on us, which would fit a pattern," Mr. Rumsfeld said. He said the document also noted "that he could do what he did to the Kuwaiti oil fields and explode them, detonate, in a way that lost that important revenue for the Iraqi people." 
That item is of particular concern to administration officials' postwar planning because they are counting on Iraqi oil revenues to help pay for rebuilding the nation.
Although administration officials are no doubt concerned about the ultimate number of American casualties, they have declined to discuss the issue and it is not known how that risk figures in Mr. Rumsfeld's list.
If there is one thing that haunts administration planners it is the thought of a protracted conflict, which could lead to increased casualties. "How long will this go on?" one senior administration official asked. "Three days, three weeks, three months, three years?" Even some of this official's aides winced as they contemplated the last time frame on that list.
The Rumsfeld document also warns of Mr. Hussein hiding his weapons in mosques or hospitals or cultural sites, and using his citizenry or captured foreign journalists as human shields. The risks, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "run the gamut from concerns about some of the neighboring states being attacked, concerns about the use of weapons of mass destruction against those states or against our forces in or out of Iraq."
A senior Bush administration official confirmed that a number of uncertainties remained even after months of internal studies, advance planning and the insertion of Central Intelligence Agency officers and Special Operations forces into some corners of Iraq.
"We still do not know how U.S. forces will be received," the senior official said. "Will it be cheers, jeers or shots? And the fact is, we won't know until we get there."
In an administration that strives to sound bold and optimistic -- especially when discussing the political, economic and military power of America -- such cautionary notes from the White House, the Pentagon and intelligence officials may well have a political purpose. Following the military maxim that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, the administration may feel it is better to warn the American public of these dangers in advance.
According to his aides, President Bush has to prepare the country for what one senior official calls "the very real possibility that this will not look like Afghanistan," a military victory that came with greater speed than any had predicted, and with fewer casualties.
If Mr. Bush decides to begin military action without explicit United Nations approval, other nations may well withhold support for what promises to be the far more complex operation of stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq while preventing religious and political score-settling and seeking out well-hidden weapons stores before others find them, not to speak of continuing the war on terror.
"There is a lot to keep us awake at night," one senior administration official said.
As America's intelligence assets focus on Iraq, senior officials worry they may be less thorough in tracking threats to the nation elsewhere.
Just last week on Capitol Hill, Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that his ability to detect the spread of nuclear weapons or missiles around the world was being "stretched thin," and he said that some parts of the world, including South Asia, Russia and China, had less coverage than he would like.
The director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, hinted at one of the deepest worries heard in the hallways of the intelligence agency, the Pentagon and the White House: that a successful removal of Saddam Hussein could be followed by a scramble among Iraqis for what remains of his military arsenal -- particularly his chemical and biological weapons -- before it was secured by American forces. 
"The country cannot be carved up," Mr. Tenet said of Iraq. "The country gets carved up and people believe they have license to take parts of the country for themselves. That will make this a heck of a lot harder."
At the White House, officials acknowledged that they had been late in focusing on the question of how to bring enough relief assistance to the region in the days after an attack begins, which could turn the populace against their would-be liberators. Mr. Bush's political aides are acutely aware that if Iraq turns into lengthy military operation, or if stabilization efforts are viewed by the Iraqi people as foreign occupation, those events will quickly be seized upon by Mr. Bush's opponents.
Administration officials list these among their concerns:
*A muddy transition of power. Most of the planning has called for the swift removal of Mr. Hussein and his top aides. While a coup or exile might preclude the need for military action, they could create a chaotic situation in which Mr. Hussein is gone but the United States is not in control. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, has begun to talk about how it will not be enough to remove Mr. Hussein, saying, "We must also get rid of Saddam-ism." Some, especially at the Pentagon, ask if, in the event of a coup or exile, the United States military might have to go into Iraq anyway to assure that the succession of power leaves in place a government that would give up all weapons of mass destruction.
*Chaos after Mr. Hussein is gone. Several task forces on Iraq have examined what some call the "score-settling problem," the specter of rivalries and feuds that have been bottled up for decades spinning out of control. Most have concluded that one result may be an American military occupation likely to be longer than the 18 months that Ms. Rice has talked about. Douglas J. Feith, the undersecretary of defense for policy, noted in Senate testimony last week that getting at the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction would be a "complex, dangerous and expensive task."
*Events outside Iraq. North Korea is the first concern here, because a crisis there could require military resources tied up in the Middle East. An equal concern is terrorism here or in Europe, set off by Al Qaeda or others. One official noted recently that it might be impossible to know if an act of terror was set off by agents of Iraq or simply by terrorists taking advantage of the Iraq invasion.
*Securing the oil fields. It is assumed that Mr. Hussein would try to destroy the oil infrastructure. The only question is how thorough a job he would do. Blowing up the above-ground pumping stations, while troublesome, would not be that hard to fix. Sinking explosives deep underground, where they damage the drilling infrastructure, could be far more destructive.

HEADLINE: Bush's StimulusPlan And Its Two Big Ifs 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
It all comes down to a gamble.
 President Bush has promised that if the White House's economic plan becomes law, the economy will flourish and deficits will shrink. But if the plan should fail, as some experts argue, the government will be handcuffed by trillions of dollars in shortfalls as it faces a difficult future. 
 Who is most likely to win? For the experts, handicapping this bet requires taking sides in a debate about the path from saving to investment and from there to innovation and long-term growth. The administration says that its policies will follow that path to its end, leading to an enduring surge in economic growth. But its argument rests on two notions that remain highly disputed among economists, including more than 400 who predicted the policies' failure in an advertisement in The New York Times last week. 
The first is that the proposed changes in the tax code -- including an end to taxes on some dividends and expanded tax-free savings accounts -- will increase households' eagerness to save. If this proves true, the extra saving would funnel more money to companies, allowing them to invest in new capital.
Economic theory suggests that the economy would grow at a faster rate, though only temporarily before returning to its old rate of expansion.
The second notion is that the accumulation of enough capital would, by itself, lead to innovation. This happy turn of events could occur if workers, faced with lots of useful tools, find new and more efficient ways to use them. Workers' productivity could increase at a faster rate, leading to permanent improvements ineconomic growth and higher standards of living.
The administration's proposals assume that the first notion is correct. Richard H. Clarida, the Treasury's assistant secretary for economic policy, asserted that eliminating the tax on some dividends would lower the cost of capital. He also said that expanding tax-free savings accounts would increase private saving. Both effects would encourage investment.
Mr. Clarida put a great deal of stock in the second notion, too. "I don't think it's fair to say that the jury's still out" on the innovation effect, he said. "We expect that it would be positive, but we're still in the process of quantifying what that would be."
Yet both notions have elicited skepticism from economists -- even those who have generally supported the White House's agenda so far.
"You can't permanently raise the growth rate just by capital deepening," said Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford who was invited to the White House last month for a symposium on its economic plan. He reiterated that more saving and investment would yield only a one-time increase in gross domestic product.
When asked specifically about the president's plan, though, Professor Hall gave a slightly different answer. "The effect on innovation is there, but it's very much harder to quantify," he said. "It certainly wouldn't harm the growth rate."
But Professor Hall made it clear that the potential boost to saving and investment was his main reason for supporting the White House's plans. "We need to have a tax reform that straightens out the tax system to remove its bias against capital formation," he said.
Another economist invited to the White House was Allen Sinai, chief global economist and chief executive of Decision Economics, a consulting firm. "We've run the administration plan in its entirety through our large-scale model of the economy," Mr. Sinai said. "The impact on capital formation of the proposals being put forward by both parties looks minimal."
He also cast doubt on any assertions by the White House about improving the economy's potential to grow. "If they're arguing that because of this, you get increased productivity and potential growth, I'd just say that our model doesn't find that."
Still, Mr. Sinai noted that since the Democrats' competing plan is aimed more at temporary stimulus, the president's package "has the best shot" at improving growth.
Opponents of the White House's plan were less equivocal, expressing their skepticism of both assumptions. "I just don't see the logical carry-through, except in ritual chanting," said Robert J. Gordon, an expert on productivity at Northwestern University who signed the advertisement in The Times.
Professor Gordon said he once believed in a strong link between spending on information technology and increases in productivity, but recent studies have left him a doubter. Among other evidence, he cited the fact that productivity has continued to grow extremely quickly despite a two-year downturn in investment. "I don't think that future productivity growth hangs very much on the amount of capital deepening," he said.
Indeed, said Christopher D. Carroll, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and another signer, there is little consensus among economists about the best way to promote innovation. "We all pretty much agree that technological progress is the source of long-run growth," he said. "There's not nearly as much agreement about how one causes technological progress."
Professor Carroll took special issue with the basic premise of the administration's plans, even disputing the idea that the proposed tax changes would increase saving.
"It's true that there are simple economic models of saving behavior which imply that if you reduce the tax rate on dividends or capital income more generally, that you're going to encourage more saving," he said. "I am skeptical that the saving behavior those models invoke has anything to do with the way people make their consumption and saving decisions."
In recent weeks, other economists have expressed misgivings that the tax-free savings accounts proposed by the White House in its budget would actually result in more saving, rather than simply raising the incomes of the wealthy.
Professor Carroll said that giving more money to rich people, by cutting taxes on dividends and other investment income, could encourage them to save more. But he added that the policy was unreliable.
"We have much more certain tools for increasing the national saving rate than cutting dividend taxes," he said, "namely reducing the budget deficit."
Opponents argue that at least one thing is certain: the federal government's deficits would grow substantially if all the president's proposals became law. According to estimates compiled by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy group in Washington, the new policies would open a gap of $2.5 trillion in the next 10 years, with each individual year showing a deficit. Forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that without the package, small surpluses would return in 2007.
The prospect of bigger shortfalls has begun to worry experts, including Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. "There should be little disagreement about the need to re-establish budget discipline," he said in testimony before Congress last week. The budgetary stress soon to be exerted by baby boomers' needs for Social Security and Medicare, he said, should be addressed "sooner rather than later."
Mr. Clarida said he expected that the president's policies would help to defray any deficits, though he declined to estimate how much. He added that even a temporary quickening in economic growth could take "quite a long time to play out."
Mr. Greenspan, however, hinted that a broader solution would be needed, requiring further spending cuts or perhaps future tax increases. "Faster economic growth alone is not likely to be the full solution to currently projected long-term deficits," he said.
Growth still remains a pressing question for the short term, as politicians in Washington debate how to return the economy to its strong upward trend of the late 1990's.
Putting aside the White House's plan, Mr. Sinai said that other policies might be more effective in promoting growth. He suggested extending a rule that gives companies a big tax break by allowing them to make steep markdowns on the value of their investments in buildings and equipment. The rule became active last March and expires in September 2004.
Professor Carroll pointed out that some benefits of eliminating taxes on dividends, the centerpiece of the president's plan, would accrue to existing capital -- not the new investments that contribute to growth.
"If you really wanted to spur growth," he said, "an investment tax credit is a much better way to go. An investment tax credit only rewards new investment and research."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ALLIES; 
Proposal by Turkey Stalls U.S. Bid to Use Its Bases

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS with JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's plans for a northern front against Iraq reached a critical point today, as Turkish leaders ruled out a deal to allow American combat troops to use their country without agreement first on a multibillion dollar economic aid package.
 With time running out, a senior Turkish official said the government would present its final offer to American diplomats tonight. If the Bush administration agreed to the proposal, the official said, Parliament would probably vote this week to allow American combat troops to use the country as a base against Iraq. 
 If the Americans rejected the offer, the official said, Turkish leaders would decline to put the question to Parliament this week. In all likelihood, the Turkish official said, such a decision would mean that the American plans for a northern front from Turkey would be all but dead. 
"We are in a deadlock," the Turkish official said. "The American deadline is very close. If our counteroffer is not accepted, then the chances that we will put this to Parliament this week are very slim if not zero." 
Less than two weeks ago, it appeared that the American plan was inching toward acceptance. The Turkish Parliament voted to allow hundreds of American engineers to upgrade Turkish bases for possible use by American troops.
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said he would ask Parliament to open the country's bases to thousands of American troops, and a final parliamentary vote was scheduled for Tuesday. 
But negotiations bogged down over the size of the aid package, officials said, and today Mr. Gul said the vote would be postponed. 
"We are not going to the Turkish Parliament tomorrow," Mr. Gul said as he arrived in Brussels to observe a summit meeting of leaders of the European Union. "We have some concerns on economic issues, political issues and military issues. First of all the Turkish government should be satisfied on those."
Last week, the Turkish foreign minister, Yasar Yakis, and finance minister, Ali Babacan, flew to Washington to try to break the deadlock. But the two sides still could not reach agreement. 
A senior Bush administration official said American aides told the Turks that the White House's offer of $26 billion -- $6 billion in grants and $20 billion in loans -- was "final."
Turkey requested more than twice that sum, the official said, but President Bush made clear that he would go no higher and that time for the Turks to make a decision was short. 
"Turkey now has a big decision to make," the American official said. If Turkey fails to approve the deployments, he said, "then we'll move on; the forces will go someplace else." 
The deadlock threatens the Bush administration with another potential setback in its strategy on Iraq, which came under intense resistance last week during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. Bush administration officials have been pressing Turkey for months to open up its military bases for an attack across Iraq's northern border, which they contend could shorten a war with Iraq and reduce casualties. 
The showdown between the Bush administration and Turkey reflects the deep-seated antipathy felt by an overwhelming majority of the Turkish people for the American military plans. Turkey's leaders say that despite their country's 50-year-old military alliance with the United States, they are finding it difficult to disregard the public's antiwar feelings.
In their meeting with Mr. Bush last week, the Turkish government officials said polls showed that 96 percent of the Turkish people opposed the war. 
Despite those misgivings, Turkey's leaders have indicated that they might be willing to buck public opinion if they could win a big financial prize for their country. They say they are determined to prevent a repeat of the Persian Gulf war in 1991; that conflict cost the Turkish economy tens of billions of dollars, they say. 
"They are serious people with a serious strategic sense, but they do bargain hard," a senior American official said. 
A Western diplomat in Ankara, the Turkish capital, said Mr. Bush had told the Turks that he assumed that the parliamentary vote that had been scheduled for Tuesday would settle the issue for good. 
But after Mr. Yakis's and Mr. Babacan's return from Washington, members of the ruling party, including the leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told the cabinet that more time was needed to persuade the party members and the Turkish public to go along. 
"So, all of a sudden, everybody backed off," the Turkish official said. 
The Turkish official said Mr. Gul would probably call an emergency meeting of the Turkish cabinet on his return from Brussels, depending on the response from the Americans. 
The senior Turkish official said that if the Americans agreed to meet their demands, then the Turkish cabinet could put the issue before the Parliament on Thursday. If it came to a vote, the official said the chances were all but certain that the members of the majority party would vote as the cabinet told them. 
"One hundred percent," the Turkish official said. "Once the resolution is brought to Parliament, then it will pass." 
But a senior Bush administration official said tonight that by delaying a decision, the Turks had put themselves in a difficult situation. 
"Turkey has a lot to lose," a senior administration official said. "If we have to do it without Turkey, we'll get the job done, but it won't be good for Turkey."

HEADLINE: A Former Dancer Is Picked to Lead City Center 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Arlene Shuler, a former dancer with the Joffrey Ballet who has had a long career with private and public philanthropies, was named the president and chief executive of City Center yesterday. She succeeds Judith E. Daykin, who has run City Center since 1992. 
 Ms. Shuler will assume her new post at the beginning of June, just after leaving her job as executive director of the Howard Gilman Foundation, a private organization devoted to the performing arts, wildlife conservation and combatting cardiovascular disease. 
 Ms. Shuler said it was premature to announce her goals for City Center, though she did say that she intended to expand programming at the 2,750-seat performing arts center despite rough economic times. 
"The organization is in very good shape," she said. "Judy Daykin did a great job, and the board is very committed to building on her work."
Ms. Shuler, who is in her mid-50's, inherits an organization with a $12 million annual budget, 50 full-time employees and a yearly schedule that swings from classical ballet to the series Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert, which revives little-seen Broadway shows and regularly sells out.
The center also presents several major dance companies, including the Alvin Ailey and Paul Taylor troupes and the American Ballet Theater.
Ms. Shuler said that all the resident dance companies would have a significant say in the future of City Center, which opened in 1943 and was saved from demolition during the New York budget crises of the mid-1970's.
"I think it's important to talk to the resident companies," Ms. Shuler said. "I want to get the benefit of the people who've been there all along."
Ms. Shuler's appointment is a sort of homecoming. A Cleveland native who moved to New York while a teenager to study dance, Ms. Shuler earned her first professional credit in a production of "The Nutcracker" at City Center.
She danced with the Joffrey for four years in the late 1960's -- when the company was in residence at City Center -- before leaving to attend Columbia University, where she received her bachelor's and law degrees.
After law school she worked in Washington for various government agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts.
In 1981 she returned to New York as the executive director of Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts. 
Other jobs with private nonprofit organizations include leading positions at the Wallace Funds, the General Atlantic Partners Foundation and the Atlantic Philanthropies. 
Before joining the Gilman Foundation, Ms. Shuler was senior vice president for planning and external affairs at Lincoln Center, where she oversaw fund-raising and institutional planning.

HEADLINE: In Bawlmer, Hon, Crab Is King 

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
"BALTIMORE is a quirky kind of town," its former mayor, Kurt Schmoke, said not long ago. "Its heart is still working class, even if the economic realities have changed. It is suspicious of anything elegant or stylish or pretentious. We have this world-famous educational institution, Johns Hopkins, in our midst, but it has never quite won the affection of ordinary Baltimoreans."
 You can see that spirit in the refreshingly unpompous local politicians, including the two senators, a tough, wisecracking Polish-American, Barbara Mikulski, and a reserved, cerebral Greek-American, Paul Sarbanes, as well as William Donald Schaefer, a wacky former mayor and governor who once settled a bet by diving into the seal pool at the National Aquarium. You can see it in the city's sports heroes, gritty men like Frank Robinson, Johnny Unitas and Cal Ripken, who never blew their own horns. 
 And you can see it in the work of Baltimore's favorite-son moviemakers, John Waters, who celebrated beehive hairdos, and Barry Levinson, who fondly explored the world of siding salesmen. Both like to set their films in their hometown, in what the iconoclastic Mr. Waters calls "this gloriously decrepit, inexplicably charming city." 
The standard form of greeting is "hon," a term of endearment commemorated by a faux-50's restaurant called Cafe Hon in Hampden, up north near the main Hopkins campus and the national Lacrosse Hall of Fame.
Baltimore's eating habits are idiosyncratic, too. The city loves crabs, oysters and rockfish from Chesapeake Bay, which its poet laureate, H. L. Mencken, once described as "an immense protein factory." It prefers diners and taverns tucked into venerable row houses to newer, trendier spots. It shops in the city's old-fashioned covered markets, a half-dozen of them -- the only places except the Ravens and the Orioles games where all of Baltimore comes together, blue-collar and blue-blooded, black and white, Greeks and Italians and Germans.
Crab is king. People here can't live without their crab soup, their crab cakes and especially their spicy steamed blue crabs, which they rip open, split in two, crack with a wooden mallet and prod with a knife, excavating every last bite of sweet snowy meat with all the fervor of an Egyptologist opening a pharaoh's tomb. In the winter months, when the big hard-shells -- scientific name Callinectes sapidus, which means beautiful swimmer -- are not available locally, the leading purveyors fly them in from ports in the South.
Unhappily, most visitors miss the best of Bawlmer eating. Taking the line of least resistance, they stop at the unfortunate mass feederies along the north side of the Inner Harbor, or at commercialized, gentrified crab houses like Obrycki's, or in Little Italy. Marty Katz, a Baltimore photographer and food critic who took the pictures that accompany this article, dismisses the copycat restaurants in that neighborhood as "our versions of Mamma Leone's."
My nominee for the single best crab dish in Baltimore, if not the Western Hemisphere, is the jumbo lump crab cake at Faidley's Seafood in the Lexington Market, which was founded in 1782 and refurbished only recently. 
You eat it standing up, at a counter or at a table with no chairs. Nancy Faidley Devine, 67, makes every one herself, including those she ships by mail, and last Christmas week she shipped 2,800.
"Other people handle the stuff too much," she told me, "and it ruins the cake's texture," the same way that overworking sometimes toughens a pie crust.
In summer, Faidley's crab meat comes from packinghouses in Wingate and Crisfield, Md., farther down the bay, and in winter it comes from Texas, Florida and North Carolina. Mrs. Devine won't use imported crab meat -- "pretty," she said, "but no flavor" -- and she won't use pasteurized crab meat, because it has a flat, metallic taste. 
She said she watches carefully to make sure the meat contains plenty of yellowish "mustard," or fat, which is as important to the flavor of a crab cake as marbling is to the flavor of a sirloin.
Faidley's sells a crab cake made from claw meat for $4.50 and one made from backfin for $7.95 as well as the jumbo lump cake at $12.95. Each is seasoned differently and each has its virtues, but the costliest one, about the size of a slightly flattened Major League baseball, deep-fried to a golden turn, with crisp little hills and dales all around, is well worth the premium.
Delicate, delicious, creamy and sweet, it may not quite be heaven, but by my reckoning it's a persuasive preview.
Mrs. Devine is canny about her recipe, except to say that it contains only a touch of Baltimore's ubiquitous Old Bay Seasoning, which can impart a harsh taste, plus broken saltines for body, mayonnaise, several mustards and spices. Her husband, Bill, 71, a retired naval officer who never lost the habit of salty talk, said the secret would die with his wife. "I sleep with her," he added, "and she won't tell me."
I T takes 20 minutes or so to drive to Dundalk, just east of the city line, where giant maritime cranes serve the docks, and the huge Sparrows Point mill spews out smoke and hot-rolled steel. The Costas Inn is there, a bluejeans and Cat hat tavern disguised as a crab house. Several of the Baltimore feinschmeckers I talked to said it serves the best steamed crabs in town, and it certainly impressed me.
You get the whole proletarian nine yards: Lots of good beer on draught, including amber-colored Pennsylvania-made Yuengling, from the nation's oldest brewery; stacks of paper towels (not napkins) to clean up with; tables covered with heavy butcher paper; the spice-slathered crabs dumped unceremoniously in front of you from plastic trays.
And what crabs! Crab houses here describe size in terms of price, and the ones my friend and I ordered were 44's, meaning they cost $44 a dozen. Huge brutes, heavy, full of luscious meat. Three each were plenty after a bowl of spicy Maryland crab soup, rich with vegetables. When we finished, our lips were stinging, our fingers were smeared with reddish gunk and a tumulus of shell and cartilage rose before each of us. Finger bowls were not provided.
Taverns, the prototypical Baltimore eating places, come in many varieties. Two of the best, in addition to Costas, are Duda's, a laid-back bar facing the water in Fells Point, which serves what may be the best hamburger in the city, a plump disk of meat grilled to moist, deep-red perfection, and Henninger's, a sweetheart of a back-street establishment in the same neighborhood, where I felt like a regular after two minutes.
Henninger's decor is eclectic, to say the least, featuring old black-and-white publicity photos of strippers alongside a tapestry portrait of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The food has ambition. When I stopped in, the menu included fried oysters on a bed of spinach with fennel and Pernod sauce, cooked by Jayne Vieth, and thin-sliced brisket of beef, deftly smoked by her husband, Kenny. The two of them own the little place.
Baltimore is a good breakfast town, too. Movie buffs should try the Hollywood Diner, a streamlined chrome beauty not far from the courthouse. This is where Boogie, Eddie, Fenwick and their friends, all of them afraid of growing up, hung out in the Barry Levinson classic, "Diner" (1982). Get there before 9 a.m. and you can have an egg and cheese on toast for only 99 cents.
If civilized talk and an unhurried session with the newspapers is your morning game, Baltimore provides City Cafe. The bagels are Manhattan-worthy, and the oatmeal is Ohio-worthy. Blue Moon, a hip cubbyhole all but impossible to get into on weekends, makes everything from scratch, including smoothies, cinnamon rolls and potato pancakes laced with bacon and green pepper. The scrapple is to die for: cut thin, fried crisp on the outside, molten on the inside. No easy thing to achieve, that.
In Helmand, Baltimore has the most unlikely of ethnic restaurants, an upmarket Afghan place, run by Qayum Karzai, brother of the Afghan head of state, no less. Its kaddo (sauteed pumpkin) and choppan (charcoaled rack of lamb) merit the raves they win from local critics year after year.
Attman's is something else again in the ethnic line, a deli in business since 1915 whose corned beef -- a bit grainy, a bit sour, not too salty -- deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with New York's best. You have to wait in a long line at lunchtime for Attman's bulging sandwiches, Dr. Brown's cream soda, half-sour dills and all-sour pickled onions. The 1100 block of Lombard Street is called "Corned Beef Row," but most of it is a wasteland now, except for Attman's and the slightly ersatz Lenny's, whose Kelly green paint job gives it away. 
I wish I could wax as enthusiastic about Baltimore's famous pit beef. They serve it in joints on Route 40, the Pulaski Highway, a real boulevard of broken dreams, lined with cheap motels and shabby car lots. The beef is top round, dry-rubbed, grilled over charcoal, sliced thin, slapped into a kaiser roll and painted with horseradish. 
My friend Calvin Trillin, down from New York, came along for a taste test. At Big Fat Daddy's, a sullen kid served us drab, dried-out mystery meat that reminded me of boarding school. We found the sandwich at Big Al's O.K., if not a tenth as enticing as the spiced beef sandwiches Chicago loves.
A busy port for more than 250 years, Baltimore has long had a sizable Greek population, which gathers at Samos, across from the Orthodox church on Oldham Street in East Baltimore. In this row-house neighborhood you see two of the other things that set the city apart: white marble steps called stoops and facades of Formstone, a cement-based falseface for porous brick.
Nick Georgalas presides in the kitchen at Samos. Tall, mustached, fierce-eyed, he looks like the partisan fighter that his father was, and he is one of those cooks who gives new life to culinary cliches. His grilled shrimp had too much dried oregano for me, but his dolmades, his souvlaki, his tsatziki and his grilled pita were worth much more than the modest prices asked.
The Black Olive in Fells Point, also Greek-owned, gets in trouble because its prices are high. Many people are reluctant to spend real money for Greek food (and Chinese food), which is a mistake. Owned by Stelios Spiliadis, whose brother runs Milos in New York, Black Olive is built around a display of fish from far and wide, which are presented atop a bank of ice: red snapper from the Gulf of Mexico, turbot from the North Sea, daurade from the Mediterranean, striped bass from the Chesapeake (which Marylanders call rockfish, supposedly because the best ones were once caught off the port of Rock Hall).
Simply grilled or pan-fried, dressed with a squirt of lemon and a few drops of best extra virgin olive oil, the fish is fabulous. So are the mezes, or starters, especially the chunky hummus and the olives, which are house-marinated in zaatar, a Middle Eastern spice combination that includes sumac, crushed sesame seeds and a thymelike regional herb from a woody bush.
Y OU'LL accuse me of stretching a point, but I would include the Women's Industrial Exchange in this roll call of ethnic eating in Baltimore. Founded in 1880 as a means of helping needy gentlewomen earn an income, it has been going strong ever since on the same corner of North Charles Street, selling handmade craft articles in the front room and handmade WASP food -- plain, unadorned, old-fashioned, superbly ordinary American food -- in the back room.
Outside Greenwich and Locust Valley, there aren't many cheerleaders these days for WASP food, but if a few more serious eaters would try the industrial exchange (closed for renovation until late spring) maybe that would change. How's this for lunch: a pile of the best chicken salad you've ever tasted, a block of ruby-red tomato aspic and a deviled egg, for a big $6.75? Add a cupcake -- yes, a cupcake -- or a wedge of lemon meringue pie for $3.
Mencken fans will have noticed a few things missing. The old grouch was a great drinker who called himself "omnibibulous" and described the dry martini as "the only American invention as perfect as a sonnet." He was a great eater, who termed crab a la creole "the most magnificent victual yet devised by mortal man." But much of Mencken's Baltimore is gone, despite the city's predilection for the tried and true.
The hometown beer, National Bohemian, the beloved Natty Boh, is brewed in North Carolina now. Other icons of the Teutonic culinary culture have vanished as well, including many of Mencken's favorite restaurants, like Miller Brothers, where my father took me as a lad to eat turtle soup; Schellhase's, where Mencken's Saturday Night Club met, and Haussner's, which was stuffed with paintings and sculptures that brought more than $10 million at auction when it closed down. You can still find a snickerdoodle cookie, but sour beef and dumplings, Baltimore's version of sauerbraten, is disappearing fast.
Depressing to report, Marconi's, a deliciously anachronistic French-Italian salon on Saratoga Street, has lost much of its charm, thanks to an aesthetically criminal remodeling ordered by its new owner, Peter Angelos, a strong-willed millionaire who also owns the Orioles. The handsome Venetian wallpaper is no more, an ugly acoustic ceiling has been installed and the floor has been overcleaned. 
But the thick broiled lamb chops with electric-green mint jelly (a favorite of Mencken's and of my wife, Betsey) have survived, at least until now, as has the fudgy chocolate sundae so beloved by generations of well-bred Baltimoreans.
BRIGHT new places have sprung up, of course. One of the first was Nancy Longo's Pierpoint, still the place to go for modern versions of traditional Baltimore dishes and innovative uses of prime Eastern Shore produce. Gotta try her smoked crab cakes. Much more recently, the Red Maple, a long, skinny room designed by someone just back from the Milan Furniture Fair, has mesmerized the city's noctambulist young. More a bar than a restaurant, it nevertheless serves classy Asian "tapas" like duck egg rolls and shrimp and tuna tartare.
But the undisputed prince and princess of Baltimore gastronomy at the moment are Tony Foreman and his wife, Cindy Wolf. A grape nut and a buddy of Robert Parker, the internationally influential critic, who lives not far from here, Mr. Foreman oversees the couple's two restaurants, Charleston, downtown, and Petit Louis Bistro in semi-suburban Roland Park. Neither is Baltimore-specific; Petit Louis features dishes like choucroute garni and cassoulet, in Paris-level versions, and Charleston's long menu owes as much to Maine, South Carolina and Louisiana as to Maryland.
"This is an in-between town," Mr. Foreman said over a bottle or two of fine Chateauneuf-du-Pape. "Not Southern, not Northern. People have a Northern edge and a Southern graciousness. They care. If they dig it, they let you know; if they don't, they let you know. That makes our job easier."
Ms. Wolf's crisp, light-as-air fried green tomatoes make a splendid foil for her crab and lobster hash. Her shrimp with grits, tasso and andouille take you to New Orleans in an instant. Her lamb and pork and ultrafresh fish never disappoint. And the cheeses, a dozen or more every night, knowledgeably chosen and intelligently served, are enough to make any restaurateur proud.
Now why, you may be asking, especially if you grew up just after World War II, why has he written all this without a single word about Lady Baltimore cakes? Well, those delectably rich confections, whose layers are separated by fluffy, rosewater-scented white frosting studded with chopped raisins, orange peel, figs and pecans, have little or nothing to do with this city.
The name originated in "Lady Baltimore," a 1906 novel by Owen Wister about a young man who walks into a tearoom in a Southern city, modeled on Charleston, S.C., to order a wedding cake. What he chooses is a Lady Baltimore cake, no doubt about that, but exactly why it is so named is unclear. Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, founded Maryland, but history records no link between his wife and baked goods. Neither of them ever visited North America.
My mother used to make Lady Baltimore cakes for family festivities, and they are favorites of mine. I have never come across one in a restaurant here, but Eddie's of Roland Park, the city's premier fancy grocery, makes a dandy one on special order.

HEADLINE: Bolivian Cabinet Resigns, Clearing Way for Shuffling of Posts 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Bolivia's cabinet resigned today to pave the way for a ministerial shuffling by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who has been besieged by the most violent protests in decades over government austerity plans.
 Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, a free marketeer and close friend of Washington in its campaign against drug trafficking, was forced last week to backtrack on calls by the International Monetary Fund to raise taxes after 32 people were killed as striking police officers and troops clashed here in the capital. 
 "Eighteen ministers have decided to resign," Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra said. The mass resignation is a formal move that is traditionally used to allow presidents to quickly reshuffle the cabinet.
The reshuffle could reflect a policy shift away from austerity plans that had been advocated by the fund as a condition for desperately needed aid.
Increasing protests by the country's poor Indian majority had sparked fears that one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere could be rocked by political instability after 20 years of market reforms.
The original 2003 budget had included new salary taxes, which infuriated Indians as well as police officers. Last week Mr. Sanchez de Lozada was smuggled from the presidential palace in an ambulance after thousands of police officers mutinied, setting off two days of rioting in which street protesters burned government buildings.
An influential Indian leader, Evo Morales, has called on the president to resign. Mr. Morales, who only just lost to Mr. Sanchez de Lozada in elections last year, has opposed the president's policy of eradicating illegal crops of coca, the plant used to make cocaine.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada has been trying to negotiate an aid package that would also pave the way for the country to obtain more loans from multilateral lenders.
But on Sunday, he said a new budget "was not going to be an I.M.F. budget" -- reflecting the fine line the president must walk between placating social protests and appeasing demands by the fund to cut the budget deficit.
While backing down on salary taxes, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada wants to cut the number of government ministries to reduce costs and fill a $50 million hole in the budget. The president has also said he will donate his monthly $3,900 salary to an orphanage.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada also wants new wage increases for the police, the armed forces and other public sector employees. However, the fund wants Bolivia, slowly emerging from a four-year recession, to cut its budget deficit from nearly 9 percent of gross domestic product last year to 5.5 percent in 2003.
Around 60 percent of Bolivians live in poverty and many of the country's 8.3 million inhabitants live on less than $2 a day.

HEADLINE: Man Charged With Hiring Another to Murder His Wife 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN 

 BODY:
An unemployed machinist has been charged with paying an acquaintance to murder his estranged wife last month in a bedroom at their house in Chestnut Ridge, N.Y., the police said yesterday.
 Detectives with the Ramapo Police Department accused the machinist, Peter Visich, 35, of hiring Frank J. Thon, a man with a long criminal record whom he knew only slightly, to kill his wife as the couple fought over their pending divorce and entered a bitter battle for custody of their 3-year-old son, Sgt. John Lynch said. 
 Evelyn Visich, 37, was found in a pool of blood in an upstairs bedroom of her home on Eastborne Drive on Jan. 7, about 10:30 p.m. Her throat had been slashed several times, cutting major arteries, and a 12-inch carving knife was stuck in her chest. Her husband called the police from a neighbor's house, saying he had come home to the grisly scene after going to the store with the couple's son to buy milk. He told the police that it appeared his house had been broken into, and that whoever broke in had murdered his wife.
But there was no sign of forced entry, and investigators immediately focused on Mr. Visich as a suspect. With little forensic evidence, detectives scoured Mr. Visich's background, looking for clues. Eventually, through records the police declined to describe, they found Mr. Thon, who lives in Perth Amboy, N.J., and was installing wallboard on a construction project in Atlantic City, Sergeant Lynch said. 
"We located records that linked Frank to Peter," the sergeant said. "And then following up on those records and interviewing people in lower part of New Jersey, we located Frank."
The police arrested Mr. Thon on Feb. 11. Mr. Thon named Mr. Visich as the one who paid him to murder Mrs. Visich, a police official said. The official would not say what payment was offered for the killing. On Friday, Mr. Visich was arrested and charged with murder.
Investigators said that Mr. Thon waited for Mrs. Visich to come home from visiting a friend that evening, and that shortly after 10 p.m. he attacked her. They also said that Mr. Thon took some personal effects belonging to Mrs. Visich, but they declined to say what those items were.
Mr. Visich's lawyer did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
The police said that Mrs. Visich had filed for divorce last year, and that the couple had been feuding over money and custody of their son. Ms. Visich worked at Expo Design Center in Paramus, N.J., Sergeant Lynch said.
He said that with little physical evidence, detectives had few clues to connect the crime to Mr. Thon, and ultimately to Mr. Visich.
"This case was, as the old adage goes, walking and talking," Sergeant Lynch said. "That is how detectives do their jobs."

HEADLINE: Waste Management to Cut Work Force 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Waste Management Inc., the trash-hauling company, said today that it was cutting 700 full-time jobs and 270 contract positions as it reduces operations in North America. 
 The company disclosed the job cuts as it reported that its fourth-quarter profit increased 49 percent, to $236 million, or 39 cents a share, from $158 million, or 25 cents, in the period a year earlier. 
 The results beat Wall Street forecasts of 34 cents a share. 
Revenue for the quarter was flat at $2.8 billion. 
For 2002, Waste Management earned $822 million, or $1.33 a share, up 63 percent from $503 million, or 80 cents, in 2001. Revenue dipped to $11.14 billion, from $11.32 billion in 2001. 
The company, which sold its international operations after running into financial problems in the late 1990's, said that the job reductions would come from reducing its market areas to 66, from 91 in the United States and Canada. 
About 60 of the full-time job losses and all of the contract losses will be at the company's headquarters here. The other 640 jobs will be cut in the field, the company said. The company employed 57,000 people at the end of 2001. 
Waste Management estimated that it would take a $23 million charge related to the layoffs. It expects to save $42 million this year as a result of the cuts and $50 million annually. 
The company also said its 2003 earnings would fall at the low end of Wall Street's range of $1.40 to $1.50 a share. 
Waste Management said the sluggish economy was creating little or no improvement in commercial and industrial waste volumes. Any revenue growth will come from acquisitions, the company said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: OUT IN THE WORLD -- Indonesia; 
Close Personal Ties, But New Wariness

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
LeRoy Hollenbeck, a development specialist, has lived in Indonesia for 21 years, speaks the language and works with an all-Indonesian staff.
 Because of his close ties to the people and his familiarity with the culture, Mr. Hollenbeck, 52, says he remains essentially at ease here. But the terrorist attack on Bali in October and the looming war against Iraq have injected a new sense of wariness, especially when he steps into the streets of Jakarta, a crowded capital city. 
 "I feel less secure, but that doesn't mean I'm afraid," he said. 
Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country in the world, and the newspapers here are filled with news about a possible war with Iraq. Strains of anti-Americanism lie beneath the surface. 
In the aftermath of the Bali attack, the families of American diplomats and nonessential employees at the United States Embassy were sent home last fall. Because Mr. Hollenbeck's work is financed by the United States Agency for International Development, his wife, Philomenia, was among those evacuated. His two grown sons live in the United States. 
Unlike many Americans here, he lives in an apartment complex where all the other residents are Indonesian. 
"Other Americans here who do not speak the language and have children in school are more concerned," he said. 
Still, a conspicuous figure in a Asian city -- he is 6 foot 1 inch with graying hair -- Mr. Hollenbeck is taking modest precautions. 
He goes to shopping malls less: once a month, instead of once a week. He said he felt pangs of anxiety the other day when he walked to lunch with colleagues from the office along one of the busiest streets.
"We were walking for about 12 minutes, and I wondered if people were looking at me more than usual," he said. "But that passed relatively quickly."
The companionship of Indonesian colleagues gives him a sense of reassurance, he said. Moreover, his Indonesian friends "never give me the sense they look at me differently now." 
He lived for many years in some of the outer provinces of Indonesia, where he still travels for work. When he goes to those areas, he feels safe in familiar places, he said. 
Indonesians out there, he said, are "less concerned with world events."

HEADLINE: ON EDUCATION; 
Defining Success In Narrow Terms

BYLINE:  By Michael Winerip; E-mail: edmike@nytimes.com

DATELINE: TOLLESON, Ariz. 

 BODY:
THE students, the parents, the teachers at Gonzales Elementary thought they had a terrific school. Though the mostly Mexican-American student body is very poor (83 percent receive free lunches), though Spanish is the first language of half the children, though many are migrants and the school's annual mobility rate is 29 percent, though they live in a drab little town that smells of blood from the nearby meat-packing plant, they are proud of their handsome school.
 The campus is modern and well kept. A tank of tropical fish decorates the entryway. There are many sports and clubs to pick from: Odyssey of the Mind, a history research club, band, chorus, yearbook, the principal's math club. 
 The school has a gifted program, and though Arizona ranks near the bottom in education spending and does not pay for basics like kindergarten, local residents passed a special tax so their children would have kindergarten, too, same as the rich. To these first- and second-generation immigrant families, Gonzales represented America's generosity: a free breakfast program, an after-school program and a health clinic, with a dental clinic soon to be added.
In a recent survey, 88 percent of parents gave the school an A or B. They love their principal, Jim Paxinos, an Anglo who speaks Spanish, works 12-hour days, lives nearby and learned his profession the hard way, teaching in inner city Phoenix. In that survey, 94 percent of teachers gave Mr. Paxinos high marks for leadership. 
"He'll do whatever it takes," said Zulema Carter, a first-grade teacher. "I had a broken bookshelf; he fixed it."
Average attendance has climbed to 97 percent from 93 percent in Mr. Paxinos's six years at the school; discipline referrals fell by half.
Ms. Carter has first graders with parents in prison, students who sleep four to a bed, children who don't know what she means when she mentions a trip to the zoo, and so she understands how great these accomplishments are. On national and state tests that measure a student's yearly academic progress, this poor school scores above average. Last year, 77 percent of students made at least a year's growth in reading and 75 percent made a year's growth in math, compared with a state average of 73 percent on each.
"That tells me we're doing our job," Mr. Paxinos said. "In a year, most students are getting a year's worth of education."
The state's education commissioner, Tom Horne, a conservative Republican, agrees that is an excellent way to assess a school, but under the No Child Left Behind Act signed by President Bush last year, states cannot rate schools this way. The federal law says a school must be judged solely on how much the student body improves on math and English competency tests. The fact that 100 transient students may have been at Gonzales Elementary just a few months when they take the tests is not a mitigating factor. It's the school's fault if they score low. Nor does it matter that hundreds have serious deficiencies in English. If teachers can't get new arrivals fluent by test time, blame the school.
Unfortunately, last year the fifth grade did not make adequate progress on the state competency exams. And that's all it takes under this great new federal law. So Mr. Paxinos and his teachers, who should be up for sainthood, instead had their school labeled "underperforming," and by next fall, in all likelihood, it will be labeled "failing" under the new federal law.
What happens to a hard-working principal at a school that the government has decided is failing? A nightmare worthy of Kafka.
Last October, principals at Arizona's 275 "underperforming" schools (19 percent of the state's schools) were summoned to Phoenix for an audience with the state bureaucracy. "They told us the law requires us to submit a school improvement plan," Mr. Paxinos recalled. "One principal asked, 'Who will evaluate the plan?' The woman from the state laughed. She said, 'We don't have the resources.' "
But Mr. Paxinos is determined. It took him six weeks, working six hours a night, to produce a 120-page report that supplied all the statistics and covered all the questions that the law needs answered. Of course, he got no help from the state. Arizona, like most other states, has a huge deficit and is cutting education financing. 
Nor did the federal government help with his report. The president needs $380 billion for a colossal military budget, he needs to cut taxes to jump-start the economy. Though the new federal law calls for up to $18 billion to assist schools this year, the president has budgeted $12 billion. 
Last month, Mr. Paxinos drove a half-hour to Phoenix to deliver his report. "I went to state education, fourth floor. I said, 'Here's my improvement plan.' I wanted a stamped receipt. The first person says, 'You know, I'm not sure where it goes.' She had to ask three others -- 'You know I'm not sure where it goes.' " After 15 minutes, someone agreed to take it.
The law requires a public hearing so parents will be informed about their "underperforming" school. Mr. Paxinos sent letters home with his 820 children. Two parents came to the hearing. When I asked Ruth Ramirez, a parent, why, she said: "Failing school? I love this school."
To his credit, Mr. Horne, who became state education superintendent last month, was upset when he heard there was no one to read the improvement plans. So he hired 10 retired teachers to evaluate the plans. That will be roughly 27 120-page reports per evaluator. 
Sad to say, there is no money to have the evaluators actually visit the schools before critiquing the plans. But who cares? That's the beauty of the No Child Left Behind Act. All that matters anyway is a school's performance on one test per year. It's perfect for politicians and bureaucrats in Phoenix and Washington who are far too busy to leave their offices and spend a day at a real school.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE REGIONAL MARKET --Midtown Manhattan; 
Maker of Luxury Goods Burnishes 57th St. Image

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the Paris-based producer of luxury goods, has acquired a real estate portfolio on 57th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues and is helping burnish the street as a prime destination for high-end shopping.
 In addition to its 24-story flagship building at 19 East 57th Street, the company has net leased for 50 years the adjacent 16-story building at 598 Madison Avenue, on the northwest corner of Madison and 57th, and has purchased the building on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street that was most recently the home of the Warner Brothers Studio Store. 
 The concept of selling movie-related clothing and trinkets having run its course on the street, LVMH is planning to install one of its own brands, Louis Vuitton, at the location, whose address is 1 East 57th Street. The store will occupy five or six floors of retail space, with offices on the upper floors, said Mark P. Boisi, the chairman of Colliers ABR, the brokerage and services company that is the managing and leasing agent for all three 57th Street properties. 
The Louis Vuitton store will join the Christian Dior store that occupies the retail space at 19 East 57th Street, which was designed by the architect Christian de Portzamparc and is the headquarters for all of the LVMH American operations. 
The retail space in the adjacent 598 Madison Avenue address will be occupied by Montblanc, a producer of expensive pens and other items. Montblanc is a subsidiary of another French luxury products company, the Richemont Group, whose holdings also include Cartier and Dunhill.
The Montblanc store will have its entrance on 57th Street and will have about 5,000 square feet of space on the ground floor and a mezzanine level. The remaining 3,000 square feet of retail space, which will have its own entrance on Madison Avenue, is expected to be leased to what Colliers executives describe as a "fashion and accessories" retailer.
With the new stores, plus the expansion of Burberrys and the opening of a Jil Sander store, the north side of the block is returning to its status as a focus for luxury shopping, according to Alexandra Frangos, the senior managing director for retail leasing at Colliers.
That image faded somewhat during the economic downturn of the early 1990's when some high-end stores closed and landlords decided to lease their space to big creditworthy companies, regardless of the moderately priced goods they were selling. "In the early 1990's the luxury retail business consolidated and landlords filled their spaces with credit tenants regardless of the price point of the store," Ms. Frangos said.
A result was stores like Warner Brothers, directly across 57th Street from that icon of luxury goods, Tiffany & Company, and stores selling Levi blue jeans and Swatch watches. Now Swatch is the only moderately priced retailer left on the block and it is assumed that it, too, will eventually be replaced by a more high-end store, Ms. Frangos said.
The return of high-end retailing has produced annual rents that are eye-popping, even by Manhattan standards. "We were asking $1,000 a square foot for ground floor space and got close to that," Mr. Boisi said. "The mezzanine was $250 a square foot," he added, saying that the final price for that space was also close to the asking price.
He said LVMH wanted tenants with a luxury image, the ability to pay good rental rates and a solid credit standing, which Mr. Boisi said the Montblanc-Richemont lease satisfied.
Mr. Boisi said Colliers became involved with LVMH in the mid-1990's, when the company was trying to figure out how much to charge its own subsidiary for the retail space in its headquarters tower at 19 East 57th Street while the building was still under construction. "We did a marketing study of the city for them and the managing and leasing relationships developed out of that," he said.
With the retail space at 598 Madison all but accounted for, Mr. Boisi said his group was going ahead with finding office tenants to lease the 5,600 square feet on each of the 14 upper floors of the building, which was part of the estate of the late Sol Goldman. Mr. Boisi said prospective tenants would probably be from the financial industry, including small investment banks and hedge funds.
Because of the high rents on the retail space, he said the pricing of the office space could be moderate and still reach LVMH's financial objectives. He said the asking rents for the office space would be in the mid-$60's per square foot annually when it went on the market shortly. 
The office space at 1 East 57th Street, he said, would not become available until the retail space is finished -- either late this year or early in 2004.

HEADLINE: Storm Adds a Measure of Insult to an Injured Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The Presidents' Day blizzard may have been only a glancing blow, but the storm will not help an economy that was already struggling to get back on its feet. 
 The storm hurt restaurants and department stores, even if it did lift sales at supermarkets and home-improvement stores. It left some workers idle, depriving them of a day's pay, while it put others to work plowing, salting and cleaning up -- efforts that have added to the budget problems facing cities and states in the Northeast. 
 And while the stock market had its second consecutive winning session yesterday, the blizzard's biggest effects on investors may be in the future. Any negative impact the storm has on February's economic activity will make it hard to divine the true health of the halting recovery, economists said, as Wall Street and the Federal Reserve study the retail sales, first-time claims for jobless benefits and other economic data in coming weeks. 
Storms rarely affect an economy enough to change its course, and analysts said yesterday that the dominant economic issues remained the hangover from the 1990's bubble and the lingering uncertainty from the possibility of a war in Iraq. But the blizzard, which moved out to the Atlantic yesterday after two days of snow from North Carolina to Nova Scotia, was large enough to hurt the finances of many businesses and workers.
"The bulk of the effects are temporary, unless you get serious damage like you do during an earthquake" said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. A blizzard, he said, "tends to be disruptive in the very short term." 
Falling on a holiday for government agencies and many companies, the storm probably caused a smaller decline in hours worked and production than the Northeast's last large snowfall, in January 1996. But it is very likely to have damaged retail sales more because the Presidents' Day weekend is typically the busiest shopping period in the first three months of the year, said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of the Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm in New York.
"It's a business bonanza for supermarkets," Mr. Flickinger said of the storm, adding that sales had nearly doubled at Pathmark stores two years ago in the days leading up to a predicted blizzard that never happened. "Parents know kids will be stuck inside doing nothing but eating for a few days at a time," he said. "But it's a disaster for retailers, for everyone from Saks to Starbucks."
On Monday, all East Coast outlets of Filene's, Lord & Taylor, Hecht's and Strawbridge's north of the Carolinas closed, said Sharon Bateman, a spokeswoman for the retailers' parent company, May Department Stores. She said that she believed that all stores were open yesterday but that some employees had remained home and relatively few shoppers had ventured out. 
Some of May's stores are likely to extend discounts that were planned for Presidents' Day, she said.
But many stores, particularly restaurants, will not recoup all the sales they would have made the last few days. In March 1993, when much of the eastern United States was hit by a late winter storm, retail sales fell almost 1 percent compared with the previous month, after adjustments for normal seasonal variations were taken into account, according to Economy.com, a research company in West Chester, Pa. It was the biggest decline for any month from 1992 to 1994.
"You lose some of that impulse- buying that would have taken place," said Carl Steidtmann, the chief economist at Deloitte Research. 
In 1996, retail sales also had their biggest decline of the year during the month of a blizzard -- January -- when the number of new vehicles sold declined almost 6 percent. Both retail and vehicle sales recovered the next month.
Government agencies, many of them already cutting programs to close budget deficits, may have been hurt worst, economists said. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York estimated that clearing roads and sidewalks could cost $20 million, doubling the amount by which the city had already exceeded its budget for snow removal this winter. 
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, said: "Given the dire financial straits these cities are in, this is painful. They've got a lot of cleanup to do at a time when there's a lot of red ink." 
The tons of snow did create some winners besides supermarkets, though. Business at some hardware stores and outlets of Home Depot and Lowe's surged, as people rushed to buy winter equipment both before and after the snow fell. At a Family Discount store in Harrison, N.Y., a handwritten sign was taped to the front door yesterday afternoon telling shoppers that shovels and an ice-melting product were sold out.
Although it arrived during a holiday weekend, the storm still cost some workers part of their usual workweek and paychecks at a time when wages are no longer keeping up with inflation in much of the country. On Monday, the number of temporary employees placed by the Manhattan office of Spherion Staffing, which fills clerical and administrative jobs for about 200 companies, was about 90 percent lower than it would have been in good weather, said Timothy Ihlefeld, a district director at Spherion. Staffing levels rose yesterday but had not returned to normal, he said.
After some past blizzards, the number of claims for jobless benefits has dropped, with people temporarily unable to get to an unemployment office, and then increased in later weeks. Economists said they would be skeptical of any big movement in the numbers that will be released next week or the week after. 
"If I saw a downtick, I would want to wait to assign it any significance," Mr. McKelvey said.
But analysts do not expect the sharp swings in the broader employment statistics that came after the 1996 storm, when the Labor Department reported that the economy lost 87,000 jobs in January after having gained an average of 182,000 jobs in each of the previous six months. Unlike that blizzard, this week's storm happened after the government had conducted its monthly employment survey, economists said.

HEADLINE: Justifying a Liberal Arts Education in Difficult Times 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Liberal education is under siege. Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.
 But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever. 
 "Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about," he said. "It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work."
At home in Cambridge, with his new book, "Liberal Education and the Public Interest" (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage. 
"A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program," Mr. Freedman said. 
"All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues."
His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working. 
In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.
This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has. 
He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.
"Life is what we are doing now," he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.
On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually. 
The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.
Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. 
"The future of America depends on educating minority men and women," Mr. Freedman said.
In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.
He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.
Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.
Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for "intimidation-free" campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.
With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce. 
A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.
Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.
In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.
Mr. Freedman is "the ultimate search engine," Professor Gardner said, "because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit."
Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, "how ought one to lead a life?"
"That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses," he writes. "The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate."
These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.
"I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits," Dr. Kaufman said.
"They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live."

HEADLINE: Volunteerism By Lawyers Is on the Rise 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
The sluggish economy has led lawyers to do free legal work in numbers that appear to reverse a decade-long decline in public service across the nation, experts say, with New York at the forefront of the trend.
 Some of the lawyers who have volunteered have been laid off. Others said they were not able to find jobs after law school and were hoping to make themselves more marketable to firms. Still others are on loan to service organizations from firms that are now pursuing pro bono opportunities, or firms where there is less work. 
 Some experts say the increase may also have to do with post-Sept. 11 altruism. 
The willingness of lawyers to do pro bono work "ebbs and flows for reasons that are beyond anyone's understanding," said Steven B. Scudder, counsel to the American Bar Association's standing committee on public service. 
But people with knowledge of recent trends, including Mr. Scudder, said some evidence suggested that volunteerism, like the business cycle itself, was cyclical. During the boom times of the late 1990's, for example, many of the nation's biggest law firms were inundated with business. Today, some lawyers say, the reality is that they have more hours to give.
While there are few reliable methods of tracking legal work done at no cost, information from bar associations and law firms suggests that the number of lawyers working pro bono publico, or for the public good, has as much as doubled in some areas from as recently as two years ago.
"There's more time for doing pro bono work," said Mel M. Immergut, chairman of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, a firm based in Manhattan, and a director of the Legal Aid Society.
Mr. Immergut said that nearly every firm in New York has less paying work, and that in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, there is a lingering sense of community spirit. Those two realities, he said, are the likely reasons behind the increase in pro bono assistance in the city.
"We certainly have encouraged our associates to be involved," he said. "We have always encouraged that, but sometimes it's hard for lawyers to juggle a huge work schedule and pro bono clients, and now they are in a better position to do that."
Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center, has estimated that major firms in the nations' largest cities are donating roughly 10,000 to 30,000 hours each in pro bono time a year. 
As recently as 1999, the roughly 50,000 lawyers at the nation's 100 highest-grossing firms spent an average of just eight minutes a day on pro bono cases, according to a survey by American Lawyer magazine.
Nationally, the increases in pro bono work might have most to do with the effect of the economy on the legal field. Some firms outside New York have shut down under the weight of the leaden economy. The most high-profile collapses came earlier this month, when partners at Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, a prominent firm in the San Francisco Bay area, decided to wind down the firm's business. Soon after, Skjerven Morrill, a 67-lawyer firm in San Jose, Calif., specializing in intellectual property law, announced that it would dissolve. 
Tom Clay, the managing director of Altman Weil Inc., a legal consulting firm outside Philadelphia, said he had not seen so many layoffs since the last big recession, in the 90's.
"It's something that really does not happen in the legal profession, but it's happening now because there's not a lot to do," he said. "It's a pure supply-and-demand issue."
As the corporations that the law firms served have cut back, so have the firms. At many of the larger ones, lawyers who are busy with pro bono work are still being paid their regular salaries.
But Anne Crawley, who runs her own small practice in Woodside, Queens, said that to be a full-time volunteer and pay her bills, she does her own work at night and on weekends.
Recalling the situation when she graduated from City University of New York Law School in 1997, Ms. Crawley said: "The job market seemed closed to me. I went to my career counselor and said, 'What do I do?' "
The answer was volunteer. 
Ms. Crawley said she had been able to network with people who have helped her become a better lawyer.
"I've met people who might help me build my practice and people who have been excellent mentors," she said. "It's a creative way to get your feet wet. It's a good thing to do for your community, but it's also an investment in yourself on a practical level."
The extent of the increases in volunteerism has surprised and even caught off-guard many people who coordinate free legal representation for the poor. Volunteer coordinators indicate, though, that the needs of the poor are still largely unmet.
"There has been an epidemic of lawyers wanting to volunteer," said Richard Gruenberger, the director of the New York Legal Assistance Group, which provides free counsel to city residents whose incomes are below the poverty line. "We're housing, literally working in our office, more than twice as many people as we did a year and a half ago."
There are not enough phone lines or chairs at the New York Legal Assistance Group's office at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, and the crowding has led to "people sitting on people's laps," according to Mara Klein, the group's director of communications, speaking of the need to share desks.
Mr. Gruenberger said: "Does this really, really help us? Yes! And we don't want to turn anyone away because we have a seating issue."
Mr. Gruenberger said he ordinarily supervised about 20 volunteer lawyers a year. "Now we have to stagger them amongst the days they are here," he said. "One of the trickiest parts of my job is trying to get them all through the door."
What the proponents of pro bono service want to do now is build on the increase. Experts say that some of the lawyers who volunteer during a recession keep it up after hard times pass. Pro bono coordinators in New York and elsewhere are busy developing programs they hope will make that more likely.
"The economy will get better and people will get busy again, or we'll go to war and people will be distracted," said Cindy Feathers, the director of pro bono affairs for the New York State Bar Association. Ms. Feathers said that she did not think the economy was the sole reason for the increases in volunteerism, but that whatever the explanation was, "what we're trying to do is say, 'If you really care about this, don't just do it by the seat of your pants.' "
The American Bar Association urges lawyers to do at least 50 hours of pro bono work a year.But in New York State, half the lawyers perform no volunteer service at all, according to Michael Cordozo, the city's corporation counsel and a major promoter of the pro bono ethic.
Financial constraints, like the ones confronting Ms. Crawley, may be one reason. In the case of Shari Goldsmith, who was laid off last summer from a large Manhattan firm, a healthy savings account helps make volunteerism possible.
At the moment, she said, she does not have to worry about money.
Eventually, said Ms. Goldsmith, 27, she will seek paid work, although she said she would rather not.
"This is so enjoyable, sometimes I wish I could do it forever," she said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 19 about a surge in volunteerism by lawyers misstated the title of Richard Gruenberger, who described the trend at the New York Legal Assistance Group, which represents poor people. He is director of its volunteer unit, not of the organization over all.
The article also referred imprecisely to an estimate by Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center. When she estimated that major firms in big cities were donating 10,000 to 30,000 hours a year, that was in addition to what they donated in past years.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Cash As Budget Fix: In Albany, No Consensus 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
The rough outlines of a political face-off between Gov. George E. Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver took shape today as Mr. Silver repudiated the centerpiece of the governor's plan to solve the state's fiscal crisis: securing billions of dollars in tobacco settlement money. 
 Mr. Silver, a Democrat, placed the size of the budget gap in the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, at $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, far higher than the $2.2 billion Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has predicted. 
 New York is facing a shortfall of an additional $9.3 billion in the coming fiscal year, according to the spending plan the governor has presented for 2003-04.
To fill the current year's gap, Mr. Silver said the state should rely on short-term borrowing against expected revenue. While he has expressed skepticism about the governor's idea to secure part of the $12 billion worth of money the state is owed after a court settlement with tobacco companies, his statement yesterday was his most forceful on the subject to date.
Mr. Silver said he was convinced that the interest rates on short-term revenue anticipation notes would "be half of what these tobacco bonds that he proposes will be." He made his comments in an interview on an Albany radio station, WROW.
Mr. Silver opposes using tobacco money to close the gap, primarily because he believes the money is earmarked for spending on health care, one of his aides said. In his budget, Mr. Pataki proposed using $1.5 billion of the tobacco revenue to pay for continuing costs in the current fiscal year, and $2.3 billion of that revenue to help close next year's gap. To get that money up front, the state would pledge $6.5 billion of future revenue from the settlement.
Nowhere in the tobacco settlement is there a directive for the state to use the money for smoking cessation efforts or health-related programs, but for four years Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has said that the spirit of the agreement was that it should be used in those ways. But he has not objected to the governor's plan because of the dire fiscal situation.
With only about six weeks left in the fiscal year -- and the lawmakers on a one-week recess -- time is running out to close this year's gap. 
Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, said the Assembly's proposal would be fiscally irresponsible, would be viewed negatively by Wall Street, and would make it difficult for the state to pay its bills comes May.
He said that receiving tobacco revenue all at once would not increase the state's debt. Under the process known as securitization, bonds would be sold to private investors so the state could get cash now; the state would then use some of the the years of revenue expected from the tobacco settlement to pay the bondholders.
Short-term notes usually must be paid back within the next fiscal year, officials said.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, who spoke today on the same radio show as Mr. Silver, said he considered such borrowing "about as bad" as things can get in government. He also considers using the tobacco money equally unpalatable. 
Mr. Bruno said he foresaw a showdown between Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki, which could stall passage of the budget. Such a confrontation, he said, could lead to the state's running out of money and laying workers off.

PERSON: Dr. Paul Meehl 

HEADLINE: Paul Meehl, 83, an Example For Leaders of Psychotherapy 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
Dr. Paul Meehl, a University of Minnesota psychologist whose writings on research methodology, mental illness and other topics influenced generations of researchers and psychotherapists, died on Friday at his home in Minneapolis. He was 83.
 The cause was chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, his colleagues said. 
 The names of other American psychologists -- B. F. Skinner, for example -- might be more familiar to the public. But many experts say Dr. Meehl's influence within his field was equally profound.
His writings are widely cited and prescribed reading for every graduate student. His insistence on precise thinking and scientific tough-mindedness made him a scourge to some and a role model to many others.
In the early 1960's, when a vast majority of psychiatrists and psychologists believed that schizophrenia was caused by bad parenting, Dr. Meehl argued that the illness must have a strong genetic component, and discussed the subject in his 1962 presidential address to the American Psychological Association. Forty years later, the genetic basis of schizophrenia is widely accepted.
In a 1954 book, "Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and Review of the Evidence," Dr. Meehl, who retired in 1990 but continued to teach at the university until last year, enraged many colleagues by pointing out, in meticulous and ascerbic detail, why clinicians were not very good at predicting people's behavior.
A far more reliable method, he argued, was to analyze the information gained from personality tests, psychiatric interviews and other sources using mathematical formulas. Dr. Meehl referred to the volume as "my disturbing little book," and many clinical psychologists reacted accordingly.
"Essentially," said Dr. William Grove, director of the clinical science and psychopathology research program at Minnesota, "he was saying that as far as predicting the prognosis of a mental disorder or predicting future recurrences, clinicians could be replaced by a clerk with a hand-cranked Monroe calculator."
"But the data have largely borne him out," Dr. Grove said.
Dr. Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist at Princeton who last year won the Nobel in economic science, cited Dr. Meehl's work as an influence on his own. 
"What he did there was more than to show the limitations of clinical judgment," Dr. Kahneman said. "He also showed that the subjective confidence that people have in their judgment is not necessarily a good indication of their accuracy."
Born in Minneapolis, Paul Everett Meehl received his bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota in 1941 and his doctorate in 1945. He was trained as a psychoanalyst and kept a couch in his office.
Dr. Meehl's effectiveness as a critic of sloppy thinking in psychology was aided by a conversational writing style and a knack for coining phrases. In a now-classic paper, "Why I Do Not Attend Case Conferences," Dr. Meehl listed the logical sins routinely committed by psychologists when they gathered to discuss patients.
One was the " 'Me too' fallacy." In it, psychologists, upon hearing of a patient's odd behavior, insist that it is normal because "anyone would do that." The "Uncle George's pancakes fallacy" is exemplified by the clinician who, told that a patient stored leftover pancakes in the attic, declares, "Why, there is nothing so terrible about that -- I remember good old Uncle George from my childhood, he used to store pancakes in the attic."
Dr. Meehl was the author of one of the scales in the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, one of the most widely used personality tests. In recent years, he played the central role in developing taxometrics, a field concerned with using mathematical formulas to determine the natural groupings of biological or psychological variables.
He is survived by his wife, Leslie Jane Yonce; his daughter, Karen Enid Hill of Seattle; his son, Erik Rolf, of Hopkins, Minn.; and three grandsons. His first wife, Alyce Roworth Meehl, died in 1972.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: New York City; 
Economy Is Tough All Over, But in New York, It's Horrid

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Michael Amodeo is New York's most prominent auctioneer of failed restaurants and bankrupt businesses, and these days he is a very busy man.
 "It started right after the bubble ended in 2000, but after 9/11 it got really bad," said Mr. Amodeo, who was on the 50th floor of a skyscraper in Lower Manhattan one recent day selling off the contents of a cafeteria that once served a company that is now retrenching. 
 The economic slump, he added, is affecting all kinds of food businesses, "restaurants and caterers and delis."
The rest of the country may be debating whether the economy is recovering or heading into a second downturn, the dreaded "double dip." In New York City, there is no question. 
The economy here is in recession.
New York City has lost almost 176,000 jobs in two years -- more than the population of many cities. The unemployment rate, which in the spring of 2001 had fallen to 5.3 percent, has been climbing steadily and jumped to 8.4 percent in December.
While the national economy has shown at least some growth, as measured by gross domestic product, a similar measure of the city's economy shows that it has been shrinking for two years. The New York City comptroller's office is forecasting another decline this year.
Evidence of economic hardship in the city is increasing. There has been a big rise in the number of people who have been jobless for more than six months, and tens of thousands of people have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits but remain out of work. The number of households not on welfare but receiving food stamps, which some analysts cite as an indicator of a bad economy, has risen 20 percent in the last year, to 124,000.
New York City has gone through boom and bust before, most recently during what Christine M. Cumming, director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, described as "the long economic winter" from 1989 through 1992. The entire region suffered then; Connecticut, New Jersey and New York State lost hundreds of thousands of jobs.
But what has surprised economists this time is that the economic carnage has been concentrated in New York City -- and only New York City.
Connecticut and New Jersey, relatively small and urban states, have suffered in the economic slowdown, but the unemployment rates, 4.6 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, remain below the national average of 6 percent. Upstate New York, often described as economically beleaguered and suffering from steep declines in population, has an unemployment rate of just 4.9 percent.
Even areas long considered suburbs of New York City, with economies that had been tightly linked, are faring far better than the city. On Long Island, employment has declined by fewer than 4,000 jobs in the last two years; Westchester County, home of many of the city's bedroom communities, has had a dip of fewer than 3,000.
In the past, "we always received an equal-opportunity clobbering," said Marc M. Goloven, a senior regional economist for J. P. Morgan.
But in other parts of the region, the economies have become more diverse and less reliant on a few big industries. Their new bases of small and medium-size businesses, Mr. Goloven said, "represent a sea wall beyond which New York City's recession tide could not spread."
New York City's economy is also more diversified than it was 20 years ago, when Wall Street was the be-all and end-all, Mr. Goloven and other economists say. There are more retail and tourism businesses and, despite the dot-com bust, more technology companies. Immigration has brought economic vibrancy to many city neighborhoods.
"It's not like a town with just one auto plant," said James P. Brown, who analyzes the city economy for the State Department of Labor. "But a lot of what New York City does is related to the same thing: we sell services to other businesses." So while the 2001 recession arrived more slowly than it did in some manufacturing towns, it hit home all the same.
Then came the attack on the World Trade Center. James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group, has calculated that half of the job losses in the last two years can be traced to the economic aftershocks of Sept. 11.
Big financial firms were displaced. Thousands of small businesses in Lower Manhattan were destroyed.
The steep decline in travel and tourism hurt not only restaurant- and hotel-heavy Manhattan, but also Queens, where many people lost jobs in and around the airports.
The fallout continues all over the city. In Brooklyn, about 1,100 businesses recently filled out questionnaires on business conditions for the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. More than two-thirds said they had lost revenue as a direct result of 9/11, and almost half of that group had laid off workers, said Kenneth Adams, president of the chamber. Very few, 45 of 365 businesses that cut workers, have rehired people.
"People talk about the ripple effect of 9/11, but ripple is understating it," Mr. Adams said. "To many businesses, it was more like a tsunami."
The shadow of Sept. 11 continues to hang over many businesses.
"New Yorkers have taken a huge beating to our self-confidence and entrepreneurship," said Chan Suh, chief executive of Agency.com, the company whose cafeteria equipment and excess office furniture Mr. Amodeo was auctioning.
A rare survivor among the city's once flourishing Internet sector, Agency.com still has 75 employees in New York City, as well as offices in San Francisco, Chicago and Boston. Mr. Suh said the business climate in New York was different.
"People are more reluctant to make decisions, launch something, get something started," he said, adding that worries about war and terrorism made things worse. "We know New York is a focal point," he said. "That's not just hubris: we know New York is a symbol."
If New York was the terrorists' target, Wall Street was the bull's-eye. And the financial industry, possibly the most important to the city in income if not in jobs, is in dire straits.
The stock market has dropped for three straight years, the only time this has happened since World War II. December is usually a good month for the stock market; in 2002, it was the the poorest since 1931.
Even worse for New York City's financial firms, corporations across America have largely stopped merging, making acquisitions or selling stock. Helping companies do those things -- the business of investment banking -- is where financial firms make the really big profits. At least, they used to.
Wall Street's revenues and profits have plunged. Bonus payments dropped to $7.9 billion last year, from $12.6 billion in 2001 and $19.4 billion in 2000, according to estimates by Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller. On Wall Street, bonuses are not icing, they are the cake. (Bonuses often dwarf base pay, and almost nobody in high finance lives off the salary.) This means Wall Street workers have just taken a $4.7 billion pay cut.
That bonus money has paid for a lot of things in New York City: high-priced apartments, private school tuition and lavish dinners at Alain Ducasse. But it has also provided paychecks for a lot of people, like nannies and housekeepers, livery car drivers, restaurant deliverymen and the like.
Taxes on those big bonuses and on stock-market profits also used to bring hundreds of millions of dollars into city government's coffers; their decline goes a long way toward explaining the city's fiscal crisis. The city is billions of dollars short of the money it needs to balance its budget, and analysts fear steep cutbacks in areas like health care, which has been one of the few bright spots in employment.
In the future, far fewer Wall Street employees are likely to be around to get whatever bonuses are paid. Brokerage firms have laid off more than 23,000 New Yorkers in two years. That is more than 12 percent of their work force, and they are not finished.
Even if the stock market rebounds, "the securities industry here will probably stagnate," said Frank Fernandez, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association. Wall Street firms have been cutting back the number of employees in New York for years, Mr. Fernandez said, and New York remains an expensive place to do business when companies are desperate to cut costs. The attack on the World Trade Center convinced some financial firms that they had to spread out their employees, decisions reinforced by federal regulators worried about the nation's financial markets if another disaster occurs.
For employment in New York City to improve, Mr. Fernandez said, investment banking must rebound, and that does not appear to be on the horizon.
Even enactment of President Bush's proposal to cut taxes on corporate dividends would not provide much immediate increase in Wall Street business, he added, in part because few corporations are in a position to pay dividends.
What all the laid-off investment bankers are doing these days is unclear. Most received severance packages for which they were sworn to secrecy about their former employers. The last thing they want to do is appear as a hard-luck case in a newspaper article.
But they are out there. In certain neighborhoods of Manhattan, in certain suburban towns, there has been a sudden increase in people with time on their hands. Some are from Wall Street; others had high-paying jobs in advertising, publishing or consulting.
Now, they are "working at home," said Owen R. Berkowitz, who runs a bakery in Pelham, in Westchester County. Commuters he used to see at dawn before they crowded onto trains are now stopping by after they drop the children off at school. Normally, he added, "in Westchester, men are not around at 10 of 9."
Paul Bernard, a consultant who works with executives, said he used to tell clients that finding a new job might take six months; now he warns them to expect to hunt for up to 14 months.
Those who graduated from business school three or four years ago are in a particularly tough spot, he added. "There are very few jobs for people in that category, if they want to stay in New York." He has even had M.B.A.'s apply to be his office manager, a job that pays about $60,000 a year. He said he had received almost 1,300 resumes from applicants.
One may well have come from Vicki Herschman, 43, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She said she had been sending out hundreds of resumes a month. Laid off from her job as a magazine circulation assistant in July 2001, Ms. Herschman has not been able to find a job of any kind.
"I've applied to places like Starbucks, but they see me as overqualified or say I don't have a retail background," she said. The employment agency that helped her find her last job has gone out of business.
Her unemployment benefits ran out early last year, Ms. Herschman said, and she has found it increasingly hard to keep body and soul together. She continues to volunteer at a soup kitchen, but does it now to get free meals, and she says she considers it a good week when she can afford subway fare.
Recently, she overcame her embarrassment and applied for public assistance. She is still looking for a job, but she is considering leaving New York City.
"I find it, especially after 9/11, gloomy and negative and depressing," Ms. Herschman said. "Before, it was lights, camera, action."
College-educated workers like Ms. Herschman are more likely to find themselves unemployed than they were in previous recessions, economists say. But those most likely to find themselves out of a job in New York City are blue-collar workers, those without high school diplomas, the young, and black and Hispanic workers, said Mark Levitan, senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society, which helps the poor.
Despite the gloomy statistics, visitors can roam the streets of Manhattan without noticing signs of economic distress. And their presence is part of the reason: tourists have returned to Times Square, and if they do not spend as much as business travelers or international visitors, they are keeping Broadway and other businesses alive.
Real estate remains relatively strong so far. Apartment prices have not tumbled, as they did in the last recession. An increasing number of small storefronts are empty, but retailers continue to open big new stores.
Vacancies in office buildings have risen in the last year, but the percentage of empty office space in Manhattan remains well below the average for city downtowns, said Bruce Mosler, president of United States operations for Cushman & Wakefield, real estate brokers. Much of the space available is being put up for sublease by retrenching companies, Mr. Mosler said.
That is the fate of the former cafeteria in the skyscraper, one reason the equipment had to be auctioned -- to get it out of the way of potential tenants.
But also on display at that auction were the optimism and determination that New Yorkers like to think characterize them as much as their gift for complaining does. Despite the poor economy, several bidders were planning to open new bars or restaurants in the city.
One was Aricka Westbrooks, 32, of Brooklyn. Until about a year and a half ago, Ms. Westbrooks had one of those "only in New York" careers that combined fashion, public relations and the Internet. But after she was laid off -- twice -- she decided to go into business for herself, she said.
So, if all goes well, she will soon open a takeout restaurant in Brooklyn called Jive Turkey (after the house specialty, which will be deep-fried).
It is not at all what she expected when she moved to New York City seven years ago, she said, but she has no intention of moving back to Chicago.
"Never that," she said firmly. "Never, ever, that."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BARGAINING; 
Turkey Demands $32 Billion U.S. Aid Package if It Is to Take Part in a War on Iraq

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS with ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Turkish and American officials continued their diplomatic brinkmanship today, as the Turks said they were waiting for the Bush administration to answer their demand for an economic aid package worth as much as $32 billion to ensure their participation in a war with Iraq.
 The American ambassador to Turkey, Robert Pearson, was summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry after 10 p.m. on Monday and handed the proposal, which he forwarded to Washington, American officials said. 
 The Turkish request is about $6 billion higher than what American officials said over the weekend was their final offer. Of the $26 billion Washington has offered, $20 billion is in loan guarantees and $6 billion in direct grants. Althougha Western diplomat said the Turks were seeking about $10 billion in direct aid, the White House is adamant that $6 billion is the limit for direct aid. 
It remains to be seen whether negotiations will begin anew or whether the administration's plan to use Turkey as a launching pad for an invasion of northern Iraq will fall through. That prospect seemed to put an unusual strain on the relationship between the longtime allies, who have been speaking of each other in increasingly harsh tones.
As of this evening, Turkish officials said they had received no answer from the Americans. As the day began in Washington, Ari Fleischer, President Bush's spokesman, called on the Turkish leaders to approve the deal that the Americans had offered.
"We continue to work with Turkey as a friend, but it is decision time," Mr. Fleischer said.
As Mr. Fleischer spoke, senior administration officials met at the White House to discuss the Turkish proposal, still hoping, at least in public, that Turkey would approve the smaller economic package.
That seemed increasingly unlikely here, as the day passed without a vote by Parliament on the deployment of American combat troops. Turkish officials had scheduled one, but canceled it on Monday, saying they would go forward only after they reached an agreement on an economic aid package.
There is a growing sense on both sides that time is running short. American military planners have drawn up two sets of war plans: one that includes Turkey as a staging area and one that does not. 
Two senior American military officials said today that without Turkish consent by the end of the week, the Pentagon would be forced to shift to a less desirable backup plan.
"Two or three more days is about all that's left," said one of the senior officials.
With ships carrying equipment for more than 15,000 soldiers of the Fourth Infantry Division now approaching Turkish ports, the military can wait only so long before planners need to divert the equipment to the Persian Gulf in time to unload it and have it ready for troops there by early March.
Turkish leaders publicly warned that they might ultimately refuse to take part in an American operation against Iraq. In a speech that seemed intended for an American audience, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the majority Justice and Development Party, said Parliament's recent vote authorizing American engineers to upgrade Turkish military bases did not mean that the Turks would agree to open their bases to thousands of American troops.
"Our American friends should not interpret this decision to mean that Turkey has embarked on an irreversible road," Mr. Erdogan said. "It is not possible for us to accept anything which we don't approve of, which we don't believe as necessary or which we can't explain to our people."
Pentagon officials, seeking to put the best face on a bad situation, said that starting a northern offensive from Turkey, while desirable, was not essential to victory.
But officials clearly want to move ahead, one way or another. Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, told a Turkish reporter last week that ships ferrying American soldiers were in the Mediterranean Sea and could not wait indefinitely for an agreement.
"We can no longer keep our troops waiting on ships, wandering around the eastern Mediterranean," Mr. Wolfowitz said in the interview, printed in Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper. Without a decision soon, he said, "it is highly likely that we would order our ships in the eastern Mediterranean to shift their direction to the gulf."
The deadlock seemed to grow out of the belief, held by each country, that it holds the upper hand in the negotiations. Turkish leaders believe that the Americans, whatever they say privately, desperately need the country's participation in a war against Iraq. 
It is not just that a northern front would make an invasion easier, it is that Turkey is a Muslim country that is democratic and secular -- precisely the kind of government the Bush administration hopes an invasion of Iraq might help bring about in other corners of the Middle East.
At the same time, the Turkish public overwhelmingly opposes a war. For many here, the potential war with Iraq seems to promise a repeat of the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when Turkey was swamped with half a million refugees and its trade with Iraq plummeted.
For their part, the Americans believe that Turkey cannot afford to turn them down, and that Turkey's leaders will ultimately understand that.

HEADLINE: Some Concerns Thrive On Medicaid Patients 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
As President Bush presses Congress to let private insurers take over more of Medicare and Medicaid, a handful of for-profit managed care companies are already hard at it, running state programs for five million low-income people in Medicaid plans. 
 Despite yawning deficits and Medicaid budget cuts in many states, the companies involved in managed care are thriving, and some of the nation's biggest private health insurers are expanding their Medicaid operations. The UnitedHealth Group, the largest, has added 375,000 Medicaid members in the last year and Wellpoint Health Networks, the fourth largest, has added more than 600,000 in the last three years. 
 Pocketing a set monthly payment for each Medicaid member, the companies sign up the most common types of Medicaid recipients: children with relatively few health care needs and women that they try to guide through uncomplicated low-cost pregnancies.
The companies say they are prospering by providing services tailored to the needs of low-income people, including tracking down hard-to-find families who do not have telephones. 
But some hospitals and doctors say the companies also profit by denying more claims than most insurers. Hospitals in New Jersey said the Medicaid companies rejected claims for hospital stays up to three times as often as other managed care plans. 
And like some other managed care insurers, the Medicaid companies can be slow to approve expensive treatments for people with serious medical problems, patient advocates say.
Another concern, Medicaid experts say, is whether some plans provide enough help for low-income people who need it. "If plans are taking people who don't know how to come in and use services, because of language problems or the location or just plain knowledge problems, it means you collect the capitation, and don't have to provide the service," said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Family Foundation's Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Capitation is the payment for each member. 
Medicaid, which covers 47 million people, is the nation's largest health system. It pays for about 4 births in 10 and provides health care for one of every 3 children. 
There are 38 states that now require some form of Medicaid managed care, and 23 million Medicaid recipients are members of health maintenance organizations.
In most states, the insurers have little to do with elderly and disabled Medicaid recipients, who usually have higher health care expenses. Those people are usually covered directly by fee-for-service federal and state programs. But in Arizona and a few other states, people with chronic conditions or who need care at home are among those recruited by Medicaid managed care plans. 
The companies say they save money for the states by making sure members get preventive care. 
Amerigroup, one of the large Medicaid companies, said that by seeing to it that young pregnant women get prenatal care, it had reduced premature births to 7 per 100, compared with the national rate of 11.9 per 100. 
Wellpoint sifts through claims records to find young children who have not had immunization shots, according to John Monahan, a senior vice president, and notifies parents, primary care doctors and the insurer's outreach workers.
But with deficits growing, the states are looking hard at Medicaid, one of their biggest costs, and beginning to cut back. Thirteen states, including California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts, are already planning Medicaid budget cuts, including limiting eligibility, reducing payments to doctors in California and, in New Jersey, ending coverage for childless adults.
As a result, many specialist physicians are dropping out of the Medicaid plans, so members have to travel to find care. 
"This is a watershed period for these plans," said Robert E. Hurley, a Medicaid managed care expert at Virginia Commonwealth University. "We have never been in a situation, going into a recession, when there were so many Medicaid beneficiaries" in managed care plans, he said. 
Industry executives say most members of Medicaid managed care plans are pleased with their care.
"We surveyed the moms, and 96 percent said they were very satisfied with their child's health plan," said Jeffrey L. McWaters, chairman and chief executive of Amerigroup.
But doctors and hospitals accuse some companies of routinely denying and delaying payments.
The Medicaid companies are denying 17 to 30 percent of hospital claims in New Jersey, compared with 5 to 10 percent denied by other managed health plans, according to the New Jersey Hospital Association. Complaining about denials and delays in paying, at least eight hospitals in New Jersey have stopped taking patients from at least one of the five Medicaid managed care insurers in the state, the hospital association said. 
Two hospitals in Trenton, Helene Fuld and Mercer Medical Centers, have dropped AmeriChoice,a big national Medicaid managed care company, doctors there said. Officials of Capital Health System, which runs the hospitals, declined to comment.
Some physician specialists in Trenton, including all those in orthopedics, neurology and urology, do not take Medicaid managed care patients, said Dr. Eric Schwartz, chief medical officer of the Henry J. Austin Health Center, a Medicaid clinic in Trenton. The clinic sends patients with these types of problems to neighboring counties. 
"The toughest pill to swallow," said E. J. Blair, an executive of the three-hospital Meridian Health System, based at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J., "is that we've been losing money on all these contracts for five years, while the managed care companies generally are making money." 
That was not always the case. Many insurers began offering managed care to Medicaid recipients as early as the 1970's, but then pulled out of the market because of losses and the program's special needs like networks that include Spanish-speaking doctors in many large cities. Aetna and Oxford Health Plans lost money on Medicaid patients and sold their Medicaid units several years ago.
Now, though, Wall Street analysts say the Medicaid managed care companies are among the most profitable health insurers. Three Medicaid managed care companies -- the Amerigroup, Centene and Molina Healthcare -- reported operating profit margins of 6.5 percent, 6.9 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, as of Sept. 30, compared with the industry average of 5.2 percent. 
The analysts said the Medicaid units of a half dozen big health insurers -- Wellpoint, UnitedHealth Group, Health Net, Humana, Coventry Health Care and Anthem -- were also profitable.
Insurers find Medicaid to be much more attractive, on the whole, than Medicare. Medicare H.M.O.'s have dropped 2.4 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries in the last five years, complaining that federal payments did not cover costs. 
The for-profit Medicaid companies say costs in the managed care plans are rising only 4 to 6 percent a year, while the cost of traditional Medicaid is growing 10 to 12 percent and Medicaid costs for people in long-term care are increasing 12 to 16 percent annually.
But some Medicaid experts are skeptical. "I've looked across the country for reports that document savings, and I haven't found the kind of savings that states said they were expecting," said Kathryn Haslanger, a health policy analyst at the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit research center in New York. 
"Within the category of moms and kids, are they really costing that much less?" she asked. 
Moreover, some people on Medicaid say the managed care companies seem to make it harder for seriously ill patients to get necessary care. 
Kelly Jankowski, a New Jersey mother, said she faced what she called "hassles" and delays of several months last year trying to obtain authorization from AmeriChoice for throat surgery for her son, Steven, then 10, who was having difficulty breathing. Steven and his brother have epidermolysis bullosa, an often fatal skin disease.
"I was on the phone right and left with these people," she said. 
Steven Matthews, a spokesman for AmeriChoice, which was purchased by UnitedHealth Group last year for $530 million, said that "no care or service" for the Jankowski family "has ever been denied by AmeriChoice, nor have we ever refused them the opportunity to see the provider they wanted to see." He did not address Ms. Jankowski's concerns about delays.
Dr. Scott R. Schaffer, the surgeon who had been treating Steven and his older brother Richard, said AmeriChoice and other managed care companies "do everything they can to delay and deny" claims for payment. He no longer accepts new Medicaid patients. 
He pointed to correspondence on Steven's case with AmeriChoice, which eventually authorized a rate of $150 for Steven's office visits and $800 for the throat surgery. According to the papers, the company actually paid $46.91 for a visit and $379.63 for the surgery.
After a reporter asked about the case, an AmeriChoice representative called Dr. Schaffer to suggest that the claim be resubmitted, his office said, and Mrs. Jankowski said that the state Medicaid office had accepted her longstanding request to leave managed care and return to fee-for-service Medicaid.

High Schools Gain Access to Scholarly Journals

BYLINE:  By Karen W. Arenson 

 BODY:
 Students at Scarsdale High School, Horace Mann, Dalton, Ethical Culture-Fieldston and Riverdale Country School now have online access to scholarly journals dating back more than 300 years. Their schools are among the first to join JSTOR, a nonprofit organization (www.jstor.org) that has digitized back issues of more than 300 journals in 26 disciplines. Among the publications that can be read are "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London," dating from the 17th century, and more modern ones like "Econometrica" and "Gender and Society." 
 JSTOR, which was established in 1995 by WILLIAM G. BOWEN, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, initially offered membership to colleges and universities and libraries. Now, after a two-year pilot project at 16 high schools, including Stuyvesant and the Bronx High School of Science, it is adding secondary schools.
There is a $500 initial archive fee and an annual fee between $750 and $2,500, depending on the school's college-enrollment rate.
BRUCE HETERICK, director for library relations at JSTOR, said that one of the biggest challenges facing teachers and librarians was "helping students to filter the vast amount of information now available to them on the Web." Mr. Heterick said that JSTOR would help introduce high school students to the kind of peer-reviewed resources they will be asked to use in college. Karen W. Arenson

HEADLINE: Ireland, Once a Celtic Tiger, Slackens Its Stride; 
Technology Collapse Drains a Town's Valued Jobs

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: YOUGHAL, Ireland 

 BODY:
The boom that doubled the size of Ireland's economy in the 1990's and changed the nation's self-image from waif to whiz kid has slowed markedly, the victim of a worldwide technology bust and membership in a European club that, like most, pays more attention to its heavyweights than its upstarts.
 "The Irish economy is not a Celtic tiger anymore," said Roisin Taggart, a manager in Dublin's upscale Brown Thomas department store. "It's a pussycat." 
 The expansion transformed Ireland, drawing in hundreds of foreign technology companies, reversing decades of Irish migration abroad in search of jobs and drawing thousands of young Europeans to a country that had become a regional hot spot.
But like the global economy, Ireland's has taken a remarkable U-turn, one apparent not just in big cities but in towns like Youghal (pronounced yawl), a port-cum-resort on the southern coast in County Cork. 
A generation ago, when Youghal faced looming recession, its movers and shakers -- from priests to pub owners, 700 in all -- gatheredin the church hall to pray all night by candlelight for better times. Six months later, said Paddy Linehan, 83, who helped arrange that 1979 vigil, five new companies came to town.
These days, it might take more than prayers. In the last two months, two of the biggest technology employers in this town of 7,500 have announced plans to close plants that employ some 400 people in jobs worth $13 million a year in salaries -- a big chunk of its livelihood.
"It's devastated us, really," said Mary Linehan-Foley, the mayor. "And there doesn't seem to be light at the end of the tunnel." Dependent on exports to Britain and the United States, and propelled by investment by American and other foreign companies, Ireland was especially vulnerable to the worldwide high-technology meltdown that has helped cut growth to a fraction of its peak in the 1990's and stripped away thousands of jobs.
Yet, locked into the euro single currency, and to low interest rates set by the European Central Bank, the authorities have been unable to tailor their own economy to head off inflation, now running at more than twice the European average, and pushing up wages and other costs.
That has made Ireland far less of a draw to outside investors, even as foreign companies looking for low-cost locations begin to look hard at East European countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which are poised to join the European Union next year.
"This is when we see whether we have a new economy in Ireland or not," said Austin Hughes, chief economist at IIB Bank in Dublin.
That is a question that preoccupies many people here in Youghal.
In December, Artesyn Technologies announced that between March and September this year it would close a plant making power converters and employing 160 people, transferring operations to China. Then, on Feb. 5, Thomson Multimedia of France said that by the end of March it would shut down its Technicolor subsidiary, which processes DVD's for a growing market in Britain. Significantly, the French company said it would transfer its activities from Youghal to factories it acquired in Wales and Poland as part of its takeover of Technicolor last year.
"The general feeling is not positive, and there's a lot of worries about the way jobs are going to Eastern Europe," said John Dempsey, 35, one of the few Technicolor workers who would talk to a reporter. Some workers hid their faces, apparently fearful that they would be singled out for lower severance payments if they were identified. Danielle Jacob, a Technicolor spokeswoman, denied that the company had silenced its staff but said it would not allow interviews of workers inside the plant.
The closings have brought a wider gloom to a town, like many in Ireland, already suffering from the global slowdown. "The shops aren't so busy. The restaurants aren't so full," said Mary Cotter, 28, a nurse. "It's very difficult for men in particular to get jobs, and these closures will have a huge impact."
Of course, many here would say that with the tourism that swells the town to 12,500 in summer, and with textile and carpet businesses providing some work, Youghal will survive well enough -- especially if the government steps in with grants and incentives to lure other companies here.
But the latest official figures showed 10,000 job losses in Ireland over the last year, bringing the total number collecting unemployment compensation to 167,000, and Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney said that more job cuts were likely.
Across the land, that is hardly good news for people like Lena Beug, a 27-year-old television designer who left Ireland five years ago and returned from working at MTV in New York in September, only to find that the job market back home had run out of steam.
When people called her in for a job interview, she said, "The first thing they asked is, What on earth possessed you to come back?" She now plans to head to London to look for work.
"There's a risk," said Colm Donlon, a spokesman for the official Industrial Development Authority, "that highly skilled people will travel across Europe" in quest of jobs.
That itself is a remarkable turnaround from the 1990's, when a heady cocktail of low corporate taxes, European Union aid and a bright young baby-boom work force lured big foreign companies like Intel, I.B.M. and Microsoft just as the global economy blossomed with the high-technology and Internet bubbles.
House prices soared along with that key indicator of boom times -- ownership of late-model BMW's. Indeed, the writer Kevin Courtney said in a recent article, the boom produced a legacy of ostentatious young Irish people nicknamed Flash Paddy or Celtic Cubs, whose "stripes are labeled Prada and Armani."
"As W. B. Yeats once wrote: all is changed, changed utterly, a terrible beauty is born," Mr. Courtney recalled. "And there's no beauty more terrible than Flash Paddy." 
In the boom years, some 40,000 foreigners from outside the European Union secured work permits each year to fill a shortage of labor. These days the government plans to cut back on work permits to preserve jobs for the Irish.
"No matter what, the economy was going to slow down," said Philip Lane, an economist at Trinity College Dublin. "But the scale of the slowdown is beyond expectations." Not only that, he said, Ireland has become a high-cost country for investors.
Some dispute that. Mr. Donlon, at the Industrial Development Authority, argues that Ireland still has the lowest corporate taxes in Europe -- 12.5 percent -- and that its economy is doing better than it might have.
Even though inflation is at 5.6 percent and climbing, more than twice the euro zone average, Ireland still hopes to lure investors with grants and tax breaks, he said. The blue-chip American companies, he said, have not abandoned their investments -- although two of them, Dell Computer and I.B.M., declined to respond to an inquiry about their long-term plans.
Ireland, moreover, is seeking to create more skilled work for a highly paid work force, moving away from blue-collar assembly-line jobs. And unemployment, at 4.6 percent, is still only half the European average, Mr. Donlon said, just as overall growth -- forecast this year at up to 3 percent -- is better than most Europeans can manage.
In some ways, though, Ireland's inflation confirms the worst fears of euro-skeptics in Britain (which is still outside the euro zone) -- that a universal interest rate among disparate economies will always punish some to the advantage of others.
Right now, for instance, Germany's faltering economy needs low interest rates to spur growth in a nation of some 80 million people. But low interest rates in Ireland encourage consumer spending and inflation. Given Ireland's weight as a nation of 4 million in a currency zone of 280 million, it is hardly surprising that its concerns do not come first.
"There isn't a single rate that's right for all," Mr. Hughes of IIB Bank said. "But that's not unique to the single-currency zone," he said, citing disparate economic conditions in different areas of the United States or Britain.
In this town -- once famed as a location for a film version of "Moby Dick" -- the big-screen considerations are tinted with a different kind of skepticism, reflecting a sense that too much dependence on outside investors and multinational corporations is a perilous business.
"Eastern Europe at the moment is the cheapest option, and all those countries will come into the European Union," said Liam Ryan, Youghal's town clerk. "The multinationals will get 10 or 12 years there and make their profit and then move on, just like they did here. There's no loyalty in all this."

HEADLINE: Another March of Folly? 

BYLINE:  By Christopher Buckley; Christopher Buckley, editor of Forbes FYI, is author, most recently, of "No Way to Treat a First Lady."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago this month, I was an aide to Vice President George Bush during another trans-Atlantic crisis. There were demonstrations in European capitals in which America was portrayed as the threat to world peace and the American president was called a warmonger, a "cowboy" and worse. Vice President Bush's response in February 1983 may hold some lessons for President Bush in February 2003.
 Two decades ago the vice president was dispatched to London to calm things down, to hold hands, to remind our European friends and allies that we were still all in this together. What made his trip necessary was the controversy over deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe; several years earlier, the Europeans had requested that the United States place Pershing 2 missiles in Europe to counter Soviet medium-range missiles that were aimed at the Continent. 
 But when the missiles were ready to be put in place, Europe changed its mind. We don't want those missiles after all, Europe decided, under pressure from its left and the Soviet Union. You'll just use them to wage nuclear war on our soil.
The United States countered that it had half a million American troops in Europe. These missiles were manifestly to protect them as well as Europe. And without them, the Soviets could destroy 100 European cities -- along with those American troops -- in 20 minutes with their SS-20's.
I was in the vice president's motorcade. I remember the demonstration we had to get through in London, on our way to the speech at Guildhall. Furious crowds lined the streets with signs that, 20 years later, remain unprintable in this newspaper. This particular group of angry demonstrators had been organized by the London School of Economics, as I recall, playing hooky from Keynes.
Watching them through the car windows, up close, face to face, inches away, I couldn't decide how to react. Here I was, an official member of the United States government -- the speechwriter -- driving through a capital that the United States had not considered hostile territory since 1814, and here were dozens of people calling me by quite unpleasant names.
What was the protocol? Did one smile and wave back serenely, as the queen would have -- and as the vice president, a few cars ahead, surely was doing? Or did one sit sullenly and refuse even to acknowledge the young hearties of the L.S.E.? I could bring myself to do neither. Instead, I offered my best composed smile, and when I had made sure there were no cameras, I exercised a middle option.
Sometimes diplomacy can be satisfying. I hereby apologize for my appalling lapse in decorum.
That night in Guildhall, as the vice president gave a positively brilliant speech, the shouting of the demonstrators seemed loud enough to rattle the stained-glass windows of the historic building. There was a question-and-answer session afterward. A politician wearing the clerical collar of the Church of England rose and in a tone of high moral revulsion denounced the United States for bringing emotions in Europe to the present boil and for forcing on an unwilling England and Continent these ghastly weapons. He had children, he announced with umbrage, and he rather hoped he would be able to see them grow up and not be incinerated in a nuclear exchange initiated by America.
The vice president began to answer, in his usual earnest, thoughtful and patient way. And then he stopped. I saw the air go out of him. He sighed. It was as eloquent and sincere a sigh as I have ever heard from a politician.
"Look, I have kids too," he said. "Don't you think I want to see them grow up?"
He followed this remark by saying that these missiles -- he did not add, "That you asked us for, bub" -- were intended to make Europe safer, not more dangerous. He reminded the gentleman that President Ronald Reagan had pledged to meet with General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev "at any time" and "any place" to sign an agreement eliminating all intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
The moment was defused. I had never seen the vice president in better form.
We flew home the next day. In the following weeks, German voters elected candidates who supported the Pershing missile deployments. A few months later, the missiles went in.
A few years after that, Mikhail Gorbachev effectively surrendered in a cold war that had lasted almost four decades, and in a few more years the Berlin Wall came down. Game, set, match. The Gulag Archipelago is now Vladimir Putin's Russia. NATO now extends to the Baltics.
Why is this episode relevant now? The North Atlantic alliance is in turmoil, furious anti-American demonstrations and sentiment are rampant in Europe, and there is an implacable tyrant-foe in the East muttering darkly about Armaggedon.
For what it's worth, I do not support a war with Iraq unless we all -- defined as a clear majority of the American people, plus New Europe and good "Old Europe," as feckless and posturing as they are -- ultimately agree that it is the only way to make the world safer. If we can't agree, I say: contain Saddam Hussein with all means at our disposal. Indeed, contain him with extreme prejudice.
Meanwhile, the lessons of February 1983 are there, available to inspectors on both sides of the pond.

HEADLINE: 2 War Foes Take Steps on Seeking Presidency 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Two strong opponents of war with Iraq, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, made plans today to take the first step toward running for the Democratic nomination for president.
 Their lawyers were under instructions to file official papers today to form exploratory committees so the campaigns could begin raising money under federal election law. But most government offices here were closed because of the weekend snowstorm. Mr. Kucinich and Ms. Moseley-Braun said the papers would be filed the first day the Federal Election Commission was open for business. 
 Mr. Kucinich, 56, and Ms. Moseley-Braun, 55, clearly hope to wrest the most liberal elements of the Democratic Party away from the better known candidates in the race.
"There's something fundamentally wrong with the direction this country is heading in," Mr. Kucinich, who was campaigning in Iowa, said in a telephone interview today.
"I'm stepping forward," Mr. Kucinich said, "because someone has to say, 'Hold it! Everything needs to be changed at every level of society.' "
Mr. Kucinich was mayor of Cleveland for two years in the 1970's. After serving in the Ohio Senate and running losing campaigns for other offices, he was elected to the House in 1996 and is now in his fourth term. 
In addition to his opposition to war with Iraq, he favors national health insurance and would like to repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Ms. Moseley-Braun spent the weekend campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Interviewed by telephone from Chicago, she said she was "running because I want to be a voice of hope for people who believe war is not the answer to our domestic security, and budget deficits are not a way to grow this economy."
Ms. Moseley-Braun became the first black woman in the Senate after she was elected in 1992. After one term, she was defeated in her race for re-election by Peter G. Fitzgerald, a Republican. President Bill Clinton then made her ambassador to New Zealand.
The entries of Mr. Kucinich and Ms. Moseley-Braun bring to eight the number of announced Democratic contenders. The others are former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Others are considering running, including Senator Bob Graham of Florida, former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Gen. Wesley K. Clark, retired.

PERSON: Frank A. Fernandez 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Seeing More Darkness at the End of the Tunnel

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

 BODY:
FRANK A. FERNANDEZ is pessimistic. 
 As the chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, Mr. Fernandez looks at the stock market and other parts of Wall Street's business and tells both the industry and city and state governments what to expect. And right now, that's nothing good. 
 New York City and State are heavily dependent on Wall Street. Taxes on high salaries and bonuses, and generally on stock market gains and options, swelled government coffers for years -- until recently. Lots of small businesses rely on Wall Street, too, so when the industry falters, the city suffers. Mr. Fernandez, 48, is one of the guys who deliver the bad news.
He sees a further slide in the coming months.
"Five of the last six recessions have been double dip," he said. "We are at the bottom headed for the next double dip, in my view."
Mr. Fernandez took his career path after a chance meeting with President John F. Kennedy that inspired him to go to Georgetown University.
When Mr. Fernandez was a small boy, his father managed the International Inn in Tampa, Fla. It was a world of glitter, celebrities, tennis courts, a swimming pool and celebrations.
"I grew up at his hotel," he said. "It was a great place. It was like having your own resort. The Rolling Stones wrote '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' when they were staying there, which gives you an example of what Tampa was like at the time."
But the highlight took place in November 1963 when his father burst into the house and told his five children to get dressed as quickly as possible. He drove them to the hotel to present them to President Kennedy, but not before Mr. Fernandez, then 9, was given a small gold PT-109 tie clip, with the word Kennedy on the boat, by a Secret Service agent.
The brief meeting might have lost much of its import but for the fact that the president was assassinated in Dallas just a few days later. The assassination haunted Mr. Fernandez, who still has the tie clip, which he fastened absent-mindedly onto his shirt as he spoke in his spacious apartment overlooking West End Avenue on the Upper West Side.
"This is what made me decide I wanted to go into the foreign service," he said. "It was what made me go to Georgetown. President Kennedy represented the idea of public service."
He spent seven years at Georgetown and received a master's in economic theory, but never finished his dissertation for a Ph.D. He was offered two jobs, one in the Foreign Service and the other at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He moved to New York in 1979 to work with the Fed and has been in the city ever since.
Mr. Fernandez was seated in a high-backed formal wooden chair that would not be out of place in a traditional home in Spain, the country from which his grandparents immigrated two generations ago. He is bilingual, and his library has books in Spanish and English. Rows of books are by the novelists and poets he loves. He is a fan of Jeanette Winterson "because she writes great, great prose."
He fidgeted with a package of Marlboros -- he is trying to quit -- until he broke down and lighted one, flicking the ash into a heavy glass ashtray.
His family suffered under the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, he said. Relatives of his mother were executed after the war for supporting the Republican side. Many others washed up as exiles in Tampa. Sepia-toned photographs adorn the wall of the hallway leading to his kitchen, where he likes like to bake flans. He stood before them to talk about this or that character, including an uncle who beat up a local gangster in Tampa "for being disrespectful to a woman."
HE lives with his wife, Tina, and their son, Felipe, 7, and daughter, Francesca, 14. He tried to persuade his family to move out of the city after the terrorist attack, "but they will not leave New York."
"We live in a target-rich environment," he said, "especially in Lower Manhattan. I think about itevery day when I go to work. I have to walk past the site."
The trauma of the attack is still very much with him, in large part because of his proximity to ground zero. He watched the towers collapse from his office, less than two blocks away. 
"Terrorism is a multigenerational problem," he said. "It is only going to get worse. It is with us literally through our grandchildren's time. That is what we have to understand. It will be expensive. Life will not be as good for our children as it was for us."
He has written two poems about the event and has shared them only with Charles Hasty, a published poet who is his brother-in-law. He had not written poems since boyhood, but the attack brought the desire back.
"I lost a lot of friends and colleagues," he said. "Poetry expresses this better."
In one poem, "A Patch of Blue," Mr. Fernandez described the color of the sky that day over Wall Street and a tattered bit of blue cloth, perhaps from a police uniform, he saw on the street after the buildings collapsed.
The worst, he said, was watching helplessly as people jumped. His poem, "The Birds," is about those who leapt to their deaths.
"Some people fell like sacks, some spread their arms, and one couple held hands and jumped together," he said. "It was courageous. At that last moment people, still had the presence of mind to choose how they would end their lives. I thought that deserved to be noted."

Bush Dismisses Protests, Pressing On With Strategy
President Bush dismissed antiwar protests as a factor in his plans for confronting Iraq and pressed ahead with a strategy to persuade reluctant allies that U.N. weapons inspections are getting nowhere. He said his goal was to protect the American people and that leadership sometimes involves bucking public opinion. A1

Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his close alliance with President Bush and warned opponents of war in Iraq that they risked producing a split between Europe and the United States. A12

Turkish and American officials continued their diplomatic brinkmanship, as the Turks said they were waiting for the Bush Administration to answer their demand for $32 billion in economic aid to ensure their participation in a war with Iraq. The Turkish request is about $6 billion higher than what American officials said was their final offer. A15

A statement issued by the European Union was tough on Saddam Hussein and clear on Europe's preference for a peaceful outcome. But it was also unambiguous in recognizing that responsibility for Iraqi disarmament lies with the Security Council, capturing the divide between American and European public opinion. A16

President Jacques Chirac of France told Central and Eastern European countries to keep their views on Iraq to themselves or risk losing their chance to join the European Union. His words words highlighted not only disagreement over Iraq, but France's struggle for dominance. A1

A San Francisco group's lawsuit says the California Coastal Commission is unconstitutional because 8 of its 12 members are appointed by the Legislature and do not have fixed terms, calling into question tens of thousands of of the commission's decisions. A17

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BRUSSELS; 
Chirac Scolding Angers Nations That Back U.S.

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
"New Europe" barked back at "old Europe" today, deepening the continental rift over Iraq after President Jacques Chirac of France told Central and Eastern European countries to keep their views on Iraq to themselves or risk losing their chance to join the European Union.
 "We thought we were preparing for war with Saddam Hussein and not Jacques Chirac," said Alexandr Vondra, deputy foreign minister of the Czech Republic, one of the European Union applicants that have drawn French ire by openly supporting the United States and Britain in the Iraqi crisis. Mr. Vondra said his country and its immediate neighbors "definitely cannot remain silent," as Mr. Chirac advised on Monday. 
 The French president, in an unusually emotional outburst in Brussels after the European Union meeting on Monday about Iraq, derided the Central and Eastern European countries that have signed letters expressing their support for the American policy on Iraq for being "badly brought up," and having missed "an opportunity to keep quiet."
All 13 candidates today endorsed the joint declaration on Iraq issued on Monday by the 15 European leaders, warning Saddam Hussein that he had "one last chance" to disarm and vowing to "avoid new lines of division" over European policy on Iraq.
But divisions exist. The war of words highlighted not only disagreement over Iraq, but also France's struggle for dominance in European affairs in the face of an enlarging European Union whose incoming members are historically beholden to the United States.
France has long been concerned that the former Communist countries, indebted to the United States for liberation from Soviet domination in the cold war, would turn out to be a sort of Trojan horse bringing America's influence into the union.
"For France, the European Union is a way for it to remain a big power in the world because it can use Europe to act and to have a certain influence in world affairs that it can't have anymore on its own," said Gilles Lepesant, a French expert on European identity and Eastern Europe. France fears that expanding the European Union membership will erode its influence and weaken Europe's position as a potential counterweight to American power.
The broader European Union membership is also more likely to produce a decentralized organization that leaves much power with national governments, rather than the more centralized, cohesive union favored by France and Germany.
The tension across Europe has grown steadily as Central and Eastern European countries have sided with the United States over how to resolve the Iraq crisis. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld last month chastised France and Germany for opposing the United States, calling them "old Europe," out of step with the "new Europe" made up of former Soviet bloc countries.
While France this month recalled its gratitude to the United States for liberation from Germany more than half a century ago, the gratitude of former Communist states toward Washington seems far more immediate and, for now, binding. Even once rock-solid bonds like that between Germany and the United States have been undermined in recent months.
Andrzej Kapiszewski, professor of sociology and political science at Krakow University in Poland, recalled that even under communism, America remained a benevolent presence. "I'm from Krakow, and practically every single person had some relative in the United States," Mr. Kapiszewski said.
There is little sense of obligation to Western Europe, though, and some irritation at the long, difficult negotiations insisted on by Western Europe for membership of the European Union. 
The East-West European divide broke into the open when eight European leaders, including the European Union candidates Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, signed a letter of support for Washington's position in January. That letter was followed by another signed by 10 more countries, including seven candidates for the European Union.
The letters reinforced widespread suspicion in France that the poorer European countries are primarily attracted to European Union membership for economic reasons while their political allegiance will remain with Washington.
"Europe is not a cash register," warned Dominique de Villepin, the French foreign minister, on Sunday.
In his comments on Monday, Mr. Chirac went on to suggest that opposing France and Germany could hurt candidates for European Union membership. He warned, in particular, that Romania and Bulgaria, the poorest of the thirteen candidates and the two that are still negotiating to enter the bloc in 2007, "could hardly find a better way" of reducing their chances for membership by speaking up against France.
The French defense minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, echoed Mr. Chirac in Warsaw today, telling her hosts that "it was better to keep silent when you don't know what's going on."
The comments were rejected across Central and Eastern Europe on Tuesday, suggesting that France will face serious challenges in exerting its influence over an expanded European Union.
"France has a right to its opinion, and Poland has the right to decide what is good for it," said Adam Rotfeld, deputy foreign minister of Poland, the largest of the candidates for the union. "France should respect that." 
Poland recently angered many European Union members by choosing Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets over French and Anglo-Swedish rivals.
The tensions between Poland and France are particularly notable because the two countries have traditionally been close. But President Bush is clearly regarded, at least for now, as a better friend to the Poles than President Chirac.
Charles Gati, a professor in European Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said nationalist sentiment in countries that are candidates for the European Union could now rise.
"This will strengthen nationalist arguments," Mr. Gati said. "They will say the West is not only selfish but divided, and we can't count on it."
Sorin Ionita, director of the Romanian Academic Society, a leading think tank in Bucharest, said: "If France wants to lose all the sympathy it has in the East, this is the way to do it, to say you little guys will have to listen to us forever. You don't hear this kind of language from the United States." 
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who initiated one of the controversial letters supporting Washington, insisted today that the candidate countries should not be silenced.
"They have as much right to speak up as Great Britain or France or any other member of the European Union today," Mr. Blair said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: LONDON; 
Blair Defends Alliance With Bush and U.S.

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his close alliance with President Bush today and warned opponents of war in Iraq that they risked producing a perilous split between Europe and the United States.
 "People who want to pull Europe and America apart are playing the most dangerous game of international politics I know," he said. 
 He did not say who those people might be. But on Monday night in Brussels, he received a boost for his position when the European Union toughened its stance on Iraq after weeks of division and rancor that pitted Britain against France and Germany. The 15 nations issued a statement saying inspections could not last indefinitely and affirming that force might be necessary, if only as a last resort. 
Mr. Blair spoke today at a news conference at 10 Downing Street as new polls showed his popularity in Britain, dragged down by his position on Iraq, at its lowest point since he became prime minister in 1997. He spoke about his support for Mr. Bush in answer to questions citing the criticism directed at the president from the estimated one million protesters who marched in London and held a rally in Hyde Park on Saturday.
"Don't look at the parody of what George Bush has done," Mr. Blair responded. "Look at the reality."
"After Sept. 11, he did not act in haste," he said. "He waited and acted deliberately. When last summer everyone was convinced we were about to rush to war, he did not. He went to the U.N. and gave peace an additional chance."
Mr. Blair, the United States' chief ally in Europe, said he thought that Mr. Bush and his policy were being unfairly caricatured in Europe. "I actually believe that some of the rhetoric I hear used about America is more savage than some of the rhetoric I hear about Saddam and the Iraqi regime," he said. He added that America should be viewed as an ally and "not some alien power acting against our interest."
In an implicit retort to President Jacques Chirac of France, he said he regretted that the 10 nations that are expected to become members of the European Union had been barred from taking part in the Brussels summit meeting on Monday. He asserted that they had the same right as the existing members to have their views on Iraq heard.
Those nations all signed a statement of support for the United States position two weeks ago, infuriating Mr. Chirac. The French president said on Monday night that their behavior could endanger their applications for admission next year.
"I would have liked to have seen the accession countries there," Mr. Blair countered today, "and I hope that no one is suggesting that they should be anything other than full members of the E.U. and perfectly entitled to express their views."
Noting that many of them had emerged from Soviet bloc tyranny, he added, "Their views are interesting because they are countries with a real sense of history, for very obvious reasons, and they know the value of Europe and America standing together."
He said he was confident that the Security Council would produce a second resolution on disarming Mr. Hussein despite Mr. Chirac's statement on Monday threatening a veto. "I don't think the position is quite as settled as people think," he said.
The same polls that show a majority of Britons against an Iraq war show that three-quarters of them would support force if it was authorized by the United Nations.
Mr. Blair said he accepted that the weekend marchers were "sincerely motivated and convinced" of their cause. But he appealed to them to recognize that it was possible to be equally sincere and convinced that force might be needed. As he has repeatedly in past weeks, he said he was standing by his position despitewidespread opposition because he felt that confronting Mr. Hussein now was simply the right thing to do.
The prime minister's office distributed statements to journalists from Iraqi exiles now living in Britain testifying to the violence and repression of the Hussein's government that had driven them to flee. Mr. Blair referred to them in answering questions about how he viewed the mass protests against his action against Iraq.
"Of course I understand the concerns of the thousands who marched on Saturday," he said. "Of course I should and do listen to those concerns." In turn, he added, the protesters should heed the voices of the four million Iraqi exiles who want Mr. Hussein overthrown.

HEADLINE: Reuters to Cut 3,000 More Jobs After Record Loss in 2002 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Reuters, the world's biggest publicly traded news and financial information provider, announced its largest loss today, a result of the global economic slowdown that has decimated the market for its stock trading terminals and left the company exposed to cheaper, nimbler rivals.
 Tom Glocer, the American who is chief executive of Reuters, said an additional 3,000 jobs would be cut, reducing the work force to 13,000. The cuts will be part of a three-year program to revamp the company that follows on the heels of a previous three-year overhaul. Reuters -- a 151-year-old company that originally relied on carrier pigeons and has spanned the eras of the telegraph and telex, electronic data transmission and the Internet -- posted a net loss for 2002 of $:394 million, or $631 million, in contrast to a profit of $:46 million in 2001. 
 The company, based in London, also alarmed investors by forecasting that revenue would slip 9 percent in the first half of 2003, before sliding even more steeply in the second half. Revenue for 2002 fell 8 percent, to $:3.58 billion. The company did not release profit or loss figures for the fourth quarter.
Reuters shares fell to 135 pence ($2.15), their lowest in 14 years. Its shares traded in New York fell $1.50, to $13.30.
When the company first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984 its shares traded for $:1 each; they reached over $:16 at the height of the technology boom in early 2000.
The company has cut 3,200 jobs under its earlier restructuring. But as the world's financial markets shrank, forcing investment banks to shed an estimated 100,000 jobs, Reuters's own market shrank. The company's rivals, meanwhile, have capitalized on low-cost Internet technology that made it cheaper and easier to transmit financial data.
"I most clearly don't see any signs of market recovery yet," Mr. Glocer said. "I am not going to make a call about when markets might turn."
Mr. Glocer said he wanted to "shape Reuters in a way to survive profitably, even in a very long bear market, but at the same time provide a platform for growth when markets turn."
As part of its announcement today Reuters said that it would spend $195 million to acquire the 94 percent it did not already own of Multex, a research firm in New York that provides financial information on some 25,000 companies.
Analysts say Reuters is struggling under two burdens -- the downturn in financial markets and the management problems accruing from years of pell-mell diversification into different technologies and geographical regions, each using its own system. And yet, Reuters has found a market for its news on some 1,500 Web sites.
"The task is so large," said Jonathan Barrett, an analyst at the brokerage house Teather & Greenwood. "You have to try and keep clients who are already difficult, introduce new systems to them, sell that to them and at the same time struggle by with what you have while in a market where other people have better products at a better price."
Reuters once focused largely on general news, where it made its name supplying information largely to newspapers and broadcasters. But from the 1970's it focused increasingly on economic news and financial data, which now provides some 90 percent of its revenue.
 In the process however, rivals like the privately held Bloomberg, which competes with Reuters for sophisticated analytical data, and Thomson Financial, offering cheaper and more basic data packages, made significant inroads as Reuters floundered with a wide variety of different technologies and pricing systems.
Bankers say the Bloomberg system is easier to operate, install and upgrade than its Reuters equivalent, while some brokerage firms have been lured by the much lower prices of systems offered by Thomson Financial and another company, Proquote.
Most worrying to many analysts, however, was Mr. Glocer's forecast of diminishing revenue this year. "How do you manage a business out of that?" said Hilary Cook, an analyst at Barclays Private Clients.
 "Ten or 12 years ago they were the stock market darlings," making healthy profits because of financial customers' readiness to pay high prices for real-time information, Ms. Cook said.
But, with the spread of the Internet and the resultant access of competitors to the same corporate and market data, Ms. Cook said, "the margin you can make has come tumbling down, because information is so much more available" on the Web.
While its competitors discounted their rates, she said, Reuters stuck to premium pricing. "They went on charging too much for what was quite a substandard product," she said. "They have this fantastic global distribution network, but they don't know how to exploit it."
Reuters sought to diversify into Internet start-ups and technology companies like Instinet, a stock trading operation listed in the United States. Reuters's newest losses included its share of a $:208 million write-down that Instinet announced last month. "They did try to diversify away from their dependence on traditional business," Ms. Cook said, "but they are now trying to pull back from that."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
CB Richard Ellis to Expand In New York With Acquisition

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
CB Richard Ellis Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the Insignia Financial Group for about $256 million in cash, consolidating its position as the larg est commercial real estate broker in the world and greatly expanding its position in New York.
 CB Richard Ellis, which is based in Los Angeles, said the combined company would be the world's largest manager of commercial property and would generate $90 billion in annual sales and leasing transactions. Despite its already huge size, CB Richard Ellis has never been much of a factor in New York, one of the most lucrative and glamorous real estate markets. But with the deal, which is expected to be completed in June, the company would finally become a powerhouse at a time when the real estate market is soft and revenues are down. 
 "Insignia is the perfect hand-in-glove complement for our global platform," Ray Wirta, the chief executive of CB Richard Ellis, said in a statement yesterday. "The new entity will offer clients the optimal balance of worldwide reach and specialized services."
CB Richard Ellis agreed to pay $11 for each share of Insignia common stock. It also agreed to spend about $155 million to pay off Insignia's debt and acquire its preferred stock, bringing the total value of the deal to about $415 million. Blum Capital Partners, which took CB Richard Ellis private in an $800 million buyout in July 2001, will provide the company with up to $145 million in cash to help finance the deal.
Shares of Insignia rose 22 cents, to $10.85, yesterday in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They closed Friday at $10.63, up 9.4 percent over the week as word of the deal circulated in real estate circles and on Wall Street. At one point, Carl C. Ichan, who owns a 7.55 percent stake in Insignia, jumped into the fray by opening discussions with Insignia about merging with his High River company. But CB Richard Ellis ultimately signed the deal at 4 a.m. yesterday.
The combined company will face some daunting obstacles, including a hefty debt, a weak economy and the potential loss of some high-producing brokers, according to stock analysts and real estate executives.
"It's a very seasonal and cyclical business that really should not be public," said William C. Marks, a director of JMP Securities in San Francisco. "There's not a significant potential for internal growth."
But one person who had been briefed on the terms of the deal said CB Richard Ellis expected to save up to $50 million a year by combining the two companies and eliminating overlapping management.
At the same time, however, some of their best brokers may feel crowded in cities where both companies have a significant presence and they may decide to jump to a rival. Competing companies may also see an opportunity to do some poaching.
"It's safe to say that their biggest challenge is to accomplish this merger without losing any significant producers," said Michael T. Cohen, chief executive of GVA Williams, a broker in New York. "Their production will come under siege. It's a slow year and the free agent market is already in play."
The two companies will have annual revenue of more than $1.8 billion and 16,000 employees in 47 countries. Insignia plans to sell certain unspecified real estate assets before the deal closes. If it receives more than $45 million, shareholders will receive up to an additional $1 a share.
There is no question that CB Richard Ellis will fulfill its longstanding quest to become a big player in New York. A year ago, the company hired Mary Ann Tighe, a top broker at Insignia, to run its New York operation and gave her a $100 million budget. Now it is buying the whole company.
Stephen B. Siegel, chairman of Insignia's commercial real estate services in the United States, will become chairman of global brokerage for CB Richard Ellis with responsibility for drumming up business. Andrew Farkas, chairman of Insignia, will remain with the company through the closing. Mr. Farkas will end up selling the publicly traded real estate company he built for a more modest premium than he once hoped, said Mr. Marks of JMP Securities.
"He now realizes that Wall Street will never embrace a company that is focused on commercial and residential real estate services," he said, "rather than a more stable business like asset management."

HEADLINE: Some States Propose End to Arts Spending 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER

 BODY:
Last year, struggling to control a ballooning budget deficit, state legislators in Arizona reduced funds for the arts. This year, facing an even larger deficit, they are proposing a simpler approach: cutting arts financing altogether. 
 A legislative committee has recommended eliminating the state arts agency in Arizona and its $5.1 million annual budget. It has also recommended that a $7 million fund established as an endowment for arts programs be dissolved, so the money can be used for other purposes. 
 Arizona is not the only state taking such a radical step. Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, who is grappling with a $5 billion deficit, has proposed cutting the entire $18 million budget of his state's Council on the Arts and canceling a planned $10 million payment to a cultural trust fund that supports small arts groups. Missouri is also planning to eliminate its entire arts budget. Other states may follow suit as they confront daunting fiscal challenges. 
Leaders of arts advocacy groups nationwide have begun what is likely to be a long and difficult campaign to restore at least some financing. Earlier this month, for example, more than 700 supporters of the arts from across Arizona gathered on a lawn next to the State Capitol for a picnic that was also a protest against plans to end state financing for cultural programs.
About 60 state legislators stopped by for barbecue sandwiches, and each was steered to protesters from his or her district. Most gave their constituents the same message: we sympathize with your concerns, but the state is broke and can no longer afford what it could a few years ago.
"They threw down the gauntlet," said Rebecca Gaspar, executive vice president of Arizonans for Cultural Development, sponsor of the protest. "There are very hard times ahead for arts organizations, that's clear."
Arts advocates sounded an alarm last year when several states approved sharp cuts in their arts budgets. California cut its support for arts and cultural programs by 41 percent. Massachusetts went even further, with a 62 percent cut. Even those reductions, however, seem almost modest compared with some recent proposals.
With tax revenues slumping because of the weak economy, governors and state legislators are telling arts groups that they must now rely on private rather than public donors. The economic downturn, however, has meant that private funds are also harder to come by.
Studies conducted over the last few years have shown that spending on arts programs produces handsome economic returns, and many state officials have come to agree that supporting these programs is a wise investment. But they now say their preferences are irrelevant because state coffers are bare.
"There is broad bipartisan support for arts programs in most states, but that doesn't matter anymore," said Kimber Craine, spokesman for the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies. "The states are facing one of their worst budget crises since World War II. The deficits they are facing are huge."
Mr. Craine said that many arts administrators considered the new cuts to be opening gambits in what may be long negotiations. "People are tense, but we all recognize there's a way to go before this is all sorted out," he said. "Some governors may want to spread the alarm so people will realize how serious the situation is. It may be a way to bring legislators around to approving new revenues, which is really going to be the only way out of this."
Arizona is typical. With a state budget deficit of $1.3 billion, legislative leaders are proposing the elimination of 13 state agencies and programs. Besides the Commission for the Arts, they include the Department of Commerce, the Office of Tourism and KidsCare, a health insurance program for children.
"This is the biggest challenge we've faced in 25 years," said Shelley Cohn, executive director of the Arizona Commission on the Arts. "If we want economic growth here, we have to fight the perception that this is a cultural wasteland. This budget takes us in the opposite direction. It's not what the people of this state want, and I think we're going to be able to show that very clearly."
In New Jersey Ellen Mellody, a spokeswoman for Governor McGreevey, called his proposals "a question of mathematics." "The governor has been forced to make cuts to programs that were near and dear to his heart," Ms. Mellody said.
Jeffrey Woodward, president of ArtPride New Jersey, an arts advocacy group, said the proposed cuts "were unexpected, a complete surprise, and many of us are still in shock."
"We haven't been asked to take a proportionate cut," continued Mr. Woodward, also managing director of the McCarter Theater in Princeton. "We've just been eliminated. That we find incredibly shortsighted and wrong."
He said his group had begun a lobbying campaign aimed at state legislators. "We're mobilizing our audiences, our vendors and everyone who realizes the effect that culture has on the quality of life here," he said. "Curtain speeches are being made at theaters around the state. At the McCarter we've put a flier in our programs urging people to contact their legislators. There's a lot of activity."
The New Jersey cuts were announced only days after Gov. Bob Holden of Missouri issued a budget proposal that included eliminating the state artscouncil, which last year had a budget of $3.9 million.
Even state arts councils that are assured of survival are suffering major cuts. The new budget proposed by Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia, for example, includes a cut of nearly 50 percent in support for the arts. Pressure for similar cuts in other states is likely to intensify as the fiscal year approaches its end on June 30.
As a result of these cuts, many arts councils and nonprofit cultural groups will lose matching funds from private donors and the federal government. The $3.9 million cut in Missouri, for example, will mean the loss of about $1 million in federal matching funds.
While this year's cuts and those proposed for next year are not expected to cause the collapse of many arts organizations, they are forcing them to reduce their scope. The Springfield Regional Opera in Missouri, for instance, is offering one main-stage production this year instead of two, and is using fewer costumes, less scenery and a smaller orchestra. It has also moved into a smaller theater.
"The effect I'm really worried about is the downtown revitalization, which has been a huge success here," said Susan Brummell, the opera's executive director. "Arts groups bring people downtown, and if we can't do that, this tremendous growth we've seen downtown could be undermined. We're going to have to work harder to convince the restaurant owners and other business people that it's in their interest to help keep us going."
Marc C. Duff, policy director for Taxpayers Network, a Wisconsin-based watchdog group, said he expected the rash of cuts in state arts budgets to continue for at least several more years.
"When you're facing a budget crisis of this magnitude, art just isn't a priority anymore," Mr. Duff said.

HEADLINE: Seattle Theater in Peril As Money Runs Out 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
Officials at A Contemporary Theater in Seattle, a respected regional troupe with some 9,000 subscribers and a history of acclaimed productions, were trying yesterday to fix a financial crisis that could shut their 38-year-old nonprofit theater. 
 The theater's board of trustees announced Friday that the company was $1.7 million in debt and was currently operating with only $3,000 in cash in the bank. At the theater's administrative offices in downtown Seattle, only a skeleton crew of a half-dozen people were working part time, and calls to the theater's administrative and public relations departments were not being returned. 
 Sheena Aebig, co-president of the theater's board, said yesterday that no white knight had appeared since the trustees announced the crisis. Some $1.5 million is needed to keep going past Friday. "No big checks have come in," she said. "I don't see how it can not cease operations." 
Like many theater companies around the country, the company, known as ACT, has been hurt by a weakening economy, a less-generous philanthropic environment and severe cuts in public arts financing. Groups in Seattle, however, have been particularly hard hit as the city's economy -- reliant on technology, Internet and computer companies -- faltered and its unemployment rate soared. 
Sharon Ott, artistic director of the Seattle Repertory Theater, the city's largest nonprofit troupe, with 15,000 subscribers, said ACT's problems weren't unique, though their severity was. "The city has been reeling, all of us, the Rep as well," Ms. Ott said. "And we all knew there were troubles at ACT, but we didn't expect it to be this dire and this imminent."
The first major sign of danger came in mid-January when the theater announced that its planned 2003-4 season, due to start in April, would be pushed back to September. Shortly after that, ACT released its newly appointed artistic director, Robert Egan, from his contract, a signal that the theater had no money to produce its own shows. (Several small productions are still renting ACT's two main-stage theaters.) Earlier this month the theater's managing director resigned; several dozen employees have also been laid off over the last three months.
Along with the Seattle Rep and the Intiman Theater, ACT helped give Seattle one of the nation's most vibrant theater scenes during the late 1980's and 90's. Among the recent shows that began at ACT before moving to New York were the 1999 production of "The Syringa Tree," by the South African playwright Pamela Gien, and the 2000 opera "In the Penal Colony" by Philip Glass.
The theater's budget also continued to grow, reaching nearly $6 million last year. High ambitions, however, along with management problems, have played a major part in the theater's current travails, Ms. Aebig said. "It's a combination of events, including letting our artistic eyes outrun our financial pocketbook," she said. "We were not keeping a close enough eye on things."
Ms. Aebig said the theater had been running with significant yearly losses for several years and lost some $500,000 in 2002, despite having sold 120,000 tickets. 
Some in the Seattle arts community pegged the theater's current problems to its decision in 1996 to move from the fashionable Queen Anne district to a newly renovated, $30-million downtown theater called Kreielsheimer Place.
"The building project they undertook was enormous," said Peter F. Donnelly, president and chief executive of the Corporate Council for the Arts, a foundation in Seattle. "They went through a very rapid expansion, and that, coupled with some serious artistic disappointments their first couple of years in that building, made it very hard on them."
Ms. Aebig agreed that the theater was expensive to run and keep up. But she added, "You can't lay everything on the building."
For the city's sake, both Mr. Donnelly and Ms. Ott said they hoped the theater could rebound quickly. "Seattle has three theaters with major ambitions, and as a result has been able to support a major community of actors, directors and designers," Ms. Ott said. "To have one of the three drop out puts a huge dent in the life of the actors and others who have chosen to live in Seattle."
Still, Ms. Aebig, a business reorganization lawyer with the firm of Williams, Kastner & Gibbs, holds out hope that money might be found in the coming months to allow the 2003-4 season to pick up in September.
"ACT has been part of this community for 38 years," she said. "And we have to be confident that the community will not let ACT fail."

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE; 
The Osbournes Plan for Summer

BYLINE:  By Neil Strauss

 BODY:
The Osbournes opened their Beverly Hills home for a news conference on Tuesday to announce the lineup of Ozzfest, the summer hard-rock tour led by Ozzy Osbourne.
 The location for the announcement was a savvy move on the part of Sharon Osbourne, Mr. Osbourne's wife, manager and television co-star. Allowing the news media into a home famous as the setting for the family's beloved reality show was a surefire way to coax extra publicity for the opening of the tour in the highly competitive summer festival season. And it was little nuisance for the Osbournes, who are used to having television cameras in their home. 
 In the past it would have been improbable to have walked onto the set of "Seinfeld" or "The Cosby Show" and interacted with the players while they were still in character. But since the comedy that is "The Osbournes" is a reality show, and regular exposure on MTV has let its family get comfortable simply being itself in front of strangers, the Osbournes are almost always in character.
Tuesday's news conference may remain a great lost episode; the show's cameras were absent because the permit required to hold the event did not allow them. The guests included members of Korn, Marilyn Manson and Chevelle, who are to perform at Ozzfest when it begins on June 28 in San Antonio, where Mr. Osbourne's shows were banned for years after he urinated on the Alamo. (The tour comes to the New York area on Aug. 18, at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J.)
The entire Osbourne family was on hand -- pets and all -- with the matriarch looking radiant. "Unlike Michael Jackson, I've had more than two operations," she said in a one-on-one interview. Shortly afterward she admonished her son, Jack, threatening to have Mr. Jackson baby-sit for him if he didn't behave.
The news conference began with a reporter asking Mr. Osbourne if his pioneering heavy-metal band, Black Sabbath, would ever reunite. "I'll never say never again," Mr. Osbourne replied, breaking his word two seconds later by continuing, "because you never know."
Ms. Osbourne quickly cut the questions short with a comment that began politely, "Excuse me," but ended with a string of profanities directed at that reporter for not asking about Ozzfest. 
Mr. Osbourne grinned: "She told you, mate."
Mr. Manson said he had been invited to join the tour after having "phone sex" with Ms. Osbourne. Mr. Osbourne looked at him admiringly and said, "That's more than I've had." 
On a more serious note, Mr. Osbourne said that last year he was not prepared to go on the road after colon cancer was diagnosed in his wife. This year, however, she is recovering, and Mr. Osbourne said he was preparing by exercising five days a week for two hours a day. 
Was he still drinking, someone wanted to know? "I'll tell you what my drinking problem is," Mr. Osbourne replied. "I've only got one mouth."
As all this unfolded, the Osbournes' dogs scratched noisily at the windows outside, and Kelly Osbourne flitted in and out of the rooms, complaining about the catered food and pet smells. 
In a famous news release several years ago, Sharon Osbourne said she had stopped managing the Smashing Pumpkins for medical reasons. "Billy Corgan was making me sick," she elaborated, referring to that band's leader. When asked on Tuesday whether she had tried to recruit Mr. Corgan's current band, Zwan, for Ozzfest, Ms. Osbourne replied, "I did, because we needed new catering."
Nowadays Ms. Osbourne does not manage other bands, she said.
Explained Jack, "Mom's a TV star." 
After the news conference Mr. Osbourne agreed to sit down for a one-on-one interview with characteristic magnanimity. "I thought that the whole point of a press conference was so that I didn't have to do these," he complained to his publicist. 
"I got two careers -- the TV career and the rock 'n' roll career," he said after easily relenting. "And the love of my life is music. I've watched barely half an episode of 'The Osbournes.' " 
Besides, that show, he said, "is just me using profanities and trying to be a father."
Ozzfest, which began in 1997, has become one of the most successful summer tours. This year the main-stage lineup also includes Disturbed. Among the acts scheduled for the second stage, and booked in part by Jack Osbourne, are Cradle of Filth, Trust Company and Hotwire. 

Festival Frenzy
Competition for the dwindling disposable income of Americans seems as if it will be fierce this summer. In recent days many of that season's most anticipated festivals have announced their lineups and ticket prices. In deference to the economy, Ozzfest is even selling a limited number of lawn seats for $10 directly at the box office of each show.
Perhaps Ozzfest's closest competition is Metallica's Summer Sanitarium tour, which is almost entirely made up of bands that have performed previously at Ozzfest, among them Linkin Park, Deftones, Limp Bizkit and Mudvayne.
Lollapalooza, the alternative-rock road show that inspired Ozzfest and most of its other summer festival competitors, has returned after five years. It even outwrestled Ozzfest to book the hard-rock band Queens of the Stone Age. Also appearing at Lollapalooza, scheduled for July and August, are Incubus, Audioslave, Jurassic 5, and Jane's Addiction. 
The punk-heavy Vans Warped Tour has survived to see its ninth year, with A.F.I., Rancid, Andrew W. K., the Ataris, Dropkick Murphys, Less Than Jake, Pennywise, Suicide Machines and the Used. 
Two major nontouring festivals also announced their lineups this week. The eclectic Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is set for April 26 and 27 in Indio, Calif. It will include the in-demand Queens of the Stone Age along with Underworld, Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, the White Stripes, Primal Scream, N*E*R*D, Cafe Tacuba, Kinky, Ladytron, Badly Drawn Boy, Ben Folds, Fischerspooner and Felix da Housecat. 
The Bonnaroo Music Festival will run from June 13 to 15 in Manchester, Tenn., with Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, the Roots, Moe, Galactic, Robert Randolph, James Brown, the Allman Brothers, Sonic Youth, Tortoise and Medeski, Martin and Wood. Headlining the festival will be Widespread Panic and the Dead. The latter act was the Grateful Dead, but after the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995 its members retired that name and performed as the Other Ones. Last week, however, the band members met their former name halfway and rechristened themselves the Dead at a Valentine's Day concert in San Francisco.
Other major packages expected this summer include the pairing of Kiss and Aerosmith, as well as Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake.

HEADLINE: Military Contractor Gets Deal To Limit Its Losses in Britain 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PFANNER, International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
BAE Systems, Europe's largest military contractor, said today that it had reached an agreement with the British government to limit its losses on two major contracts that have been plagued with cost overruns. The deal lifted a cloud from the company's financial prospects and inspired investors to bid up its shares by more than 10 percent.
 News of the problems with the two weapons programs -- Astute-class submarines and Nimrod MRA4 surveillance aircraft -- had depressed the value of BAE's shares by about 40 percent over three days in December, and had undermined confidence in the company's leadership. 
 Doubts were growing about BAE's ability to deliver profits from a huge new contract it has just won, a $4.6 billion order to build two aircraft carriers for the British Navy. BAE will subcontract much of the work on the carriers to its main rival for the order, Thales of France.
"They've received a get-out-of-jail card this time, but one wonders how many times they will keep getting them," Gareth Evans, a consultant at A. T. Kearney who follows the military procurement industry, said of BAE's agreement today. 
Analysts said Britain had little choice but to agree to absorb most of the cost overruns on the Astute and Nimrod programs. Western European countries generally spend proportionally much less on weapons than the United States. Big weapons contracts are few, and production runs are short, making economies of scale hard to achieve.
To maintain a viable European weapons industry, governments will have to live with the need to insulate suppliers from catastrophic losses when a program runs into problems. 
The new agreement provides for BAE and the British Ministry of Defense to share future cost overruns (or savings if there are any) on the two programs.
For the cost overruns already incurred, BAE will take a charge of $:750 million ($1.2 billion) against 2002 earnings, which are scheduled to be reported Thursday. The British government will also provide some new money for each weapon system.
Both programs are years behind schedule. The Nimrod aircraft, originally planned for delivery this year, is now expected in 2009; the first Astute submarine, once meant to see service in 2001, will probably not be completed until 2008.
"Addressing these issues has been important but it should be recognized that the balance and majority of the company's business has continued to perform well," said Mike Turner, the company's chief executive.

PERSON: Richard Orme Wilberforce 

HEADLINE: Lord Wilberforce, 95, Keeper Of an Antislavery Tradition 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Richard Orme Wilberforce, a retired member of Britain's highest court and keeper of his family's antislavery tradition, died on Saturday at a hospital in London. He was 95.
 He was a prominent judge in postwar Britain, known for handling both criminal and civil matters with a keen intellect, clarity and patient civility. Knighted in 1961, he was created a life peer and law lord three years later, when he became Lord Wilberforce, Baron of the City and County of Kingston-upon-Hull. 
 Lord Wilberforce was a great-great-grandson of William Wilberforce (1759-1833), an English statesman associated with William Pitt the Younger, the great British prime minister. William Wilberforce was a religiously inspired antislavery politician who helped pave the way for the Abolition of Slavery Act of 1833.
Three years ago his descendant, Lord Wilberforce, warned Parliament of a modern kind of "bonded labor." This, he declared, had taken the place of slavery that William Wilberforce had denounced in the House of Commons as early as the 1780's.
He said that whereas people may be freed from chattel servitude by breaking their chains, modern bonded labor enmeshes them in a whole skein of complex economic and political circumstances.
"You have to provide a system of good employment, schools for the children, and some system of land reform so that people can earn a living," he told Parliament. "Bonded labor certainly is servitude, and in many ways it is worse."
Richard Orme Wilberforce was raised in India, the son of a judge of the high court in Lahore under the Raj. He graduated from Oxford University and was called to the bar in 1932.
His career as a barrister was interrupted by six years in the army in World War II. He served in Norway, France and Germany, earning the rank of brigadier and decorations that included a United States Bronze Star. He ended the war in the army's legal branch and was under secretary of the Control Office for Germany and Austria in 1945-46, helping to repeal Nazi-era legislation and set up a new legal framework.
He started his judicial career in 1961 as an appointed High Court, or Chancery, judge. He was promoted directly to the House of Lords as a lord appeal in ordinary. Historically the House of Lords served as Britain's court of final resort but delegated that function to a committee of law lords, making it the country's highest tribunal.
He contributed especially in the fields of international law, and administrative and commercial law. He was also remembered for issuing the judicial report ending the coal miners' strike that crippled Britain in the winter of 1971-72.
After he retired from the law committee in 1982, Lord Wilberforce advocated human rights, legal reforms and a simpler legislative process. He also sought to inspire the judiciary to become more aware of social needs and imperatives when applying the law.
His survivors include his wife of 55 years, Yvette Marie Lenoan, daughter of a French judge; a daughter, Anne Catherine Burn; and a son, Samuel Herbert.

HEADLINE: The Worst Defense 

BYLINE:  By Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon; Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, members of the National Security Council staff from 1994-1999, are authors of The Age of Sacred Terror."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In announcing his "Ready Campaign" to prepare Americans for terrorist attack, Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge declared yesterday: "Terror forces us to make a choice. We can be afraid or we can be ready." Mr. Ridge's remarks, meant to calm people unnerved by two weeks of life at Code Orange, might have more resonance if the Bush administration were investing more wisely in national defenses against a catastrophic attack.
 As much as $160 billion in new financing has been poured into national security since 9/11, yet only a small fraction has been used to make Americans safer at home. In fact, the bulk of the money has been used for troops, conventional weapons systems and traditional military investments, not for confronting terrorism. This trend will accelerate with the president's 2004 budget: at $380 billion, spending on the military is expected to grow $40 billion over last year and almost a third since 2001, an extraordinary jump by historical standards. 
 Higher salaries for soldiers and a new aircraft carrier may be welcome in the unlikely event that Al Qaeda ever hijacks another state, as it did Afghanistan. But after the punishment meted out in late 2001, it is unlikely that United States forces will again face Qaeda fighters on the battlefield. 
In fact, the most significant defense increase that will directly help the counterterrorism effort is $1.1 billion for Special Operations Forces, which will be used more and more to destroy terrorist cells in places where the local authorities lack the ability.
On the defensive side of the ledger, the administration will increase to $9 billion the financing for national missile defense. But as the government's National Intelligence Estimate asserts, America is far more likely to be attacked by terrorists using weapons of mass destruction delivered in a car, truck or airplane than by a rogue nation with missiles. 
By comparison, the funds being allocated for security in the United States -- through the new Homeland Security Department and other agencies -- are much skimpier.
Certainly, the administration has rightly poured $12 billion into aviation security, vaccine research and a stockpile of vital drugs that would mitigate the effects of a biological weapons attack. Yet even these efforts remain uneven: no comparable security upgrades have been made for United States carriers at foreign airports -- an inexplicable failure given that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, an architect of the 9/11 attacks and someone who plotted to blow up a dozen American 747's over the Pacific in 1995, is still at large. Moreover, the effort to equip and train first responders -- the emergency personnel who would deal with a catastrophic attack -- has fallen woefully behind because of budget wrangling.
Skeptics argue, rightly, that a perfect defense is impossible. A more systematic approach, however, is not only possible but essential. Here are some key threats that must be addressed:
Unmanned aircraft and cruise missiles. On 9/11, commercial jets were used as missiles; their payloads were jet fuel. Today, recreational kit airplanes can be built for a few thousand dollars and converted into remote-control weapons. These planes can take off from a grass strip shorter than a football field and give terrorists an easy means to attack from within America's borders. 
And then there are cruise missiles. A growing number of countries, including Pakistan and Iran, have anti-ship cruise missiles that, if stolen or diverted, could be converted into land-attack cruise missiles. These missiles can be transported in nondescript containers and guided by inexpensive Global Positioning System devices to targets mapped with available satellite imagery. Freighters provide the ideal platform for launching these cruise missiles, which can travel more than 100 miles; Al Qaeda is reported to have 15 such vessels. 
Creating a perimeter at sea to keep suspicious ships out of range would mean drastically expanding the Coast Guard's mission. Although the United States has excellent air defenses against a conventional military attack, both slow-flying remote-controlled aircraft and terrain-hugging cruise missiles present a formidable challenge. Military radar that tracks supersonic aircraft cannot distinguish a terrorist plane or cruise missile from a commercial puddle-jumper; creating a new radar system that knows what to look for would be complicated and expensive -- yet it's essential if the United States is to even contemplate shooting down such a vehicle. A starting estimate of the cost of safeguarding American airspace from these dangers is $40 billion. 
Shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. The recent information about a possible attack at Heathrow Airport in London and the firing of two missiles at an Israeli plane taking off from Mombasa, Kenya, in November are frightening harbingers. The world is awash in thousands of these Stinger-type missiles, including ones made in the United States, Russia, China, the former Yugoslavia and North Korea. They have been used dozens of times against commercial aircraft, mostly in African war zones. Twice during the Clinton administration, reports of impending attacks with such missiles caused intense security scrambles abroad. A single hit on an American jet would bring commercial aviation to a halt and cripple the economy.
It is possible to defend against these missiles. Because the projectiles have a ceiling of about 10,000 feet, the danger is greatest for aircraft taking off and landing. While it is impossible to secure every rooftop around urban airports, much can be done to map the safest routes for planes and to watch over airports with cameras, patrols and helicopters. Some of the mapping work has already been done at American and foreign airports, but a global effort is required.
Countermeasures -- the so-called chaff and flare -- used on military aircraft can also be employed on commercial planes. After Mombasa, Israel started to install all its commercial jets with this equipment. In the late 1990's, the United States government raised the issue of countermeasures with the airlines. The industry blanched upon learning that it would cost $1 million to $2 million per plane. Airlines are in worse economic shape than they were a decade ago, making them even less willing to adopt these measures. Washington needs to step in, at a cost of around $5 billion. 
Loose nuclear weapons, chemicals and pathogens. If the conflict with Iraq sharpens, Al Qaeda will get its best chance of acquiring a weapon of mass destruction since all constraints on Saddam Hussein's behavior will evaporate if his regime is in danger. Over the longer term, the terrorists will look to acquire key ingredients from the former Soviet Union, where tons of chemical, biological and nuclear materials remain poorly guarded. The United States spent $4 billion in the 1990's to destroy weaponry and safeguard materials. After much initial skepticism, the Bush administration embraced this program. Last year, the leading industrial countries promised to join in with pledges of $18 billion. 
Now, the United States must keep this a top priority on the international agenda. It also needs to extend this program to other countries where there is a serious possibility of proliferation, including Pakistan, some of whose scientists have met with senior Qaeda members.
Whether driving a bomb-laden skiff into a warship or flying a wide-body jet into a skyscraper, Al Qaeda has shown extraordinary tactical ingenuity. Against this innovative and resilient foe, the United States needs to muster the resources and creativity for an effective defense, instead of overarming for battle with the rogue regimes that its military can already easily defeat.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Renewed Fears of Iraq War Cause Share Prices to Falter

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, ending a two-day rally that had lifted the Dow Jones industrial average almost 300 points, as renewed fears of war with Iraq unnerved investors.
 "What we're seeing is reaction to yesterday's call that war is not likely," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto. "I don't think we can make that call." 
 The United States and Britain worked to draw up a United Nations resolution authorizing force, in hopes that such a resolution would placate global opposition to a war. 
The Dow fell 40.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 8,000.60, recovering from a decline that reached 105 points. 
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.04 points, or 0.71 percent, to 845.13.
The Nasdaq composite index declined 12.22 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,334.32. 
Investors looked past an upbeat economic report. Low mortgage rates helped housing starts rise unexpectedly in January, climbing 0.2 percent to their highest rate since mid-1986, the government said. 
Fears of an American-led war with Iraq also pushed oil prices higher. In New York, crude oil for March delivery rose 20 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $37.16 a barrel, its highest close in 29 months. 
"Longer-term investors aren't willing to come in and be buyers," said Paul Cherney, a market analyst at S&P Marketscope. "That's the plight of the market, and it will remain that way until we have some resolution with Iraq." 
Among the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange was MBNA, which fell more than 12 percent, or $2, to $14.50. 
MBNA, the independent credit card company, had earnings estimates cut by several analysts after it reported higher-than-expected credit losses in January. 
Shares in chip equipment companies fell a day after the industry's trade group reported that orders to North American suppliers fell 10 percent in January. Applied Materials Inc. lost 33 cents, to $12.41; Novellus Systems dropped $1.02, to $29.36; and KLA-Tencor lost 46 cents, to $34.65. 
Lucent Technologies, the telecommunications equipment maker, gained slightly for most of the day after its chief executive, Patricia F. Russo, said the company was sticking by its projection of returning to profitability this fiscal year, citing growth in the industry. 
Shareholders also voted to approve giving Lucent directors authority to perform a reverse stock split, aimed at preventing shares from being delisted and reducing volatility in its share price. 
By the end of the day, Lucent lost 2 cents, to $1.77.
Qwest Communications International, the provider of local telephone service, fell 32 cents, to $4.05. The company, which is facing federal investigations of its accounting practices, posted a fourth-quarter profit because of one-time gains, but revenue fell on slack demand for telephone and data services. 
Shares of J. M. Smucker, the maker of peanut butter and jelly, fell as much as 12.5 percent after the company forecast only slight earnings growth for the coming year. Smucker shares slid $4.02, or 10.3 percent, to $35.02. 
A bullish call from Morgan Stanley barely lifted semiconductor stocks. 
The brokerage firm said a new product cycle, lower unit costs and pricing power should "drive earnings power sharply higher" in the next one to two years at Intel, the industry giant. Shares of Intel rose 9 cents, to $16.80. 
Morgan Stanley also increased its rating on Texas Instruments and Xilinx. Texas Instruments gained 17 cents, to $16.41, and Xilinx added 1 cent to $22.10. The rating increase "was totally ignored," said Andrew Baker, senior trader at the regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. 
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note increased 16/32, to a price of 99 29/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.89 percent, from 3.95 percent on Tuesday. 
The 30-year bond rose 24/32 , to 108 16/32 . Its yield fell to 4.82 percent, from 4.86 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Incumbent Is Favored as Armenia Holds Presidential Election 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Using see-through ballot boxes to help fight fraud, Armenia voted today for a president, who will have to tackle the protracted dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region with Azerbaijan and revive a ravaged economy.
 Opinion polls in the former Soviet republic, which is situated in a region important to Western oil interests, showed that the incumbent, Robert Kocharian, was likely to clear the 50 percent mark needed for a first-round victory over eight rivals. 
 Mr. Kocharian, 48, has been in power since 1998 in this country of 3.2 million. "I never step into battle without counting" his chances, he told reporters after voting, but he avoided further questions. 
His main rivals are Artashes Geghamian, the Communist-era mayor of Yerevan, and Stepan Demirchian, the son of a Soviet-era leader, Karen Demirchian, who challenged Mr. Kocharian in 1998.
"I am going to vote for Kocharian as I like how he works and I want stability," said Gagik Barsegian, 53, a driver from Yerevan. "Another candidate could destroy everything." 
Previous voting in Armenia has been marked by intimidation and ballot-box stuffing.
Many voters cast their ballots in transparent boxes imported from the West as part of efforts to ensure a clean vote.
Four of Mr. Kocharian's opponents, including his two main rivals, issued a statement today saying that they had witnessed large-scale voting irregularities that showed "free and fair elections and the country's international image" were in danger. 
Whatever the outcome, analysts say, new talks over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region are unlikely until after elections in Azerbaijan in November.
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in 1988. Six years of fighting left more than 35,000 dead and nearly a million homeless, with Armenian forces seizing much territory. A cease-fire took hold in 1994, but no long-term solution has proven attainable, despite recent attempts by Russia, the United States and France to mediate.
Armenia has a close strategic relationship with Russia. The United States, which has considerable oil interests in the region, has made it clear that it wants a fair vote that will produce leadership able to tackle the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
But for most voters, the Nagorno-Karabakh issue is secondary to raising living standards. Average monthly salaries stand at the equivalent of $40.
"I want Stepan Demirchian to be our president," said Sevan Ayvasian, 64, an engineer from Yerevan. "I believe that he will fight corruption and restore order in our country."
Armenia relies on support from up to six million ethnic Armenians in the United States. Two million ethnic Armenians live in Russia, and virtually all candidates call for close ties with Moscow.
Surveys predicted a turnout of over 70 percent and there were long lines at polling booths despite bad weather.

HEADLINE: Kraft Announces Pension Costs 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Kraft Foods Inc. said today that it would have 5 cents a share in noncash expenses next year because it spread out low returns from a pension program. 
 The company may also spend about 2 cents a share for a compensation program that gives executives restricted stock in lieu of options, the co-chief executives, Betsy Holden and Roger Deromedi, said in a presentation to analysts and investors in Arizona. 
 Companies have had to invest in their pension programs because declining value in equity investments and interest rates cut the funds' returns. Kraft's costs for next year assume the pension assets have a 9 percent rate of return. The company will have 9 cents a share in pension, health care and stock compensation expenses in 2003. 
Kraft still expects to earn $2.10 to $2.15 a share this year, an increase of as much as 6 percent from 2002. The company will save $140 million to $150 million from plant closings and other measures taken after its parent, Altria Group Inc., bought Nabisco more than two years ago.

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
Blight Is Issue at Proposed Site for The Times

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
WELL-REHEARSED drama is a staple of 42nd Street, even in the legal battles that have accompanied each step of its state-sponsored redevelopment.
 The acts play out like this: The government condemns properties as blighted. Owners sue, in part for bargaining leverage. The state prevails. Cases are settled. Awards, fees and expenses are paid. Sites are cleared. And new towers emerge. 
 At first, Prof. Marci A. Hamilton of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University, who specializes in constitutional law, said she discerned another "cut-and-dried application of the law" in the case involving owners on the block of Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, whose property has been acquired by New York State to create a development site for The New York Times Company's new headquarters.
But this case differs from earlier battles in that it is being fought at a time when blight and Times Square are no longer synonymous.
Professor Hamilton is persuaded that the case presents an important federal issue and is hoping, against high odds, that the United States Supreme Court will agree to hear the matter, which it is expected to review soon.
"The real question is: can a government take private property for the benefit of other private owners when the blight findings they're relying on are done after the decision to take the property?" Professor Hamilton said.
By that, she meant that the official determination of blight was issued in November 2001, after a tentative agreement reached by the Empire State Development Corporation with the Times Company and its development partner, Forest City Ratner Companies. Earlier blight findings, she said, were of questionable relevance since they were in some cases almost 20 years old.
Professor Hamilton argued in her petition to the Supreme Court that federal and state courts were split on whether the constitutional requirement of a public purpose for the taking of property could be satisfied by blight findings that were, in essence, a pretext for economic development plans.
Her clients are Sidney, Markus and Joseph Orbach, brothers and partners in Three O Realty, who owned a 110,000-square-foot office building at 265 West 40th Street that the state condemned in August, along with 10 other properties, to create a development site for The Times. Their tenants included a Donna Karan Home showroom and the richly stocked B & J Fabrics store. "This whole 16-story building -- they offered $7 million," Markus Orbach said. "That's a nice bargain."
And an unconstitutional one, Professor Hamilton said. "The taking was not a taking for the public purpose of removing blight, but solely for the purpose of transferring private property to another, more powerful and 'connected' private owner, The New York Times," she said in her petition. In response, Empire State Development dismissed the federal claim as preposterous. "No case has ever held that a pretextual blight finding is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional public use requirement," the state said in its brief, prepared by Carter, Ledyard & Milburn.
And no pretext was involved, state officials argued. "Without public intervention, there is no reason to believe blight will cease to exist," they said, meaning prostitution, drug use and loitering; the "shabby gateway" that the buildings present to Times Square; and the general underdevelopment of the block.
"The fact that the project may advance incidental private interests of The New York Times Company and the developer of additional office space is not unlawful and does not detract from its public purpose," the state said.
As for the Orbachs' building, the state said that even if "isolated pockets" of the block were not blighted, the whole site was.
Speaking for the Times Company, Catherine Mathis said yesterday: "The courts have repeatedly upheld, as recently as last year, the state's determination that the area is blighted. We believe that our proposed new headquarters will significantly enhance the area."
HAVING prevailed in state courts, Empire State Development is now clearing the block. Sussex House, a private 140-bed dormitory at 260 West 41st Street, has already closed. Officials say that residents received relocation payments and the owner accepted a multimillion-dollar settlement.
From the building at Eighth Avenue and 40th Street, the Taylor Business Institute and the SAE Institute of Technology have found new quarters, said Michael Rikon of Goldstein, Goldstein, Rikon & Gottlieb, which represents eight owners and 37 businesses, none of which have yet settled their claims. Arnold Hatters, the most distinctive store on the block, is searching for space it can afford, Mr. Rikon said, but has not found anything.
The Donna Karan showroom will be moving and B & J Fabrics will have a new home nearby on Seventh Avenue after 48 years in the Orbachs' building.
As they watched their property empty, the Orbachs reflected on their efforts not long ago to renovate it and build up its tenancy. "Besides the money," Sidney Orbach said, "we invested an awful lot of ourselves."

Long-Term Effects of Post-Trauma Events

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
Among New Yorkers who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after Sept. 11, 2001, those who have lost family members, lost jobs or experienced other stress since the attack are the most likely to still be having symptoms, researchers have found.
 People with midlevel incomes and those under the age of 30 or over 60 were also likely to have persistent symptoms. 
 The findings were based on a preliminary analysis of data collected by scientists at the New York Academy of Medicine in a survey of 1,939 residents of the New York metropolitan area. The participants were surveyed 6 to 9 months after the attack and again after 12 to 15 months. 
The survey findings have not yet been submitted for publication, but they were presented on Monday in Denver at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Dr. Sandro Galea, a medical epidemiologist and the associate director of the academy's Center for Urban Epidemiologic Studies, said the findings suggested that "what happens after the event matters."
Whatever people have gone through in the last few months, Dr. Galea said, "is probably interacting with people's experiences after Sept. 11."
In the earlier survey, the researchers found that 152 of those interviewed reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in the six to nine months after the attack. Of those 152, 41.6 percent reported that they were still having difficulties several months later, a figure that corresponds roughly to that found in previous studies of trauma victims.
The symptoms of the disorder include nightmares, hypervigilance, flashbacks, jumpiness, avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and unusual irritability.
Dr. Galea said the factors that predicted the development of post-traumatic stress disorder in the earlier survey -- proximity to the World Trade Center or having lost a family member in the attack, for example -- werenot associated in the new survey with continuing symptoms.
"The things that predict the development of P.T.S.D. to begin with seem to be very different from those that predict persistent P.T.S.D.," he said. "It's surprising, but it makes sense."
Dr. Galea and his colleagues, who include Dr. David Vlahov, the center's director, found that people who had experienced two stressful events since the Sept. 11 attack, like divorce or the death of a family member, were 47 times as likely to have persistent symptoms as those who had the symptoms several months earlier but had not faced such stress. Those who had gone through only one stressful event were 4.5 times as likely to have continuing symptoms.
Among survey participants with incomes from $50,000 to $75,000, the stress disorder was 7.2 times as likely to persist as it was among people with higher or lower incomes. Similar rates were found for the survey participants who were over age 70 or who were unemployed in the 6 to 12 months after Sept. 11. People under 30 were 4.4 times as likely to still have symptoms.
The researchers also found that of the participants who had post-traumatic stress symptoms in the earlier survey, persistent symptoms were more common among those who felt another terrorist attack was likely.
Sixty-two percent of the survey respondents who called another attack "very likely" had continuing post-traumatic stress disorder, while only 20 percent of those who said it was "not at all likely" had continuing symptoms.
But Dr. Galea cautioned that it was not clear whether this finding meant that people who had continuing psychiatric difficulties were more likely to be afraid, or that higher levels of fear helped maintain the symptoms.

HEADLINE: As Animosity Grows, Pataki And Silver Take Rift on the Road 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Both the Republican governor and the Democratic speaker of the Assembly went to western New York today and trumpeted their sides in an increasingly bitter debate over the state budget, another sign of a growing animosity between the two men.
 Gov. George E. Pataki gave speeches in Buffalo and Rochester, reiterating his vow to stand firm against raising broad-based taxes to close a cumulative $11.5 billion shortfall in the budget for this fiscal year and the next, which begins on April 1. "We need more jobs, not job-killing taxes," he said in Rochester, "and you can't have both." 
 Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Legislature's top Democrat, tried to upstage Mr. Pataki in Buffalo, going to a preschool to denounce the governor's attempts to cut education programs by $1.2 billion. He made a similar visit to a school in Manhattan last week. "The governor is proposing balancing the budget on the backs of children," he said.
The dueling public appeals by the state's most powerful Republican and Democrat underscore not only the sorry state of bipartisan cooperation here in the capital, but also a breakdown of trust between the two men, legislative aides and people who know both politicians say.
"It's mortal combat," a senior Democratic official said. "Frosty is an inane understatement. The staffs hate each other."
Mr. Silver has become more and more strident in his public criticisms of the governor over the last two months. The governor has nimbly counterattacked with the assertion that the Assembly leader has blocked anti-terrorism legislation, which Mr. Pataki considers critical.
Mr. Pataki has also pleaded with Mr. Silver to authorize about $4 billion in new borrowing, backed by annual payments from a court settlement with tobacco companies, to help balance the state's books. Mr. Silver has refused to act on that proposal, too.
"It's getting frosty at this point, as nothing is happening," one person close to the governor said.
The speaker has made it plain that his chamber will not give the governor the ability to use the borrowed tobacco funds until the entire budget for next year is negotiated.
"I don't like cuts; I don't like taxes; I don't like borrowing long term for short-term expenditures," Mr. Silver said today. "Obviously some combination of these will be the budget of New York. No part of that plan should get put in place until the entire thing is put in place."
Some Democrats say that Mr. Pataki's strategy is to force them to take the blame for a tax increase that is inevitable if the state is to maintain the health-care and schools programs the governor himself promoted in his re-election campaign.
"We are trying, one time, to stick this guy with something where he has to pay the price if he wants to take credit for anything," one aide to Mr. Silver said, referring to the governor.
For his part, Mr. Pataki insists he is not bluffing. Speaking to business leaders in Buffalo and Rochester, he repeated his contention that the tax cuts his administration put in place in 1995 had turned the economy around. The only way to save the state's programs in the long run, he said, is to prime the economy again.
"Unfortunately, there are those in the Legislature who are already urging us to take the path that New York and other states have taken before, massive job-killing taxes," the governor said.
Mr. Silver has harped on the fact that Mr. Pataki's budget does include increases in the sales tax on clothing and surcharges on hospital bills. He has asserted, too, that the cuts to school aid will lead to local property tax increases as districts scramble to make ends meet. 
The speaker has attacked the governor over his plan to raise tuition and delay scholarships at state universities, as well.
"I think it's important to show people how his budget affects them and present to them what is actually there," Mr. Silver said.
Underlying the policy debate is a personal animosity that each has voiced to aides and other lawmakers. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silver have never been close, but their relationship has gone through rocky and smooth phases. They manage to maintain civility in public and have even met over dinner on occasion. But their relationship has become strained during political crises. This is a particularly bad phase, aides say.
It has galled Mr. Silver that every year Mr. Pataki has stripped from his budget the speaker's top priorities, among them preschool classes and all-day kindergarten. It vexed Mr. Silver, as well, that Mr. Pataki won re-election while taking credit for Democratic initiatives, like tax-free business zones and health insurance for poor children.
On a personal level, Mr. Silver, who lives a modest life, is uncomfortable with the governor's lifestyle -- his Ivy League education, his mansion in Garrison, N.Y., his use of state aircraft and chartered jets.
Mr. Pataki, meanwhile, finds Mr. Silver's passion for gamesmanship and his poker-face tactics tiring, people close to the governor say.
"He gets frustrated with the guy," one friend of the governor said. "It's not a love or hate thing. It's more frustration that he can't get answers, can't get decisions made."
Some lawmakers, however, said the two men had that in common: they are both difficult to read and are not always up front about their tactics, irritating each other in the process.
After winning re-election in November, Mr. Pataki reached out to Mr. Silver, seeking his help in closing the current year's budget deficit, Mr. Pataki's aides said. The speaker rebuffed these entreaties, letting the governor know he was not happy that Mr. Pataki had avoided talking about the financial crisis during the election, a fellow Democrat said.
Then Mr. Silver declined the governor's request to call Assembly members back to Albany in December to authorize borrowing against future payments from tobacco companies. The governor is depending on $1.5 billion from the tobacco borrowing to close the gap in this year's budget.
"He can't manage the state without coming to some agreement with Shelly," one Democratic legislative aide said.
Which politician will win the hearts of taxpayers remains to be seen. Both men plan more appearances to spread their messages.
Mr. Pataki's pledge to oppose tax increases was generally well received among the business leaders he spoke to today. But the mood was subdued as he spoke to the Rochester Business Alliance, and some who listened to his address to the Amherst Chamber of Commerce, just outside Buffalo, said his budget would lead to higher local school taxes.
"He's shifting the burden onto the local taxpayer," said Yasmin M. Dara, the president of the Williamsville PTA Council.

HEADLINE: New-Home Building Reaches The Highest Level Since 1986 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
The construction of new homes reached the highest level in January since 1986, the Commerce Department reported today, noting the lowest mortgage rates in four decades. 
 The report said work was started on 1.85 million single-family homes and apartment units last month, at a seasonally adjusted annual pace. That was up 0.2 percent from December, when construction rose 4.9 percent from the month before. 
 Construction of single-family residences rose 2.1 percent, to an annual pace of 1.51 million units, the fastest in more than two decades. But construction of apartments fell 8.7 percent, to an annual 303,000 units. 
Sales of both new and existing homes set records last year. And home prices have risen as the stock market has declined, making home ownership look to many people like a good investment.
Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers, said, "With sales at or near record levels and prices still rising, you would expect that new construction activity would be robust, and it is."
David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said there might be some setback in the February construction activity because of the recent blizzard in the mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast. 
Total permits to start housing construction, an indicator of builders' confidence in future business, fell 5.6 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported.
Growing worries about a war in Iraq may make people cautious about committing to a big-ticket purchase like a home, but Mr. Seiders said this effect would be temporary and would be offset by continued low interest rates. 
He forecast that construction activity this year is likely to decline to 1.65 million units, down from last year's 1.71 million units, the best showing since 1986. 
By region, housing starts posted the biggest January gain in the West, an increase of 9.9 percent to an annual pace of 522,000 units.Construction was up 3.8 percent in the South, to an annual 839,000 units.
The two other regions had declines in January, reflecting the winter weather. The bigger drop was in the Northeast, where housing starts fell 16.7 percent, to an annual pace of 135,000 units. Construction activity dropped 11.9 percent in the Midwest, to an annual 354,000 units.

HEADLINE: Shifting the Burden of Funding Pensions 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The savings accounts proposed by the Bush administration are meant to produce fundamental changes in the way Americans think about saving for retirement and to shift the primary responsibility from the business community to the individual.
 Many of the most popular savings vehicles now involve an immediate tax break. Consequently, Americans have been trained to focus on saving for retirement just once a year, at tax time, when they remember they can shrink the Treasury's bite by parking some money in, say, an individual retirement account. 
 The new accounts would replace such upfront breaks with the promise that all future withdrawals would be tax-free. The idea is to wean Americans off their fixation on tax deductions in the here and now, and train them to think instead about tax-free wealth in the future. 
While the accounts may not be enacted in their current form, their tax features shed light on the administration's broader economic goals. Unlike most existing tax-deferred savings accounts, devised by the financial services sector, these came from the White House and are consistent with its philosophy that capital should not be taxed at all. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, similarly favors scrapping the estate tax and doing away with taxes on dividends if corporations have already paid taxes on the money. And in his recent economic report to Congress, President Bush praised the potential advantages of a consumption-based tax over the income tax.
Taken to their logical extension, the administration's beliefs about taxes and saving for retirement could have far-reaching implications for such cherished features of middle-class life as the company pension and the Social Security system.
"We're looking at a global shift in the bearing of responsibility and risk from the business community to the individual," said J. Mark Iwry, the Treasury's benefits tax counsel during the Clinton administration. "It's not unlike the proposed shift of responsibility and risk to the individual through the privatization of Social Security." 
America's system of work-based pensions has grown up over the better part of a century, encouraged by tax breaks to companies that sponsor pension plans, he said. Policy makers have long believed that a strong system of employer-sponsored pensions would lighten the burden borne by Social Security and related government programs.
White House theorists suggest that if Americans have the chance to discover the pleasures of tax-free investment withdrawals, they will buy into its broader ideology of individual self-reliance.
But in the meantime, a wide range of critics have lined up against the savings proposals, saying the accounts would favor the rich and hamper the government's ability to collect taxes in the future. 
Even those inclined to favor administration ideas are withholding their support for this one. Republicans in Congress complain that they were inadequately briefed on the savings accounts, and large business interests see the plans as a distraction from other legislation they want more. The ouster in December of the president's chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, an ardent champion of the administration's theories on taxation and saving, adds further doubt about whether the administration will be able to put its theories into practice.
"I don't know of anybody still in the administration, at a level anywhere near as senior as Lindsey, who has the passionate, true-believer structure on these issues to be able to keep pushing them like a bulldozer that never stops," said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a Washington group that is funded by businesses.
Mr. Salisbury said he saw the new savings plans as part of an ideological continuum that stretched back for decades, to when the tax-favored individual retirement account was created, and which will continue into the future.
"There's been a lot of talk about how it's radical, but at one level it's just an incremental step in a process that's been vigorously debated for decades," Mr. Salisbury said. "It's a shifting of the philosophy from make the contribution deductible and tax the benefit to have the contribution be after tax and don't tax the benefit."
Of the two proposed individual savings accounts, the Retirement Savings Account is the less radical, and perhaps therefore more likely to take root. It would offer no upfront tax break, but would let all withdrawals be free of federal income tax.
In addition, the Retirement Savings Account would multiply the amount of tax-advantaged money that households may salt away each year. A saver can now put up to $3,000 a year into an I.R.A. But he or she could put $7,500 annually into a Retirement Savings Account.
That enlarged tax advantage would multiply further in conjunction with the other Bush savings proposals. The administration also wants to create an all-purpose, tax-free saving plan -- the Lifetime Savings Account -- which could be used for any purpose, including retirement savings. And it proposes to raise the current contribution limits on existing work-based retirement savings plans, like the 401(k).
To pay for such tax breaks, White House economists have at least deliberated another idea in keeping with their broader economic vision: the elimination of the tax deduction that companies now get when they contribute to retirement plans.
Since 1942, companies have been able to deduct pension contributions from their taxes as long as they offer proportional benefits to both executives and rank-and-file workers. In effect, the tax treatment is a subsidy to companies that help provide for their workers in old age. Thousands of companies make use of the provision, which also applies to contributions for more recent retirement plans, such as the 401(k).
After six decades, these tax deductions are well established and add up to a lot of money. The government will forgo some $112.6 billion from workplace retirement-plan deductions this year, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
The amount is expected to grow. Stock values have declined over the last three years, and many pension funds have shrunk to the point that companies must contribute large amounts, making possible still more tax deductions. The institute predicts that from 2003 to 2007, the taxes lost because of retirement contributions in the workplace will total $615 billion.
If the government could get that money back, it would be more than enough to cover, say, the $385 billion that the administration's plan to end taxes on some dividends is expected to cost in the first 10 years. But to get the money, the government would have to end the deduction for employee retirement-plan contributions.
Late last year, Mr. Salisbury said he began receiving phone calls from lobbyists asking whether he was aware that the administration was about to do that very thing.
"I called a bunch of people to see if this had legs," Mr. Salisbury said, noting that the idea had made the rounds in other administrations.
"No matter how I've ever managed to track it, my ultimate conclusion has been, 'Goodbye pension system,' " Mr. Salisbury said of the discussion. "People have proposed doing this in the past, but just technically, doing it would be excruciating."
Mr. Lindsey, who is now the president of the Lindsey Group, an economic consulting firm, said eliminating the deductions would make sense for a number of reasons. He cited the general trend toward taxing savings plans of all types at the beginning, with contributions, rather than at the end, on withdrawals. 
If this approach were applied to pensions, he said, it would protect retirees from the risk that a future administration might raise taxes, eating into their benefits.
Mr. Lindsey also spoke of the dizzying complexity of today's pension rules, the perverse incentives that they can give companies to game their pension numbers, and the competitive burdens that pensions place on American industries in a global economy. Using the tax code to subsidize problems like these is not good public policy, he said.
At the moment, he added, there are no plans to scrap pension deductibility, but America is moving in that direction gradually. 
"Everybody is evolving," Mr. Lindsey said. "I don't think we're ever going to do a sharp break."
William F. Sweetnam Jr., the Treasury's pension and benefits tax counsel, confirmed that he knew of no plans to repeal pension deductibility.
The only live plans to change the tax treatment of company retirement benefits involve something called the Roth 401(k), which is a different plan from the existing Roth I.R.A. This little-publicized savings plan will let employees contribute after-tax money and to receive withdrawals tax free after retirement. This tax treatment is identical to that of the Retirement Savings Accounts, but the Roth 401(k) has already been signed into law by President Bush. The accounts are scheduled to appear in 2006, but the administration wants to move the debut up to 2004. 
(Companies would then choose which tax treatment to offer with their 401(k) plans, or whether to offer retirement plans at all. The 401(k) plan would also get a new name, the Employer Retirement Savings Account.)
Critics of the savings proposals have called them a stepping stone to the privatization of Social Security. The administration expressly denied this, saying that the savings accounts are intended to increase savings, plain and simple, and that goal is separate from any changes in Social Security. 
"I see no reason not to take the administration at their word," Mr. Iwry said, adding that changing retirement-saving habits would be compatible with the administration's Social Security proposals, even if one was not meant to cause the other. "If you really believe in that overall vision, why wouldn't you try to do both?"
